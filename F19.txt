F19|Exporting Spanish firms. Stylized facts and trends|During the last years, Spanish goods exports have increased significantly against a background of widening of the Spanish firms exporting base. This change has been led by SMEs, although there is still a high concentration of international sales in a small fraction of large and stable exporters. In any case, potential export growth has improved thanks to the widening of stable exporters base and to their geographical diversification towards emerging markets. Exporting firms are greater and have higher labour productivity than those focused only in domestic markets. Also within exporting firms, those with stable and diversified external flows are positively selected in terms of productivity and size. The potential widening of the stable exporting base would require an improvement of the efficiency of the segment of SMEs. Removing potential regulatory barriers that might restrict their growth and innovation ability is key to consolidate their presence in international markets in the long run.
F19|The use by Russia of the WTO dispute settlement mechanisms|The Russian Federation acceded to the World Trade Organization (WTO), and so became subject to its international trade dispute settlement procedures, on August 22, 2012. The mechanism was adopted by the WTO under the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU)2. Thus, from August 2012 onwards, Russia has enjoyed the right to defend its trade interests by applying this particular instrument
F19|Russia’s Foreign trade in 2018|In November 2018, the Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation (OECD) presented its updated forecasts2, according to which global economic growth would slow down from the current 3.7 percent (the OECD’s estimate as of 2018) to 3.5 percent in 2019–2020. Earlier, the OECD’s experts expected a 3.7 percent growth in global GDP in 2019. But growth in trade and investments slowed down on the back of the US protectionist policy. Growth in interest rates and appreciation of the US dollar exchange rate resulted in the capital outflow from developing countries and depreciation of their currencies. In the OECD zone, monetary stimulation measures are gradually scaled down. Trade conflicts between the US and China constitute a separate negative factor. According to the OECD’s estimate, imposition by the US of a 25 percent duty on Chinese imports and adoption by China of similar measures may cost the global economy, US economy and Chinese economy 0.5 percent of GDP, 0.8 percent of GDP and 1 percent of GDP, respectively.
F19|Optimal Route in International Transportation of Thailand – Guangxi (China)|Objective - This study examines the selection of international transportation routes from Thailand to Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (Guangxi), People's Republic of China. Guangxi has been designated a significant role as the gateway to ASEAN and has several land borders and seaports connecting to countries in ASEAN. Methodology/Technique - In this work, we studied 6 connecting routes, 3 of which are road routes, namely routes R8, R9, and R12 and 3 other multimodal (road-sea) routes operating from/to Laemchabang port and Nanning of Guangxi, route through Haiphong port of Vietnam, route through Qinzhou port of China, and route through Guangzhou port of China. We analysed the data using the Cost/Time Distance Model, in combination with surveys and in-depth interviews, to investigate the limitations and benefits of each route. Findings - Base on costs in 2017, we found that sea routes have much lower costs than the land routes in general; the lowest cost is route through Qinzhou port. On the other hand, the time used in transportation is much shorter for the land routes; the shortest route is the R12 route. Furthermore, in terms of limitations and benefits, we found that the Qinzhou route has many limitations such as long custom processes for fruit and agricultural products and no backhaul cargo. Meanwhile, the limitations for route R8 include crossing Mekong river on truck ferries and the presence of very steep mountain roads in the Lao People's Democratic Republic. Route R12 winds down the mountain both in Vietnam and Laos, whereas route R9 is advantageous; most of that route has a flat terrain and is operated under the Cross-Border Transport Agreement (CBTA). The route through Haiphong port is also advantageous with a direct highway from Haiphong to Hanoi of Vietnam. In conclusion, it is suggested that road transportation is more efficient than sea transportation. Novelty - Further consideration among road routes and, with emphasis on costs and time, the best route is then route R12. However, if one is concerned with risk of damage to products, then route R9 is the best. The optimal route from Thailand to Guangxi depends on the conditions and decision criteria of the stakeholders.
F19|Tobacco smuggling in the Western Balkan region: Exploring habits, attitudes, and predictors of illegal tobacco demand|In this paper, the relationship between unemployment and crime is analysed. A panel of 20 Croatian counties over the years 1998-2013 is used to estimate the effect of unemployment on the rates of various groups of property and violent crimes. According to the theory of economics of crime, increase in unemployment leads to higher crime rates. A fixed-effects model, including time- and county-specific effects and several covariates, is estimated. The results show there is no impact of unemployment on aggregate property crimes. For all violent crimes bar rapes, the results oppose the theory and intuition. The unexpected results are discussed in the context of the Croatian-specific macro-environment.
F19|The role of ICT productivity in Korea-Japan multifactor CES productions and trades|In this paper, we examine the economic impact of information and communication technology (ICT) innovation, under the general equilibrium framework, with empirically estimated constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production frontiers. Innovation can generate not only productivity growth and price changes but also changes in the economic structure of production and trade patterns, eventually increasing social welfare. To study such impact of ICT innovation, we construct a bilateral general equilibrium model, spanning 350 commodities and sectors with trades between Japan and the Republic of Korea (South Korea). We estimate all CES parameters from published statistics such as the linked input–output tables and Comtrade databases. A small exogenous productivity shock in ICT is examined in terms of potential price reduction in all commodities in both countries.
F19|Chinese Capital Flows to African Economies and Real Bilateral Exchange Rates|Since the turn of the millennium, China opened up internationally both in terms of its current account (trade) and its capital account, even though the opening of the latter happened de facto, not de jure. With respect to China being Africa's largest trading partner and developing investor in combination with its desire for African natural resources, we embark on an analysis of the impact of several categories of Chinese capital flows to African economies on the bilateral real exchange rate. We conduct a panel data analysis by means of a Hausman-Taylor-estimation over the period 2003-2016. Our results suggest that capital flows from China to Africa in the form of mainly economic cooperation projects, but also FDI contribute to an appreciation of the local currencies vis à vis the RMB, while no such effect appears for aid fl ows from China. The former two categories may pose a risk of Dutch Disease effects. Since many African countries have pegged their currencies to the Euro, and the Renminbi abandoned its peg to the US Dollar over the sample period, valuation effects of capital fl ows must be interpreted in this context.

Para tal propósito estimamos dos modelos estructurales de gravedad de comercio mediante el método de estimación denominado “Poisson Pseudo Maximun Likelihood”. Uno de nuestros modelos es estimado usando una muestra de datos de panel de más 130 países que son exportadores e importadores durante el periodo 1996-2016. El segundo modelo es estimado usando una muestra de 10 países importadores de América del Sur y más de 130 países exportadores durante el periodo 1996-2016. Los resultados del primer modelo sugieren que los países sin litoral por el lado exportar tienden, en promedio, a tener entre 24.91% y 33.29% menor flujo comercial en comparación a los países costeros. Asimismo, los resultados de este modelo con datos internacionales sugieren que el flujo comercial de los países sin litoral por el lado importador es 24.17% a 32.96% menor en comparación al flujo comercial de los países costeros. Los resultados del segundo modelo sugieren que el nivel de importaciones de los países de América del Sur sin litoral, Bolivia y Paraguay, es 19.93% a 28.11% menor en comparación al resto de países de América del Sur que tienen costa. También, los resultados de este segundo modelo sugieren que las importaciones de los países de América del Sur son 25.54% y 36.14% menores cuando los países que exportan no tienen litoral en comparación a los países exportadores que tienen costa. Por último, en ambos modelos hemos encontrado que los efectos de la condición de país sin litoral tanto por el lado exportador como por el lado importador disminuyen cuando se consideran la calidad institucional, la política comercial, la calidad de infraestructura y la calidad logística.

F19|How do organized crime and counterfeit interact in Italian trading firms? An empirical analysis of their effects on trade|The impact of crime and counterfeiting on Italian trading firms has been rather neglected. Nevertheless, they are important drivers of trade in countries like Italy, whose economic activity is characterized by small/medium-sized firms, highly exposed to the risk of infringement of intellectual property rights by criminal activities of counterfeiting, and, at the same time, not averse to production/exchange of counterfeited goods. We employ a newly-built regional panel data set that includes both economic variables and indicators of counterfeiting activities and criminality during the period of deep economic crisis (2008-2013). Using a dynamic panel data model, we study how counterfeiting affects trade indicators of the Italian firms. We find that commercial exchanges increase when regions are hubs of production or transit points for fakes. The benefit on trade should not hide the consequences of counterfeiting in terms of loss of private investorsâ€™ confidence, limits to business innovation and destruction of competitiveness. We also show that profitable counterfeiting activities that target high-value, high-quality goods, and challenge business innovation and competitiveness of the export-oriented firms, have significant depressing impacts on both export and the degree of trade openness.
F19|Product patents and access to innovative medicines in a post-trips-era|This WTO working paper studies availability and affordability of new and innovative pharmaceuticals in a post-TRIPS era. The WTO's TRIPS Agreement (TRIPS) makes it obligatory for WTO members − except least-developed country members (LDCs) - to provide pharmaceutical product patents with a 20-year protection term. Developing country members, other than LDCs, were meant to be compliant with this provision of TRIPS by 2005. This study investigates two questions in this context: (1) How does the introduction of product patents in pharmaceuticals affect the likelihood of pharmaceutical firms to launch new and innovative medicines in those markets? (2) For launched new and innovative medicines, how much do patent owners or generic pharmaceutical firms adjust their prices to local income levels? Using launch data from 1980 to 2017 covering 70 markets, the study finds that introduction of product patent for pharmaceuticals in the patent law has a positive effect on launch likelihood, especially for innovative pharmaceuticals. However, this effect is quite limited in low-income markets. Also, innovative pharmaceuticals are launched sooner than non-innovative ones, irrespective of the patent regime in the local market. Using a panel data set of originator and generic prices from 2007 to 2017, the study finds evidence of differential pricing for both originator and generic products. Overall, originators differentiate by about 11% and generics by about 26%. Differential pricing is larger for pharmaceuticals to treat infectious diseases, particularly for HIV/AIDs medicines, than for non-communicable diseases. However, pharmaceutical prices are far from being fully adjusted to local income levels in either case. However, competition, especially that within a particular medicine market, can effectively drive down prices in both originator and generic markets.
F19|Trade policies supporting women's economic empowerment: Trends in WTO members|This paper looks at the various trade policies WTO Members have put into place to foster women's economic empowerment. The analysis below is based on the information provided by WTO Members as part of their Trade Policy Review (TPRs) process from 2014 to 2018. Reports from the WTO Secretariat, governments as well as the question and answer sessions were examined for the purpose of this paper.1 In the last 4 years, the trade policies of 111 WTO Members were under review. About 70% of them have reported at least one trade policy targeting women's economic empowerment. Overall, in four years, almost half of the WTO membership has implemented trade policies in support of women (at least one). Most (about 70%) of the WTO Members2 under review have integrated women's empowerment in their national or regional trade strategy. They focused their policy activity to three main areas or sectors: * Financial and non-financial incentives to the private sector and women owned/led Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs): 30% of members3 have focused their trade policies in support of women owned/led companies. * Agriculture and fishery: 15.5 % of members4 under review have included policies in relations with agriculture and fisheries in support of women's empowerment. * Government procurement: 9% of members5 under review have included policies in relations with government procurement in support of women's empowerment.
F19|Women's economic empowerment: An inherent part of Aid for Trade|"Aid for Trade supports developing and least-developed countries in building their trade capacity and in increasing their exports by turning market access opportunities into market presence. It does so by addressing four key areas: trade policy & regulations; economic infrastructure; building productive capacity; and trade-related adjustment. The WTO-led Initiative works with a broad cross-section of stakeholders to: highlight needs (of developing and least-developed countries and regional organizations), mobilize resources (including donors, international financial institutions and other international organizations) and monitor impacts and effectiveness (with OECD and other international organizations). Through Aid for Trade, the WTO has been focusing on women with the aim of building their capacity to trade and using trade as a tool for their economic development. Gender equality is an inherent part of Aid for Trade. This has also been reflected in the Buenos Aires Declaration on Trade and Women's Economic Empowerment which identified Aid for Trade as a key instrument to assist members in ""analysing, designing and implementing more gender-responsive trade policies"". Three key facts on women's economic empowerment through Aid for Trade * Donors and partner countries have been devoting increasing attention to gender dimensions in Aid for Trade. Both groups have gradually and increasingly integrated gender into their Aid for Trade objectives. They are now at par. The 2019 Monitoring and Evaluation Exercise reveals that women's economic empowerment is now high on both donors and partner countries agendas. Today, 84% of donors' aid-for-trade strategy and 85% of partner countries national or regional development strategy seek to promote women's economic empowerment. * The main target group of gender related Aid for Trade is women entrepreneurs. * While gender is now fully part of members aid-for-trade objectives, it has not been fully integrated in their aid for trade priorities. This disconnection between objectives and priorities could explain the difficulty in assessing the real impact of aid for trade on women's economic empowerment. This also shows the challenges to translate objectives into effective programming. Aid for Trade flows confirm this trend"
F19|Lessons from a Survey of Chinaâ€™s Economic Diplomacy|Today, the West faces a considerable dilemma in their support for the Washington Consensus as a dominant approach for development because the Beijing model has grown to become an unavoidable process which can only be neglected at the cost of standing on the wrong side of economic history. The Washington Consensus, the hitherto dominant scheme, is being encroached on by the Beijing model. Many African nations are increasingly embracing this later method because the prevailing Western model has failed to deliver on a number of objectives. This is increasingly evident because Chinaâ€™s economic diplomacy has been politely and strategically coined to achieve it. A case study is used herein to articulate the different strands of the survey. The paper puts some structure on Chinaâ€™s economic diplomatic strategies and discusses lessons for Africa, China and the West. It contributes to existing literature by critically assessing why it is necessary for the West to modify the conception and definition of the Washington Consensus as a counterpart to the Beijing model. In order to remain relevant in the 21st century and beyond, the Washington Consensus should incorporate those ideas which are in conformity with Moyoâ€™s (2013) conjecture. This postulates that, while the Beijing model is optimal in the short-run, the Washington Consensus remains the ideal long-term development model because it is more inclusive of the rights demanded by individuals at different income categories.

F19|German Export Survival in the First Globalisation|How were trade relations structured in the first globalisation? Previous literature has highlighted the strong activity of the extensive margin during the first globalisation, i.e. that here was substantial entry and exit. However, so far little is known about what happens between market entry and exit. Traditional narratives of the first globalisation relying on the Heckscher-Ohlin factor endowments or the gravity model are mute about these features of the data. In this paper I study the survival margin of international trade and wonder how long trade relationships lasted and what factors mattered for the duration ofexports. Using product-evel export data from 1889 to 1913, I find that the first years of an export were the most hazardous. The median length of an export spell was 2 years, only about 60 per cent survived the first year, and a mere third of exports lasted longer than 3 years. However, once exporters survived the first two years they face less hazard from year to year. I take Rauch and Watson�s (2003) search cost model of trade relationships and derive hypotheses that I test in order shed light on the duration of Germany�s exports. Key to this model is that a fraction of exports serve to learn about market conditions. I quantify this learning, and my findings suggest that search costs as well as reliability turn out to have been important for export survival, and so did prior export experience. In other words, learning to export was a salient feature of Germany�s experience in the first globalisation.
F19|Characterizing Canada’s Export Sector by Industry: A Supply-Side Perspective|This note examines supply-side trends in Canadian non-energy industries and their implications for export performance. Between 2002 and 2016, capital stocks and total labour input declined in many industries that export non-energy goods. These soft trends in the factors of production have likely contributed to the decline in non-energy exports in about half of the goods industries analyzed in this note. On the other hand, Canada’s service sector has consistently increased its capital stock, workforce and productivity, which has helped it maintain solid production and export growth. Nevertheless, following the 2007–09 global financial crisis, supply-side trends in several goods-exporting sectors have improved, and this has led to partial rebounds in production and exports. Should these recent supply-side trends extend into the future, non-energy exports might struggle to grow in line with foreign activity without further improvements in the rates of capital formation, hiring or productivity.
F19|Productivity and Firm Boundaries|"This paper develops and applies a test of the property rights theory of the firm in the context of global input sourcing. We use the model by Pol Antràs and Elhanan Helpman, “Global Sourcing,"" Journal of Political Economy, 112:3 (2004), 552-80, to derive a new prediction regarding how the productivity of a firm affects its choice between vertical integration and outsourcing and how this effect depends on the relative input intensity of the production process. The prediction we derive hinges on less restrictive assumptions than industry-level predictions available in existing literature and survives in more realistic versions of the model featuring multiple suppliers and partial vertical integration. We present robust firm-level evidence from Spain showing that, in line with our prediction, the effect of productivity works more strongly in favor of vertical integration, and against outsourcing, in more headquarter-intensive industries."
F19|Where Has the Rum Gone? Firms’ Choice of Transport Mode under the Threat of Maritime Piracy|Despite a general agreement that piracy poses a significant threat to maritime shipping, empirical evidence regarding its economic consequences remains scarce. This paper takes a step towards filling the gap by combining firm-level Chinese customs data with information on pirate attacks to investigate how exporting firms respond to maritime piracy. It finds that overall exports along a particular shipping route fall following an increase in pirate activity. In addition, piracy induces firms to switch from ocean to air shipping, while the remaining ocean shipments become larger.
F19|Agglomeration and the Extent of the Market: An Experimental Investigation into Spatially Coordinated Exchange|How and why do agglomerations emerge? While economic historians emphasize trade and economic geographers emphasize variety, we still don’t understand the role of coordination. I fill this gap by extending the model of Fudenberg and Ellison (2003) to formalize Smith’s (1776) theory of agglomeration. I then test the model in a laboratory experiment and find individuals tend to coalesce purely to coordinate exchange, with more agglomeration when there is a larger variety of goods in the economy. I also find that tying individuals to the land reduces agglomeration, but magni?es the effect of variety.
F19|Russia’s Foreign trade in 2017|In 2016, the growth rates of world economy hit the all-time low since the global financial crisis and constituted 3.2 percent.

Hence the Russian Federation has been entitled since August 2012 to resort to the system to uphold its trade interests.
F19|The Results of Global Goods and Services Trade Development in 2017|According to the latest projections released by the WTO, this year the global trade growth rate is going to decrease to 4.4% from its previous level of 4.7% in 2017. In its annual report, the WTO Secretariat warns that the threats voiced by the USA that it may impose duties on imports of goods from China and its other main partners in trade have probably already produced some negative impact on the global economy and international trade.
F19|Multi-sectoral value chain in a bilateral general equilibrium|The information and communication technology (ICT) is a key engine of economic growth. In this paper, we examine the impact of ICT innovation using a multifactor constant elasticity of substitution (CES) general equilibrium model. Innovation not only leads to productivity growth and thus influence prices, it also changes output and trade patterns, and welfare. To examine trade values, we construct a bilateral multifactor CES general equilibrium model between Japan and the Republic of Korea using linked input–output tables. We estimate elasticities of substitution and productivity growths of the ICT sectors, to assess the effects of ICT improvement on the two countries.
F19|The Curious Incident of Luxury Imports during the Top-Income Surge|"Atkinson, Piketty and Saez (2011) find a post-1979 surge in taxfiler top income shares in ""English speaking countries"" (surge countries) but not in ""continental European countries and Japan"" (no-surge countries). Working at a similarly high level of abstraction, we find the puzzle that import-to-GDP ratios and import-to-total-import ratios for luxuries (pearls, precious stones, diamonds, works of art, jewellery, furs and coins) do not increase post-1979 in surge countries relative to no-surge countries. Explanations could include potential flaws in the taxfiler or import data, or that top income individuals do not have a particularly high marginal propensity to import these luxury goods. Overall, we believe that this is a fragment of evidence that there may not have been a large post-1979 increase in top-end domestic consumption inequality in surge countries compared to no-surge countries."
F19|O Mercado Segurador em Portugal: O Papel dos Gestores na Constituição de Provisões|As empresas seguradoras têm que constituir provisões técnicas com vista a assegurar que responsabilidades futuras perante os seus clientes e terceiros são cobertas. Estas provisões baseiam-se em estimativas não só incorporando dados passados, mas incluindo igualmente as expectativas de evolução da economia e da própria empresa. É assim expectável que o grau de otimismo dos diretores financeiros das empresas (Chief Financial Officers, CFOs) e as expectativas que criam estejam associadas às provisões que calculam e registam. Analisando as consequências da racionalidade limitada dos agentes económicos, das suas preferências sociais e na ausência de autocontrolo, Richard Thaler mostrou como estes traços humanos afetam sistematicamente as decisões individuais e os resultados, o que lhe conferiu a atribuição do prémio Nobel da Economia de 2017. O presente artigo encontra uma relação negativa entre o otimismo dos CFOs, e a constituição de provisões no mercado segurador em Portugal, no período compreendido entre 2007 e 2016. Estes resultados que têm impacto no ambiente concorrencial deverão interessar os reguladores, os acionistas e os profissionais do sector.
F19|Foreign ownership, international joint ventures and strategic investment|We investigate the strategic relationship between a foreign firm and a local firm in an international joint venture (IJV). We develop a simple partial equilibrium model in which a local firm invests in skills, which affects the productivity of the IJV, and the foreign firm decides whether to implement an IJV or not. In equilibrium, foreign ownership is a key factor that determines the investment level and the foreign firm's strategy. If foreign ownership is too low or too high, the foreign firm cannot induce the local partner to invest in skills, a situation that provides the lowest payoff for both agents. If it is at a medium level, the local partner invests in management skill and the foreign firm chooses the IJV strategy. In this case, both agents receive a higher payoff.

F19|The Iranian Economy: Challenges and Opportunities|The Iranian economy has greatly benefited from the lifting of international sanctions in 2016, when the JCPOA nuclear deal came into force. Oil production and exports rebounded strongly, which spilled over into non-oil sectors. However, the economy is yet to return to its 1976 peak in real per capita GDP terms, reflecting numerous challenges over the past four decades, including poor policy choices and the fallout from persistent conflict with the US. This report presents a broad overview of the Iranian economy, and identifies the main challenges to long-run economic development, including in foreign trade and investment, fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policy, and the institutional environment. It concludes that an already difficult situation for Iranian policy-makers will be exacerbated by the US decision to pull out of the JCPOA, and the introduction of new sanctions.
F19|Government Ideology and Arms Exports|The relationship between ideology and government decisions is a major field of research in economics and political sciences. Particularly the influence of government ideology on security issues of special interest. This paper analyses the relationship between government orientation and arms exports. Therefore, bilateral trade data for conventional weapons is regressed on data of government orientation. The results indicate that left-wing governments are more likely to grant arms export licences than governments of other partisan orientation. The finding is robust to the inclusion of control variables checking for further characteristics of the exporter government. Including interaction terms shows, that left-wing governments care about the human rights protection in importing countries and prefer to export to countries which are not involved in a conflict.

Este trabajo busca determinar el efecto de la tasa de cambio real sobre los flujos de comercio internacional en el sector manufacturero. Para tal fin, y como principal aporte, se calculan i?ndices de tasa de cambio real (TCR) subsectorial para 19 subsectores manufactureros, teniendo en cuenta la potencial existencia de heterogeneidades entre ellos. Se estiman adema?s las elasticidades precio para exportaciones e importaciones usando los i?ndices de tasa de cambio real bilateral y subsectorial. Los resultados indican la existencia de importantes diferencias entre el comportamiento de la TCR entre subsectores, y que estas diferencias explican el comportamiento de las exportaciones en los distintos sectores manufactureros, aunque los resultados no son tan claros para el caso de las importaciones. E?stos resultados sugieren que los hacedores de poli?tica deberi?an tener en cuenta los efectos diferenciales de sus poli?ticas sobre el desempen?o manufacturero cuando estas afectan la TCR.
F19|Factors Affecting Market Share of Iranian Hand-woven Carpet in Singapore|The problems created by single product economy have made the promotion of non-oil exports for Iran inevitable. In this context, the empowerment of the Iranian hand-woven carpet rank in target export markets is of considerable importance. Accordingly, using gravity model this paper examines the factors affecting the market share of the Iranian hand-woven carpet in Singapore during 1989-2015. In this regard, a modified gravity model is constructed in terms of characteristics of Singapore market. The estimation results show that decrease in export price of Iranian hand-woven carpet with respect to average carpet prices in Singapore, increase in financial support of Iranian hand-woven carpet exports, increase in real exchange rate, decrease in structural difference between Iran and Singapore economies lead to increase in Iranian market share in Singapore. In addition, increase in Singaporean per capita income with respect to Iran, and increase in employment share of population of Iran with respect to rivals have positive effects on Iranian hand-woven carpet share, while ever-changing exchange rate regimes over 1993-2002, and exchange rate unification policy from 2002 onwards in Iran influence negatively the Iranian hand-woven market share in Singapore.
F19|The knowledge spillover effects of FDI on the productivity and efficiency of research activities in China|As China is moving toward an innovation-driven economy, this paper offers new insights for both policymakers and investors to optimize the effectiveness of investment performance. This paper studies China's provincial research activities with a focus on the spillover-induced productivity and efficiency change. The results show that spillovers as a result of inflow of foreign investment contribute positively to the performance of overall research activities, however, the productivity effects vary across regions. Our analysis also indicates that highly skewed distribution of FDI leads to a less improved innovation efficiency in FDI-rich provinces. Future innovation policy should adjust the investment profiles based on the preferential innovation output on one hand, and optimize the complementary policy for FDI on the other hand to reduce inefficiency and the potential negative effects of knowledge spillovers. Inter-provincial governmental cooperation is necessary to resolve the uneven distribution of FDI and improve the innovation efficiency in both FDI-poor and rich regions.
F19|Marketing Aspects of Russia-The European Union Cooperation in the Field of Education|In the paper the authors identified the need and identified the benefits of the development of Russia-EU cooperation in the field of education in the context of globalization, marked barriers to the development of such cooperation conditions for its development. The authors also performed a comparative analysis of the state and the market model for cooperation between Russia and the European Union in the field of education in the context of globalization and the expediency of the transition to it. As perspective directions of cooperation between Russia and the European Union in the field of education in the context of globalization the authors developed and validated a complex marketing mix.
F19|Existing data to measure African trade| One finds a broad consensus in the literature regarding the lack of good information on trade in Africa, particularly intraregional trade. This paper attempts to identify gaps and remedies in measuring and tracking trade in Africa. We review the major international and regional databases that track trade in Africa, identifying the gaps therein. We also review the studies that have attempted to track informal trade between African countries, and we look at the major ongoing initiatives to track such informal trade. It appears that both international and regional databases suffer from a lack of reporting or from faulty reporting of African trade statistics. Informal trade flows pose an ongoing problem when measuring intraregional trade, although actual border-monitoring initiatives ongoing in selected countries constitute an interesting option for their quantification. When no direct monitoring method is available, estimating gravity equations represents an alternative with which to measure the potential trade between two partner countries, giving us an estimate of missing trade. A final avenue consists of estimating unregistered trade via national accounts data by comparing consumption, production, and declared trade.

F19|Russia’s Foreign trade in 2016|In early 2017, international financial organizations adjusted their short- and medium-term forecasts. The World Bank report Global Economic Prospects[1], released in January 2017, and estimated global growth in 2016 at a post-crisis low of 2.3%. It was noted that growth in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) is projected to rise in 2017 to 2.7%, reflecting receding obstacles to activity in commodity exporters and continued solid domestic demand in commodity importers. An increase in commodity prices will trigger the bottoming out in the largest emerging markets, including Russia and Brazil.
F19|Russia’s application of WTO dispute settlement mechanisms|On August 22, 2012, the Russian Federation joined the World Trade Organization (WTO), as well as dispute settlement mechanisms designed to resolve WTO trade disputes and governed by the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU). Hence Russia has since August 2012 been entitled to apply this instrument to uphold its commercial interests.
F19|Impact of the Free Trade Zone on Cigarette Consumption: An Examination of Indonesian Households|"""Objective – The purpose of this research is to evaluate the impact of the Free Trade Zone ('FTZ') in the Riau Islands Province (Batam, Bintan and Karimun) on specific products, i.e. cigarettes. Methodology/Technique – To investigate the demand for cigarettes in the FTZ area, this study examines data on cigarette consumption in Batam and surrounding areas before and after the implementation of the FTZ. The data is collected from SUSENAS surveys conducted in 2003, 2005, 2008, 2011 and 2014. To examine the net impact of the FTZ, this study also uses an experimental approach; the implementation of the FTZ can be viewed as a natural influence on a decrease in prices of specific products. The subject group includes households in the Riau Islands Province. Households in the surrounding provinces are therefore used a control groups. Several indicators were used to identify and establish the control groups, including: cigarette consumption, population, sex ratio, life expectancy and education level. Following this criteria, Bengkulu Province was selected as the ideal group of control candidates. Findings – The results show that there has been a significant increase in cigarette consumption in the Riau Islands Province following the implementation of the FTZ. Novelty – The introduction of the FTZ means that trade commodities, including cigarettes, are no longer subject to excise duty. As a result, the selling price of tobacco products has become very cheap"""
F19|International Trade Finance and Exports: Evidence from Korean Bank-Intermediated Trade Finance Instruments|Abstract This paper investigates the effects of trade finance shocks on real exports by using novel data on two bank-intermediated instruments of trade finance in Korea: foreign trade loans extended by commercial banks and documentary bills purchased by them. Using a vector autoregression (VAR) model, the results show that a negative shock to both instruments adversely affects exports, particularly the exports of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The trade financing condition explains as much as 10–14 % of the variation in exports, which is comparable to the estimates in previous studies. Noteworthy is that the effects of trade finance on SME exports vary upon whether it is pre- or post-shipment financing.
F19|Determinants of Intra-Firm Trade|By exploiting a unique sample of foreign affliates in Sub-Saharan Africa, we study previously examined and unexamined firm-level determinants of intra-firm trade. We document that foreign affliates engaging in intra-firm trade are relatively few and that the majority of these also engage in trade at arm's length, which accounts for an important fraction of their total trade. The identified firm-level determinants of intra-firm trade are consistent with property rights and intangible assets theories of the multinational firm, with international production hierarchies theories, as well as with theories of different FDI types and of multinational activity under credit constraints.
F19|Service Traders in Hungary Evidence from Firm Level Data|The aim of this paper is to present new empirical evidence on the characteristics of service trader firms using a novel dataset for Hungary. In the period of slowing growth of goods trade, services, which are more resilient to cycles and are growing steadily since the crisis, might open new alternatives for foreign trade expansion. By using firm level data for the period 2006-2014, this paper documents a series of stylized facts as follows. First, services exporters or goods and services exporters (bi-exporters) are even fewer than goods exporters, but they are present in almost all major sectors of the economy. Even manufacturing firms trade in services. Second, average yearly export values are higher for bi-exporters, both in services and goods. Third, services exporters outperform goods exporters in various dimensions: they are larger in terms of employment, give higher wages, have higher labor and total factor productivity. The effect of exporting slightly differs by industries and it is more pronounced for SMEs than for large companies. Service traders increase their productivity before starting to export and increase it further after entering foreign markets. Lastly, there is also some evidence on switching trader status. Earlier services exporter status is positively correlated with future services exporter status and bi-exporter status, indicating that firms might be willing to diversify their export portfolio in the goods-services dimension and not only along product/service type and destination country, as documented earlier. Most of the above findings prevail for importing as well.
F19|Digital Trade: Developing a Framework for Analysis|This paper explores the definition, measurement, and policy implications of digital trade, proposing a tentative typology of digital trade that can be used to unpack transactions and analyse the issues. Digitalisation is changing what and how we trade: from digital delivery to greater physical trade enabled by digital connectivity. Online platforms mean more small packages crossing borders, while new technologies are changing how services are produced and delivered. Underpinning digital trade is the movement of data: data is a means of production, an asset that can itself be traded, and the means through which some services are traded and GVCs are organised. While there is no single definition of digital trade, there is a growing consensus that it encompasses digitally enabled transactions in trade in goods and services which can be either digitally or physically delivered involving consumers, firms and governments. Unpacking trade transactions along these lines using a tentative typology can help in understanding and identifying issues. For example, measuring digital trade poses challenges ranging from identifying transactions that are digitally enabled to the sectoral classification of services in a transaction, and efforts are underway to better reflect digital trade in trade statistics. For trade policy, the increased bundling of goods and services raises issues about which trade rules (GATT or GATS) apply; trade facilitation is ever more critical for just-in-time delivery and GVCs; and the role of data flows in enabling digital trade may require further attention, along with how to ensure that the gains from digital trade are inclusive, within and across countries.
F19|USA trade policy agenda perspectives in international trade|International trade means the exchange of goods or services along international borders. This type of trade allows for a greater competition and more competitive pricing in the market. Probably the most important single insight in all of international economics is that there are gains from trade - that is, when countries sell goods and services to each other, this exchange is almost always to their mutual benefit. Importing and exporting of goods is big business in today's global economy thus international trade is supposed to be beneficial for a particular economy even for the USA. The question is arising if Americans shouldn’t buy American goods whenever possible, to help create jobs in the United States. Paper deals with issues such as the U.S. international trade characteristics in terms of territorial and commodity structure, the U.S. export trade promotion strategy, the impact of trade on the US economy and international trade development as well as President’s Obama strategy regarding the U.S. international trade strategy. This study is analyzing the US trade policy agenda and discussing the impact of foreign trade on the U.S. economy and its current status in international economic relations. To accomplish this goal, methods such as analysis, comparison, synthesis and logical deduction are to be used; facts from scientific and professional publications, periodical and non-periodical press. International trade of the United States is one of the world's most significant economic markets. The country is among the top three global importers and exporters. USA has trade relations with many other countries. Through efficiency, competition, and relationships the international trade can increase economic growth and allow for all countries to benefit from it.
F19|Long run Relationship between Trade in Goods and Trade in Services of India|The exchange of goods, services and capital across the borders of different countries is known as international trade. This type of trade is important as it promotes and encourages the growth, movement and purchase of different goods and services from one country to another. This means that what one country does not have it can purchase from another country. International trade has economic, political and social importance for the countries engage in it and it has been on the rise in the recent years. With the advent of globalization and subsequent opening up of trade, the international trade pattern has acquired a new shape across geographies. An increase in both economic and trade liberalization paid off well for India, as its trade to GDP ratio has increased last few years. The present study made an attempt to estimate long run relationship between trade in goods and trade in services of India. The study found that there exist a long run relationship between trade in goods and trade in services of India.
F19|الأبعاد الثقافية للتجارة الدولية: حالة دول إتفاقية أغادير<BR>[The Cultural Dimensions of International Trade: The Case of AGADIR Agreement countries]|The main aim of this paper is to discuss the cultural dimensions of international trade in case of AGADIR agreement countries. The main finding is that although there is a weak correlation between genetic distance as an indicator of cultural distance and both of total visible exports and cultural goods exports. But Egypt is in the first rank in the degree of correlation. Thus, the paper analyzed the impact of cultural distance on the Egyptian exports of both total visible exports and cultural goods exports with the major trade partners which categorized into income criterion. The main results are: first, genetic distance as an indicator of cultural distance has a negative significant impact in the case of low-income partners. Second, the Egyptian exports increase with Islamic countries.
F19|Neocolonialism or Balanced Partnership? Reframing Agricultural Relations Between the EU and Africa|The narratives in the media with respect to EU external policies and their effects on developing countries generally paint a picture of unequal power dynamics and negative externalities, particularly with respect to international trade and land grabbing. In this paper, I use trade data to argue that reality is more nuanced and aim to provide a preliminary sketch of the institutional dynamics between the EU and Africa. I focus on agricultural relationships to highlight the interplay between historical path dependencies, colonialism, trade policy and domestic institutions on the EU and African side. While trade is often portrayed in an overly simplified manner as the main factor hindering agricultural development, African countries are often plagued by a long history of extractive institutions, both politically and economically, which lead to a vicious cycle of unequally distributed resources, exploitation, insecure human rights and a lack of incentives for innovation. This becomes apparent when examining phenomena such as land-grabbing, which often involve African elites partnering with foreign investors to conclude controversial deals. Overall, this paper aims to highlight the necessity of building institutional capacity particularly in countries with a long history of extractive institutional continuity, and to underline the importance of state centralisation for agricultural development, so that African partners can fully take advantage of the preferential trade regime with the EU and improve their position with respect to power dynamics.
F19|Are EU exports gender-blind? Some key features of women participation in exporting activities in the EU|This analysis sheds new light on the gender-balance of the employment opportunities supported by extra-EU exports. This is done using a Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO) model with the information provided by the WIOD-World Input-Output Database (Timmer et al., 2015) and the EXIOBASE-3 database (Stadler et al., 2017). On that basis we show that in 2011 almost 12 million women in the EU had jobs thanks to the exports of goods and services to the rest of the world. However the data also reveals that a gender gap to the disadvantage of women persisted as these jobs represented only 38% of the total employment in the EU supported by exports to the rest of the world. The analysis suggests that such gender gap is largely due to the concentration of female employment in the less export-oriented sectors, notably in services.
F19|Air Access Liberalisation, Marketing Promotion And Tourism Trade|The objective of the present study is two-fold. Firstly, to assess the impact of air access liberalization on tourism demand for Mauritius and secondly to analyse the dual impact of the interplay between air access liberalization and marketing promotion efforts on tourism demand. Using an Autoregressive Distributed Lag model, the results suggest that air access liberalisation is an important ingredient, albeit to a lesser extent as compared to other classical explanatory variables, of tourism demand. The results also highlight the fact that Mauritius is perceived as a luxurious destination and tourists are also deemed to be price sensitive. Moreover our dynamic approach interestingly confirms the presence of repeat tourism in the island. Finally, the findings also uncover the positive impact of the interplay between air access liberalization and marketing promotion efforts on fostering tourism demand.
F19|International Arbitrage and the Extensive Margin of Trade between Rich and Poor Countries|We incorporate consumption indivisibilities into the Krugman (1980) model and show that an importer's per capita income becomes a primary determinant of “export zeros”. Households in the rich North (poor South) are willing to pay high (low) prices for consumer goods; hence, unconstrained monopoly pricing generates arbitrage opportunities for internationally traded products. Export zeros arise because some northern firms abstain from exporting to the South, to avoid international arbitrage. Rich countries benefit from a trade liberalization, while poor countries lose. These results hold also under more general preferences with both extensive and intensive consumption margins. We show that a standard calibrated trade model (that ignores arbitrage) generates predictions on relative prices that violate no-arbitrage constraints in many bilateral trade relations. This suggests that international arbitrage is potentially important.
F19|Reconciliation of the Washington Consensus with the Beijing Model in Africa|In this study, we argue that an approach which will reconcile the two opposing camps in Sino-African relations and bring the most progress is a “middle passage” that greases contradictions and offers an accommodative, balanced and pragmatic vision on which Africans can unite. We present a case under which countries can substantially enhance the prospect of development if an African consensus builds on a merger between the Western and Chinese models. We balance national interest with human rights, sovereign authority with individual rights and economic goals with political rights. The chapter presents arguments on the need for a development paradigm in Africa that reconciles the Washington Consensus with the Beijing Model. The analytical framework is organised in three main strands, notably: (i) historical perspectives and contemporary views; (ii) reconciliation of dominant schools of thought and paradigms surrounding Sino-African relations and (iii) practical and contemporary implications. Reconciled schools of thought are engaged in four main categories: optimists versus (vs.) pessimists; preferences in rights (human vs. national, idiosyncratic vs. sovereign and political vs. economic) and the Beijing model vs. the Washington Consensus.
F19|The Role of Private Standards for Manufactured Food Exports from Developing Countries| The effect of food standards on agricultural trade flows remains unclear. We contribute to the debate with a unique dataset that contains the number of food processing firms of 88 countries from 2008 to 2013 that are certified with the International Featured Standard (IFS). Based on a theoretical framework that combines Melitz-type firm heterogeneity with quality upgrading, we estimate a gravity-model using the one-year lag of IFS as well as modern grocery distribution as an Instrument to address potential endogeneity. We find that IFS increases c.p. bilateral exports on average of seven agricultural product categories in both specifications. However, the effect remains only for upper- and middle-income countries once we separate by income and turns even negative for low income countries in the IV-specification. Hence, whereas IFS increases exports on average, it has a trade-impeding effect for low-income countries. Therefore, private standards are not a sufficient development policy tool to integrate low-income countries to the world trading system without being accompanied by other measures.
F19|International Tariffs in a Mixed Oligopoly with Research Spillovers|This paper merges three strands of the literature – industrial organization, international trade, and economics of technical change – to examine the effect of tariffs on international mixed oligopolies which conduct research and development (R&D) that is prone to spillovers. Mixed oligopolies are prevalent in the defense sector, among other sectors. Using a two-stage sequential game with R&D in the first stage and production in the second stage, results show that higher tariffs reduce outputs of both the domestic public firm and foreign private firms, and private R&D. Effects on domestic R&D and welfare, and profits of foreign private firms depend upon spillovers. Within a large range of research spillovers, higher tariffs can in fact lower welfare. Some of these findings are different from traditional oligopolies and from models that ignore research spillovers. Policy implications are discussed.
F19|The CERDI-seadistance database|We describe the publicly available CERDI-seadistance database, which contains bilateral maritime distances between 227 countries and territories. The relevant port(s) for countries with access to the sea is defined as the coastal cell of a country that contains the highest number of shipping lines, and each landlocked country is associated to the (foreign) port with the shortest road distance to its capital city. The length of the existing shortest sea route between the two ports is then computed; this represents the bilateral maritime distance included in our database, which also contains a few additional ancillary variables.
F19|The Power Of Trade Costs Over International Trade: Causality Analysis In Frequency Domain For Turkey|The purpose of this paper is to find out the relation between foreign trade of Turkey and international trade costs (international commodity prices, transportation costs and exchange rate) by finding causality relations according to monthly time period. The data of our paper were taken from Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT), United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and Bloomberg Markets database. The sample consists of 12 years in the period 2004:01 - 2015:12. We employ frequency domain Granger causality analysis that allows to short-run and long-run causality. The estimation of causality relation in frequency domain reveals that international trade costs could not be seen as causality indicator for international trade of Turkey except international commodity costs. Besides, causality relation between international commodity prices and import has been observed as of 4th month according to results. Therefore, the test results may draw new international trade strategies of Turkey.
F19|Losers of the Falling Oil Prices: Changes in Oil Vulnerability in the Oil Exporting Countries|The oil market was relatively balanced between 2011 and 2013 at around 100 USD. In the second half of 2014 the sharp decline in oil prices was an unexpected event for most of the market players. The size of price drops justifies an analysis of the oil vulnerability of the most significant net oil exporting countries. In this study many types of trade statistics (export intensity index, terms of trade index, export sensitivity, Herfindahl-Hirschman index), and furthermore the Bennett method are applied to quantify the oil vulnerability of the 14 most important oil exporting nations. It is possible to identify country groups, which enables us to differentiate the applicable economic instruments and make policy recommendations
F19|Contenido de trabajo en las exportaciones manufactureras mexicanas, 2008 y 2012|En este trabajo se presenta una estimación del número de puestos de trabajo contenidos en las exportaciones manufactureras mexicanas en 2008 y 2012, basada en las matrices de insumo-producto elaboradas por el Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía (INEGI). Se presentan los datos de trabajo directo (el necesario para producir los bienes exportados) e indirecto, es decir, el trabajo contenido en los insumos nacionales incorporados en las exportaciones, más el empleo generado por todas las repercusiones indirectas derivadas de la producción de los bienes intermedios que se incorporan en ellas. El empleo en las exportaciones se desagrega por sectores manufactureros exportadores y por sectores donde el empleo es creado. Dado que cualquier sector exportador requiere bienes intermedios que se producen en el mismo sector o en otros, el trabajo indirecto contenido en las exportaciones es dividido entre empleo indirecto intrasectorial e intersectorial.
F19|The labour content of Mexican manufactures, 2008 and 2012|This study presents estimates of the number of jobs created by Mexican exports of manufactured goods in 2008 and 2012 based on the input-output matrices developed by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI). Data are given for direct labour (the labour needed to produce the exports) and indirect labour (the labour involved in producing the Mexican-made inputs embedded in those exports, plus the jobs created by all the indirect repercussions of the production of the intermediate goods that are incorporated into those exports). Employment in export production is disaggregated into manufacturing export sectors and sectors in which related jobs are created. In addition, since every export sector requires intermediate goods, some of which are produced in the same sector and some of which are produced in others, the indirect labour embedded in exports is divided into its intrasectoral and intersectoral components.
F19|Production complexity, adaptability and economic growth|This paper analyzes the impact of production complexity and its adaptability on the level of output and on its rate of growth. We develop an endogenous growth model where increased complexity raises the rate of economic growth but has an ambiguous effect on the level of output. Our empirical measure of production adaptability captures the proximity of production sectors within the product space, which we modify to reflect intra-industry trade and the international fragmentation of production. We test the model against a sample of 89 countries over the two decades to 2009 and find that its main predictions are validated.
F19|Exporters of knowledge-intensive business services in Basque Country|I analyze the characteristics of exporting firms in knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS) firms in Basque Country. I show that the share of exporting firms in KIBS is much higher than in other services, although lower than in manufacturing. Exporters of KIBS have lower trade intensities than exporters of manufactures, but exports are less concentrated within firms than in this latter industry. The data shows that exporting firms in KIBS are larger than non-exporters in sales, employment, labor productivity and wages per employee. Compared to manufacturing firms, the export premia in KIBS is especially salient regarding wages per employee, suggesting that quality of the service is a key factor to participate in foreign markets.

Such a mechanism operates in the WTO in accordance with the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU). So, from August 2012 Russia has the right to protect its trade interests by means of the above instrument.
F19|Russia’s Foreign trade in 2015|In 2015, economic growth rates in countries, which are main trade partners of the Russian Federation, turned out to be below forecast of a year earlier. In 2015, according to the data released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China[1], the China's GDP went up by 6.9% annualized, which is the minimum over the recent 25 years. Production growth in 2015 has slowed down to 6.0% and growth of the service sector up to 8.3%. In 2014, growth rates posted 7.3% and 7.8%, respectively.

F19|Export Variety And Intra-Industry Trade: Theoretical And Empirical Evidence|This paper theoretically and empirically investigates the relationship between the number of product varieties and the extent of intra-industry trade (IIT). IIT provides more trade opportunities for countries in which differentiated products are produced. The model presented shows that the extent of bilateral IIT is higher the smaller the gap in the number of export varieties between two countries. The empirical analysis of Japan and twenty-five countries provides support for the theoretical model presented in this paper. The theory also shows that similar number of export varieties between two countries, that is, more IIT can be a tool to redress trade imbalance between two countries. The policy implication of the results is that promoting higher product variety will increase the opportunity for IIT regardless of country specific effects
F19|The Global Corn Market: Current Situation And Trends|In the first half of 2016, quotations in the international corn market have recorded an upward trend, in spite of discouraging fundamental market factors. The article examines the main aspects of the relationships between weather conditions, producers, consumers and traders. These factors have led to the defining trend in corn quotations at the most representative agricultural exchange in the world, the one in Chicago. In addition to the analysis of the corn market fundamentals in 2015 and the first half of 2016, the article makes several references to future market developments, as forecasted by experts of the US Department of Agriculture.
F19|Trends in international grain prices and their impact on the Romanian exports|In recent years, Romanian exports of major grain products (wheat and corn) have had an upward trend, due to the high level of domestic production (both in terms of physical volume and quality) and the increase in terms of competitiveness, especially in the Black Sea Region. The present analysis of trends in wheat and corn international prices and the dynamics of the Romanian exports of these cereals have been carried out on the basis of the processing and interpretation of the most recent data and information published by the Romanian and international specialized institutions. The paper offers a general guideline for the Romanian policy makers and the business community in order to develop the potential of commercial activity in the field of agricultural raw materials.
F19|State of Ukraine’s Educational Services.How attractive is it for Indian Students?|Education services form an integral part of today’s modern and globalized world. A society’s course of development may be decided by the state of educational services in the society. The educational services sector, which was initially open to only public institutions, has seen a change. With the increased globalization and introduction of good medium of communication, people have access to education institutions worldwide. Students not only benefit from the expertise developed by the educational institutions, but they also benefit by the wide cross section of classroom having students from different parts of the world. It helps students, develop and understand the view of different geographies. As we are moving towards rapid globalization in our business, there is an increase in more students going abroad for their higher education. The population explosion around the world has also triggered a process of continued expansion and liberalization in this sector. With more and more students demanding educational services the government has had to open up the sector for both domestic and foreign private investors. Educational services are also enlisted under General Agreement on Trade and Services (GATS). However, ironically, not withstanding the importance of this sector it remains one of the least committed sectors under GATS. There are many factors that inhibit trade between countries in this sector. A few big factors are quality assurance, policy control, accreditations standardization and other country specific issues. Despite, barriers, students cross the border and seek admissions in foreign universities. China, India, Korea are sending large number of students mostly to Western universities. Almost 200,000 Indian students went abroad for higher education in the year 2012. Major destinations are US, UK and Canada. However recently the rules for immigration to these countries have been made more stringent. Consequently, this group of internationally mobile students has had to look at other destinations for higher studies. Ukraine has emerged as a major hub for higher education along with China and other European countries. In the year 2012 Ukraine had almost 40,000 international students. Moreover of these 40,000 students almost 2,500 students were from India. These figures show the growing trend of Indian students going to Ukraine for higher studies. Ukraine, with over 100 higher education institutions, produces the world’s fourth largest number of academic graduates. The Ukrainian universities are some of the oldest in the world and therefore have rich history and international level infrastructure. Furthermore, the degrees of Ukrainian universities are internationally recognized. On the other hand, India has the most number of students studying abroad after China. It goes without saying that there is a lot achieve through mutual cooperation between India and Ukraine.
F19|Myanmar's cross-border trade with China : beyond informal trade|Myanmar's trade with China is heavily concentrated in cross-border trade through the Yunnan province of China. In this qualitative analysis, we examine factors that yield such a concentration from the viewpoint that trade would be concentrated in the channel where transaction costs are relatively low compared with those in other channels. It is almost certain that weak law enforcement at the border gives rise to informal cross-border trade, which allows traders to save the time and costs for compliance with formal procedures. Apart from informality, unique institutional arrangements have been emerging spontaneously in the border area that can reduce transaction costs in a way compatible with formal trade, thus augmenting cross-border trade. Based on observations of thriving trade at Myanmar's border with China, we draw implications for the country's general trade facilitation measures.
F19|The Diversification and Sophistication of Pakistan’s Exports: The Need for Structural Transformation|While export diversification is considered to foster export growth and enhance GDP growth rates, this diversification has not translated into higher exports for Pakistan. In addition to diversification, the country must undergo a structural transformation of its exports to upgrade to a more sophisticated export basket. This entails shifting its comparative advantage from primary to manufactured exports and, further, from a labor-intensive to a more capital-intensive productive structure. In order to explain Pakistan’s paradoxical situation, this paper analyzes Pakistan’s orientation in the ‘product space’ as it affects the process and rate of structural transformation. In addition, we assess the sophistication of Pakistan’s exports based on their complexity and technological sophistication. Our analysis refutes the traditional argument that diversification leads to greater exports and faster economic development. It also shows that the bulk of the country’s productive capabilities are concentrated in the periphery of the product space, which is very weakly connected to the tightly packed industrial core. The export basket is neither complex nor technologically sophisticated, producing low-tech undifferentiated products. It seems that Pakistan is left with few nearby options for structural transformation, leaving it without a path to other, more sophisticated areas in the core of the product space. We argue that accelerating the process of structural transformation will require revisiting industrial policy, strengthening the country’s institutions and strategic collaboration between the public and private sectors.
F19|Intra-industry and inter-industry trade through the lens of comparative and absolute advantage|The article surveys the literature that emphasizes the importance of comparative and absolute advantages for intra- and inter-industry trade. Two conclusions follow form the survey. First, unlike the traditional view, intra-industry trade is determined rather by technology than by increasing returns. Second, absolute advantages that have been ignored in international trade models for a long time play a vital role through their linkages with product quality and export diversification. We also discuss a new strand of literature that models international trade with the assumption of non-homothetic preferences.
F19|International Trade's Impact on Poverty|International trade is one of the fastest developing sectors of the world economy, with total merchandise trade growing from $7.1 trillion in 1990 to $30.8 trillion in 2010. For the same period, the number of people living in extreme poverty (with under $1.25/day) worldwide has declined with nearly 800 million. This simultaneous growth of trade volumes and reduction of extreme poverty at macro level is the starting point of the analysis. Since a classical (mono-dimensional) ‘cause-effect’ relationship between trade and poverty cannot be identified, international trade’s impact on poverty has been examined through the static and dynamic effects of trade. The analysis features a broad empirical research, covering the regions with the highest concentration of extreme poverty – Africa, Asia and Latin America. The paper’s main thesis is that the long-term positive impact on poverty depends largely on the dynamic effects of trade.
F19|Analysis of tax effects on consolidated household/government debts of a nation in a monetary union under classical dichotomy|Unlike many analysis of tax effects on consolidated household/government debts in a monetary union, this paper builds up analysis from a consolidated budget constraint, instead of starting from a model. By a monetary union, it is assumed that all nations in the union share same currency. Also, if taxes are assumed to be in real values, or if one assumes that government targets real value of taxes $T/P$, then it is also possible to produce the size of fiscal multiplier on real value of consolidated debts, if relaxed version of classical dichotomy - that agents' decisions are only affected by real variables - is assumed. This paper argues that size is $db/dt_r = -1$ where $t_r$ is real value of taxes or ``real taxes'' and $b = B/(PR)$ where $B = -D$ with $D$ nominal debt, $P$ price and $R-1$ nominal interest rate , or in terms of real debts, $dd/dt_r = 1$.
F19|Reconciliation of the Washington Consensus with the Beijing Model in Africa|In this study, we argue that an approach which will reconcile the two opposing camps in Sino-African relations and bring the most progress is a “middle passage” that greases contradictions and offers an accommodative, balanced and pragmatic vision on which Africans can unite. We present a case under which countries can substantially enhance the prospect of development if an African consensus builds on a merger between the Western and Chinese models. We balance national interest with human rights, sovereign authority with individual rights and economic goals with political rights. The chapter presents arguments on the need for a development paradigm in Africa that reconciles the Washington Consensus with the Beijing Model. The analytical framework is organised in three main strands, notably: (i) historical perspectives and contemporary views; (ii) reconciliation of dominant schools of thought and paradigms surrounding Sino-African relations and (iii) practical and contemporary implications. Reconciled schools of thought are engaged in four main categories: optimists versus (vs.) pessimists; preferences in rights (human vs. national, idiosyncratic vs. sovereign and political vs. economic) and the Beijing model vs. the Washington Consensus.
F19|India’s Trade Partnership with East African Community: Exploratory Results from Trade Indices|Since the initiation of economic reforms in 1991, India adopted an outward-oriented strategy for development. After inception of World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995, the country initially relied on multilateral trade reforms for export growth, but slow progress of the Doha Round negotiations over the last decade caused it to explore the regional trade agreements (RTAs) route as well from 2003-04 onwards. While in the initial period India focused on deeper trade relationship with Asian partners, namely, Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Japan, South Korea etc. as preferential trade allies, the perceived need to diversify the export markets has led the country to focus on potential trade partners in Africa, Europe, North and Latin America as well in recent times. On the other hand, the economies of East Africa are also embracing the RTA route for their trade promotion and the growing Indian market offers an opportunity for them as well. The present analysis attempts to understand the trade potential between the five East African Community (EAC) countries and India in the sphere of merchandise and services trade by looking through various trade indices. The empirical results indicate that bilateral trade between the two regions have a strong potential, which can be aided further through policy reforms at both ends.
F19|Konkurecieschopnosť ako cieľ hospodárskej politiky<BR>[Competitiveness as a Goal of Economic Policy]|Until now there is no scientific consensus about the concept of national competitiveness. Despite the ambiguity of its definition, it has become a goal of numerous political documents. Economic policies in many countries are devoted to raise their overall competitiveness. But an unclear definition of relations between different components of national competitiveness represents an obstacle to formulate effective political measures. The aim of this paper is to clarify the relation between the competitiveness of the Czech Republic and its export performance which is considered as one of ways to improve overall competitiveness. The contribution of external competitiveness to the export performance of the Czech Republic in European Union is quantified using an econometric version of Constant Market Shares analysis. The results suggest that the external competitiveness of the Czech Republic has significantly positive effects on its export performance. Moreover we conclude that the positive spillover effect from external to aggregate competitiveness could be reach via increasing productivity.
F19|Trade, Trade Finance, and Global Liquidity in Asia; Markov-Switching FAVAR Approach|This paper analyzes why the global financial crisis in 2008 severely affected Asia's trade. Asia has been suffering from the falls in export demand from developed countries. However the abrupt trade declines in Asia are not fully explained by reactions to this as in previous experiences. The question is why the financial crisis in 2008 brought about the abrupt and deep collapse in world trade, while other world-wide recessions had more moderate effects on world trade. This paper shows that the dynamic relationship between trade and trade finance is one important factor in explaining this question. This paper also applies the Granger (causality) test to uncover different relationships in the developed and developing economies and show different results for different countries in Asia. We employ a Markov-Switching FAVAR (Factor Augmented VAR) to show that global liquidity shocks are important factors in explaining the huge and abrupt trade drops in Asia.
F19|The Prospects, Benefits and Challenges of Sui Generis Protection of Geographical Indications of South Africa|This article appraises the prospects, benefits and challenges of sui generis protection of geographical indications (GIs) in South Africa (SA). In SA, there is no specific legislation protecting GIs, and the country relies, amongst others, on the common law system and various legislations, such as the Agricultural Products Standards Act of 1990; Counterfeit Goods of 1997; the Liquor Products; the Trademark Act; the Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Act of 2013; and the Consumer Protection Act of 1998. It is therefore argued that SA needs a specific law that considers GIs as a specific, separate intellectual property right (IPR).
F19|Embassies and their role in practicing economic diplomacy. The case of Romania|Nowadays the international affairs environment has experienced major transformation, with the consequence that international trade and diplomatic relations have achieved a new significance and role. For the past years, relevant research was focused mainly on the historical development and the increasing need for economic diplomacy in the current process of globalization. Less research has been done in the factual field, emphasizing the correlation between efforts made by embassies as part of the economic diplomacy strategy of a country.In order to answer the research question, data was gathered in cooperation with a number of embassies and consulates and also national authorities representatives, such as experts from Ministry of External Affairs. The article will deliver an in-depth knowledge and describe how economic diplomatic activities are accomplished by embassies and reflected in the country?s economy.
F19|Forecasting tourist arrivals using origin country macroeconomics| This study utilizes both disaggregated data and macroeconomic indicators in order to examine the importance of the macroeconomic environment of origin countries for analysing destinations’ tourist arrivals. In particular, it is the first study to present strong empirical evidence that both of these features in tandem provide statistically significant information of tourist arrivals in Greece. The forecasting exercises presented in our analysis show that macroeconomic indicators conducive to better forecasts are mainly origin country-specific, thus highlighting the importance of considering the apparent sharp national contrasts among origin countries when investigating domestic tourist arrivals. Given the extent of the dependency of the Greek economy on tourism income and also the perishable nature of the tourist product itself, results have important implications for policymakers in Greece.
F19|Does rising import competition harm local firm productivity in less advanced economies? Evidence from the Vietnam's manufacturing sector| This paper examines whether rising import penetration has an effect on the productivity of domestic firms. The study uses data on a 10-year unbalanced panel of firms in the manufacturing sector in Vietnam from 2000 to 2009. Panel and instrumental variable methods are used to control firm heterogeneity and endogeneity of import penetration. We find statistically significant and negative effects of import competition on local firms’ productivity, but the effect in terms of magnitude is economically small. Further investigation shows no clear evidence of variations in the effects by firm size and technological level. However, we find that rising import penetration is associated with the likelihood of firm death.
F19|Inattentive importers|Information frictions prevent importers from observing the price of a good in every market. In this paper, we seek to explain how the presence of such frictions shapes the flow of goods between countries. To this end, we introduce rationally inattentive importers in a multi-country Ricardian trade model. The amount of information importers process is endogenous and reacts to changes in observable trade costs. Unlike traditional trade costs, changes in information processing costs have non-monotonic and asymmetric effects on bilateral trade flows. The model generates a novel prediction regarding the relationship between information processing costs and concentration of imports that finds support in the data. We calibrate the model, perform counterfactuals and show quantitatively how the response of trade flows to exogenous trade shocks gets magnified under inattention.
F19|Comparative Advantages with Product Complexity and Product Quality|We analyze the interplay between product-intrinsic complexity and endogenously chosen product quality in international trade. Our work reveals a novel mecha-nism that can explain a rich set of empirical observations: (1) how specialization within products on quality can equalize comparative advantages across products,(2) why poor countries do not export a broad range of products nonetheless, and (3) why the share of products for which this is the case tends to be decreasing over time. Our theory motivates the use of a censored regression model to esti-mate the link between a country’s GDP per capita and the quality of its exports. Following this empirical strategy, we find a much stronger relationship than when using OLS, in line with our theory.
F19|Revisiting growth accounting from a trade in value-added perspective|Global Manufacturing and International Supply Chains changed the way trade and international economics are understood today. The present essay builds on recent statistical advances to suggest new ways of looking at the demand and supply side approaches when Global Value Chains (GVCs) - articulating supply and demand chains from an international perspective - are taken into consideration. This pilot case focuses on the G-20 countries, a group of leading developed and developing economies which took a prominent role in fostering and managing global economic governance. The paper is organised into two independent parts. The demand dynamics is first analysed through a growth-accounting decomposition, then through the long term determinants of income elasticity of imports. The second part looks at the implications of global manufacturing for our understanding of the supply-side growth dynamics, privileging a trade perspective: the definition of comparative advantages and the potential for value-chain upgrading.
F19|Sino-African Relations: Some Solutions and Strategies to the Policy Syndromes| We survey about 110 recently published studies on Sino-African relations, and put some structure on the documented issues before suggesting some solutions and strategies to the identified policy syndromes. The documented issues are classified into the following eight main strands: China targeting nations with abundant natural resources, focusing on countries with bad governance, not hiring local workers; outbidding other countries by flouting environmental and social standards; importing workers that do not integrate into domestic society and living in extremely simple conditions, exhibiting low linkages between her operations and local businesses, exporting low quality products to Africa, and the emergence of China hindering Africa’s development. We sum up the discussion by reconciling the Beijing and Washington Consensuses.
F19|Nonlinear Effect of Exchange Rates on Trade Balance: A Recommendation for Emerging Countries’ Exchange Rate Policy|Purpose: Considering the mixed results of previous empirical studies with regard to how the real exchange rates affect bilateral trade balance, this study intends to test the presence of not only the nonlinear relationship but also the J-curve effect and Korea data from January 1985 through December 2013 is adopted. The findings are helpful for emerging countries to evaluate their exchange policy. Methodology: Unit root test, cointegration analysis and Vector Autoregressive Error Correction Model are adopted in this study. Findings: The results indicate that there is a co-integration relationship between real exchange rates and bilateral trade balance in both linear and nonlinear models and Korea-U.S. bilateral trade balance exhibited no J-curve effect when the Korean won depreciated against U.S. dollar. A performance evaluation proves nonlinear model is better than linear model. Recommendation: The findings help us to realize that depreciation has a limited effect on promoting trade balance. Sharp currency depreciation will hurt country’s trade balance.

F19|What drives bank-intermediated trade finance? Evidence from cross-country analysis|Empirical work on the underlying causes of the recent dislocations in bank-intermediated trade finance has been limited by the scant availability of hard data. This paper aims to analyse the key determinants of bank-intermediated trade finance using a novel dataset covering ten banking jurisdictions. It focuses on the role of global factors as well as country-specific characteristics in driving trade finance. Results indicate that country-specific variables, such as growth in trade flows and funds available for domestic banks, as well as global financial conditions and global import growth, are important determinants of trade finance. These results are robust to different model specifications. Further, we do not find that trade finance is more sensitive to global financial conditions than other loans to non-bank entities.

F19|The Performance of Trading Firms in the Services Sectors – Comparable Evidence from Four EU Countries|" type=""main"" xml:id=""twec12291-abs-0001""> We examine trade complexity and the implications of adding additional dimensions of trade for firm performance among services producers. We use unique firm-level data to compare these patterns across four EU countries. Overall, services firms are relatively less engaged in trade than manufacturing firms; they mostly trade goods and are more likely to import than to export. Trade in services is quite rare; services are more likely to be traded by firms already trading goods. Trading firms in the services sectors are significantly larger, more productive and pay higher wages than non-traders. Two-way traders outperform one-way traders. Changes in trading status by either adding another dimension of trade (imports, exports) or another type of product (goods, services) are infrequent and are associated with significant preswitching premia. In contrast, learning effects from switching trading status are uncommon. This points to significant fixed cost of being engaged in trade and confirms some previous findings that trading services firms have similar traits as their manufacturing counterparts. Apart from greater trade participation in smaller countries, we do not observe systematic differences in terms of trade or switching premia between the four countries that might be attributable to differences in country characteristics."
F19|The Influence Of The Romanian-German Economic Relations On A Specific Market In Romania|Considering the evolution of the Romanian-German economic relations, with their two major components (the direct foreign investments and trade), we analyzed their influence on a specific market in Romania, in this case the logistics market in Romania. After the analysis, we can conclude that the Romanian-German economic relations influenced in a positive way the development of the logistics market in Romania, both in terms of quantity but also in terms of quality, and, in addition to this, it has a significant contribution in terms of stability for the logistics market in Romania.
F19|Global Sourcing of Heterogeneous Firms: Theory and Evidence|This paper investigates the role of firm productivity in drawing firm boundaries in global sourcing. Our analysis focuses on how productivity affects the allocation of ownership rights between the headquarter of a firm and its intermediate input supplier (vertical integration vs. outsourcing), as well as the location of intermediate input production (offshore vs. domestic). Unlike previous work, we allow for a fully flexible productivity effect with varying magnitude and sign across different industries. Our estimation strategy is motivated by the canonical economic model of sourcing due to Antr s & Helpman (2004). This model invokes the property rights theory of the firm in order to pin down firm boundaries as the outcome of an interaction between firm heterogeneity and the industry's sourcing intensity (i.e. the importance of inputs sourced from suppliers relative to headquarter inputs). We demonstrate that, at the level of the firm, the model implies a productivity effect that varies not just in magnitude (and potentially non-monotonically), but also in sign with the sourcing intensity of the industry. To estimate the effects empirically, we use Spanish firm-level data from the Encuesta sobre Estrategias Empresariales (ESEE). We find a pattern of effects whereby productivity stimulates vertical integration in industries of low sourcing intensity, but favors outsourcing in industries of high sourcing intensity. Moreover, we find that productivity boosts offshoring throughout all industries, with the effect increasing monotonically in the sourcing intensity. Our results lend strong empirical support to the property rights view of the firm in the global economy.
F19|The Effect Of The Components Of Logistics Performance Index On Gross Domestic Product: Conceptual Model Proposal|Domestic and foreign trade are the most important components of the logistics sector. Logistics is related with planning, application and control of flowing of product, service and information between production and consumption areas. The most important indicators to represent the level of development of a country are economic indicators. Developments in the logistics sector contribute production and consumption activities around the World. In this context, logistics sector has an important role in social and economic development. The aim of this study is to designate the relation between gross domestic product (GDP) and logistics performance index (LPI) and differentiate the effects of the components of the LPI on GDP. As a result of the analysis conducted, the effects of Customs and Infrastructure dimensions of LPI on GDP are statistically meaningful.
F19|Four decades of terms-of-trade booms: A metric of income windfall|We study Latin America's history of terms-of-trade booms during the period 1970–2012 through the prisms of a metric that quantifies the associated exogenous income shock (‘income windfall’). We also document saving patterns during these episodes and propose a measure of how much of the income windfall was saved (i.e., the marginal saving rate). We find that Latin America's terms-of-trade shock of the last decade has not differed much in magnitude from that observed during the 1970s, but the associated income windfall has been substantially larger. While aggregate saving increased more than in past episodes, the share of the windfall saved has been lower, suggesting that greater aggregate savings reflect mainly the sheer size of the exogenous income shock rather than a greater effort to save it.
F19|Trade openness, financial openness, and financial development in China|This paper investigates the impact of trade and financial openness on financial development in China. We use three sets of indicators of financial development to distinguish size, efficiency and competition as aspects of financial development. The empirical results, using dynamic panel estimation techniques, suggest that both trade and financial openness are statistically significant determinants of financial efficiency and competition, but that openness has a negative impact on the size of financial development. Our results also suggest that the marginal effects of openness on financial efficiency and competition are positive for the most open provinces but negative for the least open regions, while the marginal effects of openness on the size of financial development are generally negative for most provinces in the sample. The results reflect a mismatch problem between the distribution in the types of trading companies and the distribution of financial resources, and also indicate that local incumbents may be strong impediments to financial development in China.
F19|Technology and costs in international competitiveness: From countries and sectors to firms|This paper examines the microfoundations of the determinants of international competitiveness. It does so within the broader “technology gap” perspective whereby wide technological and organizational differences ultimately shape the patterns of trade within sectors across countries and their dynamics. First, we take stock of the incumbent evidence on the relation between cost-related and technological competition at country and sectoral level. The overall picture indeed suggests that the countries’ sectoral market shares are mainly shaped by technological factors while cost advantages/disadvantages do not seem to play any significant role. But within any sector, within any country, firms widely differ. Hence the question: does this property apply also at a micro level? Here, we first propose a heuristic model based on a generalized Polya urn process yielding such a property and, then, empirically attempt to identify the underlying dynamics at the firm level using a large panel of Italian firms, over nearly two decades. Results show that also at micro level in most sectors investments and patents correlate positively both with the probability of being an exporter and with the capacity to acquire and to increase exports, whereas labour costs show a negative effect only in some sectors. The result is reinforced when separating the short- and long-run effects, highlighting the predominant impact of technological proxies and basically the irrelevance of wage costs.
F19|Challenges Facing Bank in Financing International Trade: From an Islamic Perspective|Risk has always existed in business and it is even predominant when business transactions are done across borders. With the intensification of industrialization, it has resulted in risks that are unknown before. In the competitive business environment today, for business firms to compete, they must not only be able to minimize their risks in doing business, but also be able to take advantage of the growth opportunities presented by doing business in other countries. Hence understanding what risk is and what the perception of business firm towards risk is very important to any bank especially Islamic bank. This study investigates the risks that Islamic banks face in particular when dealing with the Islamic bank mode of financing. There are some inherent risks involved when Islamic bank uses the Islamic principle of financing. Managing risk management is a complex discipline even in a very simple commercial transaction. Nevertheless, risk is a core element of business (particularly international business) which is closely related to return. Financing international trade inevitably is complex and involves risks, irrespective of the markets in which business firms chose to conduct their business transactions. Hence, it is pertinent that an analysis on issues of risk management in the Islamic Financial system is undertaken as well. A Shariaâ€™ compliant risk management is analysed and some alternatives to risk management is proposed for Islamic banks in mitigating their risks in financing international trade.
F19|Döviz Kuru Değişimi ve İthal Mallarının İç Fiyatlara Geçiş Etkisi: Türkiye Üzerine Bir Uygulama|Bu çalışmada amaç döviz kuru ve ithal mal fiyatlarının iç fiyatlar düzeyi üzerindeki etkisini analiz etmektir. Uluslararası fiyat düzeyindeki gelişmeler ülkelerin ticaret yapmış oldukları ülke gruplarının toplam ithalat içindeki paylarına bağlı olarak ithalat yoluyla enflasyon üzerinde etkili olmaktadır. Bu kanal dolaysız kanal iken, döviz kurlarına bağlı etki ise dolaylı kanalı oluşturmaktadır. Bu açıdan dış fiyatlardaki gelişmeler ile ülkenin döviz kurundaki gelişmeler fiyatlar genel düzeyi üzerinde asimetrik etkileri olmaktadır. Bununla birlikte iç fiyatların, özellikle maliyet unsurlarına bağlı olarak aşağıya doğru esnek olmaması da bu asimetrinin en önemi nedeni olmaktadır. Bundan dolayı bu çalışmada asimetrik durumun varlığını dikkate alan tahmin yaklaşımı kullanılmıştır. Ayrıca sözkonusu asimeterik durumun varlığının ortaya çıkardığı parametrelerin zamana bağlı değişkenliğine bağlı olarak zaman göre değişim tekniği tahminleme aşamasında tercih edilmiştir. Bu çalışma da yeni açıklanmaya başlanan yurt içi ve yurt dışı fiyatlar endeksleri kullnıldığı için elde edilen sonuçlar dış ticaret politikalarına yönelik bilgi sağlamakatadır.
F19|Corporate Communication, Visibility And Transparency: Itâ€™S Impact On Nonprofit Organizations In Mexico,Comunicacion Corporativa, Visibilidad Y Transparencia: Su Impacto En Las Organizaciones De La Sociedad Civil En Mexico|It is critical for organizations to generate an image of transparency, trust and a reputation that will endure over time as among the benefits achieved are consolidated in their markets. Nonprofit organizations achieve this through proper management of corporate communications. The present investigation was performed to determine whether management of communication and visibility, has a significant influence on the practice of transparency of the local or regional civil society located in the central region of the State of Coahuila. We provide alternatives for reinforcement or improvement in communication management by executives. The methodology involves quantitative information from 18 organizations, located in the central region of Coahuila through a structured Likert scale. Two types of questionnaire variables were used: Communication and Visibility and Transparency. To measure reliability Cronbach alpha test was used and produced a coefficient of internal consistency of 0.908 and 0.774 respectively, indicating both variables are reliable.

F19|World Sugar Market Outlook: 2014-2015|The article presents synthetically the sugar market outlook for 2014 â€“ agricultural seasons 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 â€“ highlighting the main factors influencing 2014 and 2015 sugar prices evolution. We also present the role of main actors on the world sugar market (major sugar exporting and producing countries 2014). On the basis of the analysis of refined sugar stock prices at London (Stock) Exchange, we conclude that, in 2014, (a) sugar prices dropped compared to those recorded in 2013, and (b) the price volatility decreased in relation to previous years. The downward trend of sugar prices was maintained in 2015.
F19|Global engagement in R&D: a portrait of biopharmaceutical patenting firms| This paper provides a novel portrait of firms engaging in the international use of inventors. I focus on drug discovery activity of pharmaceutical and biotechnological firms head-quartered in Europe, over the period 1996-2005. An important part of the most high-valued added R&D activities are conducted by inventors, who are engaged in the creation of new technologies. I use a novel and particularly rich dataset that provides a comparable picture across host locations and over time of research activity of EU firms. The main results are that firm-level heterogeneity is a key feature in the internationalisation of inventors and this is similar to patterns from data analysing good and service traders and MNEs. Furthermore, host country distance characteristics are associated with the number of inventors in a similar fashion to patterns found in gravity models explaining good and service trade.
F19|Theoretical Perspectives On Economic Cooperation|Economic cooperation, the engine of relations of international economic cooperation, is an insufficiently defined, dynamic concept. The transformations of the international environment, globalization and the intensification of economic interdependencies render economic cooperation a must, and not just an option within international relations. Similar to the international environment, economic cooperation undergoes a process of redefinition, of adjustment to the new realities. This article aims at identifying and analyzing the approaches of economic cooperation in this context.
F19|The Missing Economic Magic: The Failure of Trade Liberalization and Exchange Rate Devaluation in Pakistan, 1980–2012|Pakistan and India were part of that wave of economic liberalization among developing countries from the late 1980s. This paper is about one aspect of that failure to ‘produce the economic magic’, in Pakistan. Pakistan substantially liberalized its international trade after the late 1980s, and contrary to some views managed its exchange rate in an exceptionally clear sighted and prudent manner. In response, Pakistan never experienced sustained and rapid export led-growth. In fact so disappointing was the performance of exports that Pakistan’s degree of integration with the world economy was little higher in 2015 than it had been in 1990. This paper first examines the exciting promise followed by the lackluster performance of trade liberalization. It establishes evidence that the exchange rate was managed in a way that should have helped a more liberalized trading regime contribute to economic growth. The paper explores wider evidence linking trade liberalization to economic growth and argues that the positive relationship is at best only a contingent one. Those contingent factors that have failed to support the positive link between trade liberalization and economic growth in Pakistan are investment, tax revenue, and upgrading/learning.
F19|Can Uppsala Model Explain the Internationalisation of Central European SMEs?|The aim of this paper is to scrutinize some aspects of the Uppsala model whose applicability for SMEs’ internationalisation is often questioned. This model explains internationalisation as a sequential process based on learning in which an enterprise increases its international commitment in incremental steps. The assumptions of Uppsala model are discussed in conditions of SMEs from different countries, namely the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Austria and Germany. The paper is based on primary data obtained by questionnaire survey performed in 2014. Respondents were small and medium-sized firms from the above mentioned countries. Following assumptions are scrutinized: SMEs start internationalisation by exporting to neighbouring markets, SMEs behave in internationalisation according to the establishment chain, SMEs’ risk perception regarding foreign markets with different psychic distance changes with the obtained knowledge and SMEs’ risk perception regarding particular foreign markets differs depending on the country which the enterprise comes from.
F19|The geography, variety and dynamics of service exports in Spain: a firm-level analysis|This paper uses Spanish firm-level data to analyze the difference in the destination and variety-portfolios among service exporters. As for manufacture exporters, there is heterogeneity in the value of exports, the number of destinations and the number of varieties supplied among service exporters. However, compared to manufacture exporters, service exporters have a higher number of destinations and the number and value of transactions play a major role in explaining the evolution of aggregate exports.
F19|Financial Inclusion, ICBT And The Role Of ICT In COMESA|The unbanked are not financially inactive and neither do they consume all of their income. One of the reasons financial inclusion has become a policy priority is because of the negative macro-economic consequences of the informal sector, which includes an informal financial system and informal trade. Informal Cross Border Trade (ICBT) is prevalent in Africa and particularly in the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) region. This has negative impact on trade and other macro statistics for member economies and the region as a whole. Financial inclusion is a possible channel towards formalisation of these firms. The paper further discusses the role of developments in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) in reaching out to the financially excluded. Trend analysis shows a strong correlation between developments in ICT and Intra-Regional Trade in COMESA. The paper is a preliminary, non-technical discussion.
F19|Trade Creation, Diversion Effects and Exchange Rate Volatility in the Global Meat Trade|A modified gravity model is specified and applied to meat trade markets to identify factors affecting bovine and swine meat trade flows. The model is used to evaluate the effects of bilateral and regional free trade agreements. This study reveals that gravity models can be effectively parameterized and used in single commodity trade studies. Using data from 1986 to 2009, the results show that income, population, production capacity, distance, and exchange rate volatility are major factors affecting meat trade. The findings also demonstrate that the formation of the North American Free Trade Agreement and European Union significantly enhanced bovine and swine meat trade flows through trade creation among members and trade diversion from non-members to members. The Common Market of the South led to trade creation with inconclusive results for trade diversion while the Association of South-East Asian Nations led to trade diversion with no evidence of increased intra-bloc trade. The hoof-and-mouth disease significantly impaired bovine meat trade flows.
F19|The Impact Of Managerial Competencies On The Managerial Performance In The Educational System|The concept of competence in science education is in the midst of individual and collective performance. The complexity of the activity of running school has found a certain specific of its management that is materialized in two dimensions of the school activity: the variety of categories of staff and the interpersonal relationship, culture and work climate. All these result in the formation and development of a set of skills specific to the managerial field and necessary to the director of school in performing different roles sprung from this activity.
F19|Gains from Trade under Quality Uncertainty|We add quality uncertainty to a two-country trade model with CES preference and monopolistic competition. There are two kinds of firms - low quality and high quality. Quality is perfectly observable in the domestic market but not in the foreign market. Exporters use price to signal their quality. It is now well established that in such a model with full information, the welfare gains from trade (GFT) can be captured by a sufficient statistic that depends on domestic trade share and the elasticity of substitution. In contrast, in a model with asymmetric information, we show that within the class of separating equilibria, the sufficient statistic always under-estimates GFT, while within the class of pooling equilibria, the sufficient statistic could over-estimate GFT. Nevertheless, GFT are always positive. For an equilibrium refinement, we analyze the determinants of GFT. We show that the actual GFT under asymmetric information could be almost 2.5 times higher than that measured using the sufficient statistic approach.
F19|Trade Law, Domestic Regulation and Development|"Trade Law, Domestic Regulation and Development is about the relationship between trade, regulation and development. By combining law and economics perspectives on the international trading system, Trachtman takes an interdisciplinary approach in analyzing the topic of globalization and economic development. In a developing economy, as globalization proceeds, a critical factor is the relationship between liberalization of movement of goods, services, and people, on the one hand, and the right to regulate, including the right to regulate for development, on the other hand. In the context of market access, all countries need the right to restrict imports of goods or services that may hurt consumers or the broader society, and developing countries sometimes need the ability to subsidize their own goods and services, or sometimes to restrict imports of goods or services, in order to promote development. Nonetheless, both developed and developing countries often fall into the trap of regulating for protectionist or corrupt reasons. Finding the right balance between market access and regulation is the subject of analysis in this collected volume of 16 papers by Trachtman, and presented in a manner that is accessible and interesting to both law and economics readers. In Trachtman's own words, ""The purpose of [international] trade law in this context [globalization] seems to be to allow states to agree to avoid creating these inefficient policy externalities, not to force all states to dance to the same tune."""
F19|Uncovering Value Added in Trade:New Approaches to Analyzing Global Value Chains|Value chain trade has challenged economic implications of conventional trade statistics and transformed bilateral trade relationships into multilaterals. Conventional trade statistics exaggerate trade volumes and bilateral trade imbalances. It is imperative to measure trade in value-added and examine trade relations in the context of global value chains. This book is a collection of research papers on new approaches to measure trade in value added and the role of global value chains in modern international trade. It introduces the input output method for measuring trade and a direct approach for measuring the domestic value added of the People's Republic of China — the center of global assembly. In addition, it shows how to analyze trade relations in the context of global value chains.
F19|Philippines – Taxes on Distilled Spirits: Like Products and Market Definition|This paper provides a legal–economic analysis of the Appellate Body decision in Philippines – Taxes on Distilled Spirits (Philippines–Spirits). In Philippines–Spirits, the Panel and the Appellate Body had an opportunity to consider again the scope of ‘like products’ and of ‘directly competitive or substitutable products’ under Article III:2 of GATT. The Panel and Appellate Body followed the Border Tax Adjustments factors in order to determine whether the products were sufficiently similar. The Appellate Body explicitly extended its jurisprudence from other areas of Article III to a like-products determination under the first sentence of Article III:2: this analysis is to be focused on the degree of competition between the imported and domestic products. We observe that the effect of different taxation on domestic products is affected by the degree of substitution between products as well as competitive conditions, whereas the Appellate Body seems to focus on the former and ignore the latter. We also question some of the Panel and Appellate Body interpretations of the evidence regarding the degree of substitution between products. Overall, we find that even if there may be a segment in which foreign and domestic products compete, the reported evidence in this case would seem to be consistent with the view that for the bulk of the market, foreign and domestic items are distant substitutes.Putting aside the jurisprudence, a methodologically sound finding regarding substitution (and competition) seems necessary, but not sufficient, for a finding of inefficient discrimination. In order to find inefficient discrimination, there must also be a finding that the nonprotectionist benefits that may arise from the national regulation are not sufficient to justify the discriminatory action, otherwise, rational regulation that is globally efficient might be invalidated, inappropriately restricting the national right to regulate. In the present case, the Philippines articulated no nonprotectionist rationale for its distinctions. Existing WTO jurisprudence in this area prior to the Appellate Body decision in US-Clove Cigarettes (in the context of Article 2.1 of the technical barriers to trade agreement) has only hinted at the additional focus on the justificatory role of nonprotectionist regulatory benefits, yet an explicit and appropriately contextualized reference to the nonprotectionist rationale, if any, of regulation seems to be a necessary part of decision-making.

F19|Brazil – Measures Affecting Imports of Retreaded Tyres: A Balancing Act|This paper provides a legal-economic analysis of the Appellate Body decision in Brazil–Retreaded Tyres. We develop a simple economic model that we use to analyze the market structure and environmental externalities that were most relevant to this case. We start by analyzing Brazil's policies in a model in which tyre retreading generates a positive production externality through the delay it provides society before a used tyre becomes a waste product with the potential to harm society through its adverse impact on human health and the environment. We examine the different welfare implications of (i) a production subsidy for retreading of once-used Brazilian tyres, (ii) a tariff on imports of retreaded tyres, and (iii) a ban on imports of retreaded tyres. While a production subsidy is the first-best instrument to address this type of externality, there are reasons to believe that it might be infeasible. The welfare implications of the other measures depend importantly on the magnitude of the positive production externality. From the lens provided by this economic analysis, we draw three primary insights. First, we identify the critical piece of empirical information that the Panel and Appellate Body require to make a rational judgment of the utility of the Brazilian policies contested in the dispute – i.e., the size of the underlying externality associated with retreading. Second, if the justification for the original import ban on retreaded tyres was based on the argument that it was a second-best Brazilian policy designed to combat a large externality, then Brazil's failure to enforce a ban on used-tyre imports has the troubling result of eroding those potential welfare gains through a reduction in equilibrium production (and consumption) of Brazilian retreaded tyres. Third, the Brazilian policy that exempted from the ban retreaded imports from MERCOSUR partners also has the same troubling feature. The second and third points are congruent with the reasons for the Appellate Body's determination that the Brazilian policy did not qualify under the chapeau of Article XX. We examine the WTO jurisprudence of Article XX(b), in order to compare the methodology developed under this jurisprudence to the type of examination of changes to total welfare from implementing one policy relative to a postulated alternative policy that most economists would follow. We find that the WTO jurisprudence in this area is internally incoherent, and also fails to evaluate the types of concerns that an economic-welfare analysis would evaluate.

F19|Continued Suspense: Ec–Hormones And Wto Disciplines On Discrimination And Domestic Regulation|Based on the reasoning of the Appellate Body in Canada/United States — Continued Suspension of Obligations in the EC–Hormones Dispute (‘Continued Suspension’), this paper analyzes the distinction between the national-treatment obligation under Article III of GATT and the requirement under the Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Measures that such measures be based on a risk assessment that takes into account available scientific evidence. The Appellate Body's reasoning makes clear that the primary purpose of the SPS Agreement is to discipline discriminatory regulation, and not the level of protection. We argue that the case clarifies that de facto protection (market segmentation) created by an SPS measure must be motivated by demonstrating that the measure is addressing a market failure, as reflected in the existence of some scientific basis for a health or safety concern. The scientific-basis requirement is a means for determining the intent of an SPS measure. While this is a factor that is ostensibly not relevant in GATT national-treatment cases, the need for scientific justification is not a move away from a concern with preventing illegitimate discrimination against imported products.
F19|Embedding mutual recognition at the WTO|Mutual recognition is a useful tool for international liberalization in particular contexts. However, it poses two important types of risk. First, it could jeopardize a satisfactory level of prudential regulation. In order to address these risks, mutual recognition should be limited to initiatives that can be supported by satisfactory essential harmonization that can protect a satisfactory level of prudential regulation. Second, mutual recognition could disadvantage poor states, either de jure through closed recognition among developed states or de facto through harmonization or equivalence conditions that are excessive, or excessively costly, for poor states. In order to address these risks, mutual recognition initiatives should be designed to be accessible to poor states.

F19|Regulatory Jurisdiction And The Wto|The WTO is not explicitly concerned with the problem of regulatory jurisdiction in connection with prudential regulation (as opposed to industrial policy regulation). However, as the WTO has addressed increasingly complex regulatory barriers to trade, it has developed several devices that have the implicit effect of allocating regulatory jurisdiction among states. This article reviews a few illustrative cases in WTO law, including Helms–Burton, Shrimp, and Gambling. This review suggests how these cases may be understood as dealing with allocation of regulatory jurisdiction. Negative integration rules such as national treatment or proportionality may serve as devices applied by tribunals for allocation of regulatory authority. The WTO has very limited rules of positive integration—whereby states either harmonize regulation or agree on more specific allocations of regulatory authority, such as mutual recognition. However, it has developed a modest degree of capacity to engage in positive regulation, or to refer to positive integration rules developed in other contexts, such as Codex Alimentarius. Finally, this article examines theoretical bases for allocating and reallocating regulatory jurisdiction in order to establish a framework by which to analyse the role of the WTO in this context.
F19|The World Trading System, the International Legal System and Multilevel Choice|This article develops a theory of multilevel choice of regulatory jurisdiction based on normative individualism, and suggests how certain features of the World Trade Organization (WTO) might be understood in terms of this theory. The WTO has some capacity for positive integration, as demonstrated in, for example, the harmonised minimum standards for intellectual property protection contained in the TRIPS agreement. Yet the WTO has generally not been used as a site for re-regulation in areas congruent with its de-regulation. However, in a limited way, and in particular contexts, it provides certain incentives for re-regulation at other sites. For example, both the SPS Agreement and the TBT Agreement encourage the formation of harmonised rules. These agreements require Member States to use international standards as a basis for their measures, with important exceptions.
F19|Incorporating Development Among Diverse Members|Given the current state of multilateral trade negotiations, it appears that preferential trade agreements (PTAs) will serve as the main vehicle for increased liberalization in the short term. The question arises, therefore, whether the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) should and could include provisions for special treatment for developing countries, and what other aspects of the TPP have special effects on the growth of developing countries. An important range of issues relates to the preservation of policy space for developing countries to take measures to promote their development. PTAs do not normally have significant arrangements for so-called “special and differential treatment,” which at the WTO includes expanded market access for developing countries in developed country markets, and abstention by developed countries from demands for reciprocal market opening of developing countries. Since the TPP is hoped to have an expanding membership, and is heralded as a “21st Century” trade agreement, it is worthwhile to consider what types of special provisions would be appropriate to be included relating to developing countries.

F19|Toward Open Recognition? Standardization And Regional Integration Under Article Xxiv Of Gatt|This article provides a legal analysis of the significance of standards, technical regulations, and sanitary or phytosanitary (SPS) provisions (collectively, ‘TBTSPS’ provisions) in regional trade agreements (‘RTAs’) in relation to the multilateral trading system. It first examines the ways in which RTA regulation of national TBTSPS measures may contribute to or detract from liberalization goals. It then describes how GATT Article XXIV and the Understanding on the Interpretation of Article XXIV (the ‘Understanding’), as presently understood, regulate RTA regulation of national TBTSPS measures. Based on its analysis, this article makes the following recommendations: (1) Interpret Article XXIV:5 of GATT to provide an exception from obligations contained in the TBT Agreement and SPS Agreement, principally the MFN obligation, in accordance with the Turkey – Textiles necessity test. This avoids imposing an inappropriate barrier to formation of RTAs. (2) Interpret ‘other restrictive regulations of commerce’ and ‘other regulations of commerce’ in Articles XXIV:5 and 8 to include only discriminatory and unnecessary TBT or SPS measures. This avoids requirements to eliminate or harmonize non-protectionist TBT or SPS measures. It avoids imposing an inappropriate barrier to formation of RTAs. (3) Interpret Article I:1 of GATT and the MFN provisions of the TBT Agreement and SPS Agreement to clarify authorization for only ‘open’ mutual recognition agreements, similar to the permission contained in Article VII of GATS. This ensures that recognition arrangements will not provide an avenue of discrimination or other defection from WTO multilateral free trade principles. Today, it is not clear that any mutual recognition agreements are authorized.
F19|Implications of Global Value Chains for Trade Statistics and Trade Policy|The last three decades saw the creation and intensification of global value chains due to changed business models. Today, the production of final goods often requires performing several tasks across countries. This chapter describes the factors that have led to “trade in tasks” and explains the biases of traditional trade statistics in depicting this new trade reality. Approaches to correct these biases by estimating trade in value added are described with their respective statistical challenges. Changing the perspective from a “gross” reporting to a “value added” angle has implications on trade indicators. Some common considerations are revisited, such as the importance of services, interpretation of trade balance, export competitiveness, and risks associated with increased interdependencies between economies. Traditional rules and principles may also be put into question. The chapter concludes with some directions for trade policy to foster participation in global value chains.
F19|OECD Inter-Country Input–Output Model and Policy Implications|The inter-country input–output model has regained attention from various policy areas with increased participation of countries in the global production networks. The conventional analytical framework, based on a single country database, is not sufficient to perform effective empirical analyses, since economic integration with neighboring countries have increased the magnitude of international spillover and feedback effects. This chapter discusses the statistical challenges based on the experience of developing the OECD inter-country input–output model.
F19|An Alternative Measurement for International Fragmentation of the Production Process: An International Input–Output Approach|This chapter investigates the possibility of constructing an alternative measurement for analyzing the international fragmentation of the production process. It asserts that current usage of relevant information, whether trade shares of parts and components or the index of vertical specialization, is unsatisfactory for measuring the phenomenon, since they critically lack an overall perspective of the entire structure of production chains. A new measurement is formulated that captures every aspect of the vertical sequence of production linkages. It is based on the input–output model of average propagation lengths, which shows the average number of production stages that are passed through for an exogenous change in one industry to affect another. By applying this model to the Asian International Input–Output data, we are able to measure the international dimension of production sharing and division of labor in East Asia.
F19|Share of Imports and Commodities in Consumption and Investment in the United States|We use input–output data to compute the share of imports and commodities in personal consumption and fixed investment in the United States (US). We show that for the US, a large high-income economy, the shares of local content and of non-commodity content are rather small in categories that are not directly related to commodities or imported goods. Overall, about 82% of expenditures by US consumers go to goods that are made entirely domestically and from domestic imports. Our measures represent an upper bound on the computed shares of imports from a specific region, because we use a conventional, rather than a value added, measure of trade flows.
F19|Domestic Value Chains in the People's Republic of China and Their Linkages with the Global Economy|Attempts to understand the role of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in global value chains often note the case study of Apple's supply chain, in particular the fact that the PRC contributes no more than 4% of the value added in the production of the iPhone. However, the PRC's share in total induced value added in exports of final products shipped to the United States was more than 75% in 2005. This leads us to investigate how the PRC's value added is created and distributed not only internationally but also domestically. This chapter focuses on measuring domestic value chains (DVCs) in the PRC and their linkages with global markets. By using interregional input–output tables, we can understand structural changes in domestic trade in value added, as well as the position and degree of participation of different regions within the DVCs. We also use our measurements to discuss the PRC's regional economic performance and policy orientation.
F19|The “Fox–Apple” Partnership in the Global Value Chain: How Did Foreign Direct Investment and Contract Manufacturing Reshape the Landscape of the Electronics Industry?|Mirroring the notion of Wintel, we have coined the term Fox–Apple to describe the “alliance” between Foxconn Technology Group, a contract manufacturer headquartered in Taipei, China, and Apple Inc., an American technology company. Within the global electronics industry, the relationship between these two companies is so important that its formation has reshaped the landscape of the industry over the past decade. This relationship is also very typical in the sense that it reflects the characteristics of an emerging new global value chain in electronics. By examining the emergence and expansion of the Fox–Apple partnership, this chapter tries to explore the latest pattern of global production and shed light on the following two questions: What are the new, salient features of global production networks? How have foreign direct investment (FDI) and other modes of multinational companies' international operation (particularly contract manufacturing) led to these features? It proposes a theoretical hypothesis based on ownership, location, and externalization (OLE) advantages for understanding firms' strategic choice between FDI and international outsourcing.
F19|A Two Sector Endogenous Growth Model with Two Accumulating Factors- Implementing Trade|This paper is about trade in an endogenous growth model with accumulation of physical and human capital. The convergence to the ray of steady states is proved for two different development stages of similar small countries. Free trade benefits the education sector of a relatively less developed country and thus stimulates the human capital accumulation. Whereas a technological more developed country declines in favour of the world market.\\ Only if the small country is relatively less developed then there is a convergence to the balanced growth path of the world market and the country improves its situation. Without any trade policy a less developed country will lose necessary factors of production. A more developed country deals with stagnation or even fluctuation of its development stage.
F19|China’s Strategies in Economic Diplomacy: A Survey of Updated Lessons for Africa, the West and China|The Washington consensus, the hitherto dominant scheme is being encroached by the Beijing model. Many African nations are increasingly embracing this Beijing approach because the dominant Western model has failed to deliver on a number of fronts. This is increasingly evident because China’s economic diplomacy has been politely and strategically coined to achieve just that. A case study is used here to articulate the currents of the survey. The paper puts some structure on China’s economic diplomatic strategies and discusses lessons for Africa, China and the West. It contributes to existing literature by critically engaging on why it is necessary for the West to adjust the conception and definition of the Washington Consensus as a complement to the Beijing model. In order to remain relevant in the 21st century and beyond, the Washington consensus can incorporate the Moyo (2013) conjecture which postulates that, while the Beijing model is optimal in the short-run, the Washington Consensus remains the optimal long-term development model because it is more inclusive.
F19|Sino-African relations: a review and reconciliation of dominant schools of thought|We review about 100 papers on Sino-African relations published during the past 5 years for the most part, in order to put some structure on the existing strands. The literature is classified into dominant schools of thought, namely the: neocolonial or pessimistic; balance-development or optimistic and accommodation schools. After the classification, we reconcile the schools of thought in light of dominant themes and debates on development models, inter alia: (1) pessimists versus (vs) optimists; (2) preferences of rights in development models (economic vs political, national vs human & sovereign vs idiosyncratic); (3) the Washington Consensus vs the Beijing Model and; (4) an African Consensus in both the Washington Consensus and Beijing Model. Both the first and second schools have core values articulated by the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD).
F19|Technological Changes and Global Value Chains|This paper focuses on the pattern of task and income distribution within a Global Value Chain. Using the recently developed WIOD database, collecting data on the trade in value added within a world Input/Output matrix, we reveal a high heterogeneity of countries in terms of their trends of skill premia. The latter is a stylized fact at odds with the assumption of a recent theoretical model of Global Value Chains (Costinot et al. [2013]), which we extend by allowing for different types of labor and different types of production stages. The model generates a pattern of vertical specialization in which the position of each country in the chain is a function of two factors: its productivity and skill intensity of its labor endowments. Moreover, the wage of each labor type depends on the position of the country, its skill intensity and productivity of skilled workers. As a result, depending on the model parameters and labor endowments, technological innovations will induce various trends in the relative position of countries, prices, wages and exports, in line with the stylized fact. The model thus represents a suitable candidate for addressing the heterogeneity of countries in terms of skill premia.
F19|The survey on international freight rates in Italy: methods and results|The paper describes the methodology and the main results of the sample survey on international merchandise transport that the Bank of Italy has carried out since 1999, with a reconstruction of the aggregate time series to 1989. We have obtained information on the different transport modes from several sources and used interviews with operators to estimate freight rates according to the structure of the reference market. Foreign and Italian transportersï¿½ market shares of import and export volumes are estimated on the basis of the sample data and administrative records. We then break down foreign trade data by transport mode to take account of the structural overestimation of road haulage. We perform a quantitative analysis of the possible determinants of freight rates and compare the results with those available in the literature. The relationship between trade flows, transport distance and costs is estimated using a gravitational model
F19|The Relationship Between Export Status And Productivity In Services: A Firm-Level Analysis For Spain|" type=""main""> This paper analyses the relationship between export status and productivity in a major service exporter, Spain, during 2001–07. I find that exporters in the services sector are 45 percent more productive than non-exporters. This productivity premium is larger for firms that supply non-internet-related services than for firms that supply internet-related services. The results show that exporters were more productive than non-exporters before beginning to export, and also that exporting increases productivity growth; however, this positive shock vanishes quickly."
F19|Trading Effects of the FIFA World Cup|" type=""main""> This study analyzes the trading effects of FIFA World Cup in two dimensions. First, we show that participating in the World Cup significantly increases exports from the participant countries to the host countries, relative to a control group of non-participants. Second, we demonstrate that trade is reasonably higher for host-participant pairs compared to other country pairs. We also provide dynamic estimates for both cases and offer plausible arguments and important channels for our findings."
F19|Town Twinning and German City Growth| Brakman S., Garretsen H. and Oumer A. Town twinning and German city growth, Regional Studies. After the Second World War, town twinning became popular, notably in Germany. This was mainly a reaction to the war experience, and it was initially aimed at creating renewed international understanding and cooperation between former enemies. It also reduced transaction costs. The results show that counties that engage in town twinning grow faster than cities that do not have twinning partners. In particular, both the number and the intensity of twinning relations as well as town twinning with French cities positively affect city growth. Positive population growth effects of town twinning are also mostly confined to the larger German cities.
F19|Romanian Textile Industry And Its Competitive Advantage|Globalization has set up a new era of international trade flows and implicitly international competition. This is best understood by analyzing the rise and fall within certain industries. The Global Value Chains (GVC) framework has emerged from its theoretical origins to become a major paradigm used by several international organizations. A detailed scrutiny of GVC highlightsthe manner in which new patterns of production, international trade and employment shape prospects for development and competitiveness.The purpose of the article is to address the important role of the textile sector in national economy development. Firstly, the paper addresses the presentation of textile industry at global, European and national level. Then, it presents a competitiveness sectorial approach and the analysis of innovation in textile industry.Finally, it is presented the value chain for the textile industry in Romania.
F19|Los países del tercer mundo frente a la crisis europea|Resumen El objetivo de este documento es determinar los canales de transmisión de la crisis europea hacia los países del Tercer Mundo. El trabajo examina la forma en que la crisis de la deuda soberana se propagó por el sector financiero, a través de la mayor volatilidad de la rentabilidad de los activos. Lo cual se debió a una mayor variación de sus precios, lo que tuvo efectos sobre el patrimonio neto de los agentes económicos, los ingresos, la demanda agregada y la asignación del crédito, así como también sobre la producción y el empleo. Para este documento se hizo búsqueda y selección de literatura especializada y se extrajeron estadísticas especializadas de la UNCTAD, CEPAL y OECD. Se concluye que la transmisión de la crisis europea al Tercer Mundo se dio por canales específicos conocidos, como el comercio internacional, la inversión extranjera directa, las remesas y la ayuda oficial para el desarrollo.
F19|Domestic Institutions as a Source of Comparative Advantage|Domestic institutions can have profound effects on international trade. This chapter reviews the theoretical and empirical underpinnings of this insight. Particular attention is paid to contracting institutions and to comparative advantage, where the bulk of the research has been concentrated. We also consider the reverse causation running from comparative advantage to domestic institutions.
F19|The global arms trade network 1950–2007|Using SIPRI data on all international transfers of major conventional weapons 1950–2007, we study the relationship between differences in polity and arms trade. To study whether states tend to trade arms within their political vicinity we estimate gravity models of the likelihood of trade at the bilateral level and study the evolution of the global network over time. We find a stable negative relationship between differences in polity and the likelihood of arms trade for the duration of the Cold War, but not in recent years. In line with these results, the global arms trade network changes drastically over the sample period in several respects: it grows more dense, clustered and decentralized over time. The differences between the NATO and Warsaw Pact sub-networks that we find corroborate the common perception that the Warsaw Pact was more strongly centralized around the USSR than NATO around the UK, the US and France.
F19|Effects of presidents’ characteristics on internationalization of small and medium firms in Japan|Recent heterogeneous-firm models of international trade suggest that productivity determines whether firms engage in export activity and foreign direct investment. In practice, however, many productive firms are not internationalized, whereas many unproductive firms are, which suggests that there are factors other than productivity that influence firms’ internationalization. This study uses a unique panel data set for Japanese small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to examine whether the personal characteristics of a firm’s president are factors in firm internationalization. We find that SMEs with a risk-tolerant, forward-looking president are more likely to be internationalized. These effects are large in magnitude, as is the productivity effect, which provides a partial explanation as to why many productive firms are not internationalized. In addition, we find that productivity has an insignificant effect on firms exiting export markets, whereas presidential myopia increases the probability of exit. The evidence further suggests that a firm’s initial export costs become sunk following its entry into export markets, which explains why many unproductive firms are internationalized.
F19|Relatedness and Diversification in the EU-27 and ENP countries|This paper analyzes the process of industrial diversification in the EU-27 and ENP countries in the period 1995-2010 by means of world trade data derived from the BACI database (elaborated UN Comtrade data). Our results show that in both the EU-27 and the ENP countries, the evolution of the export mix is strongly path-dependent: countries tend to keep a comparative advantage in products that are strongly related to their current productive structure, and they also diversify in nearby products. However, this effect is much stronger for ENP countries, signalling their lower capabilities to diversify in products that are not very near to their productive structure. We also show that the future export structures of countries are affected by their imports: both the EU-27 and ENP countries keep a comparative advantage in products that are strongly related to their imports, but only EU countries show a strong capability to diversify in new products from related import sectors. Our results also hold when controlling for geographical and institutional proximity.
F19|Institutions, Policy and Banking Sector Development: A Reassessment|This paper investigates the links between institutional quality and government policy in banking sector development, using data from 80 low-, middle- and high-income economies during 1985–2007. In order to investigate the effect of economic, political and social institutions on bank-based development, we employ dynamic panel techniques and, more specifically, the system-GMM estimator, which controls for endogeneity among variables. The results demonstrate that: i) economic institutional quality, and especially the legal dimension, is the main determinant for banking sector development; ii) social institutions have a greater impact for low- and middle-income countries, while political institutions have a greater impact for high-income countries; and iii) government policy, in terms of government size, is crucial regardless of the stage of economic development.
F19|New Evidence on Development and Cultural Trade: Diversification, Reconcentration and Domination|International trade of cultural goods has considerably increased over the last decades and has been dominated by rich countries’s exports. Meanwhile, trade in cultural goods is considered as a potential threat to cultural diversity, and development process is sometimes interpreted as a westernization process. One question arises: how does economic development impact on the cultural diversity of developing countries?This paper investigates the relationship between per capita income and the geographical diversity of cultural imports. Building on the recent literature about cultural diversity, a multi-dimensional approach is applied, taking into account the variety and the balance of cinema and music imports. The results evidence a nonlinear impact of development on the diversity of cultural imports. First, an increase in income leads to a diversification of the varieties consumed. Second, there exists a nonlinear relationship that translates into a reconcentration on a smaller number of partners in latter stage. Third, the reconcentration pattern appears to favour the share of American productsin total cultural imports.

F19|Bilateral Equivalence between Trade in Value Added and Value Added Content of Trade|This paper demonstrates that the bilateral equivalence between trade in value added (TiVA) and value added content of trade. TiVA, based on value added exports, which is proposed by Johnson-Noguera and OECD-WTO, measures origin country’s value added exports induced by each destination country’s final demand, excluding intermediates, for the world. Value added content of trade or “value added in trade (VAiT),” which is proposed by Trefler and followed by Stehrer, measures value added induced by appropriately arranged gross trade, including intermediates. At a glance, these two measures may look quite different. This paper shows that in the world with two countries and many countries these two measures of TiVA and value added content of trade are bilaterally equivalent.
F19|State Capacity and the Quality of Policies: Revisiting the Relationship between Openness and the Size of Government|The literature has identified that countries with higher levels of openness tend to present a larger government sector as a way to reduce the risks to the economy that openness entails. This paper argues that there are a number of policies that can mitigate trade-induced risks, many of which do not have the necessary implication of increasing public spending. Yet, many such policies require governmental capabilities not available to any country. For that reason, the relationship between openness and the size of government might be mediated by the quality of its public sector. While countries with weak government capabilities will tend to rely on spending expansions to deal with trade-induced volatility, countries with stronger governmental capabilities might address such challenges by more efficient and less costly means. The empirical analysis in this paper shows that the effect of openness on government consumption is mediated by the quality of government institutions.

In the article there are highlighted the main factors which influenced the world prices of meat in 2013 and perspectives for 2014. Also, it is presented the situation of main actors of the world meat market, of main producing, exporting and importing countries, for the whole year of 2013.
F19|High-techproductsexport competitiveness, bric countries in U.S market: a comparative analysis|This paper compares the competitive advantages of high technology products export from BRIC countries to the United States using quantitative (ESI and RCA index) and qualitative analyzingof export value and distribution performance. We estimate a Varying Coefficient Model on panel data for BRIC countries from 2000 to 2010, using the Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) estimator to correct cross-sectional heteroscedasticity and serial autocorrelation. We found that BRIC countries high tech products have comparative advantages. Research and Development investment and patents are significantly positively related to the high tech export of the United State market while FDI still does not directly promote the competitiveness. The BRIC countries should learn from each otherÕs successful ways concerning FDI management, patent application and research regulation to achieve better and more comprehensive improvement of high tech export competitiveness.
F19|The European Union’S Bilateral Approach|The EU is a world economic power and a major trading partner for most countries. All the time, this region has been interested and has acted towards a free and fair trade. The decrease and even the elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers in the world trade are among the main objectives of the EU strategy for international trade. At the moment, the elusive outcome of the WTO Doha Round has led to the proliferation of bilateral trade agreements worldwide. Although the EU remains committed to further development of the multilateral trading system, however, the EU still has appealed also to the development of bilateral trade relations. The aim of this paper is to illustrate the current bilateral dimension of the common commercial policy of the EU. In conclusion, to describe this bilateral approach of the EU we are using one word, namely “diversity”.
F19|Ceta - Bilateral Trade Agreement Between The Eu And Canada|The international trade for wide world countries in the means more growth, more jobs and access on more products at competitive prices. The European Union is a major economy and an important trading partner for many countries and regions in the world. To stimulate growth and to create jobs in the Union, this economy has concluded multilateral trade agreement (under the World Trade Organisation) and a number of bilateral (preferential) trade agreements. The aim of this paper is to present an example of fully elimination of tariffs and tariff lines under a bilateral trade agreement. In this case, we have analysed Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) negotiated by the European Union and Canada. For both sides of Atlantic, the CETA is supposed to bring the solution for today's issues concerning the important trading aspects and, also, to facilitate the EU-Canada bilateral trade by creating competition.
F19|Production Sharing in East Asia: Chinaâ€™s Position, Trade Pattern and Technology upgrading|International production sharing and trade fragmentation has become a key feature of East Asian economic development in recent decades. China has taken advantage of this process and has transformed into a global manufacture center within a thirty-year period. The emergence of China has led to the restructuring of the Asian production network and changed the trade pattern in the region. Firms in advanced Asian economies have relocated their production to China, using it as an assembly base and exporting their final products to the US and Europe. This paper analyzes these trends and changes in the region, studying Chinaâ€™s position in East Asiaâ€™s production sharing and trade fragmentation, as well as ascertaining how it influences Chinaâ€™s industrial and technological upgrading. We find that China has moved to the Center of East Asiaâ€™s production network and become the key partner of its neighboring countries. Chinaâ€™s manufacturing technology has significant upgraded. There is a technology convergence between China and ASEAN-4, although the gap between China and Japan and South Korea remains fairly large and noticeable.
F19|The Determinants of Food-Aid Provisions to Africa and the Developing World|We examine the supply-side and demand-side determinants of global bilateral food aid shipments between 1971 and 2008. First, we find that domestic food production in developing countries is negatively correlated with subsequent food aid receipts, suggesting that food aid receipt is partly driven by local food shortages. Interestingly, food aid from some of the largest donors is the least responsive to production shocks in recipient countries. Second, we show that U.S. food aid is partly driven by domestic production surpluses, whereas former colonial ties are an important determinant for European countries. Third, amongst recipients, former colonial ties are especially important for African countries. Finally, aid flows to countries with former colonial ties are less responsive to recipient production, especially for African countries.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

F19|Foreign Trade Pattern of Nepal: Gravity Model Approach|This study examines the overall trade pattern and flow of trade of Nepal by using pooled ordinary least square (OLS) along with one-year lag gross domestic product (GDP). It has also attempted to find the structural shift in the economy after economic liberalization in Nepal. In this study, gravity model is applied with comprehensive panel dataset for 29 years time period covering Nepal’s 94 trading partners. The results appear robust to specification, time period and trade determinants. Following a convention in this field, this study separates exports and imports instead of using total trade turnover. The empirical results are found consistent with the fundamental of gravity model as the study reveals positive coefficients for economic size and negative coefficients for distance. No significant structural break is found in the determinants of trade after economic liberalization. The results from simulation while comparing actual trade with predicted trade show that Nepal’s trade is not distorted by political decisions such as economical sanctions imposed by other countries. The results also suggest that trade with India in comparison to China is quite substantial. The results suggest that Nepal needs trade diversification in general and trade agreement with China in particular to reap the benefits from the trade.

F19|Feasibility Study on the Logistic Competitiveness of Commercial Seaports in Southern Baltic Sea Region|This paper describes a feasibility study designed to determine the competitiveness of a seaport. The content presents a wholly unique approach to the examination and evaluation of the seaport competitiveness level based on the multi-criteria assessment model of their unique logistical characteristics. The research area is limited to the selected seaports located in the Southern BSR. This is the first stage of an international research programme using multi criteria logistics capabilities analysis combined with an adaptation of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method for seaports competition level assessment. The paper also identifies unique criteria, sub-criteria and evaluated diagnostic features (parts of the logistic capabilities chart) of selected Southern Baltic Sea ports facilities taken from an analysis of the main processes and commercial profiles in the seaports of Gdansk, Gdynia, Szczecin and Swinoujscie (Poland) and Rostock, Lubeck (Germany). A specific decisionmaking model for practical assessment of the hypothesised seaport logistics potential has been proposed as well as a group of speculative ventures designed to verify the proposed solutions in subsequent field research.

F19|“Post financial crisis and exports expansion: Micro-evidence from Chilean exporters”|This paper analyzes the performance of Chilean exporting firms during the period after the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. After the crisis, world imports increased sustainably, which was used by Chilean firms in particular and the country in general. Specifically, larger firms, and those that had lower external financing needs, were benefited the most from the new international context, increasing their exports to markets that already exported before and recovering the markets they lost during the crisis. While the recovery is mainly due to the intensive margin, the present work shows that the larger firms also increased their export destinations, so that recovery takes place in the 2 types of margins. Finally, in a survival analysis, the results indicate that larger firms needed less time to regain its level of exports that have before the financial crisis.
F19|The romanian trade with dairy products – the need to increase the export potential|Although the international milk market has registered a permanent demand increase, in the analyzed period (2002-2012), the dairy products export made by Romania, have registered relatively modest values, in meeting the demand. In this period, the Romanian trade with dairy products has known an ascending trend, and, especially after the year 2007, increases were massive o imports side, but low, in comparison with those made by the main players on the international market. The method used was the comparative analysis, in the period 2000-2012, of some sets of indicatives specific for the trade with dairy products, having as source of information international reports and studies elaborated by the European Commision, the data of FAOSTAT Agriculture and EUROSTAT. From the analyses made, as a conclusion we can observe the fact that Romania is a net importer of dairy products, this category of products presenting a strongly deficit balance (in 2012, the debt trade balance for milk and dairy products was of -157552 thousand i euros, decreasing from the preceeding year by 8.2%).
F19|China’s Strategies in Economic Diplomacy: A Survey of Updated Lessons for Africa, the West and China|The Washington consensus, the hitherto dominant scheme is being encroached by the Beijing model. Many African nations are increasingly embracing this Beijing approach because the dominant Western model has failed to deliver on a number of fronts. This is increasingly evident because China’s economic diplomacy has been politely and strategically coined to achieve just that. A case study is used here to articulate the currents of the survey. The paper puts some structure on China’s economic diplomatic strategies and discusses lessons for Africa, China and the West. It contributes to existing literature by critically engaging on why it is necessary for the West to adjust the conception and definition of the Washington Consensus as a complement to the Beijing model. In order to remain relevant in the 21st century and beyond, the Washington consensus can incorporate the Moyo (2013) conjecture which postulates that, while the Beijing model is optimal in the short-run, the Washington Consensus remains the optimal long-term development model because it is more inclusive.
F19|Sino-African relations: a review and reconciliation of dominant schools of thought|We review about 100 papers on Sino-African relations published during the past 5 years for the most part, in order to put some structure on the existing strands. The literature is classified into dominant schools of thought, namely the: neocolonial or pessimistic; balance-development or optimistic and accommodation schools. After the classification, we reconcile the schools of thought in light of dominant themes and debates on development models, inter alia: (1) pessimists versus (vs) optimists; (2) preferences of rights in development models (economic vs political, national vs human & sovereign vs idiosyncratic); (3) the Washington Consensus vs the Beijing Model and; (4) an African Consensus in both the Washington Consensus and Beijing Model. Both the first and second schools have core values articulated by the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD).
F19|The Progress of Paperless Trade in Asia and the Pacific: Enabling International Supply Chain Integration|This paper discusses on how to facilitate paperless trade for international supply chain integration in the Asia and Pacific region. The paper defines paperless trade and describes how paperless trade can improve efficiency of international supply chain, including its economic benefits. Based on the review of paperless trade initiatives and assessment of paperless trade readiness of countries in the Asia and Pacific region, the paper identifies five critical challenges in facilitating cross-border paperless trade: use of common international standards, harmonization of different legal frameworks, capacity gaps among the parties, cooperation between the public and private sectors, and lack of coordination mechanisms for cross-border data exchanges. For each challenge, the paper describes its nature and possible measures for alleviating it. In its annexes, the paper also provides implementation cases of cross-border paperless trade in the Asia and Pacific region, namely Pan Asian e-Commerce Alliance (PAA) and electronic Certificate of Origin between the Republic of Korea and Taipei,China.
F19|Redistribution Effects Resulting from Cross-Border Cooperation in Support for Renewable Energy|It has been shown that international cooperation in achieving renewable energy targets, e.g., via a common tradable green certi ficate market, increases overall welfare. However, cooperation in the support of electricity from renewable energy sources also leads to regional price effects, from which some groups benefit while others lose. On a regional level, the introduction of cross-border cooperation in RES-E support generally has an opposite effect on support expenditures and wholesale electricity prices, as long as grid congestion between the diff erent regions exists. In this paper, a theoretical model is used to analyze under which conditions different groups benefi t or suff er from the introduction of cooperation. Findings of the analysis include that eff ects on consumers and total producers per country can only be clearly determined if no grid congestions between the countries exist. If bottlenecks in the transmission system exist, the relationship between the slopes of the renewable and the non-renewable marginal generation cost curves for electricity generation as well as the level of the RES-E target essentially determine whether these groups benefi t or lose from the introduction of green certi ficate trading. In contrast, system-wide welfare always increases once cooperation in RES-E support is introduced. Similarly, welfare on the country level always increases (compared to a situation without RES-E cooperation) if the countries are perfectly or not at all physically interconnected. In the case of congested interconnectors, each country always at least potentially benefi ts from the introduction of certi ficate trade, taking into account possible distributions of congestion rents between the countries.
F19|Who Benefits from Cooperation? - A Numerical Analysis of Redistribution Effects Resulting from Cooperation in European RES-E Support|This paper numerically analyzes redistribution effects resulting from cooperation among European countries in achieving the 2020 targets for electricity generation from renewable energy sources (RES-E). The quantification of redistribution effects builds on the theoretical analysis by Unteutsch (2014), who shows that cooperation in RES-E support increases overall welfare but is not beneficial for all groups. In this paper, we use a dynamic investment and dispatch optimization model of the European electricity system to investigate which groups potentially benefit from cooperation and which groups would be worse off compared to a situation in which national RES-E targets are reached solely by domestic RES-E production. In the analysis, cooperation in RES-E support is implemented as a European-wide green certificate trading scheme. Main findings of the analysis include that in the European electricity system, effects of the change in the certificate price in most countries would overcompensate for the effects of the change in the wholesale electricity price. Thus, in most countries with comparatively high (low) generation costs for renewable energies, consumer rents increase (decrease) due to cooperation and producers yield lower (higher) profits. In addition, it is found that the magnitude of redistribution effects between the individual groups is quite large: In some countries, the change in consumer rents or producer profits resulting from cooperation is nearly twice as high as the overall welfare effect of cooperation in the whole European electricity system. Moreover, we find that the sign, but not always the magnitude, of redistribution effects is quite robust to different developments of interconnector extensions, the CO2 price and RES-E investment costs.
F19|Foreign Investment and Vertical Specialisation: An Analysis of Emerging Trends in Chinese Exports|This paper contributes to the literature on the role of foreign direct investment and vertical specialisation in China?s growth trajectory. Globalisation of the world economy, together with well-developed physical infrastructure, and falling costs of transport and communications, has led to a significant increase in foreign investment into China to take advantage of its comparative advantage in labour intensive activities. Initially foreign investment came to simple assembly line (such as textile, clothing, electronic goods), but gradually China attracted FDI to sophisticated manufacturing industries (such as, ICT products, office and medical equipments etc), giving rise to vertical specialisation in its exports. Over one quarter of Chinese exports appears to be due to the expansion of back-and?forth transactions in vertically fragmented cross-border production process. Our analysis suggests that foreign input content in Chinese exports is high and rising. When the share of ?foreign value-added? in Chinese exports is taken into account the ?actual trade balance? is much lower than what ?raw trade balance? would indicate.As expected, share of foreign input content (vertical specialization) is high in Chinese exports of high-tech industries (such as, communications equipment, computers and other electronic equipment manufacturing etc) and low in labor-intensive industries such as (food and tobacco, textile, leather products, footwear etc). China?s increased involvement in global production network as an assembly centre has created an opportunity for other countries and countries in the region to benefit from its rapid integration with the world economy as its imports of parts and components have grown dramatically and most of these imports come from advanced economies such as US, Europe and newly industrialised economy. Clearly, China?s success story has led to win-win situation, improving welfare globally. As China is committed to continue to integrate with the world economy, its involvement in processing trade will continue. However, China will require to upgrade skills of its workforce through appropriate human capital development policy, otherwise higher wages (for semi-skilled workers) can wipe out its comparative advantage in low-end assembly trade brought about by globalisation. Policy makers in China should also need to think carefully how to embark on industrial upgrading to sustain growth.
F19|Development And Problems Of Tangible Fixed Assets (TFA) Of Cooperative Retail Trade|The commercial activities carried out by consumers’ cooperatives are conducive to satisfying the needs of a considerable part of the population with the necessary goods and services. As a relatively autonomous economic system in cooperative trade, the cooperative commercial network is an integral part of the commercial network of the country, of retail trade, of domestic trade and of the entire process of stock turnover. The present article is aimed at tracing and analyzing the development and the issues of tangible fixed assets (TFA) of cooperative retail trade in Bulgaria for the period 2003-2012 (including the development in the number of owned and operated outlets, the amount of the invested funds and the development of the outlets of the retail chain Coop ) and, based on the conducted analysis, drawing some prospects for its development.
F19|Why liquidity matters to the export decision of the firm|Under financial constraints, exporting may have less to do with productivity and more to do with financial resources. The established relationship between exporting and productivity would differ when examined through the lens of the working capital needs of the firm. I approach the hypothesis that working capital matters in the firm's exporting decision in two ways: first, by articulating a dynamic working capital model of the firm that incorporates the firm's export decision. Secondly, by testing the hypothesis empirically using a unique firm level dataset from Bangladesh, where issues of financial constraints are particularly acute. The model shows that productivity determines export status of the firm as long as it is not under financial constraints. However, under financial constraints, export status is less dependent on productivity and more dependent on the availability of working capital. Empirical results support the model's prediction. The relationship between exporting time and the need for greater liquidity is also borne out empirically as shown by a positive and significant correlation between the amount of working capital and the distance of export destination. An important policy implication from the analysis is that short term liquidity is critical in allowing productive firms to export and that access to finance may prevent the benefits of trade liberalization within a country to be fully realized.
F19|Does the Home Bias Explain Missing Trade in Factors?|Abstract It is now widely accepted that when controlling for international differences in production techniques, the predictions from the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek (HOV) theorem are largely satisfied. However, a large amount of ‘missing trade’ remains. This paper makes two main contributions Firstly, the HOV is tested for various production factors including labour by educational attainment levels (high, medium, low) and capital. Secondly, the paper allows for a more general structure of final consumption in the HOV framework with technology differences, which reduces the amount of missing trade. We test for the effects of non-homothetic preferences, home bias of consumption and the role of distance at the country and industry level. We discuss how this can be tackled in the analytical framework both for a country’s total exports but also in a bilateral way. Results are shown both for total trade and bilateral trade. Empirically we draw on the recently released World Input-Output Database (WIOD) and show the extent of reductions in ‘missing trade’ caused by the various assumptions and restrictions on demand structures.
F19|Competitive Advantage in Tourism of Southeast Asian Countries|The competitive advantage in tourism of the countries in Southeast Asia was assessed by using coverage ratio and revealed comparative advantage (RCA). Static and dynamic analyses were applied to the data of tourism services export during 2002-2010. The results show that Cambodia, Laos PDR, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam had competitive advantages, i.e. these countries gain the surpluses more than that of the region’s. Thailand had the highest specialization in Southeast Asia but declining. Malaysia had the highest specialization growth rate followed by Cambodia and Singapore. The tourism export of these three countries declined but at a slower rate than that of the whole region. Thailand as the regional leader in tourism should forge a stronger partnership in tourism with Southeast Asian countries. It should also enhance market promotion in the region.
F19|The economic consequences of China--Africa relations: debunking myths in the debate| This study dissects with great acuteness some of the big questions on China--Africa relations in order to debunk burgeoning myths surrounding the nexus. It reviews a wealth of recent literature and presents the debate in three schools of thought. No substantial empirical evidence is found to back up sinister prophesies of coming catastrophe from critics of the direction of China--Africa relations. In the mean, the relationship from an economic standpoint is promising and encouraging but more needs to be done regarding multilateral relations, improvement of institutions, and sustainability of resources management. A number of positive signs suggest that China is heading toward the direction which would provide openings for a multipolar dialog. While benefiting in the short run, African governments have the capacity to tailor this relationship and address some socio-economic matters arising that may negatively affect the nexus in the long term. Policy implications are discussed.
F19|Regulatory Protection When Firms Decide First on Technical Collaboration and R&D|We investigate the imposition of a horizontal technical barrier to trade (HTBT) in a symmetric, cross-hauling duopoly. Tariffs and subsidies are ruled out, but, in the absence of a mutual recognition agreement, it is possible for governments to impose HTBTs, so long as firms apply different technologies. If firms are first movers, this possibility may induce them to avoid technical collaboration, in order to tempt governments into creating national monopolies, except where spillovers and R&D effects are high. This exacerbates the costs of regulatory protection, compared to standard models without R&D or spillovers.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

F19|Profundización, apertura y cierre de mercados de exportación a nivel sectorial en Colombia:|Resumen: En este trabajo se explora, desde el punto de vista empírico, el comportamiento de la profundización, apertura y cierre de mercados de exportación a nivel sectorial para Colombia durante el periodo 1997-2010, con énfasis en los dos periodos de recesión que presenta la economía durante el mismo. Para ello se emplea una metodología de descomposición de los cambios registrados por el comercio, en sus márgenes intensivo y extensivo, que permite la identificación de estos fenómenos y su observación tanto a lo largo del tiempo como a nivel transversal. Los resultados indican que, en el corto plazo, el margen intensivo del comercio explica la mayor parte de las variaciones en las exportaciones, en tanto que en el mediano plazo se encuentra una importante contribución del margen extensivo a éstas. Adicionalmente, desde el punto de vista sectorial, la crisis de 1997-1999 no presenta un patrón homogéneo en términos del comportamiento de los márgenes del comercio, en tanto que la de 2008-2009 se caracteriza por presentar un patrón más homogéneo a través de los distintos sectores de la actividad económica.Abstract: We explore, from an empirical perspective, the behavior of export markets opening, deepening, and closing at the sectoral level, during 1997-2010 for the case of Colombia, with an emphasis on the two recessions that the economy suffered during this time. For this, we use a trade decomposition technique that allows us to measure each of these market events and trace its behavior along time as well as in the cross-section. Results indicate that, in the short term, the intensive margin of trade largely determines the behavior of exports, while in the medium run an important role is played by the extensive margin. Furthermore, from a sectoral perspective, during the 1997-1999 crisis no uniform pattern is found for the trade margins, while during the 2008-2009 crisis a notoriously homogenous pattern emerges across sectors.
F19|The Causal Relationship between Trade and FDI : Implication for India and East Asian Countries|This study tries to find the causal relationship between bilateral trade and FDI in India and East Asian countries using macroeconomic data and derive policy implications for regional integration. Since the late 2000s, Korea, Japan and Singaporeâ€™s trade and FDI with India have been rapidly increasing, but the causal relationship between trade and FDI could not be found, contrary to expectations. The relationship between trade and FDI in the US, the UK and Germany with India showed one-way or two-way causality, respectively. The estimation suggests that the causal relationship between trade and FDI in both countries could be formed by long-term economic exchange rather than a short-term surge in scale.
F19|"The structural determinants of the US competitiveness in the last decades: a ""trade-revealing"" analysis"|"We analyze the decline in the U.S. share of world merchandise exports against the backdrop of a model-based measure of competitiveness. We preliminarily use constant market share analysis and gravity estimations to show that the majority of the decline in export shares can be associated with a declining share of world income, suggesting that the dismal performance of the U.S. market share is not a sufficient statistic for competitiveness. We then derive a computable measure of country-sector specific real marginal costs (i.e. competitiveness) which, insofar it is inferred from actual trade ows, is referred to as 'revealed'. Brought to the data, this measure reveals that most U.S. manufacturing industries are losing momentum relative to their main competitors, as we find U.S. revealed marginal costs to grow by more than 38% on average. At the sectoral level, the ""Machinery"" industry is the most critical. JEL Classification: F12, F17, F19"
F19|Comparative Advantage of Leather Industry in Pakistan with Selected Asian Economies|The aim of this paper is to analyze the trade specialization in the leather products between some selected Asian economies, with particular focus on Pakistan. For which, a measure of Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA Balassa Index) is used. The analysis shows that Pakistan has a high comparative advantage in leather products over all the selected economies during the period of study. The paper highlights the problems faced by the leather industry and identifies some immediate policy action to be taken to improve the performance of the leather industry in the light of evidence.
F19|An optimal production method for penetrating foreign markets: Standardization, localization, and flexible technology|This paper examines firms' production strategies for supplying products tailored to the target country's local taste: developing a new localized variety and modifying an existing variety to fit the local taste. Adopting the concept of the flexible technology in industrial organization theory, the paper develops a simple theoretical model to examine when and why exporters or multinationals adopt flexible technologies to serve multiple markets. The results suggest that firms with basic varieties that are considerably different from the variety demanded by the local country are likely to develop localized varieties to serve the country, whereas those with basic varieties that are considerably similar to the demanded variety are likely to modify their existing varieties. In some circumstances, even when foreign production has an intrinsic cost advantage over exporting before the application of a flexible technology, firms may choose to be exporters by adopting the technology. In addition, the results indicate a possible industry equilibrium: Firms with basic varieties that are considerably similar to the variety demanded by the local country are likely to modify them and become multinationals, whereas those with basic varieties that are considerably different from the demanded variety are likely to develop new localized products and become multinationals. Otherwise, firms are likely to modify their existing platforms and become exporters.
F19|Value added content of trade: A comprehensive approach|This letter provides an approach to decompose the value added content of trade into foreign and domestic components when intermediates are traded. The measure adds to the existing literature by considering both exports and imports simultaneously. In this way this approach generalizes the commonly applied vertical specialization measures based on exports only which are encompassed.
F19|Trade Elasticity Parameters for a Computable General Equilibrium Model|Computable general equilibrium (CGE) models of international trade typically rely on econometrically estimated trade elasticities as model inputs. These elasticities vary by as much as an order of magnitude and there is no consensus on which elasticities to use. We review the literature estimating trade elasticities, focusing on several key considerations. What are the identifying assumptions used to separate supply and demand parameters? What is the nature of the shock to prices employed in the econometrics? And what is the time horizon over which trade responds to this shock? This discussion ranges from older reduced form approaches that use time-series variation in prices, to more recent work that identifies demand elasticities from trade costs or by using instruments in cross-section or panel data, and finally to prominent applications that separately identify supply and demand parameters in the absence of instruments. We also discuss recent theoretical developments from the literature on heterogeneous firms that complicate the interpretation of all these parameter estimates. Finally, we briefly survey a literature on structural estimation and link this to recent attempts to incorporate such theories in CGE applications. By elucidating the differences and similarities in these approaches we hope to guide the CGE practitioner in choosing elasticity estimates. We favor elasticities taken from econometric exercises that employ identifying assumptions and exploit shocks that are similar in nature to those imposed in the model experiment.
