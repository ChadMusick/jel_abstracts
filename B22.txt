B22|Phillips' averaging procedure as a 'crude' version of the Haar wavelet filter|The aim of this study is to investigate the exact nature of Phillips' (1958) findings. We show that the application of the simplest type of wavelet basis function developed by Haar in 1910 allows to replicate the output of Phillips' data transformation procedure, i.e. the six mean coordinates. Specifically, the resemblance between the coarsest scale level coefficients from the Haar wavelet filter and the six crosses suggests the long-term nature of Phillips' (wage-unemployment) relationship. The application of the Haar wavelet filter allows us to examine the effects of two main features of Phillips' 'unorthodox' averaging procedure: the arbitrarily choice of variable-width intervals and the choice of sorting observations in ascending order of unemployment rate values. Our results show that the arbitrary selection of intervals affects only the smoothness (regularity) of the nonlinear pattern of the wage-unemployment relationship, but not its shape which is determined by sorting and grouping unemployment rate values in ascending order. Indeed, when observations are ordered according to a chronological sequence a simple linear relationship is evident. These findings are robust to different samples, 1861-1913 and 1861-1958.
B22|Publish and Perish: Creative Destruction and Macroeconomic Theory|A number of macroeconomic theories, very popular in the 1980s, seem to have completely disappeared and been replaced by the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) approach. We will argue that this replacement is due to a tacit agreement on a number of assumptions, previously seen as mutually exclusive, and not due to a settlement by ‘nature’. As opposed to econometrics and microeconomics and despite massive progress in the access to data and the use of statistical software, macroeconomic theory appears not to be a cumulative science so far. Observational equivalence of different models and the problem of identification of parameters of the models persist as will be highlighted by examining two examples: one in growth theory and a second in testing inflation persistence.
B22|The dog that didn’t bark: the curious case of Lloyd Mints, Milton Friedman and the emergence of monetarism|Lloyd Mints has long been considered a peripheral figure in the development of monetary economics at the University of Chicago. We provide evidence showing that the standard assessment of Mints’s standing in Chicago monetary economics -- and in American monetary economics more broadly -- is mistaken. In light of the originality and the breadth of his monetary contributions, and given the degree to which those contributions shaped part of Milton Friedman’s monetary framework and were pushed forward by Friedman, we argue that, far from being a peripheral figure in the development of Chicago monetary economics, Mints played a catalytic role.
B22|How economics forgot power|The article discusses a recent book publication by Philip Pilkington, in which an interesting and novel reconceptualizing of the investment (accumulation) process and economic growth is proposed. The gaze and critique through which the book is examined underlines certain theoretical similarities found in the Latin American economic discourse during the 1950´s, denominated as “Latin American structuralism”, in Anglo Saxon or European academia. Central to its perspective is the examination of economic formations and its agents as a configuration of power asymmetries.

B22|Macroeconomic Dynamics at the Cowles Commission from the 1930s to the 1950s|Jacob Marschak shaped the emergence of monetary theory and portfolio choice at the Cowles Commission (which he directed from 1943 to 1948, but with which he was involved already from 1937) at the University of Chicago, where he was the doctoral teacher of Leonid Hurwicz, Harry Markowitz and Don Patinkin, and then from 1955 at the Cowles Foundation at Yale University, where he was a senior colleague of James Tobin until moving to UCLA in 1960. Marschak’s later attempts to clarify the concept of liquidity and to emphasize the role of new information for economic behavior date back as far as to his early experiences with hyperinflationary processes in the Northern Caucasus during the Russian Revolution. Marschak came to monetary theory with his 1922 Heidelberg doctoral dissertation on the quantity theory equation of exchange (published in 1924 as “Die Verkehrsgleichung”), and embedded monetary theory in a wider theory of asset market equilibrium in studies of “Money and the Theory of Assets” (1938), “Assets, Prices, and Monetary Theory” (with Helen Makower, 1938), “Role of Liquidity under Complete and Incomplete Information” (1949), “The Rationale of the Demand for Money and of ‘Money Illusion’” (1950), and “Monnaie et liquidité dans les modèles macroéconomiques et microéconomiques” (1955), as well as in Income, Employment and the Price Level (lectures Marschak gave at Chicago, edited by Fand and Markowitz, 1951). We examine Marschak’s analysis of money within a broader theory of asset market equilibrium and explore the relation of his work to the monetary and portfolio theories of his doctoral students Markowitz and Patinkin and his colleague Tobin and to the revival of the quantity theory of money by Milton Friedman, a University of Chicago colleague unsympathetic to the methodology of the Cowles Commission.
B22|From Disequilibrium to Equilibrium Macroeconomics: Barro and Grossman's Trade-off between Rigor and Realism|During the 1970s, Keynesian macroeconomics was challenged by the New Classical Economics of Robert Lucas. This involved a battle between disequilibrium and equilibrium macroeconomics. My article contributes to explain why the equilibrium approach came to dominate. My case study is Robert Barro and Herschel Grossman. In 1971, Barro and Grossman elaborated the basic disequilibrium model. In 1976, they wrote the first book on disequilibrium macroeconomics – i.e., Money, Employment, and Inflation. However, at the end of the 1970s, they came to advocate for equilibrium models à la Lucas (1972, 1975). My article traces how and why
B22|Retrospectives: Lord Keynes and Mr. Say: A Proximity of Ideas|Since the publication of Keynes's General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, generations of economists have been led to believe that Say was Keynes's ultimate nemesis. By means of textual and contextual analysis, we show that Keynes and Say held similar views on several key issues, such as the possibility of aggregate-demand deficiency, the role of money in the economy, and government intervention. Our conclusion is that there are enough similarities to call into question the idea that Keynes's views were antithetical to Say's. The irony is that Keynes was not aware of these similarities. Our study sheds new light on the interpretation of Keynes's work and on his criticism of classical political economy. Moreover, it suggests that some policy implications of demand-side and supply-side frameworks overlap. Finally, the study underlines the importance of a thorough analysis of the primary sources to fully grasp the substance of Say's message.
B22|Evolving International Monetary and Financial Architecture and the Development Challenge: A Liquidity Preference Theoretical Perspective|This paper investigates the peculiar macroeconomic policy challenges faced by emerging economies in today's monetary (non)order and globalized finance. It reviews the evolution of the international monetary and financial architecture against the background of Keynes's original Bretton Woods vision, highlighting the US dollar's hegemonic status. Keynes's liquidity preference theory informs the analysis of the loss of policy space and widespread instabilities in emerging economies that are the consequence of financial hyperglobalization. While any benefits promised by mainstream promoters remain elusive, heightened vulnerabilities have emerged in the aftermath of the global crisis.
B22|Change of Monetary Regime, Contracts, and Prices: Lessons from the Great Depression, 1932-1935|In this paper I analyze the process leading to the abandonment of the gold standard in the U.S. in1933, and the devaluation of the dollar in 1934. I argue that most changes of monetary regime have an impact on contracts. In this specific case, contracts that were written in terms of gold, or “gold equivalent,” were rewritten in paper dollars. Congress did this on June 5 1933, when it abrogated the “gold clause” retroactively. The Supreme Court validated the move in February 1935. The result was a very large transfer of wealth from creditors to debtors. I use daily data on commodity prices to investigate the extent to which these policies contributed to ending deflation. I find that commodity prices reacted strongly to the announcement of policy changes, and to legal procedures involving contracts. These results are consistent with the “change in regime” hypothesis of Sargent.
B22|Introduction : Malaise dans la science économique ?<BR>[Introduction: Economics and Its Discontents]|"This is the introductive chapter to the book ""Wassily Leontief and Economics"", published in February 2019 (ENS editions). Economists produce their statements and forecasts from devices articulating abstract theories with mathematical models and statistical instruments of measurement. What is the empirical significance of these theories, models and instruments? We consider this question from the reflection of Wassily Leontief, 1973 Nobel Prize winner, on the role of mathematics and statistical analysis in economics. His perspective makes it possible to reconsider why, in economics, ""the connection does not go by itself"" between the theory and the observation, according to the expression of Alain Desrosières. We reconstruct Leontief’s methodology of economics as an empirical science. From there, we show how the input-output device paves the way to empirical and disaggregated macroeconomics."
B22|Corporate Governance Index And Its Determinants In Samsung Company|The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between Corporate Governance Index and with its dependents. This Samsung Company had been chosen as the focus of our studies. Five years of data were collected from Samsung’s annual reports and websites from the year 2014 until the year 2018. The data collected is used to calculate the descriptive analysis which will be shown in the reports. Based on our studies, the dependent variables were the Corporate Governance Index. And for the independent variables, We had chosen Return on Asset (ROA), Return On Equity (ROE), Tobin’s Q, and Altman Z as the Internal factors and for the data like GDP per capita, Unemployment rate, and Exchange rate had been chosen as the external factors. The Stepwise method is used to claiming the results for the Correlations, regression results and etc to observe the most significant with the corporate governance index. Only the unemployment rate shows the most influence on the Corporate Governance Index.
B22|Bankruptcy and Corporate Governance: The impact of firm specific factors and macroeconomic|The aim of this study is to identify the cause of scandals that faced by Malaysia Airlines Berhad (MAS) in year 2001. One of the causes of this scandals is about corporate scandals. A corporate scandal means that it is involves alleged or actual unethical behavior by people acting within or on behalf of a corporation. Many recent corporate collapses and scandals have involved false or inappropriate accounting of some sort. Besides that, this study was carried out using the secondary data which was obtained from annual report for five years that is from years 1999 until year 2003. Return on asset (ROA) has been as the dependent variable to study its relationship with the independent variables such as Return on equity (ROE), Unemployment rate, Exchange rate, corporate governance index, Tobin Q and Altman Z. The enter method was used to obtain the correlation and regression result to observe significance level of the risk with the profits. And the Altman Z data is used to identify the probability of bankruptcy in this five years because of the scandals that face by MAS. Based on the result attained, the regression result show that the company of MAS might facing the bankruptcy problem in year 2000 until 2002 where the financial performance is low. While the loan of the company is higher. This causes can refers to data of ROA, ROE and Altman Z where the data of Altman Z show that in year 2002 is lower.
B22|Tobin's Q of Honda Motor Company, Limited and its Determinants from 2013 to 2017|A firm’s market capitalization can be influenced by internal or external factors. This may be caused by and linked to corporate governance failures and the changes of macroeconomic factors. This paper attempted to investigate the internal determinants (corporate governance index, return on assets, return on equity, Altman Z) and external determinants (gross domestic product, unemployment rates and exchange rate) of Tobin’s Q and how they influence Tobin’s Q of Honda Motor Company, Limited from 2013 to 2017. The importance of corporate governance will also be delivered indirectly in this study. Ordinary Least Square analysis (OLS) was used to study the significance of independent variables towards Tobin’s Q. The findings showed that Altman Z (internal determinant) was positively significant to the Tobin’s Q ratio and influenced Tobin’s Q the most. This study also suggested the firm to focus on its corporate governance principle, which is transparency to avoid bankruptcy.
B22|Monetary Policy in Perspective Conventional Economy and Islamic Economics|This article describes the perspective of differences between monetary policy in conventional economics and Islamic economics. By using a negation approach, this study concludes that Islamic monetary policy offers an economic system that is more resistant to monetary crises because the Islamic monetary system does not use an interest rate system so that it can stabilize prices more and be able to control inflation compared to the conventional monetary system.
B22|Measuring Macroeconomic Uncertainty in Zimbabwe|What matters to economic decision-making is whether the economy has become more or less predictable. People and businesses use information around them to form judgements about what might happen in the future. The rise in uncertainty might be associated with increased concern about extreme events, skewed towards worries about bad or disastrous events. The study seeks to measure macroeconomic uncertainty in Zimbabwe, using stock market indices - industrial index and mining index - for the period 2010M1 to 2019M3. Prevalence of macroeconomic uncertainty has been traced from the stock market index trend and stock market returns volatility. The squared residuals of the GARCH(1,1) regression model proxied macroeconomic uncertainty levels. The prevalence of significant macroeconomic uncertainty has been observed, with some periods highly uncertain. The study linked periods of uncertainty to some known political, social and economic events to derive meaning. The study found that some political, social and economic events have a contributing effect on the level of macroeconomic uncertainty. Good events and policies are accompanied by low levels of uncertainty while bad events and controversial policies match with high levels of uncertainty. The study recommends that to create a good economic climate, to attract investment and boost confidence in the economy, policymakers should dwell on reducing macroeconomic uncertainty. Reducing macroeconomic uncertainty require policy consistency, policy consultations, less frequent policy changes, avoiding numerous policies, avoiding policy reversals, among other measures. The observed macroeconomic uncertainty affects proper economic decision-making and is not conducive for high levels of investment for local and international investors; companies may struggle to hire labor, and employees and corporates may delay spending and saving pattern distorted.
B22|The Past and the Future of Keynesian Economics: A Review Essay|The recently published Elgar Companion to John Maynard Keynes (2019) is a major new contribution to Keynes scholarship, with sixty-three participants contributing ninety-five distinct entries, in 632 pages of text proper. This review essay provides an overview and assessment of the character and content of the work. It does so also via consideration of the question of Keynes’s key theoretical achievements; the relation between Keynes’s thought and the main currents of subsequent Keynesian economics; Keynes’s policy sensibility vis-à-vis ‘Keynesian’ policy; and finally, the question as to what is of endur-ing validity and greatest importance in Keynes’s economics, for the future.
B22|The Wavering Economic Thought About The Link Between Education And Growth|The objective of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, it provides a balanced account of both theoretical and empirical debates on the link between education and growth since World War 2. We point out the lack of a clear-cut consensus.On the other hand, we question the traditional measurements of human capital, and assess their fit to various theoretical models of growth. Subsequently, we provide a new and arguably more appropriate proxy. Using it, we document crude correlations in line with the literature, pointing out that education may not be an appropriate instrument to accelerate growth.
B22|Macroeconomic Research, Present and Past|What is the state of macroeconomics? We answer this question by hand collecting information about the epistemological approaches, theoretical and empirical methods, and data sources used by macroeconomists in their research. During the past 40 years there has been an increasing reliance on mathematical theory, particularly DSGE models, with theory-based papers now occupying the majority of space in macro journals. This shift is mirrored by a decline in the use of empirical falsification methods testing theoretical predictions. Microeconometric techniques have displaced time series methods, and empirical papers increasingly rely on micro and proprietary data sources. We document a decline and subsequent resurgence of financial frictions appearing in macro theory. Finally, we find that topics outside of macroeconomics are studied in more than three fourths of macro field journal publications.
B22|The population question in a neoclassical growth model: A brief theory of production per capita|"This work seeks to answer the ""population question,"" i.e. the effect of population growth on production per capita. This question has lingered in economic thought for centuries and to this day two general lines of thought can be identified, which might be marked as the ""optimist"" and the ""pessimist"" view. While the optimists claim that an increase in population will - chiefly owed to concomitant specialization and technological progress - raise average production per capita, the pessimists maintain that the latter would decline as a result of resources becoming relatively more scarce. Integrating both approaches and using a neoclassical framework, this work intends to show that sustainably increasing productivity is predominantly the result of reducing too high fertility toward a lower level such that diminishing returns are outweighed by the benefits from labor division. The paper argues that the historical reduction of fertility can almost completely explain long-run development."

B22|Liquidity traps and large-scale financial crises|This paper estimates a nonlinear Threshold-VAR to investigate if a Keynesian liquidity trap due to a speculative motive was in place in the U.S. Great Depression and the recent Great Recession. We find clear evidence in favor of a breakdown of the liquidity effect after an unexpected increase in M2 in the 1921–1940 period. This evidence, which is consistent with the Keynesian view on a liquidity trap, is shown to be state contingent. In particular, it emerges only when a speculative regime identified by high realizations of the Dow Jones index is considered. A standard linear framework is shown to be ill-suited to test the hypothesis of a Keynesian liquidity trap. An investigation performed with the same data for the period 1991–2010 confirms the presence of a liquidity trap just in the speculative regime. This last result emerges significantly only when we consider the federal funds rate as the policy instrument and we model the Divisia M2 measure of liquidity.
B22|Demand regimes, financialisation and hysteresis. New Keynesian and post-Keynesian macroeconomic underpinnings of the Varieties of Capitalism|The recent integration of post-Keynesian insights into Comparative Political Economy is an exciting development. Post-Keynesian theory differs from neoclassical and Marxist theories in its analysis of the role of income distribution and of finance. It allows for wage-led demand regimes and it regards finance to be endogenously created and a source of instability. The paper contributes to the debate on the integration of demand regimes in the Varieties of Capitalism analyses. It contrasts post-Keynesian theory to the New Keynesian three equation model. It highlights that post-Keynesian theory gives prominence to the role of income distribution and allows for wage-led demand regimes; financial variables play a key role, which gives rise to endogenous instability and financial cycles (Minskyan debt cycles); economic growth is regarded as a path dependent process (with unemployment hysteresis due to wage norms) and is not anchored in a supply side equilibrium. However, PKE has so far mostly provided a normative analysis of government interventions. The ability to generate income and wealth rather than competitiveness is regarded as key criteria for a viable variety of capitalism.
B22|Bringing the helicopter to ground: a historical review of fiscal-monetary coordination to support economic growth in the 20th century|In the face of the perceived high public and private debt levels and sluggish recovery that has followed the financial crisis of 2007-08, there have been calls for greater fiscal-monetary coordination to stimulate nominal demand. Policy debates have been focused upon the inflationary expectations that may be generated by monetary financing or related policies, consistent with New Consensus Macroeconomics theoretical frameworks. Historical examples of fiscal-monetary policy coordination have been largely neglected, along with alternative theoretical views, such as post-Keynesian perspectives that emphasise uncertainty and demand rather than rational expectations. This paper begins to address this omission. First, we provide an overview of the holdings of government debt by both central banks and commercial banks as an imperfect but still informative proxy for fiscal-monetary coordination in advanced economies in the 20th century. Second, we develop a new typology of forms of fiscal-monetary coordination that includes both direct and less direct forms of monetary financing, illustrating this with case-study examples. In particular, we focus on the 1930s-1970s period when central banks and ministries of finance cooperated closely, with less independence accorded to monetary policy and greater weight attached to fiscal policy. We find a number of cases where fiscal-monetary coordination proved useful in stimulating economic growth, supporting industrial policy objectives and managing public debt without excessive inflation.
B22|The Rise and Fall of Unproductive Activities in the US Economy 1964-2015: Facts, Theory and Empirical Evidence|The general idea about unproductive labour and the associated with it activities is that they tend to expand and by expanding reduce the investible product and the growth potential of the economy, however little is known about the determinants of their movement. In this study, we take a closer look at the US unproductive labour and activities in general during the long enough 1964-2015 period. As possible determinants of the movement of unproductive activities we consider the economy-wide average rate of profit, the real interest rate and the degree of capacity utilization. The Toda Yamamoto causality tests, as well as the ARDL econometric model, lend support to the view that the unproductive expenditures and activities are determined rather than determine the above variables. Furthermore, the error correction term indicates that a long-run equilibrium relationship exists and it is attainable after the passage of not too long time.
B22|The effect of unemployment on economic growth in South Africa (1994-2016)|This study sought to investigate the trends and impact of unemployment on economic growth in South Africa using quarterly data over the period 1994Q1 to 2016Q4. The Auto Regressive Distribution Lag (ARDL) bounds test approach is applied to determine the existence of the long run linkage among the variables. The results from the ARDL model suggest that there is a long run relationship between unemployment and economic growth. The empirical results obtained confirmed that there is a negative relationship between unemployment and economic growth both in the long and short run.
B22|Dynamisation de la malédiction des ressources naturelles en Afrique sur les performances économiques : institution et guerre froide<BR>[Curse of Natural Resources and Economic Performance in Africa: Institution and Cold War]|This article articulates Acemoglu-Robinson's theory of inclusive and exclusive institutions to the theory of the effects of natural resources on the incentives of political elites to implement good institutions for development. If Africa is subject to the curse of natural resources it means that this continent has generally been organized on the basis of extractive institutions that have determined the conflicts between political elites, between border countries and between the great world powers. On this basis, this article proposes an original test over the period 1985-2010 for 30 African countries linking institutional quality to an indicator of dependence on natural resources and different control variables. The phenomenon of the curse is decreasing in Africa as we move away from the end of the Cold War.
B22|Conditions institutionnelles de la malédiction des ressources naturelles en Afrique sur les performances économiques<BR>[Institutional conditions of the natural resource curse in Africa on economic performance]|We show that if Africa is subject to the curse of natural resources it is because this continent has generally been organized since the European colonization on the basis of extractive institutions that determines the strong conflicts between the economic preferences of the political decision-makers and those of the rest of society. In particular, we show that the quality of institutions in African countries is fundamentally determined by historical factors. The main originality is that it uses as an instrumental variable, the institutional path dependence that ensures that there is a curse of natural resources only in countries where the extractive institutions of colonialism have been reproduced. We provide evidence that the overall impact of institutions and natural resource dependence on economic performance is critically dependent on past events as these determine the incentive structure and future institutional choices. The phenomenon of the curse is decreasing in Africa as we move away from the end of the Cold War.
B22|O retrospectivă analitică a contextului crizei datoriei externe a României din anii 1980<BR>[A deeper insight into the background of 1980s external debt crisis in Romania]|This study, based on more recent research, including disarchived and / or declassificated information regarding the communist period in Romania, both internally and internationally, focuses on exploring the 1980s external debt crisis context and causes, as well as the impact of internal and external factors, having as intention a reevaluation, closer to the reality, of those times state of affaires. At the beginning of the 1980s, the global economy was marked by a severe economic and financial crisis, the first on global-scale in history, felt by more than 30 developing countries as a balance of payments crisis, which resulted in the renegotiation and rescheduling of their sovereign debt. In the case of Romania, the external debt crisis triggered in 1982 has been aggravated, in an extremely severe manner, by overlapping internal vulnerabilities accumulated in previous decades with external shock caused by the major changes in the global economic, financial and geopolitical context at the end of 1979, which led to the explosive rise in interest rates on loans contracted from private commercial banks under floating interest rates, as well as the introduction of conditionalities on loans granted by international financial institutions. The study conclude that the decision of Romanian authorities to liquidate the external debt and the crisis management errors had a destructive impact on the Romanian economy, degenerated in a system crisis at the end of 1989. Many of the external debt crisis were felt also afterwards, slowing down significantly the pace of the transition to the market economy and the positioning of the country on a sustainable development trajectory.
B22|Hisbah Pemikiran Ekonomi Islam Umar Bin Khattab<BR>[Islamic Economic Islamic Thought Of Umar Bin Khattab]|This article writes about the thoughts of Islamic economic figure Umar Bin Khattab during his caliphate as the 2nd khalifah of the Rashidin Khulafah. The method used is the historical approach of Islamic economic thought through a historical method that reveals the thought of the Islamic economic figure Umar Bin Khattab in the field of Islamic economics. From the results of the analysis it can be concluded that Umar Bin Khattab during his reign, gave many brilliant ideas and ideas and established practical, technical, and operational policies for a country. In the reign of Umar Bin Khattab, the basic practices and concepts of al-Hisbah were formed even he him self became his muhtasib. Economic system that prevailed in the Umar Bin Khattab is the forerunner of the growth of Islamic economy. The economy aims to prosper and prosper society to prevent poverty.
B22|Pemikiran Ekonomi Al-Maqrizi<BR>[Al Maqrizi's Economic Thought]|This article writes about the thinking of Al-Maqrizi Islamic economic figure. The method used in the concept of money according to Al-Maqrizi is literature study. Al-Maqrizi is in the second phase in the history of Islamic economic thought, a phrase that begins to show signs of slowing innovative intellectual activities in the Islamic world. Al-Maqrizi is an Islamic economic thinker who conducts special studies on money and inflation. The socio-economic phenomenon and the effects of inflation depend on the nature of income and wealth of each group. If income is fixed or rising, but lower than the rate of inflation then the condition declines. Conversely, if their income rises higher than the rate of inflation, then their material welfare increases.
B22|Política Fiscal, Ingresos y Desigualdad en Colombia (1990-2015)<BR>[Fiscal Policy, Income And Inequality In Colombia (1990-2015)]|Due to the supported economic growth of the first decade of the 21st century, Colombia managed to reduce the levels of poverty and inequality. Nevertheless, the country continued to present one of the most inequitable economies in the world maintaining a high income concentration. In that sense, this paper aims at analyzing the fiscal policy incident in the income distribution. To that effect, the redistributive impact of the fiscal action in Colombia, Latin America and the group of country members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) were examined. Besides, a historical follow-up of the income and public expenditures behavior in Colombia was carried out from 1990 until 2015, highlighting two fundamental facts: 1) from the constitutional reform of 1991, the social public expenditure presented a remarkable growth as a response to the fiscal commitments acquired by the state and 2) the Income Tax and the Value-Added tax (VAT) have been the props on which the national tax structure has been supported. With these elements and the information supplied by the National Survey of Income and Home Expenses, there was approached the study of the distributive incident in Colombia, estimating Gini’s indicators, the income concentration, Kakwani and Reynolds-Smolensky. The results of the present investigation allow to conclude that though the Income Tax to natural people, the Value-Added Tax (VAT) and the public expenditure show a progressive behavior, their redistributive capacity is limited; that is why the Gini’s coefficient don’t present significant variations after the fiscal action.

The study focuses on the evolution of Romania's foreign trade over the past 100 years trying to highlight the main features and trends in the different stages of the Romanian economy development, covering the periods 1918-1947, 1948-1989 and 1990-2017, marked by the the interwar economy particularities, the socialist political and economic regime, and the Romania's transition to the market economy, in the context of pre-accession and integration in the European Union. The presentation of the main coordinates of Romania's trade policies precedes the foreign trade quantitative and qualitative analysis for each of the above mentioned periods.
B22|New-Structuralist Exchange-Rate Policy and the Pattern of Specialization in Latin American Countries|The present article critically examines the transmission channels between the real exchange rate and output growth adduced by the so-called New-Structuralist doctrine. It is shown that the assumptions under which the mechanisms work are highly restrictive, and hence, are generally inadequate to ex-plore the problem of economic development in Latin American peripheral countries. In view of this, the potential risks associated with a policy of devaluation are warned.
B22|Daniel Ellsberg on J.M. Keynes and F.H. Knight:Risk, Ambiguity and Uncertainty|"This paper aims to focus on the life and work of Daniel Ellsberg, with an intensive discussion on its relation to J.M. Keynes and F.H. Knight, the two great pioneers of the economics of uncertainty. Ellsberg seems to be a man in paradox. When he was young, he was an outstanding researcher at Harvard University and the RAND Corporation; at the December Meting of the Econometric Society in 1960, he presented his remarkable paper in which he successfully demonstrated what we may now call Ellsberg's paradox against the traditional expected theory a la Daniel Bernoulli and von Neumann. Although it was published with the title ""Risk, ambiguity and decision"" in the November issue of the Quarterly Journal of Economics, it was not paid due attention for a long time. It was partly because he was so preoccupied in the 1960s and onward by letting the general public know the Pentagon papers that he could virtually have no time left to engage in purely academic activities. In the 21st century, however, the times have changed in favor of Ellsberg: we can see the dramatic return of interest in decision making under ambiguity. Chapter ‡U will deal with uncertainties that are not risks. A focal point of discussion will be the similarity and difference between Keynes and Knight. Kenneth Arrow's skepticism about Knight on uncertainty will also be paid due attention. Chapter ‡V, the main part of this paper, will turn to the concept of ambiguity that was first introduced by Ellsberg. The two-color problem and the three color problem will systematically be examined by help of numerical representations. Chapter ‡W will tell us many alternative ways to solve the so-called Ellsberg paradox. Presumably, the Keynesian approach by means of interval-valued probabilities will be shown to be very simple and highly effective. In our opinion, the most amazing Ellsberg paradox lies in the fact that an accomplished economist specialized in the aversion of risk and uncertainty dared to make a personal choice to risk everything such as degrading his social status and putting him in prison for a long period. Surely, the intellectual legacy of Ellsberg seems to be an intriguing research in paradox."
B22|Utility Matters: Edmond Malinvaud and growth theory in the 1950s and 1960s|The present-day standard textbook narrative on the history of growth theory usually takes Robert Solowâ€™s 1956 contribution as a key starting point, with extensions on the savings decision (done by David Cass and Tjalling Koopmans in 1965) being the next important development. However, such account is historically misleading because it organizes past developments based on theoretical concerns. Our goal is to tell a richer story about the developments of growth theory from the 1950s to the mid 1960s, in the activity analysis literature that started before Solowâ€™s model and never had him as a central reference. We stress the role played by Edmond Malinvaud, and take his travel from the French milieu of mathematical economics to the Cowles Commission in 1950-1951 and back to France as a guiding line. The rise of turnpike theory in the end of the 1950s generated a debate on the choice criteria of growth programs, opposing the productive efficiency typical of these models to the utilitarian approach supported by Malinvaud and Koopmans. The Vatican Conference of 1963, where Koopmans presented a first version of his 1965 model, was embedded in this debate. We argue that Malinvaudâ€™s (and Koopmansâ€™s) contributions were crucial to steer the activity analysis literature towards a utilitarian analysis of growth paths.
B22|Edmond MalinvaudÂ´s Criticisms of the New Classical Economics: Restoring the Nature and the Rationale of the Old KeynesiansÂ´ Opposition|Contrarily to standard accounts of the history of macroeconomics, recent research has increasingly paid attention to the Old Keynesiansâ€™ criticisms of the New Classical Economics. In this paper, I study another study case through Edmond Malinvaudâ€™s criticisms of the New Classical Economics from the 1980s onwards. I argue that his opposition was radical in the sense that it was both multi-dimensional and systematic. I show, then, that the way he opposed reveals his own conception of macroeconomics, which owed much to the methodology and the practice of macroeconometric modeling. Finally, I suggest that the study of Malinvaudâ€™s opposition to the New Classical Economics shed light on both the nature and rationale of the Old Keynesiansâ€™.
B22|A Co-Evolutionary, Long-Term, MacroEconomic Forecast for the UK Using Demographic Projections|This paper is based around outlining and illustrating the use of a co-evolutionary method for long-term macro-economic forecasting. The paper includes economic forecasts for the UK to 2060 using a novel approach based on Multichannel Singular Spectral Analysis (MSSA). The forecasts are based on projections of the working-age population and their educational attainment, as well as building on the historic trends of these variables. The variables forecasted are Gross Domestic Product (GDP), investment and productivity, based on historic time-series dating back to 1856, and their interactions with the projected variables. Other longterm forecasts for the UK are examined and the important impact of demographic change and plateauing educational attainment is assessed. Additionally, the power of the new MSSA forecasting technique proposed here is illustrated.
B22|On the long run Phillips Curve genus|This note points out that the long run Phillips curve genus contains upward and downward sloping species as well as the vertical species. Observers have found it difficult to sight the vertical species in certain countries, in certain epochs. This difficulty could well arise from the observers having looked for the wrong species.
B22|An appraisal of Friedman's positively sloped Phillips Curve conjecture|In this paper we ask what happens in the medium-term interregnum between the domain of the short-run Phillips curve and that of the long-run effects on the natural rate of unemployment, according to Friedman's conjecture. We discuss the new classical and hysteresis alternatives to Friedman's conjecture, and some of the methodological issues involved in appraising the conjecture. A simple model, and some data, are employed in this task.
B22|Neutral Technical Progress and the Measure of Value: along the Kaldor-Kennedy line|"In this paper, I investigate the question of ""the effect of progress upon distribution"" based on the analyses of Hicks, Robinson, Harrod, Salter, Kaldor, Samuelson, and Kennedy. The paper aims to address a neglected and controversial theoretical argument on neutral technical progress related to the measure of value that preceded and then continued to the period of the Cambridge Capital Theory Controversy. I focus on Kennedy's writings and his solutions to the complications between the measure of value and technical progress. Important intuitions behind the measure of value are crucial to the formulation of neutral technical progress in both the post-Keynesian and the neoclassical-Keynesian endogenous growth models. The paper concludes with mathematical illustrations of neutral technical progress theories."
B22|The natural interest rate in OLG modelling: A rehabilitation|A simple OLG model is used to show that the natural interest rate is superior to the golden rule. This remains valid with public goods, provided these are financed in an appropriate way. In order to preserve the natural interest rate, the so-called helicopter money appears to be more appropriate than the normal credit money. Dynamic inefficiency cannot occur, if either land or neutral (helicopter) money is available as an alternative store of private wealth. Thus, the frequently proposed failure of OLG-models to satisfy the first fundamental theorem of welfare economics does not exist. The paper both generalizes and summarizes some key results from my recent book (van Suntum 2017).
B22|Economic Security and Political Governance Crisis in the Central African Republic|Nowadays the Central African Republic (CAR) is experiencing huge economic insecurity which mostly derives from the political governance crisis that the country has been continuously undergoing since its independence in 1960. This paper examines the relationship between political governance crisis and economic security in the country covering the period of 1996-2015, using two stage instrumental analysis and second order asymptotic tests. The results show that political stability and absence of violence/terrorism ,voice and accountability, proxies of political governance crisis played a different role on national income per capita, agricultural raw materials exports, agriculture value added, external balance on goods and services, food exports, food imports, foreign direct investment, GDP growth, GDP per capita growth, inflation, wage and salaried workers, industry value added, total natural resources rent and trade , proxies of economic security. The importance of sustainable political governance stability and the implementation of appropriate reforms at institutional level are a preconditions to economic security.
B22|Fragility of State in Central African Republic: An Econometric Approach to Efficiency Understanding|A fragile state contributes to the underdevelopment of the nation and its consequences can be very devastating on the stateâ€™s cohesion. Characterized by high level of corruption which lead the country to an incessant political instability and continuous presence of foreign troops . This paper used the vector autoregressive model (VAR) covering the period of 2005-2015 to examine the impact of control of corruption on fragility of state in Central African Republic (CAR). The results show that control of corruption is significant and has negative impact on fragility of state in the short run. The impulse response shows a negative impact of control of corruption in short-run but positive in long-run on fragility of state. The policies implications of this fragility are that the CAR must pursue better governance as well as in the investment choices. Unless CAR leaders and citizens recognize their own fragility, things can only get worse.
B22|Between Cash, Deposit And Bitcoin: Would We Like A Central Bank Digital Currency? Money Demand And Experimental Economics|The aim of this paper is to analyse the demand of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Using a financial portfolio approach and assuming that individual preferences and policy votes are consistent, we identify the drivers of the political consensus in favour or against such as new currency. Given three different properties of a currency – where the first two are the standard functions of medium of exchange and store of value and the third one is the less explored function of store of information – and three different existing moneys – paper currency, banking currency and cryptocurrency – if the individuals are rational but at the same time can be affected by behavioural biases – loss aversion - three different groups of individuals – respectively lovers, neutrals and haters – emerge respect to the CBDC option. Given the alternative opportunity costs of the different currencies, the CBDC issuing is more likely to occur the more the individuals likes to use a legal tender, and/or are indifferent respect to anonymity; at the same time, the probability of the CBDC introduction increases if a return can be paid on it, and/or its implementation can guarantee at least the counterparty anonymity.
B22|Cryptocurrencies, central bank digital cash, traditional money: does privacy matter?|The aim of this paper is to analyze the demand of both traditional and new media of exchange – as cryptocurrencies and central bank digital currencies – proposing a novel specification of the demand for money. In this specification, the medium of payment (MOP) has three properties: the first two are the MOP’s standard functions as a medium of exchange and as a store of value, while the third is a novel function as a store of privacy (anonymity value). The proposed framework is tested using a laboratory experiment. Our results show that anonymity matters, but less of the other two properties; at the same time, the presence of anonymity increases the overall appeal of a MOP, particularly if the individuals are risk prone; given anonymity, the sacrifice ratio between liquidity risk and opportunity cost are relatively high.
B22|Patterns of domestic and cross-border e-commerce in Spain: A gravitational model approach|This paper presents econometric evidence on the determinants of domestic and cross-border e-commerce in Spain based on BBVA anonymised data. The paper applies the gravity model of trade to explain online credit card payment flows, using all private customer transactions of BBVA for Spain.
B22|Paradise lost? A brief history of DSGE macroeconomics|Since the Global Financial Crisis, academic economists and policymakers have had to deal with uncomfortable questions about the quality of their models and the state of macroeconomics as a profession. This note offers a summary of this discussion, focusing on the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) framework and its underpinnings. This class of models reflects both theoretical advances and perennial modeling challenges. While DSGE modeling developed in times of scarce micro data and limited computational resources, it has much room for improvement given progress along these dimensions and advances in other branches of economics. Key tasks on the to-do-list for model improvement include the modeling on the financial sector, departures from the representative agent and rationality, as well as clarification of the empirical relevance of the Lucas critique. The framework is likely to remain a major research and policy tool, although its limitations call for greater robustness, validation and open recognition of uncertainty in drawing real-life quantitative conclusions.
B22|Of Gold and Paper Money|We consider the role of money as a means of payment, store of value and medium of exchange. I outline a number of quantitative and qualitative experiences of monetary management. Successful regimes have sprung up in a variety of surprising places, and been sustained with state (centralised) interventions. Although the link between state and money, and its standard of identity and account may be clear, particularly in earlier stages of economic development, the extent to which the state is widely felt to hold responsibility for ‘sound money’ is less clear in modern democracies, where there are many other public responsibilities implying ongoing trade‐offs.
B22|Lawrence R. Klein and the making of large-scale macro-econometric modeling, 1938-1955|Lawrence R. Klein was the father of macro-econometric modeling, the scientific practice that dominated macroeconomics throughout the second half of the twentieth century. Therefore, understanding how Klein developed his identity as a macro-econometrician and how he conceived and forged macro-econometric modeling at the same time, is essential to draw a clear picture of the origins and subsequent development of this scientific practice in the United States. To this aim, I focus on Klein’s early trajectory as a student of economics and as an economist (from 1938-1955), and I particularly examine the extent to which the people and institutions Klein encountered helped him shape his professional identity. Klein’s experience at places like Berkeley, MIT, Cowles, and the University of Michigan, as well as his early acquaintance with people such as Griffith Evans, Paul Samuelson, and Trygve Haavelmo were decisive in the formation of his idea on how econometrics, expert knowledge, mathematical rigor, and a specific institutional configuration should enter macro-econometric modeling. Although Klein’s identity defined some of the most important characteristics of this practice, by the end of the 1950s, macro-econometric modeling became a scientific practice independent of Klein’s enthusiasm and with a “life of its own,” ready to be further developed and adapted to specific contexts by the community of macroeconomists.
B22|The permanent-transitory confusion: Implications for tests of market efficiency and for expected inflation during turbulent and tranquil times|Even when all past and present information is known individuals usually remain uncertain about the permanence of observed variables. After reviewing the history and role of adaptive expectations and its statistical foundations in modeling this permanent-transitory confusion the paper investigates the consequences of this confusion for tests of market efficiency in the treasury bill and foreign exchange markets. A central result is that the detection of serial correlation in efficiency tests based on finite samples does not necessarily imply that markets are inefficient. The second part of the paper utilizes data on Israeli inflation expectations from the capital market to estimate the implicit speed of learning about changes in inflation and to examine the performance of adaptive expectations in tracking the evolution of those expectations during the 1985 Israeli shock stabilization as well as during the stable inflation targeting period.
B22|The History of Recent Macroeconomics Through the Lens of the Marshall-Walras Divide|According to Leijonhufvud, the development of economic theory can be compared to a decision tree, the branches of which originate in choices made about basic methodological nodes. My paper is an attempt at putting this insight into practice by reconstructing the recent history of macroeconomics on its basis. To this end, I examine whether the decision-tree framework can explain three crucial turns in the history of the field: (a) the transition from Keynesian to new classical macroeconomics triggered by Lucas; (b) the transition from the Lucas model to Kydland and Prescott’s ‘real business cycle’ modeling strategy; and (c) the transition from RBC modeling to DSGE modeling.
B22|Testing Various Forms of Consumption Function for the Romanian Economy|In the paper we propose to test various forms of the consumer function for the Romanian economy: the linear function and the consumption function constructed in the hypothesis of the present inertial phenomenon. The analysis was carried out over a period of ten years between 2008 and 2017; the data, on total income and total expenditure, allow us to assess the opportunity of estimating a linear - model; the results of the model are analyzed using: (Econometric Views 10) & (Excel 2016).
B22|Kenneth Arrow, moral obligations, and public policies|Kenneth Arrow is a founder of the social choice theory as well as a main developer of modern theories of market economies. Moral obligations and social norms are at the core of Arrow's ethical considerations to understand and overcome his well-known impossibility theorem of preference aggregation. Interestingly, he thinks that moral obligations and social norms are very important to overcome failures of market economies. Also, he proposed some interaction between public policies and evolution of social norms. Here, we can find a consistent and systematic thinking of Arrow's ethical considerations, which might be overlooked in spite of its importance. We believe that Arrow has political philosophy (or a theory of justice), which is quite useful to understand recent developments of behavioral economics and theories of non-market economies. Arrow's thought is totally different from Amartya Sen and John Rawls, which are dominant in modern theories of justice. Arrow's approach can shed some new lights on the subject of social justice.
B22|Monnaie, crédit et inflation : l'analyse de Le Bourva revisitée|Au cours des années 1970 un changement majeur est apparu dans le domaine de l'analyse macroéconomique : les thèses monétaristes sous la conduite de Milton Friedman ont pris le pas sur les thèses keynésiennes issues de la synthèse néo-classique pour affirmer à la fois le rôle majeur de la politique monétaire dans la genèse et le développement des tensions inflationnistes et, de ce fait même, la nécessité de la neutraliser en imposant l'application d'une règle visant à fixer la quantité de monnaie en circulation. Ces thèses reposent sur l'idée que l'inflation est avant tout la conséquence de l'émission excessive de monnaie par une banque centrale soumise aux desiderata de gouvernements impécunieux et, conjointement, que la quantité de monnaie en circulation est déterminée de manière exogène via le mécanisme du multiplicateur de crédit. Elles participent d'un retour, pas toujours explicite, à une dichotomie entre variables réelles et monétaires qui va marquer profondément la théorie économique devenue dominante à partir de cette période et dont les conséquences vont s'avérer dommageables pour la compréhension des événements et des moyens de politique économique susceptibles d'y faire face. Or, dès le début des années 1960, un économiste français, Jacques Le Bourva, développait, dans deux articles de la Revue Economique, une approche radicalement opposée. Il y fait état du caractère endogène de la création de monnaie, signifiant que ce sont les crédits qui font les dépôts et non l'inverse. Il énonce une théorie de l'inflation qui en fait le fruit de dérives du crédit bancaire aux entreprises rendant les déséquilibres de marché récurrents sinon cumulatifs. Cette approche est d'une étonnante actualité si l'on entend répondre aux interrogations du moment et refonder l'analyse monétaire en s'inscrivant dans la filiation de Wicksell.
B22|Growth without Expectations:The Original Sin of Neoclassical Growth Models|"Early developments of growth theory are seen widely as the result of a two-step process – the first represented by Harrod's Essay in Dynaamic Theory, and the second by Solow's 1956 model. Harrod is considered to be the first to highlight the pervasive instability in macrodynamics, which Solow showed disappeared with the inclusion of flexible-coefficient production functions. It has been recognized since that this is a misreading (Besomi 1995, 1998, Bruno and Dal-Pont Legrand 2014). Hoover and Halsmayer (2016) examined how this ""culture of misunderstanding"" guided both Solow's modelling work and his reading of Harrod. Our paper pays attention to the specific issue of the introduction of an (independent) investment function in those early growth models. Using new archival material, we examine this complex issue and show how macroeconomists of that period dealt with problems related to incorporating expectations, an a priori unavoidable step in order to build robust investment functions. Those elements were indeed discussed at length, in the early 1960s, by economists such as Sen, Samuelson and Solow as shown in his correspondence with Hahn. Our paper sheds light on some hidden foundations of growth models and examines the nature of the break Solow’s model introduced in the growth research program as initially defined by Harrod."
B22|The role of natural resources in production: Georgescu-Roegen/Daly versus Solow/Stiglitz|This paper proposes a historical and epistemological account of one of the key controversy between natural resources economics and ecological economics, lasting from early 1970s to the end of 1990s. It shows that the theoretical disagreement on the scope of the economy's dependence to natural resources, such as energy and minerals, has deep methodological roots. On one hand, Solow's and Stiglitz's works are built on a “model-based methodology”, where the model precedes and supports the conceptual foundations of the theory and in particular the assumption of “unbounded resources productivity”. On the other hand, Georgescu-Roegen's counter-assumption of “thermodynamic limits to production”, later revived by Daly, rest on a methodology of “interdisciplinary consistency” which considers thermodynamics as a relevant scientific referent for economic theory. While antagonistic, these two methodologies face similar issues regarding the conceptual foundations that arise from them, which is a source of confusion and of the difficult dialogue between paradigms
B22|Robert J. Gordon and the introduction of the natural rate hypothesis in the Keynesian framework|This article studies the dissemination of the Natural Rate of Unemployment Hypothesis (NRH) in macroeconomics during the 1970s, by studying the reaction of Robert J. Gordon to the argument of Milton Friedman (1968). In the early 1970s, Gordon displayed an empirical opposition to the NRH, arguing that the estimated parameter on expected inflation was below one, meaning that the adjustment of inflation in wages was not total. Confronting to new data and to the rise of inflation, Gordon adopted the NRH after 1973. Nevertheless the adoption anticipated any empirical proof of a parameter close to one. We explain that this conversion was due to Friedman's influence on Gordon, but also to the fact it did not prevent Gordon to support active stabilization policies. The article shows how a complex explanation of the 1960s and 1970s inflation was little by little replaced by the simpler accelerationist Phillips Curve. It enables to understand the dissemination of this particular Phillips Curve, relying on the NRH, as a process mainly led by economists close to the Keynesian framework
B22|Limits to Arbitrage and Interest Rates: a Debate Between Keynes, Hawtrey and Hicks|This paper deals with a debate between Hawtrey, Hicks and Keynes concerning the capacity of the central bank to influence the short-term and the long-term rates of interest. Both Hawtrey and Keynes considered the central bank's ability to influence short-term rates of interest. However, they do not put the same emphasis on the study of the long-term rates of interest. According to Keynes, long-term rates are influenced by future expected short-term rates (1930, 1936), whereas for Hawtrey (1932, 1937, 1938), long-term rates are more dependent on the business cycle. Short-term rates do not have much effect on long-term rates according to Hawtrey. In 1939, Hicks enters the controversy, giving credit to both Hawtrey's and Keynes's theories, and also introducing limits to the operations of arbitrage. He thus presented a nuanced view.
B22|Buchanan and public finance: The tennessee years|Abstract James Buchanan’s views on public finance have already been analyzed and they are quite well known, as are their origins and roots. However, nothing has ever been said about why Buchanan chose public finance in the first place. The first goal of this paper is to show that Buchanan had made this choice before arriving at Chicago. We show how Carlton C. Sims and Charles P. White influenced him. We also show, by analyzing Buchanan’s M.A. thesis, that he was not only interested in public finance but was also primarily concerned by ethical questions and defended a bureaucratic centralized solution to solve the problem he was discussing – how to share the benefits collected from a gasoline tax among Counties. This helps to understand that Buchanan did not choose to study public finance to learn how to fight government intervention. Quite the contrary: it was to legitimate it. Second, we also demonstrate that a lot of the ideas that will matter for Buchanan in his career – the importance of ethics and the principle of an equal treatment for equals, the need to link taxes to benefits, the importance to adapt the scale of provision of a public good to the type of public good – were already present in this first work.

B22|Le déficit budgétaire et le déficit de la balance commerciale peuvent être qualifiés de jumeaux ? Etude empirique sur le cas marocain|Dans ce travail, nous essayons de démontrer à travers l'analyse économique et économétrique que, en dépit de l'existence concomitante du déficit budgétaire et du déficit de la balance commerciale, ces deux derniers ne sont pas liés par le principe des déficits jumeaux. Le financement des dépenses publiques par le déficit budgétaire n'a pas d'impact sur le déficit de la balance commerciale via le taux d'intérêt et le taux de change. Le déficit de la balance commerciale s'explique notamment, par la structure des échanges marocains limitée à l'exportation des produits faiblement industrialisés et à l'importation des produits à haute valeur ajoutée.

B22|Peut-on parler d'un déficit budgétaire structurel et conjoncturel au Maroc ? Approche théorique et étude empirique|Le niveau du déficit budgétaire, surtout dans les périodes des crises, a toujours constitué un élément judicieux qui impacte la politique économique de chaque Etat. En effet, l'évaluation dudit déficit peut être toujours gonflée ou dégonflée par la conjoncture économique. Pour garder une image claire de l'équilibre budgétaire, les économistes stipulent qu'il faut retrancher du déficit total la partie engendrée par la conjoncture économique afin d'éviter une appréciation erronée du solde budgétaire et par conséquent une politique économique défaillante. Dans ce papier, nous démontrons à travers l'analyse économique et économétrique que la segmentation cyclique du déficit budgétaire ne donne pas des résultats solides. En effet, sur toute la période étudiée, le déficit budgétaire se trouve toujours engendré par des politiques discrétionnaires établies par les pouvoirs publics. Classification JEL : HC2, C32, B22 Mots clefs : Déficit budgétaire conjoncturel, déficit budgétaire total, causalité,V.A.R.

B22|Distribution-led growth through methodological lenses|"This paper presents a methodological discussion of two recent ""endogeneity"" critiques of the Kaleckian model and the concept of distribution-led growth. From a neo-Keynesian perspective, it is criticized because it treats distribution as quasi-exogenous, while in Skott (2017), distribution is viewed as endogenously determined by a series of (exogenous) institutional factors and social norms, and therefore one should focus on these instead of the functional distribution of income per se. The paper discusses how abstraction is used in science and economics, and uses the criteria proposed by Lawson (1989) for what constitutes an appropriate abstraction. Based on this discussion, it concludes that the criticisms are weak, although the issues raised by Skott provide some interesting directions for future work within the Kaleckian framework."
B22|Fiscal Multipliers in the Eurozone: A SVAR Analysis|We compute the value of fiscal multipliers (for government primary expenditure, Income and wealth taxes and for Production and import ones) in the Eurozone countries since the creation of the currency union (2001Q1-2016Q4), and to understand how the values may vary according to the public debt level, the rhythm of economic growth and the output gap. Imposing quarterly fiscal shocks in the period 2000-2016, the results shown that the government expenditure had a positive effect on output, with an annual accumulated multiplier of 0.64 while the tax multipliers presented negative signs - the Income and wealth and the Production and import taxes stood at -0.10 and -0.32, respectively. Furthermore, the multipliers shown higher values for countries with higher levels of public debt (to small levels, the expenditure multiplier is close to zero and the tax multipliers seem to have positive signs),during recessions, and in countries with positive output gaps.
B22|Functional Finance: A Comparison of the Evolution of the Positions of Hyman Minsky and Abba Lerner|"This paper examines the views of Hyman Minsky and Abba Lerner on the functional finance approach to fiscal policy. It argues that the main principles of functional finance were relatively widely held in the immediate postwar period. However, with the rise of the Phillips curve, the return of the Quantity Theory, the development of the notion of a government budget constraint, and accelerating inflation at the end of the 1960s, functional finance fell out of favor. The paper compares and contrasts the evolution of the views of Minsky and Lerner over the postwar period, arguing that Lerner's transition went further, as he embraced a version of Monetarism that emphasized the use of monetary policy over fiscal policy. Minsky's views of functional finance became more nuanced, in line with his Institutionalist approach to the economy. However, Minsky never rejected his early beliefs that countercyclical government budgets must play a significant role in stabilizing the economy. Thus, in spite of some claims that Minsky should not be counted as one of the ""forefathers"" of Modern Money Theory (MMT), this paper argues that it is Minsky, not Lerner, whose work remains essential for the further development of MMT."
B22|Some Comments on the Sraffian Supermultiplier Approach to Growth and Distribution|"The paper discusses the Sraffian supermultiplier (SSM) approach to growth and distribution. It makes five points. First, in the short run the role of autonomous expenditure can be appreciated within a standard post-Keynesian framework (Kaleckian, Kaldorian, Robinsonian, etc.). Second, and related to the first, the SSM model is a model of the long run and has to be evaluated as such. Third, in the long run, one way that capacity adjusts to demand is through an endogenous adjustment of the rate of utilization. Fourth, the SSM model is a peculiar way to reach what Garegnani called the ""Second Keynesian Position."" Although it respects the letter of the ""Keynesian hypothesis,"" it makes investment quasi-endogenous and subjects it to the growth of autonomous expenditure. Fifth, in the long run it is unlikely that ""autonomous expenditure"" is really autonomous. From a stock-flow consistent point of view, this implies unrealistic adjustments after periods of changes in stock-flow ratios. Moreover, if we were to take this kind of adjustment at face value, there would be no space for Minskyan financial cycles. This also creates serious problems for the empirical validation of the model."
B22|Two Harvard Economists on Monetary Economics: Lauchlin Currie and Hyman Minsky on Financial Systems and Crises|In November 1987, Hyman Minsky visited Bogota, Colombia, after being invited by a group of professors who at that time were interested in post-Keynesian economics. There, Minsky delivered some lectures, and Lauchlin Currie attended two of those lectures at the National University of Colombia. Although Currie is not as well-known as Minsky in the American academy, both are outstanding figures in the development of non-orthodox approaches to monetary economics. Both alumni of the economics Ph.D. program at Harvard had a debate in Bogota. Unfortunately, there are no formal records of this, so here a question arises: What could have been their respective positions? The aim of this paper is to discuss Currie's and Minsky's perspectives on monetary economics and to speculate on what might have been said during their debate.
B22|The effect of unemployment on economic growth in South Africa (1994-2016)|This study sought to investigate the trends and impact of unemployment on economic growth in South Africa using quarterly data over the period 1994Q1 to 2016Q4. The Auto Regressive Distribution Lag (ARDL) bounds test approach is applied to determine the existence of the long run linkage among the variables. The results from the ARDL model suggest that there is a long run relationship between unemployment and economic growth. The empirical results obtained confirmed that there is a negative relationship between unemployment and economic growth both in the long and short run.

B22|Alexandre Lamfalussy and the monetary policy debates among central bankers during the Great Inflation|"The 1970s were a turbulent period in postwar monetary history. This paper focuses on how central bankers at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), especially Alexandre Lamfalussy, the BIS’s Economic Adviser, responded to the Great Inflation. The breakdown of Bretton Woods forced central bankers to look for new monetary policy strategies as the exchange rate lost its central role. Lamfalussy, in his early years a Keynesian in favour of discretionary policies, moved to a ""conservative Keynesian"" position, acknowledging that a medium term orientation and the credibility of monetary policy were important to break inflationary expectations. However, Lamfalussy never moved to “monetarist” positions. Lamfalussy certainly acknowledged that monetary targets could reinforce the credibility and independence of monetary policy. However, he rejected mechanical rules. In essence he aimed for a middle position: rules applied with a pragmatic sense of discretion. In the early 1980s, with the rise of financial innovations, Lamfalussy would stress even more the limitations of monetary targeting. His focus turned increasingly to systemic financial stability risks, preparing the ground for the macroprudential approach of the BIS. In Lamfalussy's view, central banking remained an art, not a science."
B22|Keynes on the Sequencing of Economic Policy: Recovery and Reform in 1933|On December 31 1933, The New York Times published an open letter from John Maynard Keynes to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In it Keynes encouraged FDR to expand public works through government borrowing. He also criticized FDR’s exchange rate policy, and argued that there was a need for lower long-term interest rates. But perhaps the most interesting feature of this letter is that Keynes made comments on the sequencing and speed of economic policies. He argued that “recovery” policies should precede “reform” measures. In this paper I analyze this particular aspect of the open letter, and I argue that for Keynes exchange rate stability was a key component of what he considered to be the appropriate order of policy. I also provide a comparison between Keynes’s views on sequencing and those developed in the 1980s and 1990s.
B22|Friedman and Phelps on the Phillips Curve Viewed from a Half Century's Perspective|In the late 1960s the stable negatively sloped Phillips Curve (PC) was overturned by the Friedman-Phelps natural rate model. Their PC was vertical in the long run at the natural unemployment rate, and their short-run curve shifted up whenever unemployment was pushed below the natural rate. This paper criticizes the underlying assumption of the Friedman-Phelps approach that the labor market continuously clears and that changes in unemployment down or up occur only in response to “fooling” of workers, firms, or both. A preferable and resolutely Keynesian approach explains quantity rationing by inertia in price and wage setting. The positive correlation of inflation and unemployment in the 1970s and again in the 1990s is explained by joining the negatively sloped Phillips Curve with a positively sloped dynamic demand curve. For any given growth of nominal GDP, higher inflation caused by adverse supply shocks implies slower real GDP growth and higher unemployment. This “triangle” model based on inflation inertia, demand, and supply worked well to explain why inflation and unemployment were both positively and negatively correlated between the 1960s and 1990s, but in the past decade the slope of the short-run Phillips Curve has flattened as inflation exhibited a muted response to high unemployment in 2009-13 and low unemployment in 2016-2018. It remains to be seen whether a continuation of low unemployment will cause a modest and fixed extra amount of inflation, thus reviving the stable Phillips curve of the early 1960s, or whether inflation will continuously accelerate as Friedman and Phelps would have predicted.
B22|Beyond Bitcoin And Cash: Do We Like A Central Bank Digital Currency? A Financial And Political Economics Approach|The aim of this paper is to offer a theoretical primer in order to analyse the demand of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Using a financial portfolio approach and assuming that individual preferences and policy votes are consistent, we identify the drivers of the political consensus in favour or against such as new currency. Given three different properties of a currency – where the first two are the standard functions of medium of exchange and store of value and the third one is the less explored function of store of information – and three different existing moneys – paper currency, banking currency and cryptocurrency – if the individuals are rational but at the same time can be affected by behavioural biases – loss aversion - three different groups of individuals – respectively lovers, neutrals and haters – emerge respect to the CBDC option. Given the alternative opportunity costs of the different currencies, the CBDC issuing is more likely to occur the more the individuals likes to use a legal tender, and/or are indifferent respect to anonymity; at the same time, the probability of the CBDC introduction increases if a return can be paid on it, and/or its implementation can guarantee at least the counterparty anonymity.
B22|Friedman's Presidential Address in the Evolution of Macroeconomic Thought|"Milton Friedman's presidential address, ""The Role of Monetary Policy,"" which was delivered 50 years ago in December 1967 and published in the March 1968 issue of the American Economic Review, is unusual in the outsized role it has played. What explains the huge influence of this work, merely 17 pages in length? One factor is that Friedman addresses an important topic. Another is that it is written in simple, clear prose, making it an ideal addition to the reading lists of many courses. But what distinguishes Friedman's address is that it invites readers to reorient their thinking in a fundamental way. It was an invitation that, after hearing the arguments, many readers chose to accept. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to view Friedman's 1967 AEA presidential address as marking a turning point in the history of macroeconomic research. Our goal here is to assess this contribution, with the benefit of a half-century of hindsight. We discuss where macroeconomics was before the address, what insights Friedman offered, where researchers and central bankers stand today on these issues, and (most speculatively) where we may be heading in the future."
B22|Fundamentos teóricos y leyes económicas en El Capital de Piketty. Un análisis crítico|El artículo lleva a cabo un análisis crítico, desde la economía política, del modelo teórico de Thomas Piketty en su libro El Capital del siglo XXI. Se destacan numerosas inconsistencias en las relaciones causales que Piketty establece para justificar la existencia de leyes fundamentales del capitalismo. Por ello, se concluye que más bien se trata de fuerzas que operan en un mismo plano, construidas a partir de elementos psicológicos, técnicos y de escasez, y de una serie de hipótesis discutibles sobre la tasa de ahorro, la elasticidad de sustitución, el crecimiento económico y ciertas excepciones a la teoría de la productividad marginal. ***** The article conducts a critical analysis, from a political economy approach, into the theoretical model proposed in Thomas Piketty’s “Capital in the Twenty-First Century”. It highlights several inconsistencies in the causal relationships that Piketty establishes to justify the existence of fundamental laws of capitalism. We conclude that these relationships constitute forces that operate in the same space, and have been developed from psychological, technical, and scarce-related elements. They are also a result of a series of questionable assumptions about the savings rate, the elasticity of substitution, economic growth, and certain exceptions to the theory of marginal productivity.
B22|La teoría macroeconómica de John Maynard Keynes|Resumen: El presente artículo tiene como objetivo presentar la teoría macroeconómica de John Maynard Keynes, a partir de su obra más representativa: La teoría general del empleo, del interés y del dinero, publicada en 1936. Esta obra tiene un carácter esencialmente heterodoxo, ya que contradice las explicaciones de la teoría “clásica” del desempleo por la insuficiente flexibilidad del mercado de trabajo, del nivel de actividad global por las características de la oferta, y de la neutralidad del dinero. El contenido de La teoría general de Keynes puede resumirse en tres proposiciones: a) el nivel de empleo no se determina por el equilibrio en el mercado de trabajo; b) la demanda global puede ser insuficiente para generar un producto global que asegure el pleno empleo y c) el dinero juega un papel central en la existencia del equilibrio con desempleo. / Abstract : This article aims to present the macroeconomic theory of John Maynard Keynes, from his most representative work: The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, published in 1936. This work has an essentially heterodox character, since it contradicts the explanations of the “classical” theory of unemployment for the insufficient flexibility of the labor market, the level of global activity by the characteristics of supply, and the neutrality of money. The content of Keynes's General Theory can be summarized in three propositions: (a) the level of employment is not determined by equilibrium in the labor market; b) the global demand may be insufficient to generate a global output that ensures full employment and c) money plays a central role in the existence of the equilibrium with unemployment.

B22|Business Cycles, Growth, And Economic Policy: Schumpeter And The Great Depression|Joseph A. Schumpeter’s theory of economic development analyzes how growth and cycle dynamics intertwine. The process of Creative Destruction plays an essential role in that dynamics: embodying a cleaning effect, it has a clear beneficial impact on long-run development. For that reason, and also for some of his famous (and provocative) non-interventionists statements, Schumpeter is generally interpreted as a pure liquidationist. This paper contests this rather simplistic view and shows that Schumpeter not only expressed much more nuanced positions as far as practical economic issues were concerned but also that his views on economic policy were rooted in his earlier contributions before the Great Depression, attesting that Schumpeter’s view on economic policy was consistent over time.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
B22|Some International Aspects Of Business Cycles: Neisser, Haberler, And Modern Open Economy Macroeconomics|Despite the transnational character of the Great Depression of the years 1929-33, there are few works in the inter-war literature that deal in depth with the propagation of business cycles across national borders and systemic risks of depression in the world economy. Two notable exceptions are Hans Neisser’s monograph on Some International Aspects of the Business Cycle (1936) and chapter 12 in Gottfried Haberler’s Prosperity and Depression (1937), which carries the heading “International Aspects of Business Cycles”. Both works differ substantially from each other and from the modern way of thinking about international business cycles in Open Economy Macroeconomics. This paper argues that Neisser’s and Haberler’s approaches provide more straightforward routes to capturing some of the transnational aspects of the recent Great Recession (of 2008/09) than the modern standard approach. At the first stage, the two older approaches are presented and compared with each other. At the second stage, they are contrasted with the current state of open-economy macroeconomics, as represented by Uribe & Schmitt-Grohé (2014), a textbook in the making that puts international macro in a business cycle framework. Since Haberler’s account accentuates the role of transport costs, imperfections of capital markets and monetary policies, it can be used as a catalogue of criteria for checking what modern attempts to connect international trade, international finance and economic growth have got (back) in sight. More importantly, both Haberler’s and Neisser’s approach also serve to identify what has been lost out of sight.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
B22|Nonlinear adjustment effects in the purchasing power parity|This study examines nonlinear adjustment effects in the purchasing power parity (PPP) between South Africa and her main currency trading partners; namely, the US, the UK, the Euro area, China and Japan. We use monthly data of the nominal exchange rates and domestic price level data collected between the periods 1971-2014. The empirical study is conducted using nonlinear unit root and asymmetric cointegration analysis. Our empirical results show significant asymmetric PPP effects between South Africa and her main trading partners with causal effects flowing from exchange rates to price differentials.
B22|On Using Exchange Rate for Promoting Exports|In recent years, Pakistani exports suffered large setback and especially textile exports decreased significantly. Some economists are suggesting devaluation1 of Pakistani Rupee to improve the exports [Javed, et al. (2016)]. Many countries including Pakistan have experimented devaluation in the past to boost exports, but most of these experiment did not bring desired results and a significant change in the balance of trade could not be observed. For example, value of Pakistani rupee declined by 20 percent during 1981-82 and by 34 percent during 2007-09. No improvement in trade could be observed after each episode of depreciation, on contrary, the gap between exports and imports widened. There are well known explanations in contemporary economic literature which explain this counterproductive impact of depreciation. However, analysing the impacts of depreciation and/or devaluation in context of trade only is never justifiable. The depreciation of local currency has serious implications for many other important economic indicators including external debt, tax revenue, budget deficit, current account deficit and domestic inflation. For H[DPSOHDRQHSHUFHQWUHGXFWLRQLQYDOXHRIORFDOFXUUHQF\µFDXVHV¶DQLQFUHDVH in external debt by the same percentage, measured in local currency. Due to this increase in the external debt, the amount needed for debt servicing shall also increase which increases the budget deficit and the current account deficits. The suggestion of depreciation could be supported only if the sum of expected gains from all kinds of its impacts are positive. Given the complexity of all this estimation, one can focus on external debt and balance of trade. The effect of depreciation on external debt can be easily counted, and the improvement in trade must be more than the increase in external debt to justify depreciation. Taking into account all these factors, particularly the debt factor, it could be easily seen that net impacts of devaluation are negative and extremely harmful for the Pakistan Economy.
B22|What Remains of Milton Friedman's Monetarism?|From the early 1960s until the early 1970s with the emergence of rational expectations, under the rubric of monetarism, Milton Friedman defined macroeconomic debate. Although the Keynesian consensus that he challenged has disappeared, the current academic literature makes little reference to monetarist ideas. What happened to them? The argument here is that those ideas remain relevant but require translation into terms expressible in modern macroeconomic models and in the monetary policies of central banks, neither of which contain any obvious references to money. Moreover, the Friedman and Schwartz methodology for identifying shocks retains relevance.
B22|Reacting to the Lucas Critique: The Keynesians' Pragmatic Replies|We illustrate how the Lucas Critique was called into question by Keynesian macroeconomists during the 1970s and 1980s. Our claim is that Keynesians' reactions were carried out from a pragmatic approach, which addressed the empirical and practical relevance of the Critique. Keynesians rejected the Critique as a general principle with no relevance for concrete macroeconometric practice; their rejection relied on econometric investigations and contextual analysis of the U.S. 1970s stagflation and its aftermath. Keynesians argued that the parameters of their models remained stable across this period, and that simpler ways to account for stagflation (such as the introduction of supply shocks into their models) provided better alternatives to improve policy evaluation
B22|Central Bank Digital Currency and the Future of Monetary Policy|We consider how a central bank digital currency (CBDC) could transform all aspects of the monetary system and facilitate the systematic and transparent conduct of monetary policy. In particular, we find that CBDC can serve as a practically costless medium of exchange, secure store of value, and stable unit of account. To achieve these criteria, CBDC would be account-based and interest-bearing, and the monetary policy framework would foster true price stability.
B22|Price Stability and the Origins and Early Impact of the Phillips Curve: Contextual Analysis and New Evidence from the British Archives|Moving from conflicting opinions regarding the relevance of A.W. Phillips’ contribution, and of the Phillips curve in particular, this paper provides a contextual analysis in which Phillips (1958) is seen as part of a wider research effort, aimed at exploring how to reconcile price stability with levels of unemployment that were higher than current rates but politically acceptable. We label this proposal ‘reverse trade-off’, to mark its distance from standard textbook accounts, which regard the Phillips curve as justifying inflationary Keynesian policies in the 1960s and 1970s. Moreover, our reconstruction suggests that what really mattered with Phillips (1958) was that it provided a quantitative estimate of the unique (and low) level of the unemployment rate which was compatible with price stability. However, even though the British Treasury and the LSE colleague of Phillips F. Paish conducted independent researches along the lines proposed by Phillips, the curve met with early opposition from some prominent British policy and academic circles. At Cambridge, Kahn and Kaldor in particular attacked the neoclassical underpinnings as well as the policy implications of the curve. Parallel to this, Lipsey (1960), while contributing to popularize the Phillips hypothesis within the broad scientific community, had the opposite effect in the restricted academic and top level policy circles within which Phillips’ curve article was born and moved its first steps. First, Lipsey’s empirical results and rightly cautious attitude weakened the case for bringing the unemployment rate up at the level consistent with price stability. Second, Lipsey (1960) weakened also the belief in the possibility itself of identifying the unique unemployment rate consistent with price stability.
B22|Post-Keynesian macroeconomics since the mid 1990s: main developments|In this paper the main developments in post-Keynesian macroeconomics since the mid 1990s will be reviewed. For this purpose the main differences between heterodox economics in general, including post-Keynesian economics, and orthodox economics will be reiterated and an overview of the strands of post-Keynesian economics, their commonalities and developments since the 1930s will be outlined. This will provide the grounds for touching upon three important areas of development and progress of post-Keynesian macroeconomics since the mid 1990s: first, the integration of distribution issues and distributional conflict into short- and long-run macroeconomics, both in theoretical and in empirical/applied works; second, the integrated analysis of money, finance and macroeconomics and its application to changing institutional and historical circumstances, such as the process of financialisation; and third, the development of full-blown macroeconomic models, providing alternatives to the mainstream â€˜New Consensus Modelâ€™ (NCM), and allowing us to derive a full macroeconomic policy mix as a more convincing alternative to the one implied and proposed by the mainstream NCM, which has dramatically failed in the face of the recent crises.
B22|Exploring Links between FDI Inflows, Energy Consumption, and Economic Growth: Further Evidence from MENA Countries|This study aims to examine the nexus between economic growth, FDI inflows and energy consumption on a panel of 17 countries using a ¡®growth model¡¯ framework and simultaneous-equation models estimated by the generalized method of moments (GMM) over the 1990-2012 period. We also implement these empirical models for 17 countries selected on the basis of data availability. They include: (a) 12 Middle Eastern countries, namely: Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, Lebanon, United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Turkey, Iran, Syria, Jordan and Yemen, (b) 5 North African countries, namely: Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and Libya. Our results indicate that there is a bidirectional causal relationship between FDI inflows and economic growth, as between well as energy consumption and economic growth. Besides, there is a unidirectional causal relationship between energy consumption to FDI inflows for the global panel. This implies that the increase of energy consumption increases the FDI inflows for individual and collective countries.

B22|Thomas Sargent face à Robert Lucas : une autre ambition pour la Nouvelle Economie Classique|The article shows that Sargent's view of macroeconomics is in contrast with Lucas' one. According to the latter, assumptions in a model are un-realist, the model do not aim at representing reality. It is rather a simulation tool to enable the evaluation of different economic policies. The Lucasian ideal reflects a belief in a macroeconomist who is an engineer in charge of the production of a “software for economic policies” used by governmental authorities. And he is the one who handles the software to help policy choices on a scientific basis. Concerning Sargent, he believed that in order to replace the Keynesian paradigm, New Classical Economics had to be able to succeed in the same tasks. And one of these tasks was to advise political power by bringing some telescope to read current economic phenomenon and some intuitive ideas to debate on economic policy. Sargent sought to implement what he called the Rational Expectations Theory to some concrete cases (Poincaré Stabilization, German Hyperinflation, Thatcher and Reagan policies) to show the relevance of such a framework to think about current economic issues

B22|Stagflation and the crossroad in macroeconomics: the struggle between structural and New Classical macroeconometrics|The article studies the 1978 macroeconomics conference titled “After the Phillips Curve”, where Lucas and Sargent presented their fierce attack against structural macroeconometric models, “After Keynesian Macroeconomics”. The article aims at enlarging the comprehension of changes in macroeconomics in the 1970s. It shows: 1) that Lucas and Sargent dit not tackle directly the issue of the explanation of stagflation; 2) but that the struggle between different methodological stances in the conference cannot be separated from the way macroeconomists interpreted stagflation; 3) that it was not an opposition between being in favor or against microfounded models, but rather on the way we build microfoundations; 4) finally that the study of the 1978 conference opens the doors for scrutinizing the evolution of institution macroeconometric models of the 1970s which were not totally overthrown by Lucas and Sargent's arguments
B22|The Missing Bretton Woods Debate over Flexible Exchange Rates|The collapse of the gold standard in the 1930s sparked a debate about the merits of fixed versus floating exchange rates. Yet the debate quickly vanished: there was almost no discussion about the exchange rate regime at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 because John Maynard Keynes and Harry Dexter White agreed that exchange rate stability through fixed but adjustable pegs was the right approach. In light of the difficult macroeconomic tradeoffs experienced under the gold standard a decade earlier, the outright rejection of floating exchange rates seems surprising. This paper explores the views of leading economists about the exchange rate provisions in the Bretton Woods agreement and examines why arguments for floating exchange rates were so quickly dismissed.
B22|Keynes and the Dollar in 1933|On December 1933, John Maynard Keyes published an open letter to President Roosevelt, where he wrote: “The recent gyrations of the dollar have looked to me more like a gold standard on the booze than the ideal managed currency of my dreams.” In this paper I use high frequency data to investigate whether the gyrations of the dollar were unusually high throughout this period. My results show that although volatility was pronounced, it was not higher than during October 1931- July 1933. I analyze Keynes writings on the international monetary system in an effort to understand what he meant in his letter. I compare Keynes’s “The means to prosperity” with James P. Warburg’s plan for a “modified international standard.”
B22|The London Monetary and Economic Conference of 1933 and the End of The Great Depression: A “Change of Regime” Analysis|In this paper I analyze the London Monetary and Economic Conference of 1933, an almost forgotten episode in U.S. monetary history. I study how the Conference shaped dollar policy during the second half of 1933 and early 1934. I use daily data to investigate the way in which the Conference and related policies associated to the gold standard affected commodity prices, bond prices, and the stock market. My results show that the Conference itself did not impact commodity prices or the stock market. However, it had a small effect on bond prices. I do find that the events associated with the abandonment of the gold standard impacted prices in a significant way, even before the actual monetary and currency channels were at work. These results are consistent with the “change in regime” hypothesis of Sargent (1983).
B22|Central Bank Digital Currency And The Future Of Monetary Policy|We consider how a central bank digital currency (CBDC) can transform all aspects of the monetary system and facilitate the systematic and transparent conduct of monetary policy. Drawing on a very long strand of literature in monetary economics, we find a compelling rationale for establishing a CBDC that serves as a stable unit of account, a practically costless medium of exchange, and a secure store of value. In particular, the CBDC should be universally accessible and interest-bearing, and the central bank should adjust its interest rate to foster true price stability.
B22|Crisis and theoretical methods: equilibrium and disequilibrium once again|The financial crisis of 2007-8 damaged the credibility of macroeconomic analysis based on price-taking Walrasian intertemporal general equilibrium models. This talk explores methodological alternatives, particularly stable Nash-Cournot equilibria of social interaction models that center on agents’ response to other agents’ actions rather than on agents’ forecasts of future paths of prices and production. Social interaction equilibria in conjunction with constraints from information theory highlight the social coordination problems at the root of macroeconomic policy questions. Equilibrium concepts enhance the explanatory power of economic theories in contrast with the limitations of disequilibrium dynamical systems analysis and agent-based modeling. Constrained maximum entropy methods offer a general approach to macroeconomic modeling. Various conceptions of equilibrium in economics arise from distinct conceptions of expectations.
B22|The Link Between Bank Credit And Private Sector Investment In Nigeria From 1980-2014|TThis study attempts to investigate the link between bank credit and private sector investment in Nigeria from 1980 to 2014 using Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression procedure. The study also employs other preliminary investigations which include, unit root, cointegration and Granger causality test procedures. The OLS result indicates that the coefficients of the variables which include, banks credit to the private sector (CRPRIVAT), trade openness (OPEN), exchange rate (EXCHR) and total bank saving (BSAVING) exhibit positive signs to the dependent variable, private investment (INVEST) during the period under review, while the coefficients of two other variables, capital expenditure (CAP) and interest rate (INTR) indicate negative signs to the dependent variable. The stationarity test result shows that all the variables under consideration are stationary and integrated of order one at 5% significance level. Also, the cointegration test result indicates at most five cointegrating equations at 5% level of significance. The Granger causality test result shows that a bi-directional causality exists between banks credit and private investment and also between private investment and capital expenditure, while a uni-directional causality exists from exchange rate to private investment.Statistically, the descriptive statistics result indicates that all the variables have a positive mean values which ranges from 18.05390 to 2427052 with 34 observations.The correlation test result obtained shows that four variables, CRPRIVAT, OPEN, EXCHR and BSAVING have positive relationships with the dependent variable INVEST. The t-statistic result shows that five of the variables which includes, CRPRIVAT, OPEN, CAP, INTR and EXCHR are statistically significant at 5% significance level. The study recommends that there is a need for increased Federal government support to banks in terms of policies that would encourage lending to the private sector in Nigeria.

B22|Secular stagnation and concentration of corporate power|We identify a set of key stylised facts characterising the evolution of the seven largest advanced economies from the 1960s to 2015 and develop a small one-sector model of growth and distribution broadly consistent with these facts. The model is used to explore the relationship between falling trend growth, the re-distribution of aggregate income towards profits and the concentration of corporate power and wealth. Theory is confronted with history to illustrate how changes in social structure can affect economic behaviour and performance. We argue that finance-led corporate restructuring, involving debt-financed corporate transactions, may have played a crucial role in shaping long-term patterns of growth and distribution.

Throughout regarding calibrations, one might see that, despite the existence of some deviations from trend and some Gini 1 and Gini 2 coefficients’ differences, (a) there exists an improvement in the distribution of income until 2011, except for the year 2009 when the global crisis was experienced, but an average deterioration in the distribution for 2011-2015 period is experienced, (b) the geographical regions of the Turkish economy reveal different outcomes. For the period 2006-2015, it is observed that in the regions of Istanbul, West Marmara, Central Anatolia and North East Anatolia, the Lorenz curve has moved away from full equilibrium line, but in the regions of Aegean, Eastern Marmara and Eastern Black Sea, on the average, a convergence towards the equilibrium from the Lorenz curve has appeared. In other three regions, the Gini coefficients improve on average in Western Anatolia, Mediterranean and Western Black Sea regions. The Gini coefficients are increasing in the period 2006-2011 in the Middle East Anatolia and falling in 2015. In the South East Anatolia Region, there is no progress in the period 2006-2011, but, there happens to be a recovery in income distribution in 2015.
B22|Does Clower’s Dual-Decision Hypothesis lead to the change in saving conclusion in Keynes’s General Theory?|Keynes’ General Theory (1936) is probably the most challenging economics book ever written, with an abundance of hypotheses, concepts and theories. Twenty five years after its publication, Clower proposed an insightful explanation on Keynes, the Dual-Decision Hypothesis (DDH). Hall (1978) and Flavin (1981) seemingly reached the conclusion that, under certain conditions, consumption was independent of income. In contrast, Wu (2016) has shown that, change in saving has to be a function of income growth. In fact, applying Wu’s corrected consumption for period t+1, it is possible to show DDH equations leading to Keynes’ change in saving (and disequilibrium) conclusion.
B22|Paradigmele istoriei. Datoria publică a României în ultimii 100 de ani<BR>[History paradigms: the public debt of Romania in the last 100 years]|The study focuses on the analysis of Romania’s public debt over the last 100 years, on three distinct historical periods (interwar, under communist regime, and the transition to the market economy), characterized, despite essential system differencies, by the same paradigm of a sinusoidal trajectory of the economic development, fundamentally affected by the overindebtedness costs and/or, paradoxically, by those of debt liquidation. The paper highlights the main causes of the public debt accumulation, the destinations of loans, trying to assess the sustainability parameters thoughout the last century. It was found that, in terms of debt sustainability, Romania had, in most of the time, an excessive indebtedness degree, accentuated by heavy financial and political consequences of the two world wars before 1990 and, after this, by the transition costs and the global crisis effects, which impacted the macroeconomic situation of the country.
B22|Dynamic Impact of Money Supply on Economic Growth in South Africa. An ARDL Approach|ABSTRACT: This study investigates the dynamic impact of broad money supply (m3) on economic growth (GDP) per capita in South Africa using time-series data from 1980 to 2016. The study has employed the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL)-bounds testing approach to cointegration and error correction model to investigate the impact of m3 on GDP per capita. The model is specified with four macroeconomics variables, namely, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, Broad money supply (M3), Interest rate (INT), Inflation rate (INF). The findings reveal that there is statistically significant positive relationship between money supply and economic growth both in short run and long run. The government of South Africa should maintain consistency and follow “the Taylor rule” to allow money supply to increase at a steady rate keeping pace with the economic growth. In respect to such rule will help South Africa Reserve Bank to avoid the inefficiencies that caused by execution of discretionary policy.
B22|Dopo il keynesismo: teorie economiche per una (non-) politica economica<BR>[After Keynesianism: Economic Theories for a (non) Economic Policy]|This paper presents a brief discussion on the evolution of macroeconomics and economic policy after Keynes. Particularly, we describe the emergence of a new standard of economic research, after the «stagflation» of the 1970s, which resurrects the (pre-Keynesian) confidence in the self-correcting properties of the market economy. It also considers economic policy as a potential obstacle for the economic system in reaching the «natural» equilibrium. Finally, some perspectives for macroeconomics in the aftermath of the Great Recession are discussed.
B22|A glance at Solow’s growth theory|This paper examines the growth theory of Robert Solow , which has been a point of reference of economic growth since the 1950s. First, the article analyzes the path-breaking model of growth contained in Solow’s article “A Contribution to the Theory of Economic Growth” published in The Quarterly Journal of Economics (1956). Second, it looks at the contribution of Solow to growth accounting and to the new method of studying capital formation in economic growth through the vintage approach. Therefore, the work analyzes the article “Technical Change and the Aggregate Production Function” published in The Review of Economics and Statistics (1957). In the latter publication, Solow, through the aggregate production function, tries to measure growth and provide an explanation of the nature of technical progress. The article also examines Solow’s 1960 essay “Investment and Technical Progress” based on the hypothesis of embodied technological progress and the vintage approach.
B22|Keynes: ley de Say y demanda de dinero<BR>[Keynes: Say's law and demand for money]|In this bibliographic review, the Keynes‘main arguments against the Say’s law are gathered, this law was thought to be a special case of a broader and general theory and therefore more powerful as economic policy is concerned. These insights are vital, to understand Keynesian economics and its subsequent contributions in economic theory and economic policy.
B22|Garegnani, Ackley and the years of high theory at Svimez|In the late 1950s, Svimez was an influential research centre on Italian economic and regional policies. It was advised and visited by top international development experts and by leading Italian economists. Pierangelo Garegnani, fresh from his seminal Ph.D. thesis on capital theory at Cambridge, wrote a report for Svimez, published in 1962, on the relevance of Keynes’ theory for economies at an intermediate stage of development, like Italy. Interestingly, in 1963 Gardner Ackley published a similar report for Svimez. The theoretical parts of Garegnani’s report were published in English in 1978-79 and 2015. In a final applied section, which has not yet been published, Garegnani estimates that a fuller utilisation of productive capacity would have allowed for the creation of 550 thousand additional jobs without problems relating to the balance of payments. In this section, Garegnani also raises several interesting theoretical issues. Ackley’s report is an econometric explanation of the Italian ‘economic miracle’ based on a demand-led growth supermultiplier model – a theoretical approach re-discovered by Bortis and Serrano, and recently taken up by Marc Lavoie and others. A comparison between these two genuine Keynesian approaches looks very promising.
B22|"Involuntary Unemployment versus ""Involuntary Employment"" : J.M. Keynes and Beyond"|"This paper is concerned with the important question of how and to what extent great economists such as Keynes, Knight, Hicks, Samuelson, Takata, and Morishima have been intermingled with each other. Our discussion focuses on the two key concepts in the labor markets; involuntary unemployment and ""involuntary employment."" On the one hand, there are so many persons in the street who are willing to work at the existing wages but cannot find jobs because of a shortage of the effective demand as a whole. This is clearly the issue of involuntary unemployment, which has been energetically tackled by J. M. Keynes and his followers since the 1930s.On the other hand, since the 1990s, there also have emerged so many people who must work unwillingly for their survivals at the minimal level of wages. This is a new issue of ""involuntary employment"" or ""non-regular workers"", which has recently been investigated by Nobuaki Takahashi, a rising Japanese economist. Although the Takahashi approach is an attractive one, it nevertheless seems to remain at the embryo stage, thus requiring further developments in many ways. The second Keynes would urgently be needed."
B22|Challenging Lucas: from overlapping generations to infinite-lived agent models|The canonical history of macroeconomics, one of the rival schools of thought and the great economists, gives Robert Lucas a prominent role in shaping the recent developments in the area. According to it, his followers were initially split into two camps, the “real business cycle” theorists with models of efficient fluctuations, and the “new-Keynesians” with models in which fluctuations are costly, and the government has a role to play, due to departures from the competitive equilibrium (such as nominal rigidities and imperfect competition). Later on, a consensus view emerged (the so-called new neoclassical synthesis), based on the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model, which combines elements of the models developed by economists of those two groups. However, this account misses critical developments, as already pointed out by Cherrier and Saïdi (2015). As a reaction to Lucas’s 1972 policy ineffectiveness results, based on an overlapping generations (OLG) model, a group of macroeconomists realized that a competitive OLG model may have a continuum of equilibria and that this indeterminacy justified government intervention for competitive cycles that emerged even in deterministic models. We can identify here two distinct, but related, groups: one of the deterministic cycles of David Gale, David Cass, and Jean-Michel Grandmont, and another of the stochastic models and sunspots of Karl Shell, Roger Guesnerie, Roger Farmer and Costas Azariadis (Lucas’s PhD student). Here, the OLG was the workhorse model. Following from these works, a number of authors, including Michael Woodford, argued that similar results could occur in models with infinitely lived agents when there are various kinds of market imperfections. With such generalization, some of these macroeconomists saw that once these imperfections are introduced, nothing important for business cycle modeling was lost and they could therefore leave the OLG model aside as a model of business fluctuations, to the dismay of authors such as Grandmont, Robert Solow and Frank Hahn. In this paper, we scrutinize the differences between the deterministic cycles and sunspot groups and explore the many efforts of building a dynamic competitive business cycle model that implies a role for the government to play. We then assess the transformation process that took place in the late 1980s when several macroeconomists switched from OLG to infinite-lived agents models with imperfections that eventually became central to the DSGE literature. With this we hope to shed more light on the origins of new neoclassical synthesis.
B22|Coast to Coast: How MIT's students linked the Solow model and optimal growth theory|Textbook narratives usually describe the Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans model of optimal growth as an important development over Solow’s model. The constant saving rate rule of the latter is replaced by an endogenous determination of savings rates based on utility maximization behaviour of the former. However, neither Tjalling Koopmans nor David Cass were trying to upgrade Robert Solow’s modelling of savings with their contributions. Koopmans was pushing for utilitarian analysis to study economic growth within the activity analysis community, with the help of Edmond Malinvaud. Cass and his colleagues at Stanford’s graduate program were exploring the multiple applications of the maximum principle on economic growth models, influenced mostly by Hirofumi Uzawa. When the group of Stanford students graduated and moved to different departments, Karl Shell brought his interest on optimal growth and technical progress to the MIT. There, he organized a conference in 1965-66 that united his Stanford colleagues and MIT young scholars to discuss optimal growth theory. The conference represented the formation of a scientific community that consolidated optimal growth theory in the second half of the 1960 decade. The link between optimal growth theory and Solow’s model was consolidated by this community of young students. Most of them were advised by Solow. This paper plans to shed some light on the importance of the MIT in the history of optimal growth theory and to show how the standard textbook narrative is a MIT-only story.
B22|Makroökonomie und Populismus<BR>[Macroeconomics and Populism]|Zusammenfassung Populismus macht sich breit: das zeigen der Brexit, die Wahl Donald Trumps, die befürchteten Ergebnisse der Wahlen in den Niederlanden und Frankreich sowie das Erstarken der AfD in Deutschland. Erklärt wird dieser Trend häufig sozio-kulturell mit einer Skepsis gegenüber der modernen globalisierten Welt. Adalbert Winkler präsentiert einen anderen Erklärungsansatz, der den Blick vor allem auf die ökonomischen Gründe lenkt. Er beschreibt die Entwicklung der dominierenden ökonomischen Dogmen und deren Einfluss auf die Politik sowie die Veränderung der globalen wirtschaftlichen Verflechtungen und deren Folgen für die Beschäftigten. Abschließend analysiert er die Erfolgsaussichten einer Politik, die von Populisten zur Lösung der entstandenen Probleme angeboten wird.
B22|Agent-Based Macroeconomics and Classical Political Economy: Some Italian Roots|Abstract In this work, we discuss how the rich academic milieu left by different Italian political economy traditions after WWII paved the way for the development of a new generation of macroeconomic agent-based models. The K + S (Dosi et al. in J Econ Dyn Control 34:1748–1767, 2010; Dosi et al. in J Evol Econ. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00191-016-0466-4 , 2016a), CATS (Delli Gatti et al. in J Econ Behav Organ 56:489–512, 2005; Delli Gatti et al. in Macroeconomics from the bottom-up. Springer, Berlin, 2011) and EURACE (Cincotti et al. in Econ Open Access Open Assess E J 4, 2010; Teglio et al. in Adv Complex Syst 15:1–27, 2012) families of agent-based models are at the frontier of an alternative macroeconomic research paradigm, which considers the economy as a complex evolving system. The three families of models are presented in detail and their empirical performance and policy exercises discussed.
B22|Immigration and the Dutch disease. A counterfactual analysis of the Norwegian resource boom 2004-2013|The EU-enlargement in 2004 increased labour migration and affected the Norwegian labour market in particular. We study how this modified the Dutch disease effects during the resource boom 2004- 2013. In the Norwegian case the resource movement effect of the petroleum industry has historically dominated the spending effect. One reason is the introduction of the fiscal policy rule in 2001 that limited spending. We find that economic growth in Norway was roughly doubled during this period due to the resource boom while total population increased by 2 percent. Moreover, both the resource movement and spending effects on Mainland GDP were roughly unaffected by immigration while employment increased, real wages fell and so did productivity.
B22|Old and new formulations of the neoclassical theory of aggregate investment : a critical review|This paper surveys the neoclassical theory of aggregate investment and its criticisms. We distinguish four main formulations of this theory: the traditional Wicksellian investment function; the Fisherian array-of-opportunities approach (as Witte Jr. called it); the Jorgensonian model; the now prevailing adjustment-costs models. With respect to other papers criticizing the neoclassical theory of investment, we do not appeal to market imperfections. We instead argue that all four formulations present serious theoretical difficulties, even conceding free competition.
B22|A Formal Assessment of New-Developmentalist Theory and Policy|We develop a formal framework that endogeneizes the productive structure of a small open peripheral economy as the outcome of a problem of technical choices. We subsequently examine the main theoretical theses and policy prescriptions of the NewDevelopmentalist approach to economic development. We argue that: a) not only does the pattern of specialization depend on technical conditions, but also on income distribution; b) in an economy without rents, the level of the money-wage nominal-exchange-rate ratio is univocally determined once the rate of profits is known, and shows an inverse relationship with it; c) if differential rents are considered, the level of the rate of profits can be set independently of the money-wage exchange-rate ratio; d) the level of the exchange rate that ensures normal profitability of the primary sector need not coincide with the currentaccount equilibrium rate; e) the effective exchange rate need not gravitate around any of these two former levels, which must be rather seen as minimum thresholds of the effective rate; e) the unpleasant distributive consequences of exchange-rate depreciation can be partially avoided by means of export duties that do not raise primary-commodities production costs
B22|"From the ""planning euphoria"" to the ""bitter economic truth"": The transmission of economic ideas into German labour market policies in the 1960s and 2000s"|This paper compares the interconnections between dominant economic thought and processes of policy-making in the area of labour market reforms in Germany in the late 1960s and the early 2000s. The transition in labour market policies in this period could be described as a change from an active to an activating approach. At the level of economic discourse these policy changes correspond to a paradigm shift from Keynesian to neoclassical/neoliberal economic thought. We investigated these changes by focussing on two distinct reforms of labour market policies and carried out a critical discourse analysis of the relevant public and academic discourse of economists. We find that the paradigm shift in economic thought was accompanied by a shift in economists' discourses on labour market policy issues.
B22|Adventures of the optimum currency areas theory|The theory of optimum currency areas was created by three famous economists, R. Mandell, R. McKinnon and P. Kenen. They identified characteristics that potential participants of a currency area should possess in order to make it feasible to surrender the independent monetary policy and the adjustment of an exchange rate of a national currency. We consider the historical development of the optimum currency areas theory and review factors which led to renewal of the theory in the early 1990s. The article focuses on some important links between historic facts, development of the economic theory, and public policy.
B22|Real exchange rate targeting|Developing countries typically exhibit a high degree of macroeconomic variables­ instability. This feature is particularly evident as regards the volatility of the real exchange rate. The concern with these destabilizing effects generated­ by real exchange rate instability has prompted some developing countries to adopt real exchange rate targeting since the late 60’s. However, this policy produces an inflation bias. This paper reviews economic literature on theoretical frameworks and empirical evidences about effects of real exchange rate targeting.
B22|Impact of Oil Prices on Oil Exporting Countries in the Caucasus and Central Asia|After a period of relative stability in mid- 2014, oil prices began to decrease, and this affected the economy of the oil exporting countries. The decrease in oil prices had an impact on the economy of oil exporting countries, exposing them to risk as a result of the reduced export revenues. The effects of the decrease in oil prices on the economy of oil exporting and oil importing countries is different. The paper studies the effects of decreasing oil prices on economic growth, exchange rate sustainability and fiscal stability of the oil exporting countries in Caucasus and Central Asia. The forecasts anticipate recovery of the oil prices in 2016 but the uncertainty of oil revenues continues to be a challenge for the economy of oil exporting countries.
B22|Reading Keynes in Buenos Aires: Prebisch and the Dynamics of Capitalism|Keynes had a profound influence on Prebisch in terms of the diagnosis about the main failures of market economies and the need to pursue pro-active and anti-cyclical policies. However, Prebisch was critical of some aspects of Keynes’s General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, in particular on the theory of interest and the multiplier. His attitude can be explained by a difference in the object and method of analysis. Prebisch’s interests focussed on dynamics and the cycle, themes that were peripheral to Keynes’s central message. Prebisch’s Keynesian influence and his rejection of some aspects of Keynes’s magnum opus explains why at the same time that Prebisch is often described as the Latin American Keynes, he is portrayed as concerned mainly with the long-run development problem of Latin America and without proper consideration to demand factors as fundamental determinants of output and employment.
B22|What was the message of Friedman’s Presidential Address to the American Economic Association?|Abstract It is widely accepted that the importance of Friedman’s Presidential Address to the American Economic Association lies in its criticism of policy based on the Phillips curve. It is argued that a reading of the text does not support such a view, and this and other considerations suggest that any such aim was far from Friedman’s mind in 1968. His objective was the quite different one of making a case for policy ‘rules’ rather than discretion.
B22|Harry Johnson on the Phillips Curve|It is noted that Harry G. Johnson was widely admired for his broad knowledge of economics, and particularly for the excellence and synthesizing quality of much of his writing. His discussions of the “Phillips curve” and related matters are considered. It is found that they are brief, inaccurate, and inconsistent. It is clear that, despite his reputation, they should not be treated as authoritative. It is further suggested that rather than supposing that Johnson’s knowledge and capabilities have been grossly exaggerated, it may be better to conclude that the Phillips curve was not nearly so important in the literature of the 1960s and 1970s as has been supposed.
B22|Prospects for Turkey's accession to the EU|The European Union is an economic and politician union that currently comprises 28 member states. Turkey's accession to the EU may be a key factor leading to changes in trade system and socio-economic situation of the EU. The purpose of this article is to present the prospects of Turkey's accession to the EU. It explores the genesis and evolution of Turkey's accession negotiations to the EU. Furthermore, it examines the benefits and risks of the potential accession of Turkey to the EU. The research problem formulated in this article has been solved on the basis of the statistical data from Eurostat. The method of analysis used in this work is both descriptive and comparative. We analyzed the basic indicators of the macroeconomic situation of Turkey and the EU before and after the potential accession of Turkey to the EU, such as population, GDP, GDP per capita, inflation, unemployment and trade balance.
B22|Provocări în perioada tranziției la economia de piață în România. Creșterea gradului de îndatorare externă și internă<BR>[Challenges facing Romania during the period of transition to a market-based economy. The increase in the degree of external and internal indebtedness]|Under the circumstances of the globally interconnected world, facing currently with growing uncertainties and capital flows volatility, the assessment of external and internal indebtedness of a country could be crucial for designing better policies in order to stimulate recovery and sustainable economic growth. The paper focuses on the analysis of the main causes of the accelerated increase in Romania’s external and internal debt during the transition period, enhanced by the effects of the global financial crisis, which were neither anticipated nor countered. It was found out that, in terms of international debt sustainability standards, adjusted for Romania, the country has reached an excessive indebtedness degree in the post-crisis years, along with the deterioration of the macroeconomic situation. Among the main conclusions of the paper, strong efforts targeting coherent macroeconomic policies aimed, as central objectives, at raising the potential output growth and the resilience to shocks from the external environment have been underlined, toward the recovery of Romania’s financial position and ensuring the external and internal debt sustainability.
B22|Back to the long-run: the “Development Operation” as a supply-side policy by the Italian Industrial Association during the Seventies|The aim of this paper is to stress the proposal made by the Italian Industrial Association against the stagflation during the Seventies, labeled “Development Operation”, which tried to give Italy a long-run growth path, through a strong reduction of public debt, boosting the supply-side in order to gain more productive independence; all of this in close connection with the European Community framework and in line with IMF/OECD directives. Moreover, this policy statement provided for a synthesis of different schools and joined the crowding-out debate occurring at that time in Italy.
B22|La politica economica della Democrazia Cristiana (1948-1963) e il dibattito all’interno del partito<BR>[The economic policy of Christian Democracy (1948-1963) and the debate within the party]|This paper aims to analyze, in a first part, the economic policy carried out by the Christian Democracy from the post WWII until the early Sixties; in a second part, the goal is to trace the debate inside this party to highlight the different positions taken by its members in order to understand why those kind of policies were achieved. We will see that, a first period of unity (largely) within the party, together with a second one where the left-wing component came out and succeeded to lead the party, made possible to design Keynesian based policies in order to boost growth and employment that our country needed.
B22|Může být přirozená úroková míra nulová? Neoklasický přístup<BR>[Can the Natural Rate of Interest Be Zero? A Neoclassical Approach]|Very low real rates of interest observed in modern economies might be caused by the fact that the natural rate of interest declined to a zero level. This article shows that a zero or a negative natural interest can be explained by the Böhm-Bawerkian and neoclassical theory. Firstly, two senses of time preference are introduced in a discounted utility model, and key determinants of the zero interest rate on the side of time preference are discussed in detail. Secondly, a simple general equilibrium model with fixed intertemporal endowment is presented. Within this model, a decreasing shape of the income stream is identified as a major source of zero interest along with a low intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption. Even in the world of zero or negative natural interest, it might be optimal to be a lender. The last section focuses on the role of marginal productivity of capital in the model, stressing the role of this phenomenon on one side and time preference on the other in lowering the natural rate of interest to a zero level.
B22|Secular stagnation or stagnation policy? Steindl after Summers|The current debate on secular stagnation is suffering from some vagueness and several shortcomings. The same is true for the economic policy implications. Therefore, we provide an alternative view on stagnation tendencies based on Josef Steindl’s contributions. In particular Steindl’s (1952) book can be viewed as a pioneering work in the area of stagnation in modern capitalism. We hold that this work is not prone to the problems detected in the current debate on secular stagnation: It does not rely on the dubious notion of an equilibrium real interest rate as the equilibrating force of saving and investment at full employment levels, in principle, with the adjustment process currently blocked by the unfeasibility of a very low or even negative equilibrium rate. On the contrary, it is based on the notion that modern capitalist economies are facing aggregate demand constraints, and that saving adjusts to investment through income growth and changes in capacity utilisation in the long run. It allows for potential growth to become endogenous to actual demand driven growth. And it seriously considers the role of institutions and power relationships for long-run growth – and for stagnation.
B22|The Effects of Institutional Structure on Economic Growth: An Application on G-20 Countries (1996-2014)|In parallel to the evolution of the economic growth theories regarding the main indicators of long term economic growth, this article econometrically analyses the long term effects of the institutional structure on the economic growth of G-20 countries with different development levels for the period of 1996-2014. In order to examine the impact of the institutional structure on economic growth more coherently and to compare the results, G-20 countries are included in the analysis under two sub-groups respectively as economically developed G-9 countries and developing G-10 countries. Thus the article aims to evaluate the impact of the institutional structure on the differentiation of the long term economic growth performances and economic development levels of the countries under the groups G-9 and G-10. The article concludes that, effects of the institutional structure indicators on the economic growth have been positive and significant in statistical terms in the sub-group G-9, while they have been usually negative and significant in sub-group G-10 during the period analysed. Nonetheless, the article indicates that, along with the physical and human capital accumulation, possession of different institutional structures are more effective in differentiation of the long term economic growth performances and development levels of the countries in the groups of G-9 and G-10 during the sample period.
B22|The Dollar Dominance : Recent Episode of Trade Invoicing and Debt Issuance|The international monetary system is known to be asymmetric given the dominant use of a few international currencies. The international trade of developing countries is mainly invoiced in US dollars, unlike industrialized countries which invoice a much higher share of their exports in their home currencies. The same logic is at work in the issuance of international debt. While the attempts to challenge the supremacy of the US dollars have failed in most cases, China is coming to the fore and is increasing its use of the Renminbi, even supported by its growing recognition within the International Monetary Fund. By reassessing the relevance of existing academic works, this paper demonstrates how monetary asymmetries have been reinforced in recent decades, and offers explanations related to currency choices. Finally, this paper offers the conclusion that international monetary reform is necessary. One cannot overlook that the monetary system embodies a major constraint on the sovereignty of developing countries and that some developing countries have set out to challenge the US dollar usage.
B22|Determinants of CO2 Emissions in Developing Countries using Bayesian Econometric Approach|The attention to sustainable development and the necessity of environmental protection, and also the adverse effects of environmental pollution on development and quality of life all over the world, have made the environmental protection a major concern of economic officials. For this reason, over the recent decades an extensive literature has been devoted to improve environmental quality and its determinants. Therefore, economic analysts have focused on these issues more than before. In this regard, to know the effects of air pollution determinants can contribute economic officials to reduce pollution. This study attempted to investigate the effects of some variables on CO2 (as one of the most important air pollution indicators) in developing countries during 1992-2014 using Bayesian econometrics approach and applying Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA). Finally, according to the theoretical and empirical evidence, it is found that Environmental Kuznets’ hypothesized inverted U-shaped relationship between economic growth and environmental quality is supported by data. The findings of the study also showed that energy consumption, electricity consumption, and the variables related to industrialization have positive and almost important relationship with CO2 emissions. Against, literacy rate and income inequality have negative effects on CO2 emissions.
B22|Risking Capitalism|The growing centrality of risk management in pro-market governance raises important questions regarding how risks are produced, and why? Who and what is included in, and excluded from, risk management, and why? And, what is the relationship between the rise of risk management and neoliberalism? Charting the relationship between risk, contemporary capitalism and its neoliberal modes of governance, Risking Capitalism, addresses these questions by examining - both analytically and empirically - diverse meanings and practices of risk management across a range of scales and themes, ranging from austerity to climate change to housing and debt. The authors investigate the relationship between shifts in contemporary capitalism and the ways in which neoliberal forms of risk management have emerged, been reproduced and normalized, and, transformed historically.
B22|Comparative study of the evolution of the Gross Domestic Product indicator|In this paper, the authors realize a comparative study on the dynamics of the Gross Domestic Product of Romania. This indicator reveals the qualitative and quantitative results that characterize the economy of a country. In the paper, time-based and space-based comparisons are realized, with emphasis on the evolutions recorded in the European Union countries. The interpretation of the indicators analyzed is completed by a coherent set of measures proposed for the development of the Romanian economy.
B22|Using the linear regression model in order to analyse the correlation between the Gross Domestic Product and the household effective individual final consumption|This article aims to review the changes in gross domestic product compared to the progress of the household effective individual final consumption for the 1995-2015 period. By using a series of online data published by the National Institute of Statistics, we will analyse if there is a dependency relationship between the two variables and if so, we will also study the dependence type. By using the statistical-econometric model of simple linear regression, we will notice how a variable y, called dependent variable, can be described using another variable x, called independent variable.
B22|Examining Two of Keynesâ€™s Most Popular Statementsâ€”Wasteful Public Spending Can Be Acceptable, and, In The Long Run We Are All Deadâ€”Yields Some Surprising Implications|Analysis shows that John Maynard Keynes likely interpreted the concept â€œlong runâ€ as reflecting the dimension of calendar time, rather than operational time. More importantly, Keynes was not the advocate of wasteful spending as usually believed. He actually placed strong restrictions on this prescription; it was not an unconditional invitation to raid the public larder. Journalists, politicians, and many economists have overstated his ardor for wasteful spending.
B22|Evalution Of The Relationship Between Of Tax Competition And Tax Haven In The World And Turkey|The country, where the individuals and institutions benefit from public services paying less taxes outside the country, is called tax haven countries.These countries is used as part of economic activities and they are preferred as the center of financial affairs so the phenomenon of interstate competition become a current issue. International tax competition is a tax policy which implementing that economic activity that occurred in another country to take his own country putting a lower tax rate.When taken out the country known as a tax haven it is said that this countries are too small and some of them? name and location in the map are unknown.The purpose of the study is to find out the relationship between of tax competition and tax haven in the World and Turkey. In this direction, firstly on the conceptual framework tax competition and tax havens issues will be discussed. Secondly, the effects of the relationship between tax competition and tax havens on fiscal policy will be examined. Finally, studies conducted on the fight against tax competition and tax havens in the World and Turkey will be examined.
B22|20. Century?s Economic Crises and Their Effects on Turkey?s Economy|Crises has evolved from one country?s or one region?s crisis to global systemic crisis which can affect the whole world because of the fact that overseas of the capital get easy anymore. In this context, the aim of this study examined economic crises which occur in 20. Century and analyzed their effects on Turkey?s economy. 1929 Great Depression Crisis and 1974 crises were global crises in essence whereas 1958, 1994 and 2000-2001 crises have been identified as Turkey-based crises. The reasons of these crises, Turkey?s interventions to get rid of crises and disruptions in country?s economy were analyzed in this study.
B22|Stabilizing Representative Agent in Macroeconomics - The Samuelson-Koopmans Nexus?|Aggregation has been a pesky topic in economics at least since Stanley Jevons’s The Theory of Political Economy, when he resorted to a “fictitious mean” to grasp the complexity of an economy composed of heterogeneous agents. In the twentieth-century context, trade economists have helped deepen the search for a measure of society's overall welfare by which they brought out the concept of community indifference curve whose proofs were first provided in Gorman (1953) and in Samuelson (1956) under highly restrictive assumptions. Since there is a close relationship between community indifference curve and representative consumer, as proved by Samuelson (1956) and acknowledged by various authors such as Chipman (1965), Muellbauer (1976), and Dow and Werlang (1988), the question addressed in this article is: what role did Samuelson (1956) play in the rise of the representative-agent macroeconomics as materialized in the seminal papers by Cass (1965) and by Koopmans (1965) and continued into the traditions of Lucas (1969a, 1975, 1977), Kydland and Prescott (1982) and Prescott (1986)? I claim in this article that although Samuelson and Koopmans belonged to different scientific communities their research interests overlapped. Based also on archival works, this paper narrates how Samuelson’s representative consumer (agent) made it to Koopmans’s and, therefore, ultimately paved the way to today’s macroeconomics.
B22|When Keynes Goes to Brussels: A New Fiscal Rule for the EMU?|The Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) institutions are consistent with a New Consensus that emerged in the 1980s, limiting the role for macroeconomic policy to short term stabilizations by means of rules. I will argue that the policy inertia induced by the Consensus may have played a role in the disappointing performance of EMU economies even before the crisis. The crisis of the Consensus, and the debate on secular stagnation, proved that Keynesian and possibly persistent excesses of savings over investment may hamper growth. This has put fiscal policy back to the center of the scene, and given the General Theory, at eighty, a second youth. I will argue therefore that the EMU fiscal rule should be amended to allow semi-permanent negative government savings. I will finally argue that a modified Golden Rule may serve this objective, and allow EU-wide policy coordination. This seems the only reasonable reform with some chances of being adopted by the EU divided policy makers.
B22|Le retour de l’économie keynésienne|Pre-crisis standard macroeconomic models, qualified as neo Keynesian, rely more on the concept of natural rate of interest than on global demand. But new insights in macroeconomic theory build far more realistic models, especially as regards labour and good and services markets. These models renew with the Keynes intuitions – under-consumption, savings paradox – and are more suitable to reality confrontation. The Keynesian or neo-classical pattern should no more be a political or theoretical stake but rather an empirical one. For example, recent econometric studies highlight that the American economy behaves as Keynesian during the biggest crisis but as non Keynesian during smaller ones. This should be a guide for policy makers. Classification JEL: E12, E13, E17.
B22|Business cycles in the economy and in economics: an econometric analysis|Abstract It is sometimes pointed out that economic research is prone to move in cycles and react to particular events such as crises and recessions. The present paper analyses this issue through a quantitative analysis by answering the research question of whether or not the economic literature on business cycles is correlated with movements and changes in actual economic activity. To tackle this question, a bibliometric analysis of key terms related to business cycle and crises theory is performed. In a second step, these results are confronted with data on actual economic developments in order to investigate the question of whether or not the theoretical literature follows trends and developments in economic data. To determine the connection between economic activity and developments in the academic literature, a descriptive analysis is scrutinized by econometric tests. In the short run, the VARs with cyclical fluctuations point out multiple cases where economic variables Granger-cause bibliometric ones. In the long run, the fractionally cointegrated VARs suggest that many bibliometric variables respond to economic shocks. In the multivariate framework, the Diebold–Mariano test shows that economic variables significantly improve the quality of the forecast of bibliometric indices. The paper also includes impulse-response function analysis for a quantitative assessment of the effects from economic to bibliometric variables. The results point towards a qualified confirmation of the hypothesis of an effect of business cycles and crises in economic variables on discussions in the literature.
B22|Price flexibility and full employment: barking up the wrong (neoclassical) tree|This paper (a revised version of Strathclyde Paper 2004-07) questions the thesis (again in fashion) that price flexibility ensures full employment. (See most standard macro textbooks.) We make the point that explanation of unemployment in terms of price/wage stickiness typified much pre-Keynesian analysis, but not Keynesâ€™s theory of involuntary unemployment. Under uncertainty - an essential aspect of the Keynes conception - no set of prices consistent with full employment may actually exist: if so, price inflexibility is not the critical obstacle to the attainment of full employment. Finally, with respect to current use of the AD/AS model, we note that once-rejected ideas have returned to the mainstream and that the strong arguments against attribution of necessarily beneficent effects to price and wage flexibility, which ought to be well-known, seem now to be forgotten.
B22|When Robertson was Keynesian and Keynes Robertsonian: a discussion between D.H.R. and J.M.K. in the early 1930s and the problems with the Monetary Circuit Theory. A note|Supporters of the Monetary Circuit Theory argue that workers’ or households’ savings may be used to fix firms’ losses and avoid crises. The question is reminiscent of a discussion that took place between Dennis Robertson (DHR) and Keynes on the Treatise (1930) about Keynes’s idea that workers’ savings might cover firms’ losses. In this discussion, DHR denied that savings could correspond to firms’ losses, arguing that savings do not exist independently of investment. Circuitists like Graziani seem to reiterate the Treatise’s mistake of maintaining that part of savings corresponds to firm’s losses and are lent to firms to fix those losses, while neglecting the effects of those losses on output as DHR pointed out in the early 1930s.
B22|Chicago Economics in the Making, 1926-1940. A Further Look at US Interwar Pluralism|The aim of this paper is to unfold a rich body of archival material that can shed new light on the nature and evolution of interwar Chicago economics. Specifically, this paper is based on a scrutiny of the PhD qualifying exams on Economic Theory at Chicago from 1926 to 1940. The qualifying tests (supplemented by the courses’ programs) show the existence of two important turning points in the shaping of Chicago economic training. The first one is in 1927, when John M. Clark, the undisputed leader of the Chicago Department of Economics during the heyday of institutionalism, moved to Columbia, leaving open ground to the restructuring of the courses according to a different and more analytical approach already represented in the Department by Viner and, in a narrower field, by Paul Douglas. The arrival at Chicago of figures such as Knight, Schultz and Simons definitely shifted the balance toward neoclassical theory. A second turning point occurred in 1933 when the qualifying test in Economic Theory was divided into two major fields: price and distribution theory on the one side; money and business cycle on the other. This innovation reveals the importance acquired by monetary theory in economic training at a time that is commonly associated with the nurturing of what was later named as the “Chicago monetary tradition.”
B22|The Theory and Models of Keynesian Disequilibrium Macroeconomics|This paper critically reviews and examines the relationship between the origin of disequilibrium macroeconomic thinking by John Maynard Keynes, and the development of Keynesian disequilibrium macroeconomic models. Given that the two strands of literature are both plentiful, I will focus on discussing the essence of Keynesian disequilibrium thinking, and its implications of relevant models in the context of Keynes-Metzler-Goodwin and Weidlich-Haag-Lux approaches.
B22|The Relationship Between External Debt And Economic Growth In The West African Monetary Zone: A Panel Data Analysis|This study analyzes trends and investigates the relationship between external debt and economic growth in the WAMZ using descriptive trend analysis and panel data analysis. The trend and descriptive analysis assessed the behavior of external debt and economic growth while the empirical analyses employed panel data regression in which a fixed effect model was estimated after the implementation of the Hausman test to verify its appropriateness over the random effect model. The fixed effect model and the dynamic version show that the relationship between external debt and growth in the WAMZ is non-linear “Laffer curve” shaped, confirming the debt overhang theory that the accumulation of external debt beyond a certain threshold adversely affects economic growth. The results also confirm the crowding-out effect of rising external debt stock as the co-efficient of external debt service was negative and statistically significant, indicating that rising debt service associated with high levels of external debt stock limits the use of limited resources (revenue) from being channeled to productive public investments that would accelerate economic growth.
B22|A Review Essay on GDP: A Brief but Affectionate History by Diane Coyle|"GDP, the most fundamental concept of aggregate economics, is often misunderstood and misused. In a brief book, Diane Coyle attempts to demystify and clarify the concept by providing what she calls ""an affectionate history."" The product is a lucid and clear presentation that however must come with a caution sign. The story is often incomplete, and what it does contain is not always accurate. Among the salient and controversial topics discussed are the adequacy of GDP for the twenty-first century, the deficiencies of GDP as a measure of welfare, and the strange way in which banking services are calculated."
B22|From real business cycle and new Keynesian to DSGE Macroeconomics: facts and models in the emergence of a consensus|Macroeconomists have emphasized the force of facts in forging a consensus understanding of business cycle fluctuations. According to this view, rival economists could no longer hold disparate views on the topic because “facts have a way of not going away” (Blanchard 2009). But how can macroeconomists observe the workings of an economy? Essentially through building and manipulating models. Thus the construction of macroeconomic facts –or “stylized facts”–, empirical regularities that come to be widely accepted, opens up technical spaces where macroeconomists negotiated their theoretical commitments and eventually allowed a consensus to emerge. I argue that this is an important element in the history of the DSGE macroeconomics.
B22|Some Notes On Problematic Issues In Dsge Models|We review some of the problematic issues in DSGE models, which are currently much discussed in the economics profession. All of these issues are concerned with the DSGE models’ (in)ability to match aspects of macroeconomic variables’ observed behaviour. The optimizing agents framework implies that Ricardian equivalence typically holds, which is clearly at odds with the empirical evidence. A distinguishing feature of DSGE models is the assumption that structural parameters are invariant to policy changes. We argue that not all of them can be considered independent from economic policy. It is typical for DSGE models that agents form rational expectations, which can be considered unrealistic. The typical procedure for estimating a DSGE model is to use revised data. As some empirical studies suggest, a model’s behaviour may be different if real-time data are considered. It is also usually assumed that the monetary authority uses the interest rate as a tool of monetary policy. Nowadays, nominal interest rates are close to zero in many economies and cannot be lowered further.
B22|How Friedman and Schwartz Became Monetarists|During the earlyâ€ 1940s, both Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz downplayed the role of money in the economy. By the midâ€ 1950s, they had not only become what later were called monetarists, but the findings from their joint work defined monetarism. The key factor underlying the change in their views was what they learned from their study of U.S. historical experience, especially their empirical confirmation of the Fed's role in the Great Depression. Here, the influence of Clark Warburton on Friedman's thinking loomed large. We document Friedman's advocacy of the constantâ€ moneyâ€ growth rule as an outgrowth of his and Schwartz's empirical research.
B22|Joseph A. Schumpeter: Ein Pionier der Makrofinanz|Since the outbreak of the Great Financial Crisis in 2007, „Macrofinance“ has evolved as an exciting field for economists. The idea of marrying macroeconomics and financial economics has a long tradition, however, which should not remain buried in almost forgotten books. A couple of seemingly new ideas can be traced back to the work of the eminent economist Joseph A. Schumpeter. His dynamic model of the business cycle is built upon a close interaction between entrepreneurs and banks. Fire-sales of assets, liquidity spirals and feedback loops can turn a mild recession into a devastating depression. Schumpeter’s analysis of the role of monetary policy bears a striking resemblance to contemporary discussions.
B22|The New Keynesian Theory And Its Associated Model|The basic new Keynesian model rendered in this paper, as well as the analysis of the reaction of economic variables to the occurrence of a structural, monetary policy shock, strengthen the hypothesis exposed at pure theoretical level, namely the active role of Central Banks in economy, the classical dichotomy between the nominal and the real economic factors being abandoned. As reflected by the impulse-response function graphs, the model endogenous variables: output, output gap, labour hours, inflation rate, nominal interest rate and real interest rate, clearly react to the exogenous variables of the same, represented by structural shocks, returning afterwards, more or less quickly, to their initial steady state. In compliance with the literature in the matter, the monetary entity policies, although having a lower impact than the one generated by the technological changes, manifest obvious influences on the model variables, therefore affecting both the decisions of the representative agents, at microeconomic level, and the aggregate economy, as a whole.
B22|R&D, Export, and Investment Decision|This paper provides an empirical analysis of the mechanism through which R&D and export influence investment decision. The analysis is based on a large representative and cross-country comparative sample of manufacturing firms across seven European countries. To control for reverse causality between export decision and R&D spending and investment, we use an instrumental variable analysis to overcome the problem of endogeneity. Employing a three step procedure, it is assumed that R&D decision is endogenously determined by receiving public subsidies, and, in turn, affect investments through its impact on engagement by the firm in international trade. The results suggest that R&D positively affects export propensity. We find that there is an average increase in propensity to invest for those firms which decide to engage in R&D activities. The results also reveal that the effect of decision to export on investment behaviour is positive and highly significant, when accounting for endogeneity of export activity.
B22|Ochenta Años de la Teoría General 1936-2016|Este ensayo celebra los ochenta años de la Teoría General (1936-2016). El objetivo principal es resaltar el principio de la demanda efectiva como la más grande contribución teórica de JM Keynes a la economía para explicar el nivel del PIB y el empleo, en la economía capitalista, y sus fluctuaciones. Además, se hace hincapié en el capítulo 24, donde se analizan los problemas de la distribución del ingreso y la riqueza, en relación con el nivel de la demanda efectiva. Los altos niveles de desempleo y los bajos niveles de PIB que sufre la economía mundial, desde la crisis de 2008 hasta hoy, se han enfrentado con la eliminación o reducción del gasto gubernamental. Esta situación significa una gran inseguridad económica para millones de personas que no solo tienen que enfrentar el desempleo cíclico, sino también el desempleo tecnológico, con una mayor desigualdad del ingreso. Este no es un mundo keynesiano; éste es un mundo infeliz.
B22|Paul Anthony Samuelson and his work (on the hundredth anniversary of his birth)|Aim: The purpose of this article is an attempt to systematise and evaluate the achievements of the American Nobel laureate in economic sciences and co-founder of ‘neoclassical synthesis’ — P.A. Samuelson. Motivation: This economist greatly developed the methodology and theory of economics. Preferring the mathematical method in scientific inquiry and introducing new graphic solutions, he contributed to the mathematisation of economics. He enriched the theory of consumption by revealed preferences, devised the 45° line to determine the Keynesian short-term equilibrium in the goods market, as well as the consumer demand, investment demand, and savings function curves, and he also defined collective goods. He completed the theory of division with the modified Lorenz curve, presented the problem of the allocation of scarce resources by the curve of production possibilities, and generalised — together with R.M. Solow — the Phillips curve. In addition, he created a model of the interdependence of the multiplier and accelerator, and developed the theory of foreign trade by the ‘Stolper-Samuelson effect’ and the statement of the impact of prices of production factors on the allocation of resources. Results: Caring for affordability of the exposition of basic economic knowledge contained in his textbook Economics, he made a revolution in the teaching of economics. Owing to these achievements, P.A. Samuelson earned his inclusion in the circle of the greatest economists of the twentieth century.
B22|Milton Friedman y sus visitas a Chile|This essay describes the main circumstances, facts and consequences of Milton Friedman’s two visits to Chile, in 1975 and 1981. Both visits are analyzed and the relationship between economic freedom and political liberty developed by Friedman is emphasized.
B22|Sobre las virtudes y los vicios de la economía|No abstract is available for this item.
B22|A Review of James Forder, Macroeconomics and the Phillips Curve Myth, Oxford University Press, 2014|In this review, I argue that Forder makes a fine job in debunking the story told by Friedman in his Nobel prize lecture about the Phillips curve yet fails to assess the validity of Phelps’s and Friedman’s contributions to the Phillips curve theory.
B22|The Evolution Of Endogenous Business Cycles|This paper distinguishes between two kinds of Endogenous Business Cycle models, and discusses the evolution from first generation EBC1 models to second generation EBC2 models. I argue that EBC1 models, which display dynamic indeterminacy, are part of the evolution of modern macroeconomics that has classical roots dating back to the 1920s. EBC2 models, which display steady-state indeterminacy, are a more radical departure from the classical Real Business Cycle model; they represent a return to one of the most important ideas to emerge from Keynes' (1936) General Theory; that high involuntary unemployment can persist as part of the steady-state equilibrium of a market economy.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
B22|The Relationship among Real Gross Domestic Product, CO2 Emissions, and Energy use in South Caucasus and Turkey|The paper analyses the relationship among real gross domestic product (GDP), CO2 emissions and energy use in South Caucasus countries and Turkey over the 1992-2013 years. Results of unit root tests show that all variables are integrated of order one. In general, cointegration tests with breaks suggest the presence of a long-run relationship between these variables. Causality results suggest that “conservation hypothesis” holds for Armenia; while, for Azerbaijan and Georgia, we reached mixed results, since both “feedback hypothesis” and “growth hypothesis” received support by empirical findings. Finally, no evidence of causality emerges for Turkey, in favour of “neutrality hypothesis.” Therefore, the relevant policy implication of the study is that a common energy policy strategy would not be pursued by these countries, given the different causality links emerged in the area.
B22|Revisiting the accelerator principle in a world of uncertainty: Some empirical evidence|This contribution builds on the accelerator model to produce an investment function in which employment and households' investment are used as proxies for economic activity. This analysis identifies a positive correlation between corporate investment in fixed assets and households' investment in dwellings. Using a panel of 11 OECD countries for the period 1970–2010, the results also confirm that oil prices and interest rates may dampen firms' investment in fixed assets. An interesting feature of this investment function is that it accounts for uncertainty.
B22|Central bank transparency and the consensus forecast: What does The Economist poll of forecasters tell us?|We are interested, in this paper, in studying the effects that central bhat transparency is a prerequisite for accanks exert on private sector forecasts by means of their transparency and communication measures. We analyze the impact of central bank transparency on the accuracy of the consensus forecasts (usually calculated as the mean or the median of the forecasts from a panel of individual forecasters) for a series of macroeconomic variables: inflation, Real output growth and the current account as a share of GDP for 7 advanced economies. Interestingly, while it is found of significance of central bank transparency and communication measures on forecasts themselves, there appear some limits of the same measures when we study their impact on forecast errors. Our findings, indeed, suggest that deviations of the economic forecast data from the realized ones (RGDP and the current account as a share of GDP) are a bit affected by the central bank transparency measures considered in the paper. Inflation forecast errors, especially, are not affected at all by those measures. A possible explanation (among others) could be attributed to the inefficiency of the mean forecasts. Inefficiency of the consensus forecasts is not a new issue from a theoretical point of view, but its empirical relevance is for the first time (to our knowledge) questioned on data extracted from the Economist poll of forecasters. More particularly, our paper extracts practical implications over the effectiveness of transparent announcements in forecast formation process. We rely on two noisy information models, though having different mechanisms (Kim et al., 2001; Morris and Shin, 2002) both of which are consistent with overweighting issue to explain the inefficiency of the consensus forecast.
B22|Theories of stagnation in historical perspective|This article traces some of the historical roots of current debates about secular economic stagnation, involving L. Summers, R. Gordon, and others. We focus on early contributions by Alvin Hansen and John A. Hobson. Although Hansen has been the main influence on the secular stagnation literature, Hobson's suggested link between economic inequality and stagnation is of interest in view of T. Piketty's recent claim about the connection between slower growth and inequality. E. Domar and P. Samuelson, Hansen's students at Harvard, elaborated economic growth and multiplier-accelerator models as follow-ups to Hansen's original treatment. Domar called attention to Hobson's insight about underconsumption, increasing capacity, and deficient aggregate demand. We conclude that the range of positions held today concerning stagnation and inequality is large, as it was earlier in the history of thought.
B22|Secular stagnation or stagnation policy? A post-Steindlian view|The current debate on secular stagnation is suffering from some vagueness and several other shortcomings. The same is true for the economic policy implications. Therefore, I provide an alternative view on stagnation tendencies based on Josef Steindl's contributions. In particular Steindl's (1952) book can be viewed as a pioneering work in the area of stagnation in modern capitalism. I hold that this work is not prone to the problems detected in the current debate on secular stagnation: it does not rely on the dubious notion of an equilibrium real interest rate as the equilibrating force of saving and investment at full employment levels, in principle, with the adjustment process currently blocked by the unfeasibility of a very low or even negative equilibrium rate. On the contrary, Steindl's contribution is based on the notion that modern capitalist economies are facing aggregate demand constraints, and that saving adjusts to investment through changes in capacity utilisation and income growth in the long run. It allows for potential growth to become endogenous to actual demand-driven growth. And it seriously considers the role of institutions, power relationships and economic policies for long-run growth â€“ and for stagnation.
B22|Unravelling the New Classical Counter Revolution|To understand the position of Keynesâ€™s The General Theory today, and why so many policy-makers felt they had to go back to it to understand the Great Recession, we need to understand the New Classical Counter Revolution (NCCR), and why it was so successful. This revolution can be seen as having two strands. The first, which attempted to replace Keynesian policy, failed. The second, which was to change the way academic macroeconomics was done, was successful. Before the NCCR, macroeconomics was an intensely empirical discipline: something made possible by the developments in statistics and econometrics inspired by The General Theory. After the NCCR and its emphasis on microfoundations, it became much more deductive. As a result, most academic macroeconomists today would see the foundation of their discipline as not coming from The General Theory, but as coming from basic microeconomic theory â€“ arguably the â€˜classical theoryâ€™ that Keynes was so keen to cast aside. Students are also taught that pre-NCCR methods of analysing the economy are fatally flawed, and that simulating DSGE models is the only proper way of doing policy analysis. This is simply wrong. The problem with the NCCR was not the emergence of microfoundations modelling, which is a progressive research programme, but that it discouraged the methods of analysis that had flourished after The General Theory. I argue that, had there been more academic interest in these alternative forms of analysis, the discipline would have been better prepared ahead of the financial crisis.
B22|Keynes and the European economy|We argue in this paper that Keynes was interested primarily in the world economy. We do not seek to diminish the innovative advances Keynes made in The General Theory; we instead want to expand the perceived scope of Keynesian economics. We make this argument by analysing Keynes's contributions at three points during his career: writing The Economic Consequences of the Peace just after the First World War, testifying before the Macmillan Committee at the outset of the Great Depression, and negotiating at Bretton Woods during and after the Second World War. We then show how international Keynesian analysis clarifies the economic problems of Europe today.
B22|How Keynes came to Britain|I explore how Keynesian ideas made their way into British public policy. I argue that the breakdown of pre-First World War macroeconomic conditions led to a â€˜blockedâ€™ system, where the adjustment mechanisms presupposed by classical economics were jammed, and that Keynesian economics offered an escape from this system. I explain the Keynesian response to the new problems in monetary and fiscal policy: the gold standard impeding credit control, and the tenacity of the balanced budget rule, respectively. Finally, I outline how Keynesâ€™s ideas took hold after the Great Depression via the events at the Macmillan Committee, and their policy implications.
B22|Curried Keynesianism meets the master: Lauchlin Currie's memorandum on The General Theory for the Federal Reserve Board|This short paper introduces Lauchlin Currie's unpublished memorandum to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve discussing Keynes's General Theory. The memorandum falls short of a full review of Keynes's magnum opus, but together with other published material it provides a picture of Keynesian ideas within the Fed during the Great Depression. It is suggested that Currie's views on Keynes are relevant, in particular because, contrary to what would become the dominant view, he does not think that wage or interest-rate rigidity is at the heart of the Keynesian results.
B22|Two minds that never met: Frank H. Knight on John M. Keynes once again â€“ a documentary note. Perham C. Nahl's notes from Frank H. Knight's course on Business Cycles, University of California, 1936|This note presents new archival evidence about Frank H. Knight's views on John M. Keynes. The relevant material is composed of a series of lecture notes taken by Perham C. Nahl in Frank H. Knight's course on Business Cycles at the University of California at Berkeley in the fall of 1936. It emerges from the notes that the methodological gap between Keynes and Knight was irreducible, which explains the harsh tone of Knight's published review of The General Theory. Connected to this is Knight's strenuous defense of the â€˜postulates of classical political economyâ€™ as criticized by Keynes in chapter 2 of his book, an argument that was better expounded in the classroom than in the review. However, besides strong criticisms, a few constructive remarks can also be found in the notes. In criticizing Keynes, Knight proposed an interesting analysis of the business cycle that he did not develop in the published review of The General Theory, and there is even some evidence that Knight was attracted to Keynes's discussion of â€˜liquidity preference.â€™
B22|Distribution-led growth in the long run|This paper examines the long-run fluctuations in growth and distribution through the prism of wage- and profit-led growth. It argues that the relation between distribution of income and growth changes over time and proposes an endogenous mechanism that leads to fluctuations between wage- and profit-led periods. The ephemeral character of distribution-led regimes needs to be taken into account when someone estimates empirically the effect of a change in distribution on utilization and growth. The model is a linear version of Goodwin's predatorâ€“prey model, but with a reversal of the roles for predator and prey; this is another way to conceptualize the symbiosis between the two classes within a capitalist economy. The aforementioned argument is also examined in relation to the double movement of Karl Polanyi and the inverse U-shaped curve proposed by Simon Kuznets.
B22|Inequality Fragility Hypothesis|The last four decades have been marked by growing inequality. The inequality of income and wealth is one of the most important macroeconomic issues of our time. Inequality contributed to Global Savings Glut and Global Financial Crisis through riskiness channel and a greater propensity to borrow for poor people. This paper presents evidence that besides structural factors, monetary policy, high leverage and the development of new money substitutes are critical in explaining the inequality trend in advanced countries. Increasing economic inequality acts as financial instability enhancer and if left untreated it poses a significant threat to economic sustainability.
B22|The Impact of Key Monetary Variables on the Economic Growth of the CEMAC Zone|This study seeks to empirically explore the impact of key monetary policy variables on the economic growth in the CEMAC zone from the period of 1981 to 2015. Carried out using the Ex post facto research design based on the principal components selection approach, the study interacts money supply, interest rate, economic growth, and inflation rate, among themselves and their lagged values using the Vector Auto-regressive (VAR) analytical technique. The Classical quantity theory of money, the Cambridge Cash Balanced, the liquidity preference theory and the Monetarists as theoretical frameworks were explored to appreciate the time trends of the selected variables on the economic growth of the CEMAC zone. Based on the (VAR) methodology, the study reveals that key monetary policy variables influence economic growth of the CEMAC zone in different ways with inflation rate as the impact factor. On the basis of the above findings and the evidence from other studies, lending and inflation rate generated substantial destabilizing impacts on the economic growth, suggesting that the monetary authorities should play a critical role in creating an enabling environment for growth. The determination of the optimal lending rate should reflect the overall internal rate of returns in the productive sectors with due attention to market fundamentals. In line with this, the Central Bank of CEMAC should be given complete instrumental autonomy to operate depending on a set of in-built targets by the individual countries of the zone. Effective monetary targeting and accommodating monetary policies should be designed and implemented as the need arises with little or no political motives.
B22|How Full is Full Employment?How Tools and Not Theory Explained Full Employment|The post-war debate on full employment policy was blurred and unclear since the concept of full employment itself was theoretically unclear and un-operational. Unable to theoretically determine the unemployment level of full employment, economists tried to find more empirically based ways to determine the level of full employment. This paper argues that economists turned the UV curve (or Beveridge curve) and Phillips curve into practical, empirical tools of investigation and measurement for full employment. In this role economists could establish quantitative facts of unemployment that were not derivable from theory alone and so fulfilled the role of a measuring instrument in economics. Consequently, they not only enhanced theory but gave specific, quantitative and empirically based interpretations of full employment that economic theory couldn’t deliver. This paper shows how the UV and Phillips curves became tools for disentangling complex and theoretically underdetermined phenomena and measurement devices for the performance of the labour market.
B22|Fighting Past Economic Wars: Crisis and Austerity in Latin America|Political economy theory expects that changes in macroeconomic governance are often catalyzed by institutional factors, such as partisanship or elections. I challenge and contextualize this view by incorporating the role of technocratic advisors into a domestic policymaking framework. I contend that structural and elite-level explanations are also important to understanding ideational shifts, particularly in regions like Latin America that suffer from severe economic volatility. Presidents tend to govern from the lens of their crisis past, appointing economic hawks (or mainstream economists) who embrace austerity in the shadow of inflation crises, and economic doves (heterodox economists) who drift from budget discipline following unemployment shocks. Employing an originally constructed data index, the Index of Economic Advisors, I conduct a statistical test of 16 Latin American countries from 1960 to 2011, finding support for sustained idological shifts in technocratic composition and fiscal governance, based on the nature of past shocks.
B22|Criticizing the Lucas Critique: Macroeconometricians' Response to Robert Lucas|The standard history of macroeconomics considers Lucas (1976)– “the Lucas Critique” –as a path-breaking innovation for the discipline. According to this view Lucas's article dismissed the traditional macroeconometric practice calling for new ways of conceiving the quantitative evaluation of economic policies. The Lucas Critique is considered, nowadays, as a fundamental principle of macroeconomic modeling (Woodford, 2003). The interpretation and the application of the Critique, however, represent still unsolved issues in economics (Chari et al., 2008). Even if the influence of Lucas's contribution cannot be neglected, something seems to be missing in the narrative: the reactions of the economists that were directly targeted by the Critique. Modeling practices of economic policy evaluation were not overthrown immediately after Lucas (1976), creating a divide between theoretical and applied macroeconomics (Brayton et al., 1977). The purpose of this paper is to study the reactions of the macroeconometricians criticized by Lucas. We focus especially on those macroeconometricians who worked on policy evaluation and who held an expertise position in governmental institutions. We categorize the different reactions to the Critique, in order to enrich the understanding of the evolution of modeling and expertise practices through the analysis of the debates–which have not yet been completely solved. In the first section, we propose a careful account of Lucas's argument and of some of the previous works anticipating the substantial outline of the Critique (like Frisch's notion of autonomy). Second, we bring our own interpretation of Lucas (1976). We think that we find two points of view in Lucas paper: a prescriptive one that tell you how to build a good macroeconometric model (it is the standard interpretation of the article); a positive one that relies on the fact that the Lucas critique could be seen as an attempt to explain a real-world phenomenon, the stagflation. Third, we classify the reactions of the Keynesian macroeconometricains following this line of interpretation. On the prescriptive side, the Keynesians protested against the New Classical solution to the Lucas critique (the use of the rational expectation hypothesis among other things). Klein, for instance, proposed an alternative microfoundational programme to study more empirically the formation of expectations. On the positive side, the Keynesians put into question the relevance of the Lucas Critique to explain the rise of both unemployment and inflation in the 1970s. They tried to test the impact of policy regime changes and of shifts in agents behaviour. According to us, in general, the explanation of the stagflation was elsewhere
B22|The Dollar dominance : recent episode of trade invoicing and debt issuance|The international monetary system is known to be asymmetric given the dominant use of a few international currencies. The international trade of developing countries is mainly invoiced in US dollars, unlike industrialized countries which invoice a much higher share of their exports in their home currencies. The same logic is at work in the issuance of international debt. While the attempts to challenge the supremacy of the US dollars have failed in most cases, China is coming to the fore and is increasing its use of the Renminbi, even supported by its growing recognition within the International Monetary Fund. By reassessing the relevance of existing academic works, this paper demonstrates how monetary asymmetries have been reinforced in recent decades, and offers explanations related to currency choices. Finally, this paper offers the conclusion that international monetary reform is necessary. One cannot overlook that the monetary system embodies a major constraint on the sovereignty of developing countries and that some developing countries have set out to challenge the US dollar usage
B22|Granting China The Market Economy Status And Its Impact On The Eu Member States|The existence of a transitory provision in China’s Protocol of Accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) permitted the country’s status of non-market economy to be maintained for aperiod of 15 years, which materialized in the possibility to treat imports from China differently in order to protect the European Union (EU) market against dumping prices. As this clause is going to expire at the beginning of December 2016, the EU will have to adopt a position regarding the official recognition of China as a market economy, thus assuming also the possible economic implications brought about by this kind of decision. In this context, the present paper aims to assess the effects of this option on the EU economy, as well as to briefly overview the measures taken in order to safeguard fair competition and avoid future market distortions.
B22|What Have We Learned from the 2007-08 Financial Crisis? Papers Presented at the Second International Workshop on Financial Markets and Nonlinear Dynamics (Paris, June 4-5, 2015)|Abstract This note introduces eight studies presented at the second International Workshop on Financial Markets and Nonlinear Dynamics (FMND), organized in Paris on June 4–5, 2015 ( www.fmnd.fr ). These studies focus, first, on the main effects of the recent financial crisis of 2008–2009. Second, they discuss consequences of the global economic downturn of 2008–09. To do this, the authors focus on the main effects on real economies and financial systems of the financial crisis and then sum up the key reforms, recommendations and new rules and challenges that emerged from the crisis. For each paper under consideration, the economic theory and/or hypothesis suggested is illustrated through an empirical investigation.
B22|Political business cycles 40 years after Nordhaus|Abstract The aim of this article is to survey the huge literature that has emerged in the last four decades following Nordhaus’s (Rev Econ Stud 42(2):169–190, 1975) publication on political business cycles (PBCs). I first propose some developments in history of thought to examine the context in which this ground-breaking contribution saw the light of the day. I also present a simplified version of Nordhaus’s model to highlight his key results. I detail some early critiques of this model and the fields of investigations to which they gave birth. I then focus on the institutional context and examine its influence on PBCs, the actual research agenda. Finally, I derive some paths for future research.
B22|Hayek’s monetary theory and policy: A note on alleged inconsistency|Challenging the dominant view, we claim that Hayek’s monetary views did not significantly change over his lifetime. The prevalent perception of early Hayek as a money stream stabilizer and late Hayek as a price level stabilizer is attributable to an unjustified normative interpretation of Hayek’s positive analysis. We argue that in his contributions to monetary theory, Hayek took the goals of monetary policy as exogenously given and analysed the efficiency of different means of achieving them. Hayek’s allegedly inconsistent transformation from a critic to an advocate of price level stabilization is explained by a change of issues under his focus, rather than by a change in his positive views. We also claim that Hayek was always aware that every practical monetary policy involves difficult trade-offs and that he was therefore reluctant to impose his own value judgments on what people should strive for.

B22|Truth or precision? Some reflections on the economists’ failure to predict the financial crisis|Abstract The failure of professional economic forecasters to predict the financial crises has led many to question the credibility of modern economics as a reliable foundation for economic policy. If economists were unable to foresee so big a crisis, how can they be trusted to cure or prevent it? Several accounts of this failure exist. The paper offers a tentative answer based on the lessons that may be drawn from the wisdom of a short list of past and present economists: Hayek, Neville Keynes, Mankiw, Tinbergen, Maynard Keynes and Lucas. The glue to keep such an odd bunch together is the distinction between truth and precision provided by science historian Ted Porter.
B22|Scott B. Sumner, The Midas Paradox: Financial Markets, Government Policy Shocks, and the Great Depression|In a study with detailed evidence and technical economics, Scott Sumner seeks to explain both the monetary origins of the Great Depression (1929-1932) and its persistence due to government-driven wage shocks (1933-1941). He credits the Mundell-Johnson hypothesis, based on the post WWI undervaluation and shortage of gold, with identifying the deflationary pressure that led to monetary distress. Sumner concludes that interest rates, money supply, and price changes provide inadequate measures of the stance of monetary policy. Sumner’s most important evidence supports his arguments that, first, raising the price of gold in 1933 facilitated price inflation and rapid recovery after years of deflation; and second, that several Roosevelt-era recoveries were stopped in their tracks by New Deal-driven real wage increases. The 1937-38 depression was caused by Treasury sterilization of gold inflows, but aggravated by unionization drives and wage increases. Reviewer considers Sumner’s critique of Keynesian economics, and adds overview to identify two areas where Keynes’ “revolution” set back understanding. He then moves to some intra-New Deal dynamics and to some recent political economy parallels.
B22|Unified Growth Theory Contradicted by the Absence of Takeoffs in the Gross Domestic Product|Data describing historical economic growth are analysed. They demonstrate convincingly that the take offs from stagnation to growth, claimed in the Unified Growth Theory, never happened. This theory is again contradicted by the same data which were used, but never properly analysed, during its formulation. The absence of the claimed takeoffs demonstrates that the postulate of the differential takeoffs is also contradicted by data. Furthermore, this analysis demonstrates that the mathematically-analysable data contradict the concept of the prolonged Malthusian stagnation, its effects on the economic growth as well as the concept of a dramatic escape from the Malthusian trap.
B22|Mathematical Analysis of the Historical Economic Growth with a Search for Takeoffs from Stagnation to Growth|Data describing historical economic growth are analysed. Included in the analysis is the world and regional economic growth. The analysis demonstrates that historical economic growth had a natural tendency to follow hyperbolic distributions. Parameters describing hyperbolic distributions have been determined. A search for takeoffs from stagnation to growth produced negative results. This analysis throws a new light on the interpretation of the mechanism of the historical economic growth and suggests new lines of research.
B22|Did Keynes Make His Case?|Paper considers Keynes’ case for fiscal stimulus under depression conditions – a case that remains prominent in both policy and academic literature. It highlights four specific real-history instances where, Keynes argued, monetary measures alone would not have restored prosperity and, hence, where fiscal activism would have been desirable. These were: 1) the depression of the 1890s; 2) the onset of the Great Depression in 1930; 3) the Roosevelt Recovery in 1933; and 4) the 1937-38 contraction in the US. But evidence from all four instances, gathered here, undermines Keynes’ claims... Paper then shifts to Keynes’ theoretical rationale, where it turns out that the frequently-cited “liquidity trap” argument was only one of several he advanced for monetary policy ineffectiveness. And it was not the one he most-often emphasized, while his own texts raise doubt about its coherence. Keynes view of Depression was intertwined with the stagnationist temper of economic theory during the middle 1930s, and with his cultural and aesthetic distaste for “capitalist individualism.” The weakness of Keynes’ real-history illustrations reflects in part Keynes’ flawed underlying critique of “classical” theory – a critique that, because it was so prominent, has often set back understanding. Keynes did not make his case.
B22|Scientifically Unacceptable Established Knowledge in Demography and in Economic Research|The established knowledge in demography and in the economic research is based on the concept of Malthusian stagnation and on the associated concept of the escape from the Malthusian trap. These two fundamental concepts were gradually enforced by numerous other related postulates all aimed at explaining the mechanism of the historical growth of population and of the historical economic growth. Examples of publications based on the established knowledge are closely examined. They are used to show why the established knowledge is scientifically unacceptable. It is also pointed out that the established knowledge is contradicted by data and by their analyses. Interpretations of the historical economic growth and of the historical growth of population has to be based on accepting hyperbolic growth. However, the discussed examples point to a more serious problem in these two fields of research. It is a fundamental systemic problem, the problem associated with the way research is conducted. Doctrines, interpretations and declarations used by the established knowledge have to be accepted by faith. Data are either ignored or manipulated to support preconceived ideas. Contradicting evidence is methodically ignored. To be recognised as science, demographic and economic research has to adhere to the scientific rules of investigation.
B22|Growth of the World Population in the Past 12,000 Years and Its Link to the Economic Growth|Data describing the growth of the world population in the past 12,000 yearsare analysed. It is shown that,if unchecked, population does not increase exponentially but hyperbolically. This analysis reveals three approximately-determined episodes of hyperbolic growth: 10,000-500 BC, AD 500-1200 and AD 1400-1950, representing a total of about 89% of the past 12,000 years. It also reveals three demographic transitions: 500 BC-AD 500, AD 1200-1400 and AD 1950-present, representing the remaining 11% of the past 12,000 years. The first two transitions were between sustained hyperbolic trajectories. The current transition is to an unknown trajectory. There was never any form of dramatic transition from stagnation to growth, described often as a takeoff, because there was no stagnation in the growth of the world population. Correct understanding of the historical growth of human population is essential in the correct interpretation of the historical growth of income per capita.
B22|Distribution-led Growth through Methodological Lenses|"This paper presents a methodological discussion of two recent ""endogeneity"" critiques of the Kaleckian model and the concept of distribution-led growth. From a neo-Keynesian perspective, and following Kaldor (1955) and Robinson (1956), the model is criticized because it treats distribution as quasi-exogenous, while in Skott (2016) distribution is viewed as endogenously determined by a series of (exogenous) institutional factors and social norms, and therefore one should focus on these instead of the functional distribution of income per se. The paper discusses how abstraction is used in science and economics, and employs the criteria proposed by Lawson (1989) for what constitutes an appropriate abstraction. Based on this discussion, it concludes that the criticisms are not valid, although the issues raised by Skott provide some interesting directions for future work within the Kaleckian framework."
B22|The New Classical Explanation of the Stagflation: A Psychological Way of Thinking|The stagflation phenomenon is regarded as one of the cause of the Keynesian paradigm breakdown in the 1970s. The New Classical school took advantage of this breakdown. However, its discourse on the stagflation was not so clear and remained in a implicit shape. The paper aim at rebuilding the New Classical tale of the stagflation that stroke the United-States economy in the 1970s. We show that psychological ideas (expectations, beliefs, credibility) lay in the heart of the explanation. In the same time, oil shocks were left in the background. Besides, the New Classical school put much more emphasis on the inflation issue and experienced some difficulties to deal with the increase in unemployment
B22|La Belgique et l’Europe dans la tourmente monétaire des années 1970 - Entretiens avec Jacques van Ypersele|Jacques van Ypersele de Strihou is a discrete person but well-known in Belgian and international political and economic circles. After an outstanding academic career at the Universities of Namur, Leuven and Louvain and then at Yale in the United States where he gained a PhD, he started out his professional life as an official at the International Monetary Fund. He then returned to Belgium where he held important posts in various Finance Ministers’ cabinets. He played a major role in European and international monetary negotiations, notably in his capacity as President of the European Monetary Committee when the European Monetary System was being set up. Later, as head of Prime Minister Wilfried Martens’ cabinet, he was one of the architects of the 1982 devaluation of the Belgian franc. Discretion and modesty prevented Jacques van Ypersele from talking about himself much. He took some convincing before agreeing to be interviewed. The end result was these three interviews which took place at his home between June and October 2015 which he re-read the following summer. We were also given access to his private archives, the source of the documents published in the Annex.
B22|Communicating Uncertainty in Official Economic Statistics: An Appraisal Fifty Years after Morgenstern|Federal statistical agencies in the United States and analogous agencies elsewhere commonly report official economic statistics as point estimates, without accompanying measures of error. Users of the statistics may incorrectly view them as error free or may incorrectly conjecture error magnitudes. This paper discusses strategies to mitigate misinterpretation of official statistics by communicating uncertainty to the public. Sampling error can be measured using established statistical principles. The challenge is to satisfactorily measure the various forms of nonsampling error. I find it useful to distinguish transitory statistical uncertainty, permanent statistical uncertainty, and conceptual uncertainty. I illustrate how each arises as the Bureau of Economic Analysis periodically revises GDP estimates, the Census Bureau generates household income statistics from surveys with nonresponse, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics seasonally adjusts employment statistics. I anchor my discussion of communication of uncertainty in the contribution of Oskar Morgenstern (1963a), who argued forcefully for agency publication of error estimates for official economic statistics.

B22|New dynamic disequilibrium|The series of financial crises shook seriously the new consensus between neoclassical and new Keynesians on dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. The criticisms were directed mainly to inadequate policy of monetary institutions and the inability of these models to foresee similar crises. In the ensuing debate on the future of macroeconomic theory two approaches were outlined: (1) Combination of alternative economic theories in new, free framework that ignores DSGE models; and (2) Critical analysis of the shortcomings of the DSGE models that enrich them with new ideas and methodological instruments. This article belongs to the second approach and presents DSGE models through the lens of new, non-Walrasian's version of the dynamic disequilibrium. Unlike neo-Walrasian disequilibrium, not the natural equilibrium prices of Smith and Marshall, but the natural rate of Wicksell are put in the role of a gravity center. Endogenezation of capital allows the model to involve the problem of intertemporal coordination, which is pathological for the economy and leads to financial crises.
B22|Dinero, circuito monetario y estado estacionario en la economía monetaria de producción|El ensayo considera el circuito económico de una economía monetaria de producción. La exposición de las transacciones financieras, productivas y comerciales entre los agentes económicos en el sistema de mercados exige una contabilidad macroeconómica integrada que unifique de manera comprehensiva las cuentas financieras de flujos de fondos y las cuentas de producción, gasto e ingreso de las cuentas nacionales. En el plano del análisis económico, la contabilidad macroeconómica integrada constituye un argumento de consistencia lógica interna en el proceso de construcción de modelos teóricos y empíricos. La discusión en el ensayo se desarrolla para el caso abstracto de una economía cerrada con producción circular simple en estado estacionario competitivo de largo período (o de reproducción simple o de autoremplazamiento). La exposición completa del circuito monetario permite resolver la cuestión de la “paradoja de las ganancias” y muestra la importancia clave de la demanda en la dinámica económica capitalista.
