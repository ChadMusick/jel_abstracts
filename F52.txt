F52|Arming in the Global Economy: The Importance of Trade with Enemies and Friends|We analyze how trade openness matters for interstate conflict over productive resources. Our analysis features a terms-of-trade channel that makes security policies trade-regime dependent. Specifically, trade between two adversaries reduces each one's incentive to arm given the opponent's arming. If these countries have a sufficiently similar mix of initial resource endowments, greater trade openness brings with it a reduction in resources diverted to conflict and thus wasted, as well as the familiar gains from trade. Although a move to trade can otherwise induce greater arming by one of them and thus need not be welfare improving for both, aggregate arming falls. By contrast, when the two adversaries do not trade with each other but instead trade with a third (friendly) country, a move from autarky to trade intensifies conflict between the two adversaries, inducing greater arming. With data from the years surrounding the end of the Cold War, we exploit the contrasting implications of trade costs between enemies versus trade costs between friends to provide some evidence that is consistent with the theory.
F52|Immigration, fear of crime and public spending on security|We explore the relation between immigration, crime and local government spending on security in Italian municipalities. We find that immigration increases the share of public resources devoted to police protection, particularly when migrants are culturally distant from the native population. We uncover a misalignment between perception and reality, as immigration increases fear of future crimes rather than the actual probability of being victim of a crime. We also demonstrate that immigration from culturally distant societies is associated with a deterioration in civic cooperation and interpersonal trust, which can affect perceptions of safety and the demand for police services.
F52|The defense economics and the military reform in Russia in 2018|In 2018, the total strength of the Armed Forces (AF) of the Russian Federation did not change. Early in February 2018, the President of the Russian Federation increased by 200 persons to 10,740 persons the ultimate staff number of the Central Office of the Ministry of Defense (without the guarding and building maintenance personnel taken into account), which is not included in the strength of the Armed Forces.
F52|Military Intervention via Drone Strikes|We study the 420 US drone strikes in Pakistan from 2006-2016, isolating causal effects on terrorism, anti-US sentiment, and radicalization via an instrumental variable strategy based on wind. Drone strikes are suggested to encourage terrorism in Pakistan, bearing responsibility for 16 percent of all attacks or 2,964 terror deaths. Exploring mechanisms, we distinguish between insiders (members of terrorist organizations) and outsiders (the Pakistani populace). Analyzing data from a leading Pakistani newspaper, anti-US protests, and Google searches, drone strikes appear to increase anti-US sentiment and radicalization: Outsiders seem to sympathize with insiders because of drone strikes.
F52|Al Qaeda, fundamentalism and modernity|"This paper seeks to challenge two primary views that have been advanced in the wake of September 11 concerning the relationship between Al Qaeda, or militant Islamic fundamentalism more generally, and modernity. These are the views of John Gray and Tariq Ali. John Gray identifies Al Qaeda and Islamic fundamentalism with modernity and even sees Al Qaeda as a product of modernity. Conversely, Tariq Ali, far from identifying Al Qaeda with modernity, identifies the United States' imperial project with fundamentalism and refers to the confrontation between this project and Islamic fundamentalism as a ""clash of fundamentalisms"". In seeking to challenge these views, the paper distinguishes fundamentalism from modernity in the most foundational terms and argues that the ""logic"" characteristic of each is intrinsically at odds."
F52|Modeling Deterrence by Denial and by Punishment|"We explore a defender's prewar allocation of military resources between denial and punishment strategies for deterrence. While denial disproportionately raises the probability to countervail aggression by disrupting military forces (""guns""), punishment proportionately raises costs on the aggressor by damaging civilian values (""butter""). Because these countervailing and deterrence effects are so divergent, the deployment that minimizes the risk of war can vary, depending on the defender's military capacity relative to the aggressor's. Namely, inferior parties resort only to punishment (e.g., post-Cold War North Korea), competitive parties concentrate solely on denial (e.g., Germany, Italy, and Japan), and superior parties develop both denial and punishment capabilities (e.g., Permanent Five)."
F52|The ethics of African regional and continental integration|The decision of African leaders on the creation of an African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) in 2018 was not merely a political decision with economic implications. It has significant and complex ethical dimensions too. This, not only concerning a possible trade-off between economic growth and well-being, employment, remittances, corruption, the depletion of natural resources and related ecological and gender problems. AfCFTA will also impact harmfully on growing xenophobia, nationalism and populism, the likely outcome of growing capital and labour mobility.
F52|L'éthique de l'intégration régionale et continentale africaine<BR>[The ethics of African regional and continental integration]|ABSTRACT & RÉSUMÉ & ZUSAMMENFASSUNG : The decision of African leaders on the creation of an African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) in 2018 was not merely a political decision with economic implications. It has significant and complex ethical dimensions too. This, not only concerning a possible trade-off between economic growth and well-being, employment, remittances, corruption, the depletion of natural resources and related ecological and gender problems.

Il comporte également des dimensions éthiques importantes et complexes. Cela ne concerne pas seulement un éventuel compromis entre croissance économique et bien-être, emploi, envois de fonds, corruption, épuisement des ressources naturelles et problèmes écologiques et de genre connexes. Le ZLECA aura également un impact néfaste sur la xénophobie croissante, le nationalisme et le populisme, le résultat probable de la mobilité croissante du capital et de la main-d'œuvre. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ZUSAMMENFASSUNG : Die Entscheidung der afrikanischen Staats- und Regierungschefs zur Schaffung einer Pan-Afrikanischen Freihandelszone (AfCFTA) im Jahr 2018 war nicht nur eine politische Entscheidung mit wirtschaftlichen Auswirkungen. Sie hat auch bedeutende und komplexe ethische Dimensionen. Dies betrifft nicht nur einen möglichen Kompromiss zwischen Wirtschaftswachstum und Wohlergehen, Beschäftigung, Rücküberweisungen, Korruption, Erschöpfung der natürlichen Ressourcen und damit verbundenen ökologischen und geschlechtsspezifischen Problemen. Die AfCFTA wird sich auch nachteilig auf die Zunahme von Fremdenfeindlichkeit, Nationalismus und Populismus auswirken, die sich wahrscheinlich aus der Zunahme der Kapital- und Arbeitskräftemobilität ergibt.
F52|Public interest considerations in European merger control regimes|Nowadays, merger control predominantly relies upon a strict analysis of the effects from merger and acquisitions on effective competition. However, there is scope for so-called public interest considerations in several European merger control regimes and recently a number of European politicians have called for more elbowroom for non-competition-oriented interventions into merger control. For instance, they did so in the context of the prohibition of the Siemens-Alstommerger and the upcoming industrial policy discussion about European Champions. Since the social welfare effects of competitive markets present an important public interest in itself, additional public interest considerations justifying an intervention need to be non-market in the sense that these goals stand in conflict with competition. However, a trade-off between effective competition and public interest, i.e. public interests that are better served through market power then through effective competition, is a rare phenomenon. This paper gives an overview of public interest considerations in the merger policy of European Union member states and analyzes four jurisdictions in more detail. We find that the institutional designs how public interests considerations are included in the merger control regimes lack focus on non-market public interest considerations across the analyzed jurisdictions. Furthermore, there are relevant shortcomings regarding transparency and legal certainty. Moreover, our ex-pots analysis shows that the empirical record of past public interest-motivated interventions is questionable with only few interventions yielding the desired effects. Therefore, we suggest revising the public interest regulations in the respective merger control regulations by narrowing their focus to real non-market public interests and by levying decision power on less politically-influenced bodies.
F52|The Impact of Crime and Other Economic Forces on Mexico's Foreign Direct Investment Inflows|This paper examines the effect of different crimes on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows into the 32 Mexican states. Using a state-quarter panel data for the period 2005 to 2015, we estimate alternative models of FDI, with fixed effects throughout a flexible lag-lengths methodology and System Generalized Method of Moments (SGMM) models in order to identify the determinants of FDI inflows into the country. The dependent variable in our model is the annual inflow of FDI and the independent variables are state level indicators (real wages and electricity consumption), and macroeconomic forces (the real exchange rate and interest rate). We find that homicides and thefts have negative statistically significant effects on FDI, while other crimes show no effects. Partitions of the sample suggest higher negative effects in the most violent states.
F52|The Depot-Level Maintenance of DoD's Combat Aircraft: Insights for the F-35|Depot-level maintenance of military aircraft consists of in-depth maintenance that is beyond the capability of maintenance staff at an aircraftâ€™s operating location. Depot-level maintenance is essential to ensuring an aircraftâ€™s capability to perform missions and can influence whether an aircraftâ€™s life can be extended cost-effectively. This report focuses on depot-level maintenance practices for the Air Forceâ€™s and Navyâ€™s combat aircraft as sources of insights for the new F-35 fighter aircraft.
F52|Funding for International Affairs Activities, Within and Outside Agenciesâ€™ Base Budgets|The Congress provides the State Department, the Agency for International Development (USAID), and other agencies a â€œbase budgetâ€ each year to fund ongoing activities related to international affairs. The agencies have received other â€œnonbaseâ€ funding in recent years, in the form of supplemental appropriations, emergency appropriations, and funding for overseas contingency operations. In this report, CBO analyzes the recent use of such nonbase appropriations for international affairs activities.
F52|The Better Route to Global Tax Coordination: Gradualism or Multilateralism?|In the context of international tax coordination incomplete information is one of the well-known frictions that can lead to bargaining failure and might explain a lack of observed coordination. We consider international negotiations about tax coordination under complete and incomplete information. We identify the conditions for multilateral negotiations to be more likely to be successful than gradual/sequential negotiation approaches and compare different routes of sequential bargaining. Under plausible conditions, full-scale global coordination is least likely to emerge if the negotiations take place sequentially, and if the negotiations with the most unpredictable country take place last.
F52|Military economy and military reform in Russia|The number of Russian Armed Forces (RFAF) authorized strength at year-end 2017 increased 17,387 to 1,903,758 on the back of disbandment of the Federal Special Construction Agency (Spetsstroy); therefore, the RFAF’s total authorized strength rose to 1,013,628 from 1 million.[1] That was the first time when data on RFAF’s authorized war strength (1,700,000) were published by mass media, posting a substantial decrease from 5 million reported prior to the military reform of 2008-2012.The Russian Defense Ministry did not publish 2017 year-end service personnel statistics like it did in previous years; therefore, the total accountable strength presumably decreased to 240,000 from previous year’s 270,000 as a result of a 35,000 (13 percent) decline in the number of conscript personnel. Overall, the 2017 total number of conscript personnel inflow stood at 276,000, or 31,000 (10 percent) less than in 2016 .
F52|Education and Military Rivalry|Using data from the last 150 years in a small set of countries, and from the postwar period in a large set of countries, we show that large investments in state primary education systems tend to occur when countries face military rivals or threats from their neighbors. By contrast, we find that democratic transitions are negatively associated with education investments, while the presence of democratic political institutions magnifies the positive effect of military rivalries. These empirical results are robust to a number of statistical concerns and continue to hold when we instrument military rivalries with commodity prices or rivalries in a certain country's immediate neighborhood. We also present historical case studies, as well as a simple model, that are consistent with the econometric evidence.
F52|The Effect of Media Coverage on Mass Shootings|Can media coverage of shooters encourage future mass shootings? We explore the link between the day-to-day prime time television news coverage of shootings on ABC World News Tonight and subsequent mass shootings in the US from January 1, 2013 to June 23, 2016. To circumvent latent endogeneity concerns, we employ an instrumental variable strategy: worldwide disaster deaths provide an exogenous variation that systematically crowds out shooting-related coverage. Our findings consistently suggest a positive and statistically significant effect of coverage on the number of subsequent shootings, lasting for 4-10 days. At its mean, news coverage is suggested to cause approximately three mass shootings in the following week, which would explain 55 percent of all mass shootings in our sample. Results are qualitatively consistent when using (i) additional keywords to capture shooting-related news coverage, (ii) alternative definitions of mass shootings, (iii) the number of injured or killed people as the dependent variable, and (iv) an alternative, longer data source for mass shootings from 2006-2016.
F52|The Economics of Peace and War: An Overview|Violence and conflicts have caused suffering throughout history. Moreover, the arrival of nuclear weapons even raised concerns about the survival of humankind. This special issue analyzes the causes and consequences of violence and conflict. It covers wars, civil wars, and terrorism, as well as organization of the military and its effects on the rest of the society.
F52|An Overwiew of Economic Impacts of Shale Gas on EU Energy Security|This paper analyzes the possible shale gas development in the EU in context with raising problem of energy security. Based on the experience of shale revolution in the USA the transfer of US model to the EU is discussed. The results show that shale production affects the price negatively and that US model is successful due to multiple reasons, primarily presence of experienced companies, geological structure and strong regulation rules. This paper shows the unsuitability of the US model for the EU market. After the first enthusiasm for shale plays research in late 2000s the multiple barriers for drilling have risen up; the most significant are the environmental worries; both on governmental and public levels. US companies have lost interest in the EU and moved to other parts of the world. The shale gas development is not able to affect the energy security of the EU on European, international level.
F52|Togo - 2017: domestic politics, foreign affairs and socio-economic development|ABSTRACT & RÉSUMÉ & ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: The demand for political alternance, initiated by institutional and electoral reforms, constituted the major contentious issue between the government and the challengers of the Gnassingbé regime throughout the year. Civil society organizations and representatives of the Christian church supported the demands of the opposition. The protest of the notorious divided opposition took a new momentum since August with the lead by a hitherto hardly known opposition party and its charismatic leader, Tikpi Atchadam. He organized huge demonstrations of all the 14 opposition parties in the second half of the year which put the government progressively under pressure. Foreign affairs were dominated by the impact of increased aid by the international donor community. Socio-economic development was marked by diminishing human development and economic freedom. ------------------------------------------------------------ RÉSUMÉ: La demande d'alternance politique, initiée par des réformes institutionnelles et électorales, constitue le principal contentieux entre le gouvernement et les challengers du régime Gnassingbé tout au long de l'année. Les organisations de la société civile et les représentants de l'église chrétienne ont soutenu les demandes de l'opposition. La protestation de l'opposition divisée notoire a pris un nouvel élan depuis le mois d'août avec à sa tête un parti d'opposition jusqu'alors méconnu et son leader charismatique, Tikpi Atchadam. Il a organisé d'énormes manifestations de l'ensemble des 14 partis d'opposition au cours de la seconde moitié de l'année, ce qui a mis le gouvernement sous pression. Les affaires étrangères ont été dominées par l'impact de l'aide accrue de la communauté internationale des donateurs. Le développement socio-économique a été marqué par la diminution du développement humain et de la liberté économique. ------------------------------------------------------------ ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: Die Forderung nach politischer Alternanz, initiiert durch institutionelle und Wahlreformen, war das größte Streitthema zwischen der Regierung und den Herausforderern des Gnassingbé-Regimes während des ganzen Jahres. Zivilgesellschaftliche Organisationen und Vertreter der christlichen Kirche unterstützten die Forderungen der Opposition. Der Protest der zerstrittenen Opposition nahm ab August mit der Führung einer bisher kaum bekannten Oppositionspartei und ihres charismatischen Führers Tikpi Atchadam eine neue Dynamik an. Er organisierte in der zweiten Jahreshälfte große Demonstrationen aller 14 Oppositionsparteien, die die Regierung zunehmend unter Druck setzten. Auswärtige Angelegenheiten waren von den Auswirkungen der verstärkten Hilfe der internationalen Gebergemeinschaft geprägt. Die sozioökonomische Entwicklung war von abnehmender menschlicher Entwicklung und wirtschaftlicher Freiheit geprägt.

F52|Humanism or Racism. Pilot Project Europe at the Crossroads|This policy paper combines a large number of acute contemporary problems in political economy and shows that it is possible to bring them under one broad common umbrella: The choice between humanism or racism. To do so more fine grained definitions of humanism and racism are put forward. From that theoretical perspective the possible policy options for further European Integration are discussed. It is argued that Europe could be a role model for global evolution if it is possible to overcome racism and to use diversity as a creative force. As a driving agent for such a development the emerging class of organic intellectuals is identified.

F52|Countering Terror Cells: Offence versus Defence|The analysis provides insights regarding the suitability of offensive versus defensive measures in countering a terror cell. It is shown that the optimal allocation is more offensive when the cell is aware of which targets have been protected, but unable to distinguish between the values of different targets; than the case where it can neither distinguish between target values nor is the protection conspicuous. Also, the ability of the terror cell to inflict damage is least when it can neither distinguish between target values nor is the target protection conspicuous, and most when it can observe both target values and protection. Hence, from the counter-terrorism (CT) point of view, there seems to be a rationale in making target values and target protection inconspicuous to the extent possible. The paper finally deals with the possibility of diverging target valuations from the CT standpoint and that of the terror cell, and shows that if target protection is conspicuous to the cell and these are common knowledge, then the optimal CT allocation is at least as offensive as the case with identical valuation rankings.
F52|Critically important: The heterogeneous effect of politics on trade|The proliferation of international supply chains makes the domestic production of goods increasingly dependent on inputs from foreign sources. By expanding their sourcing portfolio to foreign suppliers, firms and by extension entire economies are more prone to the trade effects of adverse bilateral political shocks. In this paper, we analyze the relation between political relations and trade at lower levels of aggregation, allowing for a heterogeneous effect by types of inputs. We show that a negative shock to political relations has a more pronounced effect on trade of critical goods, conditional on the ease of switching suppliers. We construct a simple model exhibiting input-output linkages to clarify the mechanisms at play, from which we derive testable predictions. Using a new measure for countries' dependence on these critical inputs, we then test the proposed mechanism in a difference-in-differences framework. To address potential endogeneity issues we perform an event study, in which the treatment is an exogenous adverse political shock. Using a new dataset on the status of diplomatic representation and monthly trade data, we exploit the recalling or summoning of the ambassador of a country as a shock to bilateral political relations.
F52|The “same bed, different dreams” of Vietnam and China: how (mis)trust could make or break it|The relationship between Vietnam and China could be captured in the Chinese expression of “同床异梦”,which means lying on the same bed but having different dreams. The two countries share certain culturaland political similarities but also diverge vastly in their national interests. This paper adds to the extantliterature on this topic by analyzing the element of trust/mistrust in their interactions in trade-investment,tourism, and defense-security. The analysis shows how the relationship is increasingly interdependent butis equally fragile due to the lack of trust on both sides. The mistrust or even distrust of Chinese subjectsrun deep within the Vietnamese mindset, from the skepticism of Chinese investment, Chinese tourists,discrimination against ethnic Chinese, to the caution against Chinese aggression in the South China Sea.The paper forecasts that, despite the deep-seated differences and occasional mistrust, going forward,neither side would risk damaging the status quo even when tensions peak.
F52|Consumer Nationalism and Multilateral Trade Cooperation|We investigate the implications of consumer nationalism for multilateral trade cooperation. We develop a two-country, two-firm model, in which the firms produce horizontally differentiated products and act as Bertrand competitors. Assuming that there is asymmetry in consumer nationalism between countries, we show that the country with the (relatively more) nationalist consumers can sustain more liberal trade policies than its trade partner in a repeated-game setting. Moreover, its most cooperative equilibrium tariff is actually decreasing in the level of its consumers' nationalism, provided that countries are not too patient. On the other hand, asymmetric consumer nationalism across countries produces an anti-cooperation effect on the incentives of the country with the non-nationalist consumers.

F52|Development paths: A case for public investment as the alternative to the Washington Consensus|This paper's aim is to provide a different standpoint in the development debate, by focusing on the short-sightedness of the international institutions when they propose a development agenda. Focusing on macroeconomic performance and on privatisation, they have found a solution in PPPs, which offer financing opportunities for public investment and at the same time they reduce the burden on governments budgets. As an alternative this paper proposes a model based on investment and self-dependency with combining elements from post- Keynesian theory as well as the Beijing Consensus. The model rests on the importance of SOEs to use industrial policy as a tool to achieve independence from western powers as well as to increase investment. The theoretical claims are supported by empirical analysis based on 98 developing countries over a 15 year period.
F52|Sanctioned to Death? The Impact of Economic Sanctions on Life Expectancy and its Gender Gap|In this paper, we empirically analyze the effect of UN and US economic sanctions on life expectancy and its gender gap in target countries. Our sample covers 98 less developed and newly industrialized countries over the period 1977–2012. We employ a matching approach to account for the endogeneity of sanctions. Our results indicate that an average episode of UN sanctions reduces life expectancy by about 1.2–1.4 years. The corresponding decrease of 0.4–0.5 years under an average episode of US sanctions is significantly smaller. These average effects conceal that the damage to life expectancy is accumulating over time; with every additional year under UN (US) sanctions the size of the adverse effect on life expectancy increases by 0.3 (0.2) years. Finally, we find evidence that women are affected more severely by the imposition of sanctions. The fact that sanctions are not “gender-blind” can be interpreted as evidence that sanctions disproportionately affect (the life expectancy of) the more vulnerable members of society.
F52|Can economic sanctions be effective?|While economic sanctions may be attractive policy tools for governments wanting to express discontent with a country's behaviour, it is arguable if from an economic perspective sanctions can achieve the change that is often envisaged through the punitive measures taken. In fact, the literature does not present conclusive evidence that economic sanctions are an effective policy instrument. Nevertheless the number of sanction episodes is on the rise and have increasingly gained in popularity in recent years. What can explain that? This paper will review how sanctions work from an analytical perspective and the challenges countries encounter in applying sanctions as an effective policy tool. In doing so, it reviews more specifically the sanction episodes against the Russian Federation and Iran and without offering any views on the merits and/or legitimacy of the actions taken by any of the parties. It will be argued that economic sanctions generally inflict economic costs to all countries involved in the sanction episodes, including those taking the sanctions, thus shooting themselves in the foot. The country facing the sanctions is likely to develop trade relations with third parties that are not part of the sanction coalition. It is observed that sanctions are mostly taken in complement of diplomatic and other forms of pressure. The type of sanctions is also evolving, with countries increasingly using 'smart' sanctions, targeting financial transactions, business activities and individuals there were it hurts most and limiting their freedom of movement. From an analytical perspective, it is noted that when various measures are put in place, it is hard to assess the extent to which the economic sanctions per se contribute to the eventual outcomes, hence the question of attribution. It is the combination of various interventions that could eventually make the sanction episodes effective, if at all and not the economic sanctions per se. Despite such shortcomings and lack of evidence of their effectiveness, it can safely be said that they are the preferred option compared to military intervention. At the same time, and regrettably, sanctions do not necessarily prevent armed conflict adding to the economic cost the tragic cost of human life.
F52|Industrial Espionage and Productivity|In this paper, we investigate the economic returns to industrial espionage by linking information from East Germany's foreign intelligence service to sector-specific gaps in total factor productivity (TFP) between West and East Germany. Based on a dataset that comprises the entire flow of information provided by East German informants over the period 1970–1989, we document a significant narrowing of sectoral West-to-East TFP gaps as a result of East Germany's industrial espionage. This central finding holds across a wide range of specifications and is robust to the inclusion of several alternative proxies for technology transfer. We further demonstrate that the economic returns to industrial espionage are primarily driven by relatively few high quality pieces of information and particularly strong in sectors that were closer to the West German technological frontier. Based on our findings, we estimate that the average TFP gap between West and East Germany at the end of the Cold War would have been 6.3 percentage points larger had the East not engaged in industrial espionage.
F52|The Effect of Migration on Terror - Made at Home or Imported from Abroad?|We investigate whether the stock of foreigners residing in a country leads to a larger number of terrorist attacks on that country. Our instrument for the stock of foreigners relies on the interaction of two sets of variables. Variation across host-origin-dyads results from structural characteristics between the country of origin and the host, while variation over time makes use of changes in push and pull factors between host and origin countries resulting from natural disasters. Controlling for the levels of these variables themselves and fixed effects for dyads and years, the interaction provides a powerful and excludable instrument. Using data for 20 OECD host countries and 187 countries of origin over the 1980-2010 period we show that the probability of a terrorist attack increases with a larger number of foreigners living in a country. However, this scale effect is not larger than the effect domestic populations have on domestic terror. We find some evidence that terror is systematically imported from countries with large Muslim populations. A larger number of attacks against foreigners in the host country increases the risk of terror from foreigners there. We find that host country policies relating to integration and the rights of foreigners are key to fight terror- stricter policies that exclude foreigners already living in a country increase the risk of terror. High-skilled migrants are associated with a significantly lower risk of terror compared to low-skilled ones, while there is no significant difference between male and female migrants.
F52|Mediated Terrorism: US News and Al-Qaeda Attacks|This paper presents an empirical test for the hypothesis that US news coverage of al-Qaeda causes al-Qaeda attacks. To isolate causality, disaster deaths worldwide provide an instrumental variable crowding out al-Qaeda coverage. Studying daily al-Qaeda coverage by CNN, NBC, CBS, and Fox News, as well as the NYT and the WaPo, results consistently produce a positive and statistically significant effect. At its mean, al-Qaeda coverage is suggested to cause 1.2-2.3 al-Qaeda attacks (equivalent to 5.8-10.9 deaths) in the upcoming week. Results are remarkably consistent across media outlets and it appears unlikely that attacks are simply delayed when coverage is low.
F52|Does Protectionist Anti-Takeover Legislation Lead to Managerial Entrenchment?|I study a protectionist anti-takeover law introduced in 2014 that covers a subset of all firms in the economy. The law had a negative impact on shareholder value and substantially reduced affected firms' likelihood of becoming a takeover target. There is no evidence that management of those firms subsequently altered firm policies in its interest. Investment, employment, wages, profitability, financial leverage and distributions to shareholders remain unchanged. The share of annual CEO compensation consisting of equity instruments increased by 9.4 percentage points, suggesting that boards reacted to the loss in monitoring by the takeover market by increasing the pay-for-performance sensitivity.
F52|War and Conflict in Economics: Theories, Applications, and Recent Trends|We review the main economic models of war and conflict. These models vary in details, but their implications are qualitatively consistent, highlighting key commonalities across a variety of conflict settings. Recent empirical literature, employing both laboratory and field data, in many cases confirms the basic implications of conflict theory. However, this literature also presents important challenges to the way economists traditionally model conflict. We finish our review by suggesting ways to address these challenges.
F52|Using a regional CGE model for rapid assessments of the economic implications of terrorism events: creating GRAD-ECAT (Generalized, Regional And Dynamic Economic Consequence Analysis Tool)|The Terrorism Risk Assessment (TRA) groups in the Department of Homeland Security assess millions of terrorism scenarios defined by location, agent (e.g. nuclear device), and delivery method (e.g. car bomb). For each scenario they estimate deaths, injuries, property damage, clean-up and health expenses, visitor discouragement, and other damage dimensions. The TRA groups translate damages into economic measures, e.g. loss of GDP. Previously they used an input-output (I-O) model. Here we replace I-O with computable general equilibrium (CGE). Solving CGE models is computationally time-consuming and requires specialist skills. For the TRA groups this creates two challenges: feasibility and security. A model that cannot be solved in less than a fraction of a second is infeasible for analyzing millions of scenarios. The TRAs can rely only on people with high security clearances, limiting the possibilities for obtaining specialist advice. Our approach to these challenges was to use a CGE model to estimate elasticities that show the sensitivity of economic variables to direct damage effects of events occurring in different regions. For example, we supplied the TRA groups with CGE-based estimates of the percentage effect on national welfare of destruction of 1 per cent of the capital stock in congressional district NY14. Our elasticity approach meets both challenges. First, for any given terrorism scenario specified by a location and a vector of direct damage shocks, the TRA groups can use the elasticities in linear equations to estimate in nanoseconds the implications for a wide range of economic variables. Second, as outside contractors, we have no need for access to sensitive information on specific shock vectors and target regions. We describe how we used a dynamic, multi-regional CGE model, USAGE-TERM, to estimate the elasticities.
F52|The Effect of Migration on Terror - Made at Home or Imported from Abroad?|We analyze the causal effect of the stock of foreigners residing in a country on the probability of a terrorist attack in that country. Our instrument for the stock of foreigners relies on the interactions of two sets of variables. Variation across host-origin-dyads results from structural characteristics between the country of origin and the host, while variation over time makes use of changes in push and pull factors between host and origin countries resulting from natural disasters. Using data for 20 OECD host countries and 183 countries of origin over the 1980- 2010 period we show that the probability of a terrorist attack increases with a larger number of foreigners living in a country. However, this scale effect is not larger than the effect domestic populations have on domestic terror. We find scarce evidence that terror is systematically imported from countries with large Muslim populations or countries where terror prevails. Policies that exclude foreigners already living in a country increase rather than reduce the risk that foreign populations turn violent, and so do terrorist attacks against foreigners in their host country. High skilled migrants are associated with a significantly lower risk of terror compared to low skilled ones, while there is no significant difference between male and female migrants.
F52|Flood Risk Mitigation: Pressing Issues and Challenges|The increase number of natural disasters that struck the world gives damaging impacts to the people and properties. This paper attempts to examine crucial pressing issues and challenges in mitigating flood losses and loss of lives in Malaysia. Only qualitative approach is used to address these pressing issues and challenges of natural disaster. Kelantan is one the states in the east coast of Malaysia that experienced the highest loss of properties and infrastructure in 2014 massive flood. Semi-structured interview was designed and used to collect data from six government agencies in the state of Kelantan. These agencies were, Kelantan State Education Department, Kelantan State Department of Rescue and Fire Brigade, Kelantan State Health Department, Local Authority of Kuala Krai, Kelantan State Social and Welfare Department and Kelantan State Police Contingent. The finding of the study revealed that were eight pressing issues and four challenges. The eight pressing issues are flood preparations, lack of rescuers, lack of awareness, communication difficulty, lack of assets for rescue, transportation issues, the absence of food supply, and other constraints. On the other hand, the challenges are lack of provisions, redevelopment, the social and economic situation, and trauma. These pressing issues and challenges need to be seriously addressed by the State and Federal level of Government of Malaysia so that future natural disaster like the 2014 flood can be managed in a much more prepared way or manner.
F52|Nationalism and economic openness: The cross-country evidence revisited|In this paper we examine the empirical relationship between economic openness and nationalism. We replicate and extend the cross-country analysis of Lan and Li (2015) using additional measures of nationalism and additional years of data from the World Values Survey. We fail to find the negative relationship between economic openness and nationalism that Lan and Li (2015) find, even when using the same data sources, years and sample of countries. When we expand the sample of countries and years of the data, we find no statistically significant relationship between economic openness and nationalism.
F52|Defense economy and military reform in Russia in 2016|In 2016, the main provisions of the military reform started in 2008 and approved by the Executive Order of President Vladimir Putin[1] of May 2012 were successfully realized as a whole.
F52|Military and financial policy|In administrating the 2016 federal budget, a single adjustment was made in November. Under the Law on the 2016 Federal Budget, allocations on the “National Defense” section of the budget expenditures were initially set at RUB 3,149 trillion, or RUB 32bn (1%) less than actual expenditures a year before. In November, allocations on the National Defense grew to RUB 3,895 trillion (an increase of RUB 746bn or 23.5%)[1] due to the government’s decision to repay ahead of schedule a portion of commercial loans taken against state guarantees for financing the state defense order in 2011–2016. Compared to 2015, allocations on the National Defense grew by 22.4% in nominal terms .
F52|An Analysis of the Economic Determinants of Food Security in North Africa|This paper investigates the issue of food security as the basis for stable economic development using the example of North Africa. A statistical analysis of economic and financial factors in relation to the determinants of food security was carried out using a panel cointegrating model based on official international statistics of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Bank for 1991-2014. According to the results, population growth and the intensification of agricultural production, foreign trade and foreign direct investment play a crucial role in food security. The study revealed the relationship between food security and the development of the banking and financial systems in the region, and their degree of globalization. The strategy of a long-term investment policy pursued by the World Bank and FAO to combat hunger and poverty was justified. The methodology proposed can be used to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of policies to maintain food security in the regions of Arfica.
F52|Terrorism and the Media: The Effect of US Television Coverage on Al-Qaeda Attacks|Can media coverage of a terrorist organization encourage their execution of further attacks? This paper analyzes the day-to-day news coverage of Al-Qaeda on US television since 9/11 and the group's terrorist strikes. To isolate causality, I use disaster deaths worldwide as an exogenous variation that crowds out Al-Qaeda coverage in an instrumental variable framework. The results suggest a positive and statistically powerful effect of CNN, NBC, CBS, and Fox News coverage on subsequent Al-Qaeda attacks. This result is robust to a battery of alternative estimations, extensions, and placebo regressions. One minute of Al-Qaeda coverage in a 30-minute news segment causes approximately one attack in the upcoming week, equivalent to 4.9 casualties, on average.
F52|Industrial Espionage and Productivity|In this paper, we investigate the economic returns to industrial espionage by linking information from East Germany’s foreign intelligence service to sector-specific gaps in total factor productivity (TFP) between West and East Germany. Based on a dataset that comprises the entire flow of information provided by East German informants over the period 1970-1989, we document a significant narrowing of sectoral West-to-East TFP gaps as a result of East Germany’s industrial espionage. This central finding holds across a wide range of specifications and is robust to the inclusion of several alternative proxies for technology transfer. We further demonstrate that the economic returns to industrial espionage are primarily driven by relatively few high quality pieces of information and particularly strong in sectors that were closer to the West German technological frontier. Based on our findings, we estimate that the average TFP gap between West and East Germany at the end of the Cold War would have been 9.5% larger had the East not engaged in industrial espionage.
F52|Impact of Terrorism on Cross-Border Mergers and Acquisitions (M&As): Prevalence, Frequency and Intensity|Abstract This paper contributes to the literature on the impact of terrorism on international business by focusing on the specific case of cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As) using bilateral data for 59 countries over the period 2000–2011. We are interested in the following set of questions: (a) the impact of source and host country terrorism on bilateral M&A flows using various measures of terrorism (i.e. prevalence, frequency and intensity); (b) whether terrorism affects developing countries differently; (c) whether good institutions in developing host countries can offset the negative effects of terrorism; and (d) whether terrorism incidents in a particular economy has negative spillovers to its neighbors. To preview the main conclusions, we find that an augmented gravity model fits the data well. While the occurrence of terrorism in either the host or source does not appear to have any impact on bilateral M&A, the frequency and intensity of terrorist attacks significantly deter M&A flows, especially in the latter. We also find that good institutions negate the impact of terrorist attacks in the developing host country. There is also some evidence that regional spillovers reduce M&As in the host country.
F52|Editorial Volume 13|Dear Reader, Those among us who have reached a certain age tend to have developed a long-term perspective and inclination to look back on individual years and to compare them for their respective blessings and injuries. In that sense, 2016 seems to take a special rank as an annus horribilis not just in my own assessment but in numerous commentaries we have come across over the past weeks. Foremost in our awareness featured the surprises: Nobody in my direct acquaintance foretold the Trump phenomenon or the Brexit decision. To find events equally unanticipated and far-reaching, one would have to go back to the 2007/8 financial crash, the 9/11 attacks, the dissolution of the USSR, or the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.
F52|Threats to Security Posed by ISIS in Syria: A Human Security Approach|The civil war in Syria coupled with the attacks by ISIS, has resulted in one of the largest humanitarian crises since World War II. Although international efforts have resulted in regaining control of important cities, these military approaches have escalated and inflamed the violence of which innocent civilians bear the consequences. The continuing violence and resulting threats or insecurities negatively affect the lives, freedom, dignity and development of the people to name but a few. For that reason, the aim is to explore the applicability of a human security approach to the conflict in Syria that focuses on, among other aspects, minimising violence, mitigating the effects of the conflict, protecting people, restoring peace and eliminating the grounds that resulted in the development of these conditions in the first place.
F52|Emerging Security Challenges to Africa: The Case of Haphazard Disposal of Pharmaceuticals in Ghana|The study of the Disposal of Unused/Unwanted Medicines Project examines ways in which medicines are disposed of in Ghana and assesses how disposal methods can impact water resources. The study showed a number of challenges: gaps in the legislative framework for the disposal of medicines; environmentally-unfriendly methods of disposal of medicines; and large quantities of medicines potentially disposed of indiscriminately with major impact on the environment. It recommends a review of the legal framework to ensure the proper disposal of all unused medicines; policies to mop up excess medicines with members of the public; review of prescribing and dispensing practices to reduce excess medicines; and further research into the types of pharmaceuticals that are present and persist in the environment, their effects and how they affect quality of life.
F52|War and Conflict in Economics: Theories, Applications, and Recent Trends|We review the main economic models of war and conflict. These models vary in details, but their implications are qualitatively consistent, highlighting key commonalities across a variety of conflict settings. Recent empirical literature, employing both laboratory and field data, in many cases confirms the basic implications of conflict theory. However, this literature also presents important challenges to the way economists traditionally model conflict. We finish our review by suggesting ways to address these challenges.
F52|Missing the Peace Train in 2006: Economic and political dynamics of India Pakistan hostility?|The paper discusses the dynamics of peace initiatives made by Pakistan in 2006 and their importance in changing the regional dynamics in favour of increased economic cooperation in the light of the study undertaken by Murshed & Mamoon (2007) which has analysed the multiple determinants of conflict between India and Pakistan. The paper highlights the importance of peace in the region especially for Pakistan where the development potential of the country have been stifled greatly due to a long history of political and economic volatility while linking Pakistan’s progress with that of its neighbours through conflict mitigation process. The paper also presents the possibility of such dyadic economic and conflict trade off in 1990s where India may have utilised hostilities to curtail Pakistani economic potential to pressurise Pakistan to forego its support of insurgency in Indian held Kashmir. Pakistani peace initiatives in 2006 made the country as a leading factor in South Asia with a valid possibility of determining the pace and potential to realise long sought process of regional progress through greater integration of interests. However, the tangible response from Indian side was not forthcoming leading to loss of opportunities and thus creating a good explanation of Hawkish Indian behaviour 10 years down the time line in 2017.
F52|Blockchains and Extra-Terrestrial Nations: Role of Blockchains in the Socio-Political Milieu of Future Extra-Terrestrial Settlements|Humanity is on the cusp of a great wave of space exploration and colonization of Extra-Terrestrial Bodies (ETB). This paper deals with the socio–political issues that may arise between Earth and E.T Settlements and the possible ways to resolve them. Firstly we discuss as to how early maritime explorations compare to present day space voyages. Based on the lessons learnt, we will analyse the socio–political relation between Earth and Extra-Terrestrial Settlements (ETS) and how some possibilities of conflicts can arise. We then evaluate as to how Blockchain systems can potentially keep earth and ETS tethered to each other and provide a way for harmonious co-existence. The paper concludes by summarizing the possible Socio–Political and Economic conflicts between Earth and future ETS and ways to resolve them.
F52|Eurasian integration and its institutions: possible contributions to security in Eurasia|The authors turn to the large family of institutions that came into existence in post-Soviet Eurasia (and, in some ways, beyond it) over the last two decades. The researchers review their current state, agenda, real and perceived mandate, and their respective achievements and constraints. The main questions of interest are the following: do ‘Eurasian’ institutions serve to provide security/stability and, if so, how? To answer these two questions, the authors identify a number of key challenges to security in Eurasia, review the institutions belonging loosely to the Eurasian Economic Union’s institutional ecosphere, the Collective Security Treaty Organization, and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. The goal is primarily to find out the possible contributions to security in the region from the point of view of the mandates of regional institutions and their capacity. As the authors will show, the potential of Eurasian regional institutions to provide security is substantial, and it partly materializes itself in concrete policy measures.
F52|Fighting terrorism in Africa: evidence from bundling and unbundling institutions|Abstract This study assesses government mechanisms in the fight against terrorism with particular emphasis on the bundling and unbundling of ten governance dynamics. The empirical evidence is based on a panel of 53 African countries for period 1998–2012 and generalized method of moments. The following findings are established. First, for the most part, political governance and its constituents, respectively, have negative effects on all terrorism dynamics, with the following consistent increasing order of negative magnitude: unclear terrorism, transnational terrorism, domestic terrorism and total terrorism. Second, overwhelmingly for economic and institutional governances, the governance dynamics and their constituent components affect terrorism negatively, with the magnitude on domestic terrorism consistently higher than that on transnational terrorism. Third, for most specifications, the effect of general governance is consistently negative on terrorism variables. Theoretical and practical policy implications are discussed.
F52|The Impact of Terrorism on Well-being: Evidence from the Boston Marathon Bombing|A growing literature concludes that terrorism impacts the economy, yet less is known about its impact on utility. This paper estimates the impact of the 2013 Boston Marathon Bombing on well-being, by exploiting representative U.S. daily data. Using both a regression discontinuity and an event study design, whereby the 2012 Boston marathon serves as a counterfactual, we find a sharp reduction in well-being, equivalent to a two percentage point rise in annual unemployment. The effect is stronger for women and those living in nearby States, but does not persist beyond one week, thus demonstrating the resilience of well-being to terrorism.

F52|Emerging challenges to long-term peace and security in Mozambique|Mozambique's transition from civil war to peace is often considered among the most successful implementations of a peace agreement in the post-Cold War era. Following the signing of the 1992 Rome General Peace Accords (GPA), the country has not experienced any large-scale recurrence of war. Instead, Mozambique has made impressive progress in economic growth, poverty reduction, improved security, regional cooperation and post-war democratisation. Mozambique has also made significant strides in the provision of primary healthcare, and steady progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Notwithstanding these stellar achievements, Mozambique still faces a large number of political, social and economic problems: poverty, unemployment, natural resource boom, increasing political exclusion, dependence on foreign aid, and low access to social and economic services and facilities. This paper unpacks these challenges and the implications for Mozambique's long-term peace and security.
F52|I hope I die before I get old: The supply side of the market for suicide bombers|"We explore the supply side of the market for suicide bombers. While the strategic edge of suicide attacks for certain terrorist organizations has been thoroughly explored, the motivation of the suppliers remains quite mysterious. Following a review of existing theoretical approaches and empirical findings we develop a model of the supply of suicide bombing, the motivation of which is expressive but time inconsistent. The model implies terrorist organizations to provide a commitment device in exchange for the ""services'' of those suicide bombers' that do not suffer from any mental or physical burden of life. By contrast, suicide attackers that do suffer from some sufficiently severe burden of life are not reliant on any commitment device and should therefore be expected to more frequently act as lonesome-wolf attackers."
F52|Americans’ Responses to Terrorism and Mass-Shooting: Evidence from the American Time Use Survey and Well-Being Module|A small but significant literature concludes that terrorism impacts the economy, although the impact of mass-shooting has not yet been addressed by economists. We compare the economic effects of two tragedies: the 2013 Boston Marathon Bombing and the 2012 Sandy Hook School Shooting. Fatal attacks are rare on any given day, and to estimate their effects we combine RDD with differences-in-differences. Using diaries of daily activities for a representative, random sample of Americans, we find a decline of over half an hour per day in average hours worked, while time spent accessing the media increased slightly. Active leisure fell after the BMB but increased after the SHSS. Daily data on emotional feelings reveal that subjective well-being fell dramatically after the BMB, and especially so for women, who are likely more averse to risk; but the findings are mixed for the SHSS. The latter induced a significant increase in meaningfulness, which was greatest for respondents with college education. We discuss these differences against economic, a priori, and drive conclusions that may be relevant for policy.
F52|The cost of sanctions: Estimating lost trade with gravity|"Economic sanctions are a frequently used tool of foreign policy. Constraining trade flows towards or from the target country is supposed to coerce its government into changing certain policies. However, sanctions constitute an obstacle to trade, thereby affecting flows of all countries, including those of sanctioning countries themselves. I gauge the global impact of three recent sanctions regimes using a structural gravity framework and quantify the ""lost trade"" in a general equilibrium counterfactual exercise. Each of the episodes, sanctions against Iran, Russia and Myanmar, are instructive in their own way, due to the different nature of bilateral trade and severity of measures applied."
F52|Sanctioned to Death? The Impact of Economic Sanctions on Life Expectancy and its Gender Gap|We empirically analyze the effect of UN and US economic sanctions on life expectancy and its gender gap in target countries. Our sample covers 98 less developed and newly industrialized countries over the period 1977–2012. We employ a matching approach to account for the endogeneity of sanctions. Our results indicate that an average episode of UN sanctions reduces life expectancy by about 1.2–1.4 years. The corresponding decrease of 0.4–0.5 years under an average episode of US sanctions is significantly smaller. In addition, we find evidence that women are affected more severely by the imposition of sanctions. Sanctions not being “gender-blind” indicates that they disproportionately affect (the life expectancy of) the more vulnerable members of society. We also detect effect heterogeneity, as the reduction in life expectancy accumulates over time and countries with a better political environment are less heavily affected by economic sanctions. Finally, we provide some evidence that an increase in child mortality and Cholera deaths as well as a decrease in public spending on health care are transmission channels through which UN sanctions adversely affect life expectancy in the targeted countries.
F52|Las presiones políticas y empresariales en el marco del proceso de negociación para la entrada de España en la Comunidad Económica Europea (c. 1962-1968)|The admission of Spain as a member of the European Union was a long process of 24 years. During this time, our country used all kind of tools at its disposal (diplomatic, ecomomic, political) to avoid the fact that Spain was not a democracy but a dictatorial regime. In this article, one particular way of forcing the European Union to accept Spain's application is examined. The idea was to put pressure on the managers of the main European companies working in Spain, in order to ease the political negotiation with their respective countries. Attention is mainly focused on Dutch and Italian firms (and managers) with interests in Spain. There are few studies addressing this peculiar lobbying of countries directed at specific companies. Ways are shown on how to measure the real impact of these economic pressures. KEY Classification-JEL: F15. F52. N24
F52|Redefining Human Security. The Case of Albania|This paper offers a critical study of the concept and issues of human security. Its usage, definition and applicability may differ since different authors explain issues related to security differently. Although there is still no common definition on what human security is, most authors agree that human security is related to individuals in terms of their wellbeing. For too long, human security has been focused on the protection of state territory, regarded as the traditional perception of security. This kind of interpretation refers to a narrow security concept, not well constructed and incapable of addressing most of the important issues related to the security of the individual. The issue of security for a nation is quite different to the issue of security for individuals, because the first tends to protect the boundaries of the state where people live while the second aims to protect all human being from insecurities. Human security is a new challenge in today’s world; it presents new threats which are far away from the threats generated by the traditional concept of human security. The new concept of human security should be analysed in people’s daily lives, not in a country’s guns and weapons. To protect people’s lives means respecting all human rights prescribed in domestic law and international conventions; violating them means causing human insecurities and the failure of the state to fulfil its own responsibilities towards the law. Therefore, the protection and the welfare of the people should become first goal of the government. In cooperation with international organizations and NGOs, governments should find and promote appropriate policies to establish a political, economic and social security environment for all the people as citizens of that country.
F52|Ruská Makká Moc V Baltských Krajinách (Russia’S Soft Power In The Baltic States)|Predkladaný článok sa zameriava na súčasný výskum, ktorý poukazuje na fakt, že Rusko okrem tradičných nástrojov hospodárskeho a vojenského nátlaku na Baltské štáty, rozšírilo svoje pôsobenie o nástroje mäkkej moci za účelom legitimizovania svojich záujmov v post – sovietskom priestore ako výsledok existencie veľkej rusko-jazyčnej minority.Cieľom state je predstaviť nástroje mäkkej moci na základe výskumu Joseph-a Nye-a. Článok je informatívny a predkladá finančnú, organizačnú, diplomatickú, ideologickú, legislatívnu a hospodársku analýzu, ponúkajúc tak náhľad do podstaty ruskej mäkkej moci a snažiac sa zároveň analyzovať skutočné záujmy Ruskej federácie v post – sovietskom priestore. Poukazuje na jej obmedzenosť v dôsledku jej zamerania takmer výhradne na rusko-jazyčnú menšinu. Jej pozitívom však môže byť konštruktívna kritika USA. This paper focuses on the latest researches that show apart from traditional economic pressure and military policy, Russia has extended tools of influence in the Baltic States by soft power instruments to legitimate interests in the post-Soviet space as a result of the presence of large Russian-speaking minorities. The aim of the paper is to present the soft power sources and instruments of influence with factual backup from Joseph Nye. The paper is informative and provides financial, organisational, diplomatic, ideological, legal policy and economic analysis; providing an indication into the nature of Russia’s soft power and to transpose what Russia's real intentions are to advance pressure on the post-Soviet space. The result of which; Russia’s soft power is regarded as weak due to Russia’s influence directed to a particular audience of Russian-speaking citizens only. The advantage of this influence maybe, leading the constructive opposition to the United States, amongst authoritarian regimes
F52|Bol Putin K Západu Vždy Prieteľský? Interpretačná Štúdia Prvých Dvoch Funkčných Období Perzidenta Vladimíra Putina Vo Svetle Teórií Realizmu (Was Putin Ever Friendly To The West? An Expository Study Of The First Two Terms Of President Vladimir Putin, In Light Of The Theories Of Realism)|Medzi mnohými západnými analytikmi je zaužívané vnímanie Vladimíra Putina ako priateľa Západu, ktorý sa z dôvodu príčinných a štrukturálnych dôvodov, ako vojna v Iraku, rozširovanie NATO, protiraketová obrana vo východnej Európe alebo ceny ropy, zmenil na revanšistického vládcu, ktorým je dnes. Táto esej toto vyvracia a dokazuje, že bol vždy presvedčeným realistom vo vzťahu k taktickému zbližovaniu so Západom, sledujúc primárne svoje vlastné záujmy. Štúdia podčiarkuje dôležitosť prvých dvoch funkčných období Putina v kontexte stanovenia jeho budúcich politík. Štúdia je má vysvetľujúci charakter a testuje teóriu realizmu na krokoch Ruska počas prvých dvoch vlád Putina, ktoré rozsiahlo korešpondujú s obdobím vlády G. W. Busha. It is common notion among a lot of Western analysts that Vladimir Putin was a friend of the West, and due to causal and structural reasons, like Iraq War, NATO expansion, East Europe missile defense and oil price index, he turned into a revanchist ruler that he is today. I argue, that was not the case, and this essay highlights that he was always a shrewd Realist, on a tactical alignment with the West, looking to chart his own course at his earliest convenience. The study of this time period, of Putin’s first two terms, highlights the importance and suggests future policy course in dealing with him. This study is expository and tests the theory of Realism with Russian actions under the first two terms of Vladimir Putin, which broadly coincides with the George W Bush Administration.

Ukrajinská kríza, a s tým súvisiaca anexia Krymu Ruskom, mala za následok zásadné obmedzenie spolupráce medzi Spojenými štátmi a Ruskou federáciou, ktoré sa vo výraznej miere dotklo problematiky jadrových zbraní. Cieľom článku je poukázať na bezprostredné, ako aj na očakávané dôsledky, ktoré pre proliferáciu z americko-ruského konfliktu vyplývajú. Tieto dôsledky článok analyzuje v rámci typológie proliferácie. Autor článku dochádza k záveru, že najväčšou obeťou americko-ruského konfliktu je v tomto ohľade spolupráca Washingtonu a Moskvy v oblasti jadrovej bezpečnosti a protiproliferačných aktivít. (This article deals with the impact of the current conflict between Russia and the USA on the proliferation of the nuclear weapons. Ukrainian crisis and the annexation of the Crimea by Russia has in its course significantly affected the American-Russian cooperation, with a spillover to the area of nuclear weapons. The goal of the article is to highlight the immediate and the expected consequences which emerge from this conflict in the area of nuclear proliferation. The consequences are analyzed through the framework of the nuclear proliferation typology. The article comes into conclusion that the major casualty of the American-Russian conflict is the cooperation of the USA and Russia regarding the global nuclear security and their antiproliferation activities.)
F52|The impact of terrorism on expectations, trust and happiness – the case of the November 13 attacks in Paris, France| I use quasi-experimental evidence to measure the impact of the 13 November 2015 attacks in Paris, France, on various channels through which terrorism can affect the economy. The evidence suggests the attacks reduced optimism and increased trust in the national government but did not affect current life satisfaction nor political orientation.
F52|Bootstrap Methods for Inference in the Parks Model|The Parks (1967) estimator is a workhorse for panel data and seemingly unrelated regression equation systems because it allows the incorporation of serial correlation together with heteroskedasticity and cross-sectional correlation. It is efficient both asymptotically and in small samples. Kmenta and Gilbert (1970) and more recently Beck and Katz (1995) note that estimated standard errors are biased downward, often severely. Instead of fixing the Parks standard errors, Beck and Katz abandon the efficient estimator in favor of a Prais-Winston estimator together with “panel corrected standard errors” (PCSE), a procedure that only partially reduces the standard error bias. In this paper we develop both parametric and nonparametric bootstrap approaches to inference that avoid the need to use biased standard errors. We then illustrate the effectiveness of our procedures using Monte Carlo experiments that show that the bootstrap gives rejection probabilities close to the nominal level chosen by the researcher.
F52|When to expect a coup d’état? An extreme bounds analysis of coup determinants|Abstract Over the last several decades, both economists and political scientists have shown interest in coups d’état. Numerous studies have been dedicated to understanding the causes of coups. However, model uncertainty still looms large. About one hundred potential determinants of coups have been proposed, but no consensus has emerged on an established baseline model for analyzing coups. We address this problem by testing the sensitivity of inferences to over three million model permutations in an extreme bounds analysis. Overall, we test the robustness of 66 factors proposed in the empirical literature based on a monthly sample of 164 countries that covers the years 1952–2011. We find that slow economic growth rates, previous coup experiences, and other forms of political violence to be particularly conducive to inciting coups.
F52|Precision-Guided or Blunt? The Effects of US Economic Sanctions on Human Rights|We use endogenous treatment-regression models to estimate the causal average treatment effect of US economic sanctions on four types of human rights. In contrast to previous studies, we find no support for adverse effects of sanctions on economic rights, political and civil rights, and basic human rights. With respect to women's rights, our findings even indicate a positive relationship. Emancipatory rights are, on average, strengthened when a country faces sanctions by the US. Our findings are robust when applying various changes to the empirical specification. Most importantly, this study provides strong evidence that the endogeneity of treatment assignment must be modelled when the consequences of sanctions are studied empirically.
F52|Sanctions et embargos : quels impacts sur le commerce de la France vers la Russie ?|Cuba, Birmanie, Iran, Syrie… les exemples d’actions diplomatiques prenant la forme de sanctions économiques ne manquent pas. Cet outil a l’avantage d’exercer une pression mesurée et non militaire sur le pays ciblé afin de l’amener à infléchir sa politique. L’impact peut être négligeable pour l’économie du pays qui sanctionne, sauf quand le pays ciblé représente un grand marché extérieur. Or c’est le cas de la Fédération de Russie à l’encontre de laquelle l’Union européenne a pris des sanctions en 2014. Ce pays offre en effet un marché non négligeable et a répondu aux sanctions occidentales par un embargo sévère sur les produits agricoles. Cette Lettre propose une estimation du coût économique (en termes de réduction des exportations), pour la France, des sanctions et contre-sanctions économiques imposées respectivement par les grandes puissances occidentales et la Russie au cours de l’année 2014.
F52|Global aspects of security environment — the ‘One Belt, One Road’ project|Motivation: The security environment is evolving globally and more attention is given for other than military threats. They are major concern related to internal and external security of any country as their nature is complex and it is evolving crossing national borders. Globalization is one of processes enabling freedom of operations for criminal, terrorist and other dangerous movements endangering security environment and economy. The ‘One Belt, One Road’ concept, promoted by China, is vulnerable for attacks along land and sea legs. To face threats an international cooperation of involved countries must create opportunities to counter all illegal acts. Aim: The aim of the paper is to study security threats influencing security of economy processes by analysing the ‘One Belt, One Road’ concept. In the paper theoretical methods have been adopted. Results: The research allowed drawing conclusions related to ways of overcoming the threats toward supply chains caused by evolving security environment based on the risks related to the ‘One Belt, One Road’ concept.
F52|Conflict, Defense Spending and Economic Growth in the Middle East: A Panel Data Analysis|The relationship between defense spending and economic growth is an active topic of debate for a long time. Defense spending may have negative consequences on the growth performance of developing countries in such conflict-ridden areas as the Middle East. This study is conducted to investigate the effects of defense spending on economic growth in a panel of twelve Middle Eastern countries over the period 1998-2012. The approach suggested by Swamy and Arora (1972) was employed for the empirical study. Findings of the empirical study suggest that defense spending has a negative effect on economic growth, which aggravates during times of internal and external conflicts
F52|The impact of US sanctions on poverty|In this paper, we analyze the effect of US economic sanctions on the target countries' poverty gap during the period 1982–2011. Econometrically, we employ a matching approach to account for differences in the countries' economic and political environment and the likelihood of being exposed to US sanctions. Our results indicate that US sanctions are adversely affecting those living in poverty as we observe a 3.8 percentage point (pp) larger poverty gap in sanctioned countries compared to a control group that is as close as possible in terms of observable pretreatment characteristics. In addition, we show that the impact of sanctions on poverty (i) increases with the severity of sanctions, (ii) is larger for multilateral sanctions than for unilateral sanctions imposed by only the United States, and (iii) is long-lasting as the poverty gap increases over the first 21years of a sanction regime.
F52|From pro-natalist rhetoric to population policies in Turkey? An OLG general equilibrium analysis|We build an overlapping generation (OLG) general equilibrium model of Turkey with survival rates and endogenous labour supply to simulate the economic, fiscal, welfare, and intergenerational redistribution impacts of the medium and high fertility demographic scenarios projected by the United Nations. We assume that the high fertility variant is a realistic demographic proxy for pro-natalist policies in Turkey. Our results show that on a purely economic basis, a higher fertility scenario in Turkey appears open to criticisms as it cannot offset the social security pressures of ageing, and it also involves intergenerational welfare redistributions so that current young adults are unlikely to endorse natalist rhetoric and policies.
F52|The competitiveness of Latin-American economies: Consolidation of the double diamond theory|The aim of this research is to assess the competitiveness of countries through the development of a new model, which is much simpler than those currently in use. The premise of this research is based on the fact that the current models contain numerous indicators/measures and cannot be applied to other contexts, such as the Latin American (LA) one. Based on the “diamond competitiveness” approach, we developed a model for the LA economies (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela). Our model has clear implications for both academics and policymakers and could help design state policies to improve economic growth, especially for the less developed LA economies.
F52|Regionalism and conflict: Peace creation and peace diversion|We investigate the implications of preferential trade agreements (PTAs) for interstate conflict. We set up a two-stage game with three competing importers, where first, two of the countries decide on whether to initiate war against each other, and subsequently, all three countries select their import tariffs. We show that PTAs produce both a “peace-creation” effect and a “peace-diversion” effect, whereby they reduce the likelihood of conflict between member countries (peace creation), but render the eruption of war between member and non-member countries more likely (peace diversion). This paper is the first to identify and explicitly model the peace-diversion effect of PTAs, and is also the only one in this literature to endogenize countries' terms of trade. We use data from the Correlates of War project to empirically test these predictions, and after controlling for endogeneity, we find robust evidence of both peace creation and peace diversion in relation to PTA establishment.
F52|Does political conflict hurt trade? Evidence from consumer boycotts|I estimate the impact of international conflict on bilateral trade relations using several incidents of politically motivated boycotts: The boycott of Danish goods by Muslim countries following the Muhammad Comic Crisis in 2005/2006, the Chinese boycott of Japanese goods in response to the Senkaku/Diaoyu Island conflict in 2012, the boycott of French products in the US over the Iraq War in 2003, and Turkey's boycott of Israel over the Gaza conflict in 2014. The results from difference-in-differences regressions and the synthetic control group method show that boycotts can have strong negative effects on bilateral trade in both goods and services. I estimate an average one-year trade disruption of 18.8% in the case of Denmark, 2.7% for Japan, and 1.7% for French imports, where in the latter two cases this effect is only short term. For all boycott instances, this is only a minor share of overall exports of the boycotted country over the same period. For the Iraq and Gaza conflicts, there is a reciprocal negative effect on the boycotted countries' imports from the boycotter. Product-level results are in line with intuition: Boycotts are most effective for consumer goods, especially highly-branded signature export goods such as Japanese cars, while having at most a temporary effect on intermediates and capital goods. An event study on Japanese stock market returns suggests that the Chinese boycott depressed stock values of explicitly boycotted Japanese firms only temporarily.
F52|Trading hard hats for combat helmets: The economics of rebellion in eastern Ukraine|Using new micro-level data on violence in Eastern Ukraine, this paper evaluates the relative merits of ‘identity-based’ and ‘economic’ explanations of civil conflict. The first view expects rebellion to be most likely in areas home to the geographic concentration of ethnolinguistic minorities. The second expects more rebel activity where the opportunity costs of insurrection are low. Evidence from the armed conflict in Ukraine supports the second view more than the first. A municipality’s prewar employment mix is a more robust predictor of rebel activity than local ethnolinguistic composition. Municipalities more exposed to trade shocks with Russia experienced a higher intensity of rebel violence throughout the conflict. Such localities also fell under rebel control earlier – and took longer for the government to liberate – than municipalities where the labor force was less dependent on exports to Russia.
F52|The economic effects of a counterinsurgency policy in India: A synthetic control analysis|Using the synthetic control method, we analyze the economic effects of a unique counterinsurgency response to the Naxalite insurgency in India. Of all the states affected by Naxalite violence, only one state, Andhra Pradesh, raised a specially trained and equipped police force in 1989 known as the Greyhounds, dedicated to combating the Naxalite insurgency. Compared to a synthetic control region constructed from states affected by Naxalite violence that did not raise a similar police force, we find that the per capita NSDP of Andhra Pradesh increased significantly over the period 1989–2000. Further, we find that the effects on the manufacturing sector are particularly strong. Placebo tests indicate that these results are credible and various difference-in-difference specifications using state and industry level panel data further corroborate these findings.
F52|Fighting African conflicts and crimes: which governance tools matter?|Purpose - – Crimes and conflicts are seriously undermining African development. The purpose of this paper is to assess the best governance tools in the fight against the scourges. Design/methodology/approach - – The authors assess a sample of 38 African countries. Owing to the cross-sectional structure of the data set, the authors adopt a heteroscedasticity consistent ordinary least squares estimation technique. For further robustness purposes, the authors employ Ramsey’s regression equation specification error test. Findings - – The following findings are established. First, democracy, autocracy and voice and accountability have no significant negative correlations with crime. Second, the increasing relevance of government quality in the fight is as follows: regulation quality, government effectiveness, political stability, rule of law and corruption-control. Third, corruption-control is the most effective mechanism in fighting crime (conflicts). Practical implications - – The findings are significantly strong when controlling for age dependency, number of police (and security) officers, per capita economic prosperity, educational level and population density. Justifications for the edge of corruption-control (as the most effective governance tool) and policy implications are discussed. Originality/value - – The study is timely given the political instability, wars and conflicts currently marring African development.
F52|Terrorism, Trade and Welfare: Some Paradoxes and a Policy Conundrum|We present a standard trade model and show that terrorism can be trade inducing, starting from autarky. In addition, terrorism can be shown to be welfare augmenting for a group of nations. Finally, we present some qualitative conditions that identify when a nation’s trade volume may rise (or fall) in response to a greater incidence of terrorism. Our trade and welfare results point to potential difficulties in international coordination of counterterrorism policy because of terrorism’s differential impact across nations.
F52|Military economics and military reform in Russia in 2015|Unlike previous years, the findings of analysis of Russia’s military economics and policy in 2015 fail to match what is perceived as absolute peacetime. The IISS, a world-leading authority on global security, argues that Russia is conducting a so-called hybrid warfare. The published views of western experts on hybrid warfare reflect the events occurred in Ukraine over the last two years. The spring of 2015 saw changes in accusations against Russia following Russia’s air strikes and cruise missiles strikes on the positions of ISIS terrorists in Syria. The fact that Russia is conducting special-purpose military operations is indisputable. Russia took the terrorist attack that brought down the Russian plane in Egypt, killing all 224 Russian passengers on board, as military assault against Russia’s nationals, thus forcing Russia to introduce retaliatory military counteractions against not only the ISIS in Syria but also against organizers and sponsors of terrorism. Later there were acts of terrorism in France, that prompted the French government to join the war against the ISIS, acting in conjunction with Russia and with a few other countries. Being unhappy with these developments, the Turkish government prepared the shoot down of a Russian military jet along the Syrian border. Russia responded with economic countersanctions, warning more sanctions could follow. Therefore, it appears logical that a new version of the Russian Federation National Security Strategy (Executive Order of the President No. 683 dated December 31, 2015) was approved on the very last day of 2015 .
F52|Leadership Qualities of Defence Officers for meeting Present and Future Requirements|"""Objective – The objective of this study is to find the qualities expected of an officer for meeting present and future requirements of the battle field. Methodology/Technique – The study was conducted by personally visiting all the Service Selection Centres of the Indian Armed Forces. The response of 449 officers were put through SPSS software system and analysed. Findings – The study reveals that though the present set of OLQs is sufficiently acceptable and no quality needs to be deleted, the recommendation is for technical knowledge and ability to train subordinates to be added to meet present and future requirements. Novelty – The study uses original data."""
F52|Individual Well-Being and the Allocation of Time Before and After the Boston Marathon Terrorist Bombing|There is a small literature on the economic costs of terrorism. We consider the effects of the Boston marathon bombing on Americans' well-being and time allocation. We exploit data from the American Time Use Survey and Well-Being Module in the days around the terrorist attack to implement a regression-discontinuity design. The bombing led to a significant and large drop of about 1.5 points in well-being, on a scale of one to six, for residents of the States close to Boston. The happiness of American women also dropped significantly, by almost a point, regardless of the State of residence. Labor supply and other time use were not significantly affected. We find no well-being effect of the Sandy Hook shootings, suggesting that terrorism is different in nature from other violent deaths.
F52|Can Russia's Military Expansion be Impossible Mission Force for its V-Shaped Growth Recovery under Declining Oil Prices?|This paper investigates whether Russia's expansion of military goods can be Impossible Mission Force (IMF) for its V-Shaped growth recovery under declining oil prices. Looking at long-run relationships between domestic outputs and international oil prices for 1995–2016, we focus on the impact of the military output expansion on growth of GDP and manufacturing for 2011–2016. We demonstrate that the military output expansion checked further growth retardation for 2012–2014 as a counter power against deteriorating oil prices or economic sanctions, while the military output expansion would not be likely to bolster up Russia's growth from 2015 onward without next oil windfalls.

F52|Wealth Effects of Rare Earth Prices and China’s Rare Earth Elements Policy|Abstract Rare earth elements (REEs) have become increasingly important because of their relative scarcity and worldwide increasing demand, as well as China’s quasi-monopoly of this market. REEs are virtually not substitutable, and they are essential for a variety of high-tech products and modern key technologies. This has raised serious concerns that China will misuse its dominant position to set export quotas in order to maximize its own profits at the expense of other rare earth user industries (wealth transfer motive). In fact, export restrictions on REEs were the catalyst for the U.S. to lodge a formal complaint against China in 2012 at the World Trade Organization (WTO). This paper analyzes possible wealth transfer effects by focusing on export quota announcements (the so-called MOFCOM announcements) by China, and the share price reactions of Chinese REE suppliers, the U.S. REE users, and the rest of the world REE refiners. Overall, we find limited support for the view of a wealth transfer in connection with MOFCOM announcements only when disentangling events prior to and post the initiation of the WTO trial, consistent with the trial triggering changes to China’s REE policy and recent announcement to abolish quotas. We do find, however, that extreme REE price movements have a first-order effect on all companies in the REE industry consistent with recent market trends to enable hedging against REE price volatility.
F52|Zakah Management for Poverty Alleviation in Indonesia and Brunei Darussalam|Concern for poverty is not new and has been the focus for centuries by historians, sociologists and economists. The cause has been identified, ranging from shortcomings in the administration of income support, until the injustice of the social and economic system. Various attempts have been proposed, from the reform of social security system for changes in the form of the socio-economic system. Because poverty is a multidimensional problem, solutions to poverty require a set of coordinated action, particularly through charity. Indonesia, which has a population with a large population, of course, the problem of poverty continues to be a problem in economic development. Nevertheless, the potential zakat Indonesia larger community and cooperation among stakeholders and government regulation is a solution to reduce the level of poverty in Indonesia. It is certainly different from the Brunei Darussalam to the level of a small population and large government revenues, management of zakat by MUIB in the form of cash grants, the capital of commerce, and others are implementable can solve the problem of poverty in this country.
F52|Too Much Idealism? Ferguson, Kissinger, and the Vietnam War|Ferguson provides evidence from Kissinger’s early academic writings involving Kantian philosophy and nineteenth century diplomacy, but continuing much later, that his subject was not the one-dimensional realist many have taken him to be. Kissinger was in fact a Kantian idealist, thought Prince Metternich to be backward-looking, and had serious reservations about the thrust of Bismarck’s power politics… Ferguson’s account of his record regarding Vietnam during the Kennedy andJohnson administrations demonstrates that Kissinger never opposed overall war strategy, although he made tactical criticisms of it. Ferguson and Kissinger both neglect evidence that Kennedy was moving in an opposite direction regarding Vietnam, and that serious intra-Vietnam peace talks were underway in 1963. Such neglect leaves a misleading impression about alternatives… Ferguson’s account provides much evidence that Kissinger’s, and US, expectations for what might be obtained at the negotiating table in 1967-68 were unrealistic–this is a cardinal criticism of Kissinger and Nixon’s performance… Kissinger’s premises for continuing in Vietnam were usually geopolitical, rather than based on careful understanding of what was happening on the ground; and his view of power relations, at least during the 1950s and 1960s, gave insufficient attention to the role of nonaligned countries in contributing to international stability. Also, Kissingerthought maintaining US credibility an almost independent rationalefor continuing the war effort. Credibility arguments work best, however, where their advocates are otherwise on the right side of history. Just as the US security framework survived concessions to avoid nuclear war over Berlin or Cuba, it would survive the post-Vietnam consequence thattroop commitments would henceforth be severely limited. The Kissinger-Nixon approach to Vietnam suffered from too little foreign policy realism, not too much.
F52|Editorial Volume 12|Dear Reader, As I write this first official reports confirm the existence of gravitational waves which Albert Einstein predicted a century ago. Ground breaking scientific discoveries such as this reaffirm to me the spatial relationships between the universe and human security issues, placing those issues into a new perspective that contrast with perspectives formed by our everyday lives. Nevertheless, for the majority of humanity, human security in its diverse manifestations remains the most significant consideration in their lives whereas the nature of gravity is hardly given a thought until such time when some clever technologist uses such a new insight and ends up revolutionising our lives.
F52|Human Security: Chinaâ€™s Discourses and Experience|This article addresses three research questions by elaborating on how the idea of human security is understood or defined by the government and social actors in China; how the distinction between the â€œprotectionâ€ aspect and â€œempowermentâ€ aspect of human security is understood and accepted; and what particular downside risks are perceived as pressing human security issues in China. Amongst these the major ones include air pollution, food security, and cyber security. The study reveals that, whilst as a term â€œhuman securityâ€ is not frequently used, there have been significant discussions leading to the consideration and implementation of various human security practices in China. The idea of human security has been firmly established and threats to human security detected. For both the government and academic community in China, human security and state security are not necessarily confrontational but can rather be combined, often complimenting each other. Recent developments in China are pointing to a positive direction in terms of human security in the country.
F52|A Review of 'New Explorations into International Relations: Democracy, Foreign Investment Terrorism and Conflict'|"Author and Scholar Seug-Whan Choi's ""New Explorations into International Relations: democracy, foreign investment, terrorism and conflict"" serves as a nexus of interdisciplinary analysis and findings rooted in evidenced based research. Indeed, the author set out to challenge and test traditional international relations (IR) theories by implementing rigorous scientific methods in an attempt to produce policy recommendations and encourage a frameshift in methodological approaches. One underlying theme that recurs throughout this work is the requirement for rigorous statistical analysis and education in the field of political science. This has already begun and a re-emphasis is encouraged and greatly welcomed."
F52|A Review of 'Law's Impunity: Responsibility and the Modern Private Military Company'|The mercenaries and mercenarism are two points of concern for scholars studying the rules of war throughout history. Both in jus ad bellum (JAB) and jus in bellum (JIB) we can find a framework of international law crafted to impede the participation of individuals motivated to take part in hostilities to get private gain. Nevertheless, paradoxically, the problem is when corporations are supported by domestic law to perform serviced in ground combats abroad. In the latter case, Human Rights Law (HRL), International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and International Criminal Law (ICL) present numerous gaps that make it difficult to incriminate corporations, which perpetuate the impunity among private organizations involved in human rights violations in conflict zones.
F52|A Piece of Land or Peace on the Land: How Much Is a Peasant's Life Worth in Brazil?|Land inequality in Brazil is alarming and several poor individuals living in rural areas do not have enough income to survive decently. The struggle to access land should lead to a paradigm shift with social movements leading this process since democratization. Their strategies vary, but usually focus on complementary activities of mass mobilization that culminate in the occupation of unproductive land that is not fulfilling its social function in order to force expropriation and the creation of new settlements. This study aims to investigate, through empirical evidence, if such strategies are having the desired effect of allowing the poor to access land, without increasing the already high numbers, and potentially aggravating the violent characteristics, of such disputes. During the Cardoso and Lula presidential administrations the relation between the number of new settlements and the number of deaths caused by land disputes increased. However, there is still a long way to go to improve this policy and achieve positive results. Overall, is this struggle for the reduction of inequality in the Brazilian countryside being won? Is the sacrifice paying off? And what is the price regarding the relation between land conflict victims and the creation of new rural settlements?
F52|Pacification & Mega-events in Rio de Janeiro: Urbanization, Public Security & Accumulation by Dispossession|This paper outlines how Brazil's latest public security initiative-its highly controversial Police Pacification Campaign (UPP)-is an integral component of a neoliberal political framework that is enacting rapid urbanization projects in and around strategically located favelas (informal settlements or slums) of Rio de Janeiro. Specifically, it evaluates what kinds of economic development initiatives are moving forward, how they are facilitated by the UPP, how they connect to the city's mega-events, and who is profiting from them. The article also examines how the pacification has affected residents in three favelas over a seven-year period from the inauguration of the UPP in 2008 through to mid-2015.
F52|On Unstable Ground: Issues Involved in Greening Space in the Rocinha Favela of Rio De Janeiro|This paper is based on fieldwork undertaken in conjunction with Green My Favela, a land use restoration project that works with informal and vulnerable income sector residents to reclaim chronically degraded public areas by creating gardens inside the urban favelas of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The paper reveals how government intervention policies employed in the lead up to the 2016 Olympics are destabilizing the fragile social fabric of the cityâ€™s largest favela, Rocinha, through military occupation and urbanization activities that threaten an already low and unstable human security threshold.
F52|Rio De Janeiroâ€™s Olympic Legacy: Public Security for Whom?|As Rio de Janeiro struggles to hold itself together through the Games of the XXXI Olympiad, its much lauded public security Games plan, including its highly controversial police pacification programâ€”long promoted as one of the cornerstones of Rioâ€™s Olympic legacyâ€”descends into a state of near total collapse. This paper takes an intimate look at what is likely the last days of this contentious pacification policy, the part it plays in the wider â€˜Games Security Planâ€™, and how and why it has been implemented in the lead up to the 2016 Summer Olympics.
F52|Review of On-Scene Management of Mass-Casualty Attacks|Background : The scene of a mass-casualty attack (MCA) entails a crime scene, a hazardous space, and a great number of people needing medical assistance. Public transportation has been the target of such attacks and involves a high probability of generating mass casualties. The review aimed to investigate challenges for on-scene responses to MCAs and suggestions made to counter these challenges, with special attention given to attacks on public transportation and associated terminals. Methods : Articles were found through PubMed and Scopus, â€œrelevant articlesâ€ as defined by the databases, and a manual search of references. Inclusion criteria were that the article referred to attack(s) and/or a public transportation-related incident and issues concerning formal on-scene response. An appraisal of the articlesâ€™ scientific quality was conducted based on an evidence hierarchy model developed for the study. Results : One hundred and five articles were reviewed. Challenges for command and coordination on scene included establishing leadership, inter-agency collaboration, multiple incident sites, and logistics. Safety issues entailed knowledge and use of personal protective equipment, risk awareness and expectations, cordons, dynamic risk assessment, defensive versus offensive approaches, and joining forces. Communication concerns were equipment shortfalls, dialoguing, and providing information. Assessment problems were scene layout and interpreting environmental indicators as well as understanding setting-driven needs for specialist skills and resources. Triage and treatment difficulties included differing triage systems, directing casualties, uncommon injuries, field hospitals, level of care, providing psychological and pediatric care. Transportation hardships included scene access, distance to hospitals, and distribution of casualties. Conclusion : Commonly encountered challenges during unintentional incidents were added to during MCAs, implying specific issues for safety, assessment, triage, and treatment, which require training. Effectively increasing readiness for MCAs likely entail struggles to overcome fragmentation between the emergency services and the broader crisis management system as well as enabling critical and prestige-less, context-based assessments of needed preparatory efforts.
F52|Nation Building Through Foreign Intervention: Evidence from Discontinuities in Military Strategies|This study uses discontinuities in U.S. strategies employed during the Vietnam War to estimate their causal impacts. It identifies the effects of bombing by exploiting rounding thresholds in an algorithm used to target air strikes. Bombing increased the military and political activities of the communist insurgency, weakened local governance, and reduced non-communist civic engagement. The study also exploits a spatial discontinuity across neighboring military regions, which pursued different counterinsurgency strategies. A strategy emphasizing overwhelming firepower plausibly increased insurgent attacks and worsened attitudes towards the U.S. and South Vietnamese government, relative to a hearts and minds oriented approach.
F52|Conceptual Approaches to Understanding and Ensuring National Economic Security: Scientific Theories and State Strategies|The author investigates the emergence and development of the economic security concept. He gives an overview of the main conceptual approaches to national economic security typical for the United States, Japan, China and Russia. The article introduces the concept of the homocentric and civitacentric paradigms to describe two fundamentally opposing approaches to national economic security. The analysis is carried out for scientific theories and state strategies. This allows to trace parallels and find contradictions between them. The paper shows the evolutionary path of the theories of economic security and identifies key factors that influenced the research in this area. The study reveals a number of internal contradictions in the official state strategies relating to economic aspects of national security. The result of the study is to develop a holistic view of the prevailing conceptual approaches to national economic security. This is important in the further development of optimal models of its ensuring in different socio- economic and political conditions. The results can be used for further scientific analysis of the theoretical foundation of ensuring economic security.
F52|Investment Policies Related to National Security: A Survey of Country Practices|While many countries have become ever more open and welcoming for foreign investment, the awareness of risks for national security stemming from or related to international investment has increased. Many governments have thus introduced policies that seek to protect their national security with the smallest possible impact on investment flows. Guidelines for recipient country investment policies relating to national security adopted at the OECD in 2009 provide recommendations for the design and implementation of such policies. This paper reviews commonalities and differences of policies implemented in 54 countries with a special focus on arrangements in 17 economies that have explicit policies in this area. It offers a comparative analysis of countries’ investment policy approaches to address national security concerns stemming from foreign investment; classifies the different forms of restrictions to address these concerns; identifies differences between restrictions on ownership and acquisitions; and presents how countries define the scope of application of their policies. The study also assesses how countries have implemented some of the key principles set out in the 2009 Guidelines in actual policy in order to meet their need to safeguard national security while reducing the impact of these policies on international investment.
F52|Economic Sectors Of Strategic Importance To The National Security. A Case Of Poland|The purpose of the paper is to properly define the economic sectors of strategic importance to the national security and to evaluate the state’s tools which protect this security. The paper’s methodology is based on two analyses; the former focusing on instruments which are applied by the state in order to control certain fields of the economy, and the latter investigating economic sectors in terms of concentration, impact on the state security and integration with other sectors. The paper also defines the criteria which helped to identify sectors which have strategic importance to the national security, i.e. production and supply of electric energy; extraction and supply of natural gas; extraction, distribution and storage of liquid propellants, telecommunications, banking industry; banknotes and documents’ production (together with related IT solutions) and military industry. The article leads to the conclusion that these sectors are strategically important to the national security. However, there is still a lack of coherent and complete legal regulations that would protect the national security interest related to the part of the economy represented by the analyzed sectors and companies.
F52|Destination EU and USA: Improving Export Potential of Pakistan by Trading with India|This paper is the extension of popular work of Murshed and Mamoon(2010) that suggests that India Pakistan proximity to global trade can significantly mitigate conflict between these two nations. The paper analyses bilateral trade patterns between India Pakistan with its major exporting destinations in a simple OLS framework. It finds that if bilateral trade between two nations increases that will improve exports of Pakistan in US, EU and UAE. This finding has significant implications for improvement of ties between the two countries. Furthermore, trading with India also full fills Pakistani Government’s emphasis on Trade not Aid. This aspect of India Pakistan trade has not been investigated before.
F52|Intelligence and defense spending: a cross-country evidence|This paper investigates the association between intelligence and military expenditure, across 159 nations during the 1990-2013 period. The econometric results we provide are surprising. On one hand, we fail to confirm that intelligence has monotonic effect on military spending. However, the results also suggest a novel type of intelligence-military spending nexus. In particular, the regression estimates show that there is inverted U-shaped relationship between IQ and military expenditure. From a policy perspective these findings suggest that cognitive development that increases military expenditures is sustainable so long as defense sector has positive spillovers on economic and social well-being.
F52|Transnational policing: preemption and deterrence against elusive perpetrators| Why does a state directly police certain kinds of transnational perpetrators by itself while indirectly policing other kinds through their host government? To address this question, we develop a formal model, where Defender chooses either to police Perpetrators or to make Proxy do so. According to our theory, the delegation of policing can enhance its effectiveness in light of Proxy’s three advantages: (a) Proxy can convince Perpetrators of punishments more credibly than Defender (communicative advantage); (b) Proxy is more likely to identify Perpetrators and detect what they hold dear (informational advantage); (c) Proxy can cripple and punish Perpetrators more effectively (offensive advantage). On the other hand, the delegation may cause inefficiency if Defender has limited information about Proxy’s choice or cost of policing. Depending on the relative size between these advantages and disadvantages, one of the following four forms of policing may emerge: (i) Defender polices Perpetrators on her own (e.g. Somali counter-piracy operations); (ii) Defender induces Proxy to police Perpetrators (U.S. War on Drugs in Colombia and Mexico); (iii) Defender and Proxy together police Perpetrators (Operation Inherent Resolve); (iv) two or more Defender-Proxy states police Perpetrators in each’s own domain (Interpol, Budapest Convention).
F52|Fiscal Policy in Indonesia: Analysis of State Budget 2017 in Islamic Economic Perspective|This study ananlyze the State Budget (APBN) 2017 of Indonesia in Islamic economic perspective. The state budget is prepared using the rules of public economics consisting of state revenues, state expenditures, and budget financing has the posture of the budget, the issues of fiscal policy, and the role of the government in carrying out its functions. With the analysis of Islamic economics, fiscal policy in the State Budget 2017 is the duty of the government to implement the budget for the public welfare with indicators on aspects of religion (religious life), life (justice and security), intellect (education), descent (health and social security family), and treasure (income distribution and access to employment).
F52|European Secession: Economic Integration on the Road to the Political Desintegration|European national governments have faced since 90s two contradictory pressures. While European Union requires ever closer economic integration, individual regions have called for increasing political disintegration. In 2014 four crucial referendums on the independence of regions in Ukraine, Italy, Scotland and Spain were held. This wave of secession movement and the fear of contagion to states with latent autonomous tendencies turned attention from the integration studies to the research of disintegration. This consultation deals with the literature review of the political-economic aspects of secession tendencies in European integration. Secession spreads especially among the most developed regions of nation states. In an environment of economic barriers the right to secession is therefore not Pareto-optimal. Economic integration of small states, however, provides the benefits of the single market and reduces costs for the secession of the mother country. Comprehensive survey serves as a basis for future research of the political economy of conflict in the contemporary secession pressures.
F52|The key goal of this research is to empirically determine the effects of terrorism on FDI of the selected EU and EEA member countries|The key goal of this research is to empirically determine the effects of terrorism on FDI of the selected EU and EEA member countries.The methodology is based on a system-GMM estimator for dynamic panel data models on a sample covering up to 29 countries, and 13-year periods from 2000 to 2013. The main results confirm that terrorism incidents, economic and institutional variables are found to depress FDI of analysed EU and EEA countries. It can be concluded that terrorism and institutional stability are most influential on FDI inflows of the observed EU and EEA countries. The results indicate that terrorist activities reduce security and confidence of investors in countries exposed to terrorist activities, reducing the inflow of foreign direct investment. The recommendations and proposals are given based on the results of empirical analysis.
F52|Trading with the Enemy|We analyze how trade openness matters for interstate conflict over productive resources. Our analysis features a terms-of-trade channel that makes security policies trade-regime dependent. Specifically, trade between adversarial countries reduces their incentives to arm given the opponent's arming. If they have a sufficiently similar mix of initial resource endowments, a move to trade brings with it a reduction in resources diverted to conflict and thus wasted, as well as the familiar gains from trade. Otherwise, a move to trade can induce greater arming by one of them and thus need not be welfare improving for both. Moreover, when the two adversarial countries do not trade with each other but instead trade with a third (friendly) country, a move from autarky to trade intensifies conflict between the two adversaries. Building on the welfare implications, we also analyze the endogenous choice of trade regimes.
F52|The UK and EU Foreign, Security and Defence Policy after Brexit: Integrated, Associated or Detached?|None of the existing models for the future trade policy relationship between the UK and the EU come with a predetermined foreign and security policy relationship. This article assesses how the future EU-UK foreign and security policy relationship might be organised post-Brexit. It provides evaluation of the current EU-UK interrelationship in the fields of the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) and assesses the degree to which the UK is presently integrated into EU decision-making and implementation. It highlights that the UK needs to determine the degree to which it wants autonomy or even divergence from existing EU policies. The article concludes by rehearsing the costs and benefits of three possible future relationships between the UK and EU foreign, security and defence policy: integrated, associated or detached.
F52|Openness of the economy, terms of trade, and arms|It is estimated that world military spending in 2011 amounted to over 2.5% of the world's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This corresponds to a spending of $233 per person in the world at 2010 constant prices, an amount close to the GDP per capita of the poorest country in the world. Therefore, it is important for economists to understand the allocation of resources to this sector of the economy. I present a model that explores the determinants of a country's level of military spending. I show how greater gains from trade can lead to greater military expenditures to protect them. It is also found that expansion in the demand for a country's tradable commodities, that is, an improvement in that country's terms of trade, will impact defense spending. Several other propositions emerge from the model which are then empirically tested using both pooled and time series data. The statistical results support the model's propositions.
F52|Arab Spring-A Proxy War?|This paper will argue the concept of ?Arab Spring? which has been used as a tool for perception management to cover up a multi-dimensional Proxy War that is ongoing within the borders of Middle East.Being an allusion to 1848 revolutions, which is known as ?Spring of Nations?, Arab Spring is ought to be a grassroots movement. It is accepted as a breaking point for Arab Peninsula by western scholars, intellectuals and policy makers. However Liberte-Éqalite under the concept of democracy seems to be the subject matter of the process, the debate was rounding about establishment of legitimate governments immediately.Therefore, until the government of Syria?s unexpected resistance to so called social movements, Western countries insisted on the existence of the uprisings autonomous character in Middle East. After the challenge of Syria it became harder to claim autonomy or civility for the movements at the region. The direct intervention of western countries to the process made it even harder. In light of these developments building an intellectual argument on what is happening or expected in Middle East became more and more blurry. To clarify the process we propose a new point of view which suggests to rethink the Arab Spring starting from scratch. Can the so cold autonomous revolt against authoritarian regimes in Middle East be a proxy war which is sponsored by international actors?The Western Governments? publicly discussions of some vital issues which includes direct violations of a ?sovereign states? sovereignty rights such as weapon supplying to rebellions, can be considered as an indicator for such a hidden agenda. Likewise the refugee inflow to other countries can be a supporting indicator of this theory. The people who were so determined to take over the authoritarian regimes in their countries by revolution are now fleeing to Europe. What has changed and why those revolutionist are not holding the lines. Were they ever? This process is either a Global Civil War, which seems unlikely since nation states still exists and international law protects their existence, or more likely a Proxy War which makes it possible to fight war in a foreign country without any declaration. The ongoing Proxy War in Middle East is an example of post-modern warfare. The new wars will not seem to be fought by national armies. To ovoid the political and legal consequences of modern war, using proxies seems to be the future of new warfare.
F52|The political meaning and thrust of populist movements|Populist movements are abound in Europe: since the 1990s such movements and parties as Podemos in Spain, the Lega Nord in Italy, the UKIP in England or the Front National in France sprang up and attracted substantial numbers of voters and followers over time. This articles restricts itself to populist movemements which claim to speak for the people, oppose elites in politics and economy and large associations and demand direct democracy. The thesis of this primarily theoretical paper is that these movements and parties protest against the perceived erosion of the political status of the people as the legitimate constituent of democratic rule. According to populist views, political and social elites violate the obligation of the implicit contract between elites and the people to pursue the common good of the people in exchange for the people's loyalty to political rule. This loyalty appears to be challengd by perceived corruption, fatal governmental decisions and actions risking the wealth and the security of the nation, among which immigration politics rank highly. Immigration violates this contract because, as populists see it, only the people (that is: the legal and legitimate members of a constituency) should profit from the provisions of the state (welfare, safety, public order). The paper will illustrate this thesis by elaborating on the meaning of Pegida populism and reflect on the possible consequences of populism for representative democracy.
F52|Economic Development and Foreign Policy, The Case of Syria 1949-1954|This paper aims to enhance our understanding of the relationship between economic development and foreign policy in Syria in the post-independence period. In this endeavour, Syria has been taken as a state of the global South that was bound to be preoccupied with its condition of underdevelopment, dependence, vulnerability and permeability. Adopting a political economy approach to examine a period of instability marked by three military coups, this paper presents socioeconomic needs of the country as a source of foreign policy and identifies the acquisition of external resources as a key foreign policy objective.
F52|Do travel visa requirements impede tourist travel?|Abstract Yes. Using a travel visa data set developed by Lawson and Lemke (2012) and travel flow data from the World Bank and the UN’s World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), we investigate the deterrent effect of travel visa requirements on travel flows. At the aggregate level, a one standard deviation more severe travel visa regime, as measured, is associated with a 30 % decrease in inbound travel. At the bilateral level, having a travel visa requirement on a particular country is associated with a 70 % reduction in inbound travel from that country. The gains associated with eliminating travel visas appear to be very large.
F52|Interdependence between US and European military spending: a panel cointegration analysis (1988-2013)| The aim of this article is to study the interdependence of military spending between US and a panel of European countries in the period 1988-2013. The empirical estimation is based on a: (1) unit root tests and a cointegration analysis and (2) fully modified ordinary least squares and dynamic ordinary least squares estimations. General results highlight that military spending of European countries is: (1) positively associated with US military spending and (2) negatively associated with average military spending of other European countries.
F52|Defence budgets in the post-Cold War era: a spatial econometrics approach| This paper examines the determinants of national defence budgets in the post-Cold War era employing a spatial econometric framework. Using data for 124 countries over a 16-year time period, I examine spatial relationships in defence spending to investigate how countries account for the military spending of other countries when setting their budgets. Using specially developed weighting matrices, the regression results indicate that defence budgets are positively spatially correlated. These results provide support for the use of ‘external’ factors when examining defence budgets over this time period. The importance of a country’s spatial location when setting its budget is further examined through the identification of regions of high and low defence spending.
F52|French Roast: Consumer Response to International Con flict--Evidence from Supermarket Scanner Data|Do consumers boycott in response to international conflict? We show that during the 2003 U.S.-France dispute over the Iraq War, the market share of French-sounding, U.S. supermarket brands declined. The dispute was a negative shock to U.S. consumers’ associations with France. French-sounding brands, which consumers perceive to be French imports but are not, allow us to isolate the dispute’s effect on economic behavior, as these brands’ only link to France is through consumers’ associations. Our estimates, derived from a nationwide sample of weekly supermarket sales for over 8,000 brands, are robust to a variety of alternate explanations. We also show that supermarkets with a higher proportion of customers who are U.S. citizens (i.e., who more strongly identify with the U.S. national identity) exhibited sharper boycotts.
F52|War and Relatedness|We find that more closely related populations are more prone to engage in international conflict with each other. We provide an economic interpretation based on two connected mechanisms. First, more closely related groups share more similar preferences over rival goods and are thus more likely to fight over them. Second, rulers have stronger incentives to conquer populations more similar to their own, to minimize postconflict heterogeneity in preferences over government types and policies. We find support for these mechanisms using evidence on international conflicts over natural endowments and on territorial changes, including decolonization.
F52|Evolution Of The Concepts Of Economic Security|World experience of legal maintenance of economic security has been studied. The formation of national economic interests and awareness of society are investigated. Evolutions of concepts of economic security in different countries have been considered. Features of the formation of the institutional and organizational basis for the economic security have been studied. The chronological incorporation of key legislative acts in the sphere of economic security has been developed. Monitoring international economic law, foreign and domestic legal acts have been conducted. In turn, this allowed tracing the sequence of signing and organizing documents to use them easily in practice.
F52|Drivers of Greek and Turkish Defense Spending|This paper evaluates the factors responsible for maintaining substantial military expenditures in Greece and Turkey. The presented research encompasses theoretical and empirical aspects. First, defense spending by both countries was analyzed based on statistical data from international sources. Next, the theoretical determinants of budgetary spending are reviewed, which consider political, economic and military factors behind high expenditures on the army in Greece and in Turkey. Finally, Granger causality tests is applied to determine whether a causal relation between variables exists in the case of these two countries.
F52|The relative attractiveness of Germany and the United States for Chinese overseas investments|Over the last decade, Chinese outward direct investment (ODI) has been rapidly growing in technologically advanced countries. In this paper, the investment trends are explored with a particular focus on the United States of America and Germany. While the Chinese investors are interested in the U.S. as a powerhouse of technology creation, they may also find Germany an attractive option with its concentrated technological offerings and an easier access. Using 13 factors explores not only technological attractiveness, but also cultural affinity and any trade frictions and investment openness. This paper looks to see if Germany or the USA is overall a more successful location for Chinese ODI.
F52|Friendly fire - the trade impact of the Russia sanctions and counter-sanctions|Economic sanctions are a frequent instrument of foreign policy. In a diplomatic conflict, they aim to elicit a change in the policies of foreign governments by damaging their economy. However, sanctions are not costless for the sending economy, where domestic firms involved in business with the target countries might incur economic damages. This paper evaluates these costs in terms of export losses of the diplomatic crisis that started in 2014 between the Russian Federation and 37 countries, (including the United States, the EU, and Japan) over the Ukrainian conflict for the implicated countries. We first gauge the impact of the sanctions' regime using a structural gravity framework and quantify the trade losses in a general equilibrium counterfactual analysis. We estimate this loss at US$114 billion from 2014 until the end of 2015, with US$ 44 billion being borne by sanctioning Western countries. Interestingly, we find that the bulk of the impact stems from products that are not directly targeted by Russian retaliations (taking the form of an embargo on imports of agricultural products). This result suggests that most of the losses are not attributable to the Russian retaliation but to Western sanctions. We then investigate the underlying mechanism at the firm level using French customs data. Results indicate that neither consumer boycotts nor perceived country risk can account for the decline in exports of products that are not targeted by the Russian embargo. Instead, the disruption of the provision of trade finance services is found to have played an important role.
F52|Precision-Guided or Blunt? The Effects of US Economic Sanctions on Human Rights|This study contributes to the literature that analyzes the consequences of economic sanctions for the target country’s human rights situation. We offer a political economy explanation for different types of human rights infringements or improvements in reaction to economic shocks caused by sanctions. Based on this, we derive hypotheses linking sanctions to four types of human rights: economic rights, political and civil rights, basic human rights, and emancipatory rights. We use endogenous treatment regression models to estimate the causal average treatment effect of US economic sanctions on each type of human rights within a uniform empirical framework. In contrast to previous studies, we find no adverse effects of sanctions on economic rights, political and civil rights, and basic human rights, once the endogenous selection into sanctions is modelled. With respect to women’s rights, our findings even indicate a positive relationship. Emancipatory rights are, on average, strengthened when a country experiences sanctions by the US. Our findings are robust and we find little evidence for effect heterogeneity between types of target countries or sanctions. Most importantly, this study shows that the endogeneity of treatment assignment must be modelled when the consequences of sanctions are studied empirically.
F52|The Economics of Nationalism|This paper provides an economic framework for examining how economic openness affects nationalism. Within a country, a region's level of nationalism varies according to its economic interests in its domestic market relative to its foreign market. All else being equal, increasing a region's foreign trade reduces its economic interests in its domestic market and thus weakens its nationalism. This prediction holds both cross-sectionally and over time, as evidenced by our empirical study using the Chinese Political Compass data and the World Value Surveys. Our framework also applies to analysis of nationalism across countries and receives support from cross-country data. (JEL F14, F52, O17, O19, P26, P33)
F52|A Good Turn Deserves Another: Political Stability, Corruption and Corruption-Control|We build on existing literature and contemporary challenges to African development to assess the role of political stability in fighting corruption and boosting corruption-control in 53 African countries for the period 1996-2010. We postulate that on the one hand, an atmosphere of political instability should increase the confidence of impunity owing to less corruption-control. On the other hand, in the absence such impunity from corruption, political instability further fuels corruption. Our findings validate both hypotheses. Hence, contrary to a stream of the literature, we establish causal evidence of a positive (negative) nexus between political stability/no violence and corruption-control (corruption). The empirical evidence is based on Generalized Method of Moments. The findings are robust to contemporary and non-contemporary quantile regressions. The political stability estimates are consistently significant with decreasing (increasing) magnitudes throughout the conditional distributions of corruption (corruption-control). In other words, the positive responsiveness of corruption-control to political stability is an increasing function of corruption-control while the negative responsiveness of corruption to political stability is a decreasing function of corruption. Simply put: a good turn deserves another.

F52|Threats to Romania generated by the status of a NATO and EU|Romania's status as a member of NATO and the European Union makes the eastern border a common border of the two organizations. Romania being on the border of the two organizations has created a significant new geopolitical and geostrategic position. Therefore, on the one hand we are witnessing the actions aimed at strengthening defence and security of the Romanian state and on the other hand it is increasingly becoming a possible target of threats. Based on these considerations our study aims to analyse the diversity of potential threats to Romania.
F52|Basic Dimensions of Security Information Systems|The XXI century brought significant new changes in information systems improvement, especially as regards increasing their role in the performance of an organization. Given the need to ensure the functioning of information systems, today, increasingly there are new openings in terms of ensuring their security. In this article we intend to present some aspects that aim fundamental dimensions of ensure the security of information systems and how they affect activities within an organization. Size information systems security analysis highlights new aspects of its complexity and the need for more efficient management of each of these.
F52|Shale gas - Saviour or destructive technology|The discovery of shale gas reopens the fierce struggle for energy control at regional and global level and reconfigures the geostrategic interests map of the great powers. The new technology of unconventional gas extraction, hydraulic fracturing has supporters andopponents on its size. But at the gate of scientific discoveries beats a new form of energy: the energy based on thorium. Cheaper, safer, less polluting.
F52|Re-evaluation of Hydrocarbons origin is to be a necessary challenge|Although most of the worldwide scientific community accepted and supported the theory that oil and gas formed during remote geological eras, from organic matter under anaerobic conditions, on the bottom of the seas and oceans and that it migrated to the so-called rock collectors, exhaustible in time, in the last decades, some researchers brought forward the theory of inorganic origin (abiogene) of oil and gas formation, including the idea that it should be renewable. The detection and exploitation of the great oil and gas field White Tiger, located in the Vietnamese coasts, hosted in granite, impossible to explain using the biogenic theory, and the recent development of hydraulic fracturing technology for shale gas are at the frontier of a scientific leap which raises many other questions: is the oil era coming to an end or to a new beginning? If energy resources are renewable, how will the human society evolve? What long-term effects on the environment will be recorded by using polluting technologies?
F52|Possible Developments of Forms and Ways of Risks and Threats Manifestations towards Romania|Through its international status and geopolitical positioning, Romania will remain a place of some possible risks and threats. The diversity, complexity and especially the threat for Romania's security requires a detailed knowledge of the manifestation particularities and influence. Therefore, addressing specific issues to the evolution of forms and ways of manifestation of risks and threats for Romania remains an issue of high interest to any scientific analysis, as in this study.
F52|Ensuring the security of information systems - role and functions of information systems security|We are certainly in the face of unprecedented challenges regarding the crisis and war development highlighting new ways of conflict evolution, anticipating the major role that information systems will acquire. It is this beginning of the millennium challenge that induces the need of a more sustained focus on preparing the new type of war in which information systems security will be the success factor. Through this article we aim to present the role of the information systems and the manner in which information systems security affects the decision-making process, the planning and the operational management of all actions taken within each organization.
F52|Oil-gas technique and technology, scientific bridge in both directions between East and West|The discovery of oil and gas one hundred and fifty years ago, in Romania, United States and in further other states, has lead the way of human development towards a society based on hydrocarbons whereas the technical and technological competition between companies and states for the ultimate supremacy evolved and is still in progress. In the past century, the two world wars and the most recent conflicts we were and are contemporary with (Falkland Islands war, Iraq, Libya, Syria etc.) began with and for energy resources which resulted in a fierce battle on the front of research and streamline of this field. The technical and technology transfer in many areas, including the oil and gas one, disregarded ideological barriers imposed by the “Cold War” so that, through legal methods (imported licenses) and “reverse engineering” (intelligence), it carried through. Since the emergence of the “drilling method with rotary table”, discovered by the Romanian engineer Ioan Basgan which revolutionized the worldwide deep drilling technology and whose patent is still disputed by Romania and the United States, up to offshore drilling platforms, high pressure blowout preventers, drilling rigs for mining and transport for extreme weather conditions and to the controversial method of extracting shale gas, the transfer of science, engineering and technology knew and will know no boundaries.
F52|The Lifting Of The European Union Arms Embargo Against China And Its Potential Impact On East Asian Security (Zrušenie Embarga Na Vývoz Zbraní Z Európskej Únie Do Číny A Jeho Potenciálny Dopad Na Bezpečnosť Vo Východoázijskom Regióne)|Following the Tiananmen Square incident on 4th June 1989, the European Union (EU) launched a resolution to establish an arms embargo against China. However, the ties between the EU and China have grown closer over recent years because of the recent Chinese economic boom. The potential lifting of the EU arms embargo has now become a major issue in the Asia-Pacific region. Since 2003, France has been considering lifting the ban of arms sales to China; it is an important signal for the EU in treating China to strengthen the relations in trade. However, this message has been interpreted differently by a large part of the international community. Many European countries have expressed their concerns about China’s human rights record, military buildup, and the increasing threat towards Taiwan. Moreover, China’s ratification of the Anti-Secession Law against Taiwan has become solid evidence of its military threat towards Taiwan. It was due to the U.S. intervention that the lifting of the ban was temporarily postponed. However, with the deterioration of the Eurozone debt crisis, the issue of the EU arms embargo on China has appeared again in the dialogue of the EU-China relations. The position to lift the arms embargo has become stronger because of European sovereign debt crisis recently. In 2010, the EU’s Spanish presidency was considering lifting the bloc’s arms embargo on China again. If the embargo is lifted, China could acquire the most advanced technology of arms from the EU countries more easily. It may also cause serious tensions between Taiwan and China, and force the U.S. to face new challenges in security strategies in the Asia-Pacific area. Meanwhile, East Asian geopolitical system will be reconstructed and a new balance of power will be created. This paper looks into these issues from the perspective of the European Union’s Common Foreign and Security Policy. It attempts to explain why the EU has considered lifting the arms embargo against China. The paper analyzes the evolution of this issue from several aspects, and discusses the potential threat towards cross-strait relations, the security dilemma and its possible impact as a security crisis in the East Asian and Asian region. (Po incidente na Námestí nebeského pokoja v Pekingu zo 4. júna 1989 uvalila Európska únia (EÚ) embargo na vývoz zbraní do Číny. V poslednom období sa však vďaka rýchlemu hospodárskemu rastu Číny prehlbujú väzby medzi ríšou stredu a EÚ a potenciálne zrušenie zbrojného embarga sa stalo zásadnou témou debát v ázijsko-pacifickom regióne. Významným indikátorom meniacich sa vzťahov medzi EÚ a Čínou je fakt, že už od roku 2003 Francúzsko zvažuje zrušenie zbrojného embarga. Cieľom tohto kroku je posilnenie vzájomných obchodných vzťahov. Francúzska iniciatíva sa stretla s rozdielnymi reakciami medzinárodného spoločenstva. Mnohé európske štáty prejavili svoje obavy z čínskeho postoja k ľudským právam, z budovania armády a rastúcej hrozby voči Tajvanu. Navyše, čínske prijatie Zákona proti odčleneniu Tajvanu sa stalo dôkazom stálej čínskej hrozby voči Tajvanu. Z týchto dôvodov bolo po intervencii USA zrušenie zbrojného embarga dočasne pozastavené. Zhoršujúca sa dlhová kríza v eurozóne však opäť vyniesla debatu o možnom zrušení embarga do popredia. Hlasy volajúce po zrušení embarga sú čoraz silnejšie a v roku 2010 sa španielske predsedníctvo EÚ pokúsilo znovu otvoriť túto tému. Ak sa zbrojné embargo zruší, Čína bude mať jednoduchší prístup k najpokročilejším zbrojárskym technológiám. To môže viesť k vážnemu napätiu medzi Čínou a Tajvanom a prinesie nové výzvy pre americké bezpečnostné stratégie v oblasti Ázie a Pacifiku. Vytvorí sa nový východoázijský geopolitický systém a nová mocenská rovnováha. Prekladaný článok nazerá na uvedenú problematiku z hľadiska spoločnej zahraničnej a bezpečnostnej politiky EÚ. Vysvetľuje, prečo EÚ zvažuje zrušenie embarga. Analyzuje vývoj tejto otázky z viacerých hľadísk a skúma potenciálne hrozby daného kroku pre čínsko-tajvanské vzťahy, bezpečnostnú dilemu a jej možné dopady na východoázijský región vo forme bezpečnostnej krízy.)

Autor sa domnieva, že Európska únia musí uskutočniť inštitucionálnu reformu tak, aby mohla čeliť novým výzvam a nebezpečenstvám, ktorým je vystavený súčasný svet. V prvom rade sa to týka nevyhnutnosti vytvoriť spoločnú európsku armádu, oddelenú od NATO, a spoločnú zahraničnú politiku EÚ (namiesto existujúcich dvadsiatich ôsmich zahraničných politík), ako aj nevyhnutnosti dopracovať systém jednotnej európskej meny EÚ a Schengenského priestoru, spoločného pre všetky členské štáty EÚ s presne vyznačenými a chránenými vonkajšími hranicami. (The present paper analyzes changes in security on the European continent which have been caused by conversion of the world system of international relations from a unipolar to the multipolar one. The author argues that the European Union should carry out an institutional reform to be able to better face new challenges and dangers of the contemporary world. This translates into creation of a new Common European Army which would be independent from the NATO and creation of a Common Foreign Policy of the EU (instead of 28 separate foreign policies of the member states). It will also be necessary to improve the common European currency of the EU as well as the Shengen area, which should be common for all member states of the European Union and should have well protected borders.)
F52|Simplifying the Rule Book: a Proposal to Reform and Clarify Canada’s Policy on Inward Foreign Direct Investment|Control over public money is fundamental to democratic government, and presents huge challenges to legislators and taxpayers. Getting the information needed to answer simple questions such as how planned spending in the upcoming year compares to actual results in the prior year can be hard, and ensuring that governments treat their budget targets seriously is an never-ending task. This latest edition of the C.D. Howe Institute’s annual report on the fiscal accountability of Canada’s federal, provincial and territorial governments assesses the quality of financial information these governments present, and looks at their success or failure in achieving their budgetary goals over the past decade. Its survey of the financial reports reveals some good news: more governments now prepare their budgets on the same basis as their end-of-year public accounts, making comparisons over time easier for their citizens. While these improvements mean that more governments earn high marks for their reporting, some jurisdictions still present numbers in which such key figures as total spending and total revenue are obscure. Inconsistent presentation of numbers to legislators, late reporting, and qualified audits are too common. A major aim of this report is to celebrate the relatively transparent reporting found in New Brunswick and Saskatchewan, and in Ontario and Ottawa, and encourage other jurisdictions to raise their game. When it comes to the degree to which results match intentions, the survey also finds some good news. In the second half of the past decade, the spending and revenues reported by Canada’s senior governments at the end of each fiscal year have tended to match the projections in the budget at the beginning of the year more closely than in the first half of the decade. That said, federal, provincial and territorial governments tend to overshoot their budget targets by large amounts. Over the decade, Canada’s senior governments overshot their spending targets by some $48 billion in total. They also brought in far more revenue than anticipated in budgets, and while caution in forecasting can explain some of this overshoot, the survey finds a disturbing tendency for revenue and spending surprises, up or down, to occur together – more suggestive of opportunism than good fiscal management. Improving control over public funds in Canada will require two things. Legislators and the public must demand more transparent, timely and accurate reporting of governments’ fiscal plans and results. And legislators must use their powers over appropriation more effectively. Votes on budgets are votes of confidence that determine whether governments stand or fall. Only when legislators ensure that budget plans are meaningful do they hold governments accountable for their use of public funds.
F52|La acción integral: herramienta de gestión de los gobiernos municipales focalizados por la Política Nacional de Consolidación y Reconstrucción Territorial|La acción integral ha sido un medio fundamental para el desarrollo social, en los logros del Gobierno nacional de recuperación de la legitimidad y la gobernabilidad. Desde el inicio del proceso de Consolidación en el 2002 y hasta la fecha —representado en la Política Nacional de Consolidación y Reconstrucción Territorial (PNCRT)— ha presentado modificaciones en su estrategia, en concordancia con los escenarios coyunturales. Este artículo se sustenta teóricamente en los conceptos de legitimidad y gobernabilidad y en la doctrina de acción integral de las Fuerzas Militares, complementada con la experiencia de oficiales que trabajaron en esta estrategia o que actualmente la dirigen. De tal manera, presenta recomendaciones al Gobierno nacional para la toma de decisiones en la modificación del desarrollo de la PNCRT de acuerdo con el actual momento histórico.
F52|The Macroeconomic and Sectoral Effects of Terrorism in the U.S.: A Reconciliation of CGE and Econometric Approaches|Government decision makers must make plans for a wide range of terrorism threat scenarios. In the formulation and evaluation of these plans, economic consequence analysis plays an important role in elucidating the benefits of successful deterrence, mitigation, and post-event management. However, planning in this regard is not easy, particularly when terrorism events have diverse characteristics defined along many dimensions, including the method, location, scale and frequency of attack(s). As discussed in previous work by [Giesecke et al. (2015)], CGE models are well-suited to the analysis of the economic consequences of a diverse range of threat scenarios; with a large number of exogenous variables, CGE models can be used to model shocks related to the many particular characteristics that can define a given individual terrorism event. This also makes them well suited to the analysis of the many hypothetical scenarios that must be investigated in contingency planning by defence and emergency management decision makers. In defining a terrorism event for input to a CGE model, two broad sets of shocks are typically recognised: (1) Physical impacts on observable economic variables, e.g., fatalities, asset damage, business interruption; and (2) Behavioural impacts on unobservable structural variables, e.g., the effects of fear and uncertainty on workers, investors, and consumers. Assembling shocks related to the physical characteristics of a terrorism event is relatively straightforward, since estimates are either readily available or plausibly inferred. However, assembling shocks describing the behavioural characteristics of terrorism events is difficult; with values for unobservable variables such as impacts on required rates of return, worker compensating wage requirements, and consumer willingness to pay having to either be inferred or estimated by indirect means. Typically, this has been achieved via reference to extraneous literature. But how confidant can planners be that the impact magnitudes reported in such ex-ante analyses are plausible? Ex-post econometric studies of terrorism, such as those by [Blomberg et al. (2004)] and [Blomberg and Hess (2006)], present models for the response of observable economic variables, e.g., real GDP, investment, government expenditure and trade, to terrorism and other forms of conflict. [Dixon and Rimmer (2002)] demonstrate that a CGE model can be used to infer outcomes for unobservable structural variables using observable economic variables. In a similar way, in this paper we use the findings by [Blomberg et al. (2004)] to determine point estimates for the relevant (unobservable) structural variables impacted by terrorism events using the USAGE 2.0 dynamic CGE model of the US economy ([Dixon and Rimmer (2002)]; [Dixon and Rimmer (2004)]). This allows us to: (i) Explore the relative contributions of implicit structural and policy shifts in the results for observable variables reported in [Blomberg et al. (2004)]; (ii) Extend Blomberg's analysis of results for macro variables into the sectoral dimension, thereby elucidating the consequences of terrorism on prospects for individual industries; and (iii) Compare implicit structural shocks in Blomberg with the assumed structural shocks in earlier CGE papers.
F52|The Change and Transformation of Social Insurance System of Turkey|Turkish social insurance system based on the contributory principle finds its basis in the Ottoman era. During classical period of Ottoman Empire, similar practices of old age pension, survivors'benefit, disability and employment injury benefits were seen in Jannissaries and Guilds. After Tanzimat, the insurance protection for the civil servants was provided by pension funds. The fund application for each public institution, was continued until the codification of Law on Retirement Fund No.5434. The unification of different social security schemes was realized by the foundation of this Fund. After WW2, in Turkey it can be seen the foundation of modern social insurance system. Until 1983, all of the working class protected under the social insurance system. However, the presentation of different regimes for each sectors, gave harm to social justice and the investment failure of insurance funds in profitable investments caused decreasement of funds. With the frequently application premium amnesties and the removing of the age limit to be a prerequisite of a pension the national insurance model, that constitued newly, faced with the danger of collapse. The contribution of social security reforms that made in 1999 and 2008, will be seen in medium and long term.
F52|Trade and insecure resources|We construct a model of conflict and trade to study the consequences of interstate disputes over contested resources (land, oil, water or other resources) for arming, welfare and trade flows. Different trade regimes imply different costs of such disputes in terms of arming. Depending on world prices, free trade can intensify arming to such an extent that the additional security costs it brings swamp the traditional gains from trade and thus render autarky more desirable for one or all rival states. Free trade, though, is always an equilibrium, and sometimes is a dominant one with features of a prisoner's dilemma outcome. Furthermore, contestation of resources can reverse a country's apparent comparative advantage relative to its comparative advantage in the absence of conflict. And, where such conflict is present, comparisons of autarkic prices to world prices could be inaccurate predictors of trade patterns.
F52|Military careers of politicians matter for national security policy|Do politicians with a military background vote differently on military affairs? We investigate the informative institutional setting of the Swiss conscription army. Politicians who served in the military have a higher probability of accepting pro-military legislative proposals, even when controlling for party affiliations and the revealed preferences of their constituents. Although conscription requires all able-bodied man to serve at least as soldiers, we can exploit variation in exposure to enforced and voluntary service. We find evidence that intrinsic motivation to serve in the military, instead of compulsory service, plays a substantial role in explaining legislative decisions on military affairs.
F52|Democracy, political risks and stock market performance|This study examines the impacts of democracy and political risk on stock market. Using annualized panel data for 49 emerging markets for 2000–2012 we find evidence that democracy and political risk do have impact on stock market returns and the relationship between democracy and political risk is parabolic, i.e., there is a threshold level of democracy after which political risk begins to decline. Also our results suggest that decreases in political risk lead to higher returns.
F52|The impact of UN and US economic sanctions on GDP growth|In this paper, we empirically assess how economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations and the United States affect the target states' GDP growth. Our sample includes 160 countries of which 67 experienced economic sanctions over the period 1976–2012. We find, first, that UN sanctions have a statistically and economically significant influence on the target state's economic growth. On average, the imposition of UN sanctions decreases the target state's annual real per capita GDP growth rate by more than 2 percentage points (pp). These adverse effects last for a period of 10 years and lead to an aggregate decline in the target country's GDP per capita of 25.5%. Comprehensive UN economic sanctions, that is, embargoes affecting nearly all economic activity, trigger a reduction in GDP growth by more than 5 pp. Second, the effect of US sanctions is much smaller and less distinct. The imposition of US sanctions decreases the target state's GDP growth by 0.75–1 pp. This detrimental impact on growth persists for seven years and accounts for an aggregate decline in GDP of 13.4%.
F52|Economic impediments to a Taliban peace process|An important question underlies the potential for a successful peace process in Afghanistan: If political negotiations between the Taliban leadership and the Afghan government succeed, will fighters in the field cease their activities, especially illicit funding practices, and accept government legal authority? Interviews conducted in early 2014—well before the announcement of Mullah Omar’s death or the appearance of Islamic State in the region—indicate that a wide gulf separates the motivations of low-level insurgents from their leadership’s ideological objectives. The rank and file fight for multiple reasons, the most significant of which is the financial advantage of association with the movement. Recent studies of the economics of insurgency describe a crime-insurgency-terror nexus that applies to the contemporary Afghan context, albeit requiring adjustment to account for the distinctive political circumstances and wartime history of Afghanistan.
F52|Youth Unemployment, Education and Political Instability: Evidence from Selected Developing Countries 1991-2009|This paper investigates the effects of youth unemployment on political instability in developing countries through three hypotheses. Firstly, youth unemployment has significant effects on risk of political instability. Secondly, we consider that the relationship between unemployment rate and political instability is conditional upon education levels. Finally, we examine whether youth unemployment can lead to anti-government demonstrations rather than global instability. Using a sample covering 40 developing countries over the period 1991-2009, we confirm the positive effect of youth unemployment on political violence. However the level of education lowers the magnitude of the effect. The effect of youth unemployment on coups d’état is significant but not robust. Finally, the results suggest that the relationship between youth unemployment and political instability is not robust. A possible explanation is that the main predictors of political instability are also determinants of unemployment. Therefore, youth unemployment can be a symptom rather than the illness and cannot alone explain political instability.
F52|The impact on the evolution of the European security environment on ground combat forces|The current security environment continues to change being described as extremely complex, containing elements interconnected and interdependent. From this perspective, the risks to the security of European citizens are complex, their occurrence is unpredictable in time and space. As a consequence, transforming the land forces into the main exponent of military power becomes an imperative for European armies and for achievieng European security.
F52|Indicators-based early systems warning|Putting the early warning efforts into a systematic shape has intensivelly grown in the past 25 years, under the strict scrutiny of decision-makers and state authorities, as they are under the necessity of addressing more and more complex security crisis. Most of the preventive tools rely on indicators, based on the perception that they signal the changes in the security environment and allow decision-makers to adopt early measures in orde to diminish the impact of the crisis on the society. The analysis of the specific literature and the existing praxis publicly available shows us that early warning systems relying on indicators offer some advantages that can be exploited in order to timely prevent security crisis, but also some limits for their efficiency.
F52|Global Governance Vs. National Sovereignty In A Globalized World|The global economic and financial crisis of 2007 highlighted the risks, threats and enormous costs of a global economy in the absence of a global government. The aim of this paper is to emphasize the importance of global governance in a world in which states are facing the erosion of national sovereignty. The two concepts are being analyzed from various points of view, including current challenges and future scenarios. Despite the fact that states, especially major powers, are not prepared to accept some elements of global governance and the limits that they would put on their national sovereignty, recent developments seem to make global governance a key component of the international scene.
F52|Economic Security – New Approaches In The Context Of Globalization|Nowadays, more than ever, economic relations between states are the ones that define the general character of the relations between them and establish economic security as a concept which cannot be neglected anymore. Globalization, the process that shapes the international environment, undermines the old definition of economic security and forces its redefinition. The article aims to identify and analyse the effects of globalization on economic security and the new approaches it takes in this context.
F52|Political-Security, Economy, and Culture within the Dynamics of Geopolitics and Migration: On Philippine Territory and the Filipino People|The paper considers the interaction of the dual elements of the nation-state: territory and people. Particularly, it discusses the interaction of geopolitics and migration, i.e. the non-mobile territory and the mobile people, from the perspectives of political-security, economy, and culture, and how the interactions influence government policy focusing on the case of the Philippines.The paper ferrets-out the major factors in the geopolitical transformation of the Philippine Is-lands into the westernmost frontier of the United States, and how this geopolitical transformation created a migratory linkage from the Philippine Islands to the United States. The paper shows how migratory movements shaped the geopolitics of East Asia or Western Pacific before World War II by pointing out the following. One: The westward expansion of the American people ini-tially changed the geopolitical conditions in the American continent, and eventually changed the geopolitical make-up in the Western Pacific. Two: The migration of Filipinos to the United States was a key factor in the granting of Philippine independence, thereby reshaping the geopo-litical conditions in the Western Pacific region.The paper shows that the geopolitical transformation of the Philippine Islands came with the im-plantation of American culture and English language. The paper discusses how this cultural as-pect has functioned in terms of a migratory linkage by looking at the current migratory pattern of Filipinos. The paper then shows how the economic agreement the Philippines signed with the United States in 1946 to attain independence eventually led to the establishment of a migratory system as the Philippine government adopted of a labor export policy in the 1970s. The paper further shows the importance of remittances from overseas Filipinos to the Philippine economy.The paper elaborates and discusses how the political-security policies undertaken by the Philip-pines have been deeply influenced by both its geopolitical circumstance and the current situation of Filipino migration. Finally, the paper points out that the large presence of Filipinos overseas and the country’s dependence to their remittances are a cause of weakness for the Philippine state in maintaining a credible foreign and security policy.
F52|Editorial for Journal of Human Security Volume 11|This editorial marks the beginning of the journal's eleventh year since its inception as the Australasian Journal of Human Security. As a sample from an exÂ­tremely tumultuous era in human history, this time span has consistently provided an abundance of human security issues for me to comment on. Yet, for the first time since that fateful day in September of 2001, I feel that the world has arrived at another historical turning point. I am referring to the attack on the Paris office of the satirical journal Charlie Hebdo on January 7 and the events immediately following it.
F52|Human Security Workers Deployed in Austere Environments: A Brief Guide to Self-Care, Sustainment, and Productivity|Since the early 1990s, the human security movement has sought to expand the concept of security beyond the traditional military defense of national borders to focus on the intra-state security needs of populations at the individual level. Specific initiatives frequently address problems of population health, ethnic conflict, religious extremism, human rights, environmental or natural disasters, and other critical issues. For expatriate human security workers in the field, the environment may present meaningful challenges to their wellbeing and productivity. This can be especially so for those who have relatively more experience in academic, business, or administrative settings, and less in the field. The authors' goal is to illuminate practices that have demonstrated their efficacy in enhancing wellness, sustainment, and productivity for human security and other humanitarian and development workers deployed to austere environments. The content represents a synoptic consensus of best general practices and guidance from a range of resources comprising United Nations agencies and activities, national and international non-governmental organizations (NGO's), private volunteer organÂ­izations (PVO's), national military services, and international business concerns.
F52|A Review of 'Humanitarian Intervention and Legitimacy Wars: Seeking Peace and Justice in the 21st Century'|In his book Humanitarian Intervention and Legitimacy Wars: Seeking Peace and Justice in the 21st Century , Richard Falk argues that, with the growing prevalence of soft power, historical lessons of asymmetric warfare and legitimacy wars must be taken into account. Falk rejects the realist notion that the state is the only rational actor, offering a more constructivist approach that focuses on the norms, culture and morality of the international community. He asserts that humanitarian intervention is on the decline, and legitimacy wars are increasing. Much of this legitimacy is based on international law and its relevance in the international community.
F52|Notes from the Field: The Humanitarian Crisis in Ukraine|Humanitarian crises are politically and socially charged, and as actors, donors and organizations move in to help, duplication of services can ensue. Despite the influx of humanitarian actors into the war zone of eastern Ukraine, more are still needed to address immediate threat to the health of more than 5 million at-risk people in the area. The humanitarian disaster in Ukraine requires fast support and stakeholder involvement to mitigate preventable death among at-risk populations. As the crisis unfolds and many more people are caught in the crossfire with no health security, WHO is leading the charge to organize healthcare and humanitarian action to relive human suffering and engender health security for all.
F52|Educational Pathways to Remote Employment in Isolated Communities|Those who live in isolated communities often lack reliable, skilled employment opportunities, which fundamentally undermines their human security. For individuals who wish to remain in their isolated communities for family, religious, philosophical or other reasons, their attachment to their communities creates a disincentive for higher education. This promotes low educational achievement, which in turn results in low socioeconomic status, lack of social mobility, and a generational cycle of poverty. The human misery that results from such a feedback loop is observed in isolated communities throughout North America, including aboriginal communities in Canada. Fortunately, maturation of information and communication technologies now offers individuals the potential to gain high-skilled employment while living in an isolated community, using both (i) virtual work/remote work and (ii) remote training and education. To examine that potential, this study: 1) categorizes high-skill careers that demand a higher education and are widely viable for remote work, 2) examines options for obtaining the required education remotely, and 3) performs an economic analysis of investing in remote education, quantifying the results in return on investment. The results show that the Internet has now opened up the possibility of both remote education and remote work. Though the investment in college education is significant, there are loans available and the return on investment is generally far higher than the interest rate on the loans. The results identified several particularly promising majors and dozens of high-income careers. The ability to both obtain an education and employment remotely offers the potential to lift many people living in isolated communities out of poverty, reduce inequality overall, and provide those living in isolated communities with viable means of employment security, which not only allows personal sustainability, but also the potential for personal growth.
F52|Redefining Human Security for Vulnerable Migrants in East Asia|This article proposes human security as an analytical framework to understand the current trends of irregular migration (both forced and unauthorised) in East Asia and revisits the seven pillars of human security defined in the 1994 Human Development Report by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). It explains how the concepts of human security are parallel to those prescribed in international human rights conventions but different in terms of the attitude towards states. Human security does not directly challenge state authority and adds a sense of urgency and moral authority that requires extra-legal measures by the states. The author argues that human security is the securitisation of human rights and is a better framework and policy discourse than human rights to engage with state and non-state actors, especially in East Asia where political leaders are more receptive to the former idea. The study draws examples from stateless Rohingyas, undocumented sex workers in Thailand and Singapore, trafficked brides from Vietnam and Cambodia, and smuggled North Korean refugees in China to demonstrate the nexus between human security and irregular migration.
F52|Sustainable Health for All? The Tension Between Human Security and the Right to Health Care|In the current global environmental crisis medical aid and disaster relief is given by the UN and its branches, by governments and by NGOs, who regard it as their duty to address large-scale humanitarian catastrophes. The duty to give medical aid rests on traditional interpretations of health security and on the bioethical imperatives to relieve suffering and to save lives. However, those principles are not easily reconciled in the current situation of global environmental change and the threats it poses to human security. The global demand for health care has already outpaced resources in many regions, and those resources are likely to decline further. An ethic based on more comprehensive concepts of human security can lessen the contraÂ­dictions between ethical priorities because it takes into account environmental security. HowÂ­ever, that approach leads to clashes with common interpretations of human rights, including the so-called right to health care. The argument presented in this paper states that, under the imperative of ensuring the survival for humanity in acceptable and sustainable ways, the latest generation of human rights pertaining to health care and environmental quality have become ungrantable. While this does not render them negligible, it does necessitate a new approach to global development aid and health security, with severe consequences for individual autonomy.
F52|Always Affecting the Wrong People? The Impact of US Sanctions on Poverty|In this paper, we analyze the effect of US economic sanctions on the target countries’ poverty gap during the period 1978–2011. Econometrically, we employ a nearest neighbor matching approach to account for differences in the countries’ economic and political environment and the likelihood of being exposed to US sanctions. Our results indicate that US sanctions are indeed affecting the wrong people as we observe a 2.3–5.1 percentage points (pp) larger poverty gap in sanctioned countries compared to their nearest neighbors. Severe sanctions, such as fuel embargoes, trade restrictions, the freezing of assets, or embargoes on most or all economic activity are particularly detrimental and lead to an increase in the poverty gap by 6.1–7.4 pp.

F52|The Empiricists' Insurgency|Research on insurgency has been invigorated this past decade by better data, improved methods, and the urgency of understanding active engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan. This empiricists’ insurgency reinforces a classic literature on the essential role of civilians while challenging older theories about how they affect conflict outcomes. It provides a general framework describing “irregular” insurgencies (where government capacity exceeds rebel capacity), which is analytically cohesive and empirically tested using subnational data from multiple conflicts. The new research provides guidance on intervention design, including governance improvement, development programs, and rules of engagement. The design of interventions matters: some key evidence comes from measuring the effects of misguided policies. The framework may enable better conceived and implemented interventions, including foreign engagements with and without troop deployment, depending on the type of insurgency and mindful of political limitations. We position these findings in the literature, and highlight directions for future research, including legal aspects of countering insurgency.
F52|The Harnessing Of The Renewable Energy Sources Potential Of The Republic Of Moldova|Ensuring energy needs has turned into a major topic of all socio-economic systems worldwide. Against this background, renewable energy sources become a powerful part of the national, regional and global security. Given the current global trends and the major dependence on imports of energy resources in Moldova, a new strategy must be adopted by upgrading existing energy infrastructure, internal energy market analysis, diversification of the existing renewable energy sources and permanent coordination of the decisions taken within national energy policies. In this article, the author examined the potential of the renewable energy sources available in the Republic of Moldova, presenting calculations on the effectiveness of these resources use.
F52|Do que é feito um país campeão? Análise empírica de determinantes sociais e econômicos para o sucesso olímpico [What makes a country a champion? Empirical analysis of social and economic determinants for Olympic success]|This paper analyzes the social, economic and political determinants of Olympic success in post-war games. To this end, a panel data regression with fixed effects, using a sample of 102 countries for the years 1960 to 2012 was employed. The dependent variables used were: the sum of medals won by a country in a given edition of the Olympics and the total gold medals earned by a nation. The results obtained show that the most significant determinants for these variables are the GDP per capita, the autocracy level, the average total years of study and whether the country is hosting the Olympics.
F52|An Overview of the Geoeconomic Effects of Terrorism [O investigaţie a efectelor geoeconomice ale terorismului]|The present paper seeks out to investigate five economic aspects involving terrorism: the effects on FDIs, the macroeconomic effects, the impact on financial markets, the role of foreign aid and transactions undertaken by terrorist groups for self-financing. Each topic will be analysed on the basis of the existing available literature and recent information on the activities of terrorist groups.
F52|International terrorism as a trade impediment?|This article uses monthly data on bilateral trade in conjunction with monthly data on terrorism events and associated fatalities to shed light on the impact of terrorism on trade. Employing a structural model of trade, we provide evidence that, if at all, international terrorism displays effects on bilateral and multilateral trade only in the medium run (more than one and a half years after an attack/incident). The pure short-run impact of international terror on trade appears very small, if not negligible.
F52|The effects of economic asymmetry in European Union in the context of international capital flows|In this article the author attempted to identify effects of the economic asymmetry in European Union in the context of international capital flows. The analysis concerns the effects of the functioning of the single European market, which are characterized by differing levels of economic development. According to the author this kind of asymmetry can lead to excessive economic dependence from leaders of this organization. In order to verify this statement in this article the author was based on data from Eurostat, UNCTAD, industry reports and available literature.

W artykule zdefiniowano kryteria, na podstawie ktorych wyodrebniono sektory gospodarcze o strategicznym znaczeniu dla bezpieczenstwa panstwa, tj. wytwarzanie i zaopatrywanie w energie elektryczna; wydobycie, przesyl, dystrybucje i magazynowanie paliw gazowych; wytwarzanie, przesyl i magazynowanie paliw plynnych; telekomunikacje; bankowosc; produkcje dokumentow (w tym zwiazanych z nimi systemow IT) i banknotow oraz przemysl zbrojeniowy. Artykul prowadzi do konkluzji, ze pomimo strategicznego znaczenia tych sektorow dla bezpieczenstwa panstwa oraz udzialu Skarbu Panstwa w spolkach reprezentujacych te sektory, brakuje spojnych i kompleksowych uregulowan prawnych, ktore chronilyby interes bezpieczenstwa panstwa zwiazany z czescia gospodarki narodowej reprezentowanej przez wskazane sektory i spolki. W pracy wykorzystano metodyke oparta o analize instrumentow stosowanych przez panstwo w zakresie kontroli nad wybranymi dziedzinami gospodarki oraz analize sektorow gospodarczych w zakresie koncentracji, wplywu na bezpieczenstwo panstwa oraz integracji z innymi sektorami.
F52|The effectiveness of Canada's navy on escort duty|This paper examines the relative effectiveness of different vessels used as convoy escorts in the North Atlantic by the Allied navies during the Second World War. A data set is created that matches convoy movements to German U-boat locations in order to examine the escort composition and the number of merchant ships lost when an engagement occurred. I find that larger escort vessels, such as destroyers and frigates, were between 1.4 and 2.25 more effective than smaller escort vessels, such as corvettes, at preventing the loss of a merchant ship. As an application of these results, I examine the cost faced by the Allies from Canada failing to develop domestic naval manufacturing capabilities prior to World War II. By constructing a counterfactual scenario, I find that developing a Canadian domestic shipbuilding industry would have given the Allies a net benefit of 23.2 million 1940 Canadian dollars.
F52|Indirect Policing: Its Theory, Mechanism, and Application to Combatting Elusive Perpetrators|Why do states indirectly police some kinds of transnational perpetrators by using their host governments while directly policing other kinds? We address this question by identifying the obstacles to deterring transnational perpetrators and by presenting a functional account of how indirect policing can overcome the obstacles. According to our theory, indirect policing can outperform direct policing in light of three advantages inherent in Proxy, who is induced by Defender to police Perpetrators: (a) Proxy can convince Perpetrators of punishments more credibly than Defender (communicative advantage); (b) Proxy is more likely to identify Perpetrators and detect what they hold dear (informational advantage); (c) Proxy can cripple and punish Perpetrators more effectively (offensive advantage). On the other hand, indirect policing has potential disadvantages such as: (x) difficulties with two-phase communication from Defender through Proxy to Perpetrators; (y) disincentives for policing known as moral hazard and free riding; (z) destabilization of Proxy’s regime caused by his corruption and tyranny that Defender might induce. Four forms of policing are delineated with associated incidents: proper direct policing (e.g., Combined Task Force 151); proper indirect policing (U.S. War on Drugs in Colombia and Mexico); dual policing (Operation Inherent Resolve); and reciprocal policing (INTERPOL, Budapest Convention).
F52|The impact of economic diplomacy over national economic security. Case study on Eastern Partnership region|Economic security has been and will be a key concept in international economic relations. In the 21st century, an era of globalization, new technology, new actors, new issues, economic diplomacy proves its monopoly over international economic relations. An efficient foreign affairs representant is ever more essential to a state’s security, economic and social welfare. Saying this, we stress that economic diplomacy cannot be separated or even became crucial component from the totality of tools used to assure economic security. The EaP region is facing a number of challenges which are mostly resulting from the internal situation, but also determined by the external environment. Thus, diplomats are key players in strengthening the economic dimension of security, in negotiations to establish market rules and regulations, the dissemination of the huge impact that EU values have on national economy, the promotion and implementation of economic policies, and the advocacy of public and private economic interests. Summarizing, when there is strong external economic activity economic security is enhanced for both sides, for the „home” country and for its partners.
F52|Integration Interrupted : The Impact of September 11, 2001|The economies of Canada and the United States, closely linked for many years, began a formal process of tighter integration with the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement (1989) and North American Free Trade Agreement (1994). Due to the ease of border crossing, American and Canadian consumers took advantage of exchange rate variations to engage in cross-border shopping, implying a movement toward unified markets in the border regions. This process of integration was interrupted by tighter border controls after the terrorist attacks of 9/11. In this paper, we investigate the disruption of normal patterns of day tripping across the US-Canadian border. Using seasonally adjusted monthly data for the period 1994~2011, we show a robust relationship between the exchange rate and the flow of day trippers in each direction, implying cross-border shopping to be a major motive for day trippers. Using dummy variables to represent the security measures enacted in September 2001, and the stricter documentation required after January 2008, we show that both sets of measures significantly reduced cross-border trips and thickened the border.
F52|Identity, Nations and the Requirements of Global Justice: Limits of the Debate in Democratic Politics|How do we, as individuals, communities and nations, arbitrate between the requirements of justice or our sense of justice, at the local or national level, as compared to our idea of justice in the world at large? Is the demand for global justice a demand for greater equality among nations, for systems of just global governance to manage an increasingly interconnected world of increasing complexity, or just another utopian ideal? This article seeks to bring together two separate debates in contemporary social sciences and social philosophy to discuss these questions. The first part of this article examines questions of identity, individual and collective, and the expressions and practice of nationalism that forms the basis of international exchanges based on the debates between communitarian and universalist social philosophers. The second part of the article analyzes how the idea of global justice, and in particular, international distributive justice, is limited or constrained by the questions of identity and nationalism under the democratic and institutional compulsions of nation states, even when they accept the necessity of institutions of global governance. The later work of Rawls and their extensions are a common thread in these two debates. JEL: F6, F52, F54, D63
F52|US–Mexico border tourism and day trips: an aberration in globalization?|We examine the influence of two distinct regime changes in US border security on the number of persons traveling from the US into Mexico on day trips. In contrast to increases in overall US tourism to Mexico and rapidly growing trade linkages, day trips to Mexico fell by over 20 % between 2000 and 2012. In the popular press, the reduction in short visits is widely attributed to a rising tide of violence in the Mexican border states, more specifically to a rise in the rate of homicides as a result of the emergence, or radical transformation, of a drug war in Mexico. We show that changes in the US border regime caused a large reduction of day trips and border tourism, and in doing so had a large negative effect on the Mexican border. We situate this result within the literature devoted to analyzing the effects of changes in international documents on tourist flows. Copyright The Author(s) 2015
F52|UN interventions: The role of geography|This paper argues that UN military interventions are geographically biased. For every 1,000 kilometers of distance from the three permanent Western UNSC members (France, UK, US), the probability of a UN military intervention decreases by 4 percent. We are able to rule out several alternative explanations for the distance finding, such as differences by continent, colonial origin, bilateral trade relationships, foreign aid flows, political regime forms, or the characteristics of the Cold War. We do not observe this geographical bias for non-military interventions, providing evidence that practical considerations could be important factors for UNSC decisions to intervene militarily. In fact, UNSC interventions are also more likely in smaller and poorer countries – both of which are indications of less costly interventions and higher chances of success, everything else equal.

F52|Do human rights violations hinder counterterrorism cooperation? Evidence from the FBI’s deployment abroad|The impact of human rights on counterterrorism cooperation has been the subject of speculation, but not of systematic analysis. This study offers such an analysis by examining an important channel of cooperation against terrorism: international police liaisons, such as the FBI agents deployed worldwide. It is hypothesized that police liaisons are less likely to be sent to countries where human rights violations are widespread, since repressive governments see threat in foreign agents stationed on their territory. Survival analysis finds support for this hypothesis. An FBI presence does not require democratic government or a strong rule of law in the host country; but human rights abuse reduces the likelihood of an FBI deployment. These findings substantiate a link between human rights and counterterrorism cooperation, offering insights for the study of cross-border law enforcement and transgovernmental networks.

Econometrically, we employ a nearest neighbor matching approach to account for differences in the countries’ economic and political environment and the likelihood of being exposed to US sanctions. Our results indicate that US sanctions are indeed affecting the wrong people as we observe a 2.3–5.1 percentage points (pp) larger poverty gap in sanctioned countries compared to their nearest neighbors.

F52|Organizing for Emergencies - Issues in Wildfire Fighting in Croatia|Croatia's accession to the European Union implies inevitable changes in the national emergency management system. New requirements for adjustment in accordance with the EU standards and practices also apply to the fire-services organization. Harmonious functioning of a large number of relatively autonomous organizations related to the National Protection and Rescue Directorate necessitates clear decision-making authority and coordination mechanisms as well as a high level of interoperability and core competencies development. This paper gives an overview of the Croatian fire protection organization along with its accompanying legislation, followed by an analysis of identified problems, especially those concerning fighting of wildfire. In our research a survey questionnaire comprised of Likert-scale items was used to assess the attitudes and experiences of trained fire department members. The respondents reported a relatively low evaluation of effectiveness and appropriateness of the following key fire service attributes: organizational structure, legislation and firefighting logistics support. From the obtained results guidelines can be drawn for possible redesign of the emergency management organization, especially those concerning the fire protection service.
F52|On the Effect of State fragility on Corruption|The Kodila-Tedika & Bolito-Losembe (2014, ADR) finding on no evidence of causality flowing from State fragility to classical corruption or extreme corruption could have an important influence on academic and policy debates. Using updated data (1996-2010) from 53 African countries, we provide evidence of a positive (negative) nexus between political stability/no violence and corruption-control (corruption). As a policy implication, the finding of the underlying paper maybe more expositional than factual and should be treated with caution.
F52|Predation, Taxation, Investment, and Violence: Evidence from the Philippines|The literature relating economic activity to political violence posits greedy rebels (Collier, 2000) but not greedy governments. Could capturing tax revenue motivate governments to step up their counter insurgency operations, just as extortion motivates rebel violence? Panel data on political violence in the Philippines distinguish government from rebel attacks, which we link to private investment across 70 provinces. To formally explore these data we expand an established theory of asymmetric substate conflict –the “information-centric” model, adding firms, investment, taxation and predation (i.e., extortionary violence by rebels in response to investment) to the interplay of government, rebels and civilians, generating testable implications. The data show that increases in investment predict increases in both government-initiated attacks and rebel-initiated attacks. In the year following increased investment government attacks decrease. In the context of our expanded model, these empirical results suggest that both rebels and governments contest economic rents.
F52|Food Security And Regional Agricultural Market: Economic Analysis And Development Prospects| The analysis of dynamics and current state of an agrifood market is conducted on the case of the agrarian region of Stavropol Krai. The research objective is to analyse development factors and tendencies of the regional agrifood market; to assess the import dependency rate of selected product sectors; to investigate the perspective directions of domestic market saturation. The research subject is a system of economic relations, directed on the establishment and development of the agricultural commodities and food market, and a range of special economic measures for insurance of the food security in the Russian Federation. The analysis includes the market capacity and level of self-sufficiency in the Stavropol Krai, which are defined by basic foodstuffs. It is found that people’s needs in food are covered insufficiently. It is revealed that Stavropol Krai is an active player on both inter-regional and international markets, with the substantial amounts of counter deliveries. Agricultural raw commodities of low added value predominate in export, while processed ones of higher added value – in imports. Food processing industry of the region is underdeveloped, however, it has substantial reserves for development. The major protection measures of domestic food market are defined in the paper: diversification of agricultural production, and industrial and logistics infrastructure development of the regional agrarian market. The results can be used by regional government authorities in improving of the domestic food market regulations.
F52|Deterrence, Preemption, And Panic: A Common-Enemy Problem Of Terrorism|We develop a game-theoretic analysis of terrorism that examines the interaction between a terrorist organization and multiple target countries, and considers both pre-emption and deterrence as counter-terrorist policies. The damage from terror includes not only the material cost of fatality, injury and loss of property, but also the resultant fear. The fear-effect leads to different kinds of equilibria and implications for counter-terrorism policies. In particular, the model identifies conditions under which greater pre-emption may be the rational response to an increase in terrorism, i.e., it analyzes the merit of the dictum: ``offense is the best defense.'' Further, it examines the characteristics of cooperative behavior among target countries in dealing with the threat of terrorism.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F52|US Security Strategy and the Gains from Bilateral Trade| We explore the geo-strategic determinants of bilateral trade flows between the USA and the rest of the world. We develop a three-party model of security and trade patterns and use data on military assistance and troop deployments over the 1950–2009 period to validate its predictions. We find that security assistance has significant, positive impacts on the shares of bilateral trade between the USA and the recipient country, results that are robust to issues of reverse causality and hold across different sectors.
F52|Drogový Problém Afganistanu Ako Obmedzujúci Faktor Jeho Ekonomickej Obnovy (Illegal Drugs And Afghanistan‘S Economic Reconstruction And Development)|Vývoj Afganistanu po roku 2014 sa bude odvíjať od vojensko-politickej a ekonomickej situácie v krajine. Vzájomná prepojenosť týchto determinantov významným spôsobom limituje víziu jeho obnovy a rekonštrukcie. Článok prináša pozitívne námety na to, ako sa vymaniť zo začarovaného kruhu zaostalosti a chudoby krajiny. Súčasne poukazuje na zložitosť a časovú náročnosť tohto procesu. Jedným z určujúcich elementov, ktorý bude Afgancom brániť v konsolidačnom procese, je drogový priemysel. Krajina je, v prenesenom slova zmysle, závislá od pestovania a spracovania ópia a ani medzinárodné spoločenstvo sa nevie zjednotiť na spôsobe, ako tento problém riešiť. (The development path of Afghanistan after 2014 will depend on militarypolitical and economic situation in the country. Mutual correlation of these factors significantly limits the vision for its reconstruction and development. The paper presents some positive ideas on possible ways of how to get out of the circle of backwardness and poverty. At the same time it points out the complexity and time constraints of this process. One of the crucial elements that limits Afghans in consolidation process is the drug industry. The country’s economy depends on growing and processing of opium and the international community cannot agree upon a common way to solve this problem.)
F52|Updated Death and Injury Rates of U.S. Military Personnel During the Conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan: Working Paper 2014-08|By Matthew Goldberg (CBO) In Operation Iraqi Freedom, which ended on August 31, 2010, some 3,482 hostile deaths occurred among U.S. military personnel and 31,947 people were wounded in action (WIA). More than 1,800 hostile deaths occurred during Operation Enduring Freedom (in Afghanistan and surrounding countries) through November 2014; about 20,000 more people were wounded in action. In the Iraq conflict, a larger proportion of wounded personnel survived their wounds than was the case during the Vietnam War, but the increased
F52|Energy Security – A Part Of The Economic Security|Energy is in the centre of the economic development of each country, setting into motion and fuelling factories, government buildings and offices, schools and hospitals, heating homes and keeping perishable foods cold. Its importance explains its complexity. Energy is source of wealth and competition, base for the political controversies and technological investments, and also the core of the epochal challenges of our global environment. Energy is essential for a sustainable development. Security of supplyis a priority for many countries. In this context, there are more ways through it can be achieved: effective management of the demand, diversification of energy sources and the locations of supply, or even using military presence. Energy security can best be defined as the overlap between economic security, national security and the environmental security. This paper will present the economic component of the energy security concept, its purpose being to analyse the concept of energy security in the world.
F52|Growth, Import Dependence, and War|Theories of war predict that the leader may launch a war on a follower who is catching up, since the follower cannot commit to not use their increased power in the future. But it was Japan who attacked the West in 1941: both leaders and followers start wars. Similarly, many have argued that trade makes war less likely, yet the First World War erupted at a time of unprecedented globalisation. We develop a model of trade and war that can explain both observations. Dependence on imports can lead followers to attack leaders or resource‐rich regions when they are subject to blockade.
F52|The Slump and Immigration Policy in Europe|Historical experience suggests that when a period of rising immigration is followed by a sudden slump, this can trigger a policy backlash. This has not occurred in the current recession. This paper examines three links in the chain between the slump and immigration policy. First, although immigration flows have responded to the slump, and immigrants have borne more than their share of the burden, this has done little to protect the employment of non-Immigrants. Second, despite the recession for Europe as a whole, attitudes to immigration have not changed very much, and they have been influenced more by fiscal concerns than by rising unemployment. Third, while far right parties have used the recession to renew the political pressure for tougher immigration policies, governments have been constrained by the composition of immigration and by EU regulation.
F52|Technology and the Era of the Mass Army|We investigate how technology has influenced the size of armies. During the nineteenth century the development of the railroad made it possible to field and support mass armies, significantly increasing the observed size of military forces. During the late twentieth century further advances in technology made it possible to deliver explosive force from a distance and with precision, making mass armies less desirable. We find strong support for our technological account using a new data set covering thirteen great powers between 1600 and 2000. Contrary to what is so often suggested, we find little evidence that the French Revolution was a watershed in terms of levels of mobilization..<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

F52|Employment restrictions and political violence in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Following the outbreak of the Second Intifada in 2000, Israel imposed severe restrictions on the employment of Palestinians within its borders. We study the effect of this policy change on the involvement of West Bank Palestinians in fatal confrontations with Israelis during the first phase of the Intifada. Identification relies on the fact that variation in the pre-Intifada employment rate in Israel across Palestinian localities was not only considerable but also unrelated to prior levels of involvement in the conflict. We find robust evidence that localities that suffered from a sharper drop in employment opportunities were more heavily involved in the conflict.
F52|Ekonomska analiza međunarodnog terorizma|"Knjiga Ekonomska analiza međunarodnoga terorizma nastoji kroz ekonomiju i ekonomsku analizu objasniti dvije izrazito važne kauzalnosti u modernom svijetu: kako terorizam utječe na ekonomiju i kako ekonomija utječe na terorizam. Autor jasno pokazuje specifičnost ovoga odnosa, jer postoje zemlje u kojima stanje ekonomije ima utjecaj na terorizam i postoje zemlje u kojima nema što predstavlja inresantan odnos. O utjecaju terorizma na ekonomiju autor je tu kristalno jasan: terorizam ima negativan utjecaj na ekonomiju. Autor također jasno pokazuje da nije sam čin terorizma negativan za ekonomiju, nego je i postojanje mogućnosti terorističkih aktivnosti izrazito negativno za ekonomiju. Upravo je ovaj ""terorizam u sjeni"" izrazito negativan za ekonomiju. Autor vješto koristi ekonomsku analizu kako bi objasnio međunarodni teorizma, osim ekonomskih učinka terorističke aktivnosti autor upotrebljava ekonomsku analizu kao tehnički okvir za objašnjenje ponašanje terorista. Najbolji primjer ovoga je povezivanje učinka supstitucije, koja je jedna od elemenetarnih mikro ekonomskih pojava, sa odlukama koje donose teroristi kada odlučuju gdje i pod kojim uvjetima izvršiti napad. Ovakvih primjera je puno i ne želim ih sve navoditi, ali upravo takvi primjeri podržavaju ono što autor želi napraviti, a to je upotrijebiti ekonomsku analizu u ekonomski analitički okvir kako bi objasnio ponašenja terorista i učinke terorizma."
F52|Economic growth: trade, public finance, and the paradox of thrift|The classical argument for free trade stressed the possibilities of economic growth by exploiting the gains from trade. A trade surplus per se was not the main objective; presumably the argument was that trade would be balanced at the new higher growth rate. Moreover, the arguments for free trade were made against the background of an assumed hard peg (the gold standard) which would enforce balance of payments equilibrium. This means that contemporary free trade agreements (FTAs), with floating exchange rates, cannot be defended on the traditional grounds. With a floating exchange the appropriate policy advice for each individual jurisdiction is monetary mercantilism â€“ the use of macroeconomic policy in an attempt to achieve a trade surplus as a percentage of GDP. If one partner pursues such a strategy alone, this will translate into a one-for-one increase in the growth rate, and potential regional hegemony for the first mover. To restore balance amongst the trade partners (not necessarily with the outside world) and yet still keep higher growth rates there would have to be a union-wide expansion. This need not be formally coordinated, but at least all the partners should be in broad agreement about the stance of policy.
F52|The Federal Reserve Engages the World (1970-2000): An Insider's Narrative of the Transition to Managed Floating and Financial Turbulence|This paper traces the evolution of the Federal Reserve and its engagement with the global economy over the last three decades of the 20th century: 1970 to 2000. The paper examines the Federal Reserve's role in international economic and financial policy and analysis covering four areas: the emergence and taming of the great inflation, developments in US external accounts, foreign exchange analysis and activities, and external financial crises. It concludes that during this period the US central bank emerged to become the closest the world has to a global central bank.
F52|The effects of terrorism on trade: a factor supply approach|The conventional view of terrorism is that it raises risks and, as a result, reduces trade. The authors use a factor supply approach to show that this hypothesis is not necessarily correct. They use a two-good, two-factor, small open economy model to show that terrorism can either reduce or raise trade depending on critical factors, such as the impact of terrorism on the intensive factor of the export or the import sector. They then extend the analysis to models with several goods and factors and identify conditions under which trade may rise or fall with a greater incidence of terrorism. Finally, they provide an analysis of the effects of terrorism on trade in the presence of an optimal counterterrorism policy. The authors find that a nation’s adjustment of its counterterrorism level in response to a greater terrorist threat may moderate the impact of terrorism on trade.
F52|Breaking the Unbreakable Union: Nationalism, Trade Disintegration and the Soviet Economic Collapse|The breakup of the Soviet Union provides evidence for the detrimental effects of secessionist conflict on domestic integration and economic growth. This paper shows that the increased likelihood of secessions by the UnionÕs member republics in the late 1980s strongly reduced internal Union trade. Economic disintegration thus proceeded along internal borders and preceded the Soviet UnionÕs official dissolution. This helps to explain the severity of the output fall in the late Soviet period. Methodologically, these results stem from an empirical gravity framework, which is derived from first principles by a game-theoretic modeling of Soviet internal trade. Exogenous variation in nationalist agendas, namely the desire to preserve national languages, is used to preclude endogeneity running from trade patterns to secession.
