J49|Flying High on Glucose? Glucose Intoxication and Gender Effects in Paper Airplane Production|Bayesian choice and Framing task experiments were run using a glucose manipulation. Idle time between glucose or placebo drink ingestion was filled with airplane folding on paper designated with one’s subject code. The Bayes “B” and Framing “F” resulted in some airplanes having a U.S. military bomber (e.g., B-52) or fighter jet (e.g. F-14) designation. Flight data shows a gender effect whereby females on glucose made airplanes that flew shorter distances and more off-center, perhaps explaining the gender imbalance in paper airplane competitions where sugary beverages abound. Bomber-designated planes flew less accurately, which suggests unconscious effects on airplane production skills. Key Words: Airplanes, glucose, gender, hilarious
J49|The Real U.S. Unemployment Rate Is Twice the Official Rate, and the Phillips Curve|The official unemployment rate has become an inadequate measure of labor market conditions. This poses a major challenge for basic research as well as for the formulation of adequate economic policy. We propose a new definition of the unemployment rate by weighing part-time workers with 62.5%, the proportion of the time they work relative to full-time workers. We provide new monthly estimates of the unemployment rate for the period 1994-2019 and find that their average during this 25-year period was 10.1% or 4.4 percentage points above the average of the official rate of 5.7%. The gap between the two rates fluctuated between 3.6 and 5.6 percentage points and rose in wake of the recession of 2008 reaching a peak in 2014 only to decrease slowly thereafter back to its pre-recession level of 4 percentage points. The Phillips curve is investigated with the new unemployment rate as well as with U3 and U6 in seven specifications for the period 2008-2019 confirming the very shallow slope found in other studies. However, in one of the specifications the slope is much steeper, mysteriously reminiscent of the coefficients estimated for the 1970s providing a conundrum for further study.
J49|Micro-work, artificial intelligence and the automotive industry|Abstract This paper delves into the human factors in the “back-office” of artificial intelligence and of its data-intensive algorithmic underpinnings. We show that the production of AI is a labor-intensive process, which particularly needs the little-qualified, inconspicuous and low-paid contribution of “micro-workers” who annotate, tag, label, correct and sort the data that help to train and test smart solutions. We illustrate these ideas in the high-profile case of the automotive industry, one of the largest clients of digital data-related micro-working services, notably for the development of autonomous and connected cars. This case demonstrates how micro-work has a place in long supply chains, where tech companies compete with more traditional industry players. Our analysis indicates that the need for micro-work is not a transitory, but a structural one, bound to accompany the further development of the sector; and that its provision involves workers in different geographical and linguistic areas, requiring the joint study of multiple platforms operating at both global and local levels.
J49|Building Workers in Madrid (1737-1805). New Wage Series and Working Lives|This paper provides new series of building wages for 18th-century Madrid. At an international level, the usual point of reference for Spain during the 18th century is the wage series that Earl Hamilton compiled (and Robert Allen included in his database) using the payrolls from the construction of the Royal Palace of Madrid. However, Hamilton did not fully exploit the rich information that those data provide about wage rates, skills and labour force participation. Contrary to the simplicity of the labour categories in Hamilton’s series, our results show the existence of a complex world of skills and, consequently, of wage rates that only come to the surface when we reconstruct the working lives of the thousands of workers who participated in the building of the new palace. The new data presented in this paper provide some new insights into the functioning of labour markets and the complexity of wage (and even human capital) formation in pre-industrial Madrid.
J49|Is There a Business Cycle Effect on the Incidence of Dual Job Holding?|This paper examines the extent to which the incidence of dual job holding is cyclically sensitive in the context of hours constraints on labor supply. Linear probability models of the incidence of dual job holding are estimated separately for each hours constraint regime. Selection effects are accounted for in a correlated random effects setting in which selection into overemployment, unconstrained hours, and underemployment is separately estimated each year from an ordered probit model. As measured by the local unemployment rate, transitory business cycle movements have no effect on the incidence of dual job holding. However, a sustained change in the local unemployment rate reduces the incidence of dual job holding among workers who are not hours constrained on their main jobs.
J49|The economic importance of the Belgian ports : Flemish maritime ports, Liège port complex and the port of Brussels – Report 2017|This Working Paper analyses the economic importance of the Belgian ports largely based on annual accounts data for the year 2017. As the years prior to 2017 have been described in earlier papers in the same series, the emphasis lies on the ﬁgures for 2017 and the developments between 2016 and 2017 . After the stagnation in 2016, direct value added at the Belgian ports rose by 7.3% from € 18 052 million to € 19 368 million (current prices) or roughly 4.4% of Belgium’s GDP. All ports, with the exception of the Liège port complex, contributed to value added growth at the Belgian ports. The ports of Antwerp and Ghent were the most important players. The biggest contributing sectors to value added growth were the chemical industry and, to a lesser extent, cargo handling and the metalworking industry. In 2017, indirect value added was around 82% of direct value added. Direct value added increased significantly at the ports of Ghent, Brussels and Antwerp, by 13.4%, 16.0% and 6.1% respectively. The increase by more than 3% of direct value added at the ports of Zeebrugge and Ostend was also substantial. Direct value added fell by 2.4% at the Liège port complex. After the decline between 2012 and 2015, direct employment at the Belgian ports was up for the second year in a row. Between 2016 and 2017, the number of direct full-time equivalent jobs rose by 0.8%, from 115 401 to 116 311 or approximately 2.8% of Belgium’s total domestic employment. All ports, with the exception of Ostend and Brussels, contributed to employment growth at the Belgian ports. The ports of Antwerp and Ghent were the most important players. The biggest contributing sectors to employment growth were cargo handling and, to a lesser extent, the chemical industry. In 2017, indirect employment was around 120% of direct employment. Direct employment increased by around 1% at the ports of Antwerp, Ghent and Zeebrugge. Growth at the Liège port complex was more modest at 0.4%. The number of direct full-time equivalent jobs fell at the ports of Ostend and Brussels, by 1.2% and 4.2% respectively. The pattern of investment is closely linked to projects and is therefore highly volatile. After the decline between 2012 and 2014, direct investment at the Belgian ports was up for the third year in a row. Between 2016 and 2017, investment was up by 2.4%, from € 4 711 million to € 4 825 million. The port of Ghent and, to a lesser extent, the Liège port complex contributed to investment growth at the Belgian ports. The biggest contributing sectors to investment growth were the ‘port construction and dredging’ sector and, to a lesser extent, cargo handling, and the energy and chemical industries. Based on the figures of the traffic, the Flemish ports can be considered as real bridgeheads for trade with the UK. Developments regarding the modalities and consequences of the Brexit therefor should be followed with the greatest attention. Given the existing import and export volumes in terms of tonnage, it seems it will mostly be a challenge in Zeebrugge and to some extent for Antwerp. As a supplier to both China and the United States, Belgium is indirectly involved in trade between the two countries. If protectionism would close the United States off to exports from abroad, Belgian economy might get impacted one of the most in Europe.
J49|Firm- specific human capital in different market conditions: evidence from the Japanese football league|This paper examined how meeting the team-specific human capital is important in a football player’s performance by comparing the top two league teams. From panel data of the Japan Professional Football League, we find that changing the team reduced a player’s performance and that the team’s performance improved as each player’s tenure in the team increased, the returns from team-specific skills over time increased and then decreased as the years passed, the benefit from moving to a new team depends on the timing of moving, and neither tenure in the team nor experience affects a professional football player’s performance.
J49|Do high wage footballers play for high wage teams? The case of Major League Soccer|Intuition and sports knowledge suggest the most talented professional footballers play for the best teams, i.e. positive assortative matching based on productivity. We consider Major League Soccer between 2007 and 2017. We estimate a wage equation, finding that player and team fixed wage premiums are negatively correlated. This is a puzzle, especially because our estimates of players' wage premiums do correlate strongly with measures of their performance on the pitch, and there is evidence of teammate sorting. One potential solution to this puzzle would be that players match to teams according to some sort of compensating wage differential, for example from their desire to play for successful or well-supported teams; the estimated wage premiums of MLS teams are highly and negatively correlated with their success in the league and their home game attendances.
J49|Is the U.S. Labor Market for Truck Drivers Broken? An Empirical Analysis Using Nationally Representative Data|"The US trucking industry trade press often portrays the US labor market for truck drivers as not working, citing persistent driver shortages and high levels of firmâ€ level turnover, and predicting significant resulting constraints on the supply of motor freight services. We investigate the truck driver labor market using three techniques. First, using data from the Occupational Employment Statistics of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we delineate the structure of the driver workforce. Second, from the same source we find that the trucking labor market has displayed some characteristics of a ""tight"" labor market since 2003: rising nominal wages, stable/growing employment, and lower rates of unemployment than other blue-collar jobs. Third, using data from the Current Population Survey we describe the occupations and industries from which drivers come and to which drivers go, when they change occupations, and statistically analyze these entries and exits. We find relatively high rates of occupational attachment among drivers, and importantly, we also find that truck drivers respond in the expected manner to differences in earnings across occupations. Finally, we point out that the issues discussed by the industry are concentrated in one segment of the overall market, that for drivers in long distance truckload (TL) motor freight, which contains between one sixth and one fourth of all heavy and tractorâ€ trailer truck drivers. These findings suggest a more nuanced view of this labor market. The market as a whole appears to work as well as any other blueâ€ collar labor market, and while the truck driver market tends to be ""tight,"" there do not appear to be any special constraints preventing entry into (or exit from) the occupation. There is thus no reason to think that driver supply should fail to respond to price signals in the standard way, given sufficient time. The persistent issues localized in the TL segment are not visible in the aggregate data, and require a distinct analysis."
J49|The economic importance of the Belgian ports : Flemish maritime ports, Liège port complex and the port of Brussels – Report 2016|This Working Paper analyses the economic importance of the Belgian ports based largely on the annual accounts data for the year 2016. As the years prior to 2016 have been described in earlier papers in the same series, we mainly focus on the figures for 2016 and developments between 2015 and 2016. On the back of strong growth, direct value added in the Belgian ports remained more or less stable in 2016 at around € 18 000 million (current prices) or roughly 4.3% of Belgium’s GDP. Direct value added declined in the Flemish seaports, mainly in the port of Antwerp. Ghent and Zeebrugge could only partly compensate for the fall in Antwerp’s value added, while Ostend showed a small decline itself. The inland ports as a whole grew over the period 2015-2016; the port of Brussels registered a decline and the Liège port complex an increase. Indirect value added is around 82% of the direct figure. After declining from 2012, direct employment in the Belgian ports was more or less stable in 2016 at around 115 000 FTE or approximately 2.8% of Belgium’s total domestic employment. Direct employment in the Flemish seaports increased, mainly in the ports of Zeebrugge, Ghent and Antwerp. Ostend showed a decline in employment. The inland ports recorded lower employment; the port of Brussels registered a decline, as did the Liège port complex. Indirect employment is around 1.2 times the direct figure. Delving deeper into the data and trying to explain the above trends in terms of the structural composition of the Belgian ports shows that all ports are concentrated on a few sectors, and within those sectors often on just a handful of companies. Based on the figures of the traffic, the Flemish ports can be considered as real bridgeheads for trade with the UK. Developments regarding the modalities and consequences of the Brexit therefor should be followed with the greatest attention. Given the existing import and export volumes in terms of tonnage, it seems it will mostly be a challenge in Zeebrugge and to some extent for Antwerp.
J49|Wage Determination In A Regulated Labor Market: Empirical Evidence From Major League Soccer|The North American top tier Major League Soccer presents a unique research setting to study a regulated labor market. Contrary to the situation in Europe, where player salaries remain private and confidential (the only exception here is “Serie A” in Italy), the player unions regu-larly publish this kind of information for each of the US Major Leagues. In this paper we use an unbalanced panel with detailed player-season-information from the seasons 2006 to 2016 to estimate a multi-stage salary model for MLS players. We differentiate in the analysis be-tween regular and designated players (aka DP, a status unknown in Europe) due to their heter-ogenic profiles. For regular players we find that the impact of age on salaries follows an in-verted u-shape with a very late turning point at 33.6 years. In addition, we find a statistically significant positive of last season’s performance and career performance. Experience abroad yields a significantly higher salary as does tenure with the current team (controlling for team-specific fixed effects). Perhaps surprisingly, career length in MLS is negatively associated with salary. Also, the results suggest that local player suffer a pay discrimination compared to similar players from Western Europe, Central and South America. Thus, we confirm most of the findings that have been reported in previous research using data from European football leagues (e.g. Lucifora & Simmons, 2003; Frick, 2007; Bryson et al., 2014). This finding alone is not straightforward considering the various regulations that help the leagues to keep espe-cially salary budgets in check. The effectiveness of salary regulations, e.g. put in place via Collective Bargaining Agreements, is shown for two instances, as is the impact of a regulatory change. In contrast, the key driver of the unregulated DP salaries are club-specific fixed effects, ex-plaining already 58 percent of the observable variation in player salaries. Next important driv-ers are career games played and the region of origin. Local superstar players earn a surprising premium over players from Western Europe, South America and the Carribean’s. Neither for regular nor for designated players’ positions are rewarded significantly different. This is a big difference compared to European leagues where Forwards are usually paid better.
J49|Self-employment on the way in a digital economy: A variety of shades of grey|The aim of this paperis to discuss self-employment in a historical perspective. A historiography of self-employment has to embed the observation into a broader frame-work of international relations and of economic and social developments. Related changes affect diverse institutions like labour markets, systems of education and further education, political organizations, the system of labour relations and, of course, the whole “social system of production” (Hollingsworth, 1998). Vice versa, these changes are also affected by different developments in the sphere of the social, technological and political organization of economy and society. Contemporary discourse about the nature of self-employment falls far too short, if it is not linked to an historical frame-work of thought, which gives contours to ideas and changing interpretations. Especially, the current type of “naive” admiration of self-employment, often in combination with normative upgrading in terms of entrepreneurship, must be advised to analyse and to think historically. At the same time, many present day self-employed “jobs” would have been standard employment contracts some ten years ago. In this respects current de-bates on precarization are also linked with debates on self-employment.
J49|Work productivity and employment in chosen EU countries|Work productivity presents one of the factors, influencing economic growth of the country. On the other hand work productivity is also influenced by various factors. There are raising differences in work productivity among individual countries. Human capital can influence work productivity through employment, which can be analyzed from various points of view. The goal of the paper is therefore to identify work productivity in EU-28 with emphasize to V4. The main analysis had been done by available database in European system of national and regional accounts and according introduced statistic classification of economic activities from European Parliament Decree. The main indexes of work productivity had been calculated according obtained data with using of descriptive statistics. According mentioned statistics we found which country is the best and which is the worst from the view of analyzed indexes. The last part of the paper presents following up of reason of determined state with setting of possible solutions.
J49|The Impact of Internships on Job Attainment: an Applied Analysis<BR>[El impacto de las prácticas en empresas en la inserción laboral: un análisis aplicado]|Las prácticas en empresas que realizan los estudiantes a lo largo de sus estudios universitarios han sido prácticamente inexploradas en la investigación académica, sobre todo en el ámbito español. El objetivo de este artículo es analizar qué características de las prácticas en empresas y qué competencias adquiridas en las mismas determinan la empleabilidad actual y la calidad salarial de aquellos estudiantes que las han realizado. Adicionalmente, se examina el grado de satisfacción y de utilidad percibido con la realización de las prácticas. La investigación se basa en información recopilada por medio de una encuesta realizada a estudiantes de Ciencias Económicas y Empresariales de la Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM) que han realizado prácticas entre 2012-2013 y 2015-2016. En base a la estimación de modelos lineales de probabilidad y probit, encontramos que aquellas prácticas en empresas que permiten desarrollar las competencias de comunicación y de gestión de problemas mejoran, respectivamente, la probabilidad de estar empleado y la de situarse en tramos salariales elevados. Asimismo, el uso de nuevas tecnologías de comunicación e información (TICs) emerge como la competencia adquirida más importante, tanto en lo relativo a la satisfacción de los estudiantes con las PAE como a la utilidad de las mismas como medio de inserción laboral.
J49|Constrained vs unconstrained labor supply: the economics of dual job holding|Abstract This paper develops a unified model of dual and unitary job holding based on a Stone-Geary utility function. The model incorporates both constrained and unconstrained labor supply. Panel data methods are adapted to accommodate unobserved heterogeneity and multinomial selection into six mutually exclusive labor supply regimes. We estimate the wage and income elasticities arising from selection and unobserved heterogeneity as well as from the Stone-Geary Slutsky equations. The labor supply model is estimated with data from the British Household Panel Survey 1991–2008. Among dual job holders, our study finds that the Stone-Geary income and wage elasticities are much larger for labor supply to the second job compared with the main job. When the effects of selection and unobserved heterogeneity are taken account of, the magnitudes of these elasticities on the second job tend to be significantly reduced.
J49|Physical constitution matters for athletic performance and salary of NBA players|Basketball is one of the most practised sports in the world, especially in America. America has the most famous professional basketball league, the National Basketball Association (NBA). This study examines whether there is a relationship between the physical constitution of professional basketball players and their athletic performance in the 2015/16 NBA season. Regression results show that the relative wingspan influences the athletic performance in a significantly positive way whereas the vertical jumping ability influences it in a significantly negative way. Furthermore, age follows an inverted U-shape with a maximum at 28 years. Moreover, this study analyses the impact of on-court performance measurements and personal characteristics on salary for NBA players. Taller players have a higher salary in the 2015/16 NBA season.
J49|Being Central and Productive? Evidence from Slovenian Visual Artists in the 19th and 20th Century|Slovenian art history has received very little (if any) attention from the viewpoint of network theory although there were several examples of artists co-working or working in groups, collectives or even loosely organized clusters (groups from the impressionist Sava in 1904 to postmodern Irwin in 1984). This may be interpreted as a way to acquire better positions in the national and international art circles and on the art market. In our article we use web-based dataset of Slovenska biografija (operated by the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts), which contains data on numerous notable persons throughout Slovenian history to analyze the centrality of individual artistic figures and movements throughout Slovenian art history. We also study the influence of network centrality on cultural production controlling for endogeneity following the instrumental variable approach, proposed in the literature while using a new instrumental variable to solve the problem. Finally, we present results which show that women visual artists used their network positions more intensively than men and provide some first explanations for this observed relationship. In conclusion, we provide some reflections on the importance of these findings for further research work in the area.
J49|"Arbeiten in der Sharing Economy: die ""Uberisierung"" der Arbeitswelt?"|"Within a short period of time the sharing-phenomenon, originally triggered by altered consumer attitudes and preferences and enabled by modern networking technologies, gained momentum. Quickly sharing emerged from its niche existence. Today an increasing professionalization of the sharing economy can be observed: Many of the idealistic goals originally set are being abandoned. Also, sharing platforms are more and more recognized not only for their ability to provide alternative ways to satisfy consumption needs but also as sources of jobs and income. Sharing platforms’ specific economical principles bring forth a new sort of self-employed worker—the micro-entrepreneur. This new sort of worker is confronted with specific working conditions prevailing in the new platform economy. As a whole, the further proliferation of this form of working gives rise to concerns about an ""uberization"" of work. This development raises questions in terms of modern protective rights for workers as well as social security benefits and therefore calls for the attention of regulators. Innerhalb kürzester Zeit hat das durch veränderte Konsumeinstellungen angestoßene und durch moderne Vernetzungstechnologien ermöglichte Sharing an Fahrt gewonnen und trat schnell aus der anfänglichen Nische heraus. Heute ist eine zunehmendeProfessionalisierung der Sharing Economy zu beobachten, in deren Zuge ursprüngliche und idealistische Ziele des Sharings zunehmend über Bord geworfen werden. Sharingplattformen dienen auch nicht länger nur als Quelle alternativer Konsumbefriedigung, sondern zudem als Job- und Verdienstquelle. Dabei sind es die spezifischen ökonomischen Grundprinzipien der Sharingplattformen, die einen neuen Typus von Selbständigem hervorbringen – den Mikrounternehmer. Dieser ist unterspeziellen, den Funktionsprinzipien der Plattformökonomie geschuldeten Arbeitskonditionen tätig. Insgesamt lässt die weitere Verbreitung dieser neuen Wirtschafts- und Arbeitsform eine ""Uberisierung"" der Arbeitswelt erwarten. Diese Entwicklung wirftFragen hinsichtlich zeitgemäßer Schutzrechte für Arbeitskräfte sowie sozialer Absicherung auf und ruft Regulierungsinstanzen auf den Plan."
J49|Impacts of regulation on eco-innovation and job creation|New environmental technologies (environmental/eco-innovations) are often regarded as potential job creatorsâ€”in addition to their positive effects on the environment. Environmental regulation may induce innovations that are accompanied by positive growth and employment effects. Recent empirical analyses show that the introduction of cleaner process innovations, rather than product-based ones, may also lead to higher employment. The rationale is that cleaner technologies lead to cost savings, which help to improve the competitiveness of firms, thereby inducing positive effects on demand.
J49|Do Employers Learn from Public, Subjective, Performance Reviews?| Much of the new “gig economy” relies on reputation systems to reduce problems of asymmetric information. In most cases, these reputation systems function well by soliciting unbiased feedback from buyers and sellers. However, certain features of onlinelabor markets create incentives for employers to misreport worker performance. This paper tests whether employers learn about worker productivity from public, subjective, performance reviews using data from a large online labor market. Starting with a simple model of employer learning in the presence of potentially biased reviews, I derive testable hypotheses about the relationship between public information and wages, worker attrition, and contract renewals. I find that these public reviews provide substantial information to the market and that other firms use them to learn about the productivity of workers. I also find evidence that these reviews affect how long workers stay in the labor market. Finally, using data on applications, I provide evidence of a mechanism for honest reviews. I show that workers punish firms that leave negative reviews by refusing to work for them again. Together, this body of evidence suggests that reputation systems in online labor markets provide significant information to both workers and firms and help reduce problems of asymmetric information.
J49|Aggregate wages of players and performance in Italian Serie A|Abstract This paper investigates the relationship between players’ wages and sport performance in the Italian top professional football league—Serie A. The analysis focuses on 14 seasons from 2001/2002 to 2014/2015. Findings show that aggregate wage expenditure is a robust predictor of success for Italian professional football teams. We first exploited a fixed-effects panel data and eventually we addressed the problem of endogeneity by providing a dynamic IV specification of the model. Based on the System-GMM framework, we employed a model including lagged terms of dependent variables and covariates as instruments to control for endogeneity as well as alternative exogenous instruments to control for geographical/environmental factors and socio-economic factors that could be the actual predictors of performance through an indirect effect on payroll.
J49|Zwischen den Welten: Hybride Arbeitsverhaeltnisse in den Kulturberufen (Between worlds: Hybrid employment in the cultural industries)|Der vorliegende Beitrag untersucht Arbeitsverhaeltnisse der Kultur- und Kreativberufe. Es gibt einige empirische Anhaltspunkte, dass sich hier eine neue Stufe der Flexibilisierung von Arbeit vollzieht, die als Erwerbshybridisierung zu beschreiben ist. Die Frage ist, unter welchen beschaeftigungs- und arbeitspolitischen Bedingungen und in welchen empirischen Formen sie auftritt sowie welche Arbeitswirklichkeiten sich damit verbinden. Argumentiert wird, dass die Aufteilung von Erwerbsformen nach sozialversicherungspflichtig versus selbstaendig nur mehr zu kurz greift und dass sich in den Kulturberufen hybride Arbeitsverhaeltnisse entwickeln, die sich als Grenzgaenge zwischen Erwerbsformen und Arbeitsverhaeltnissen manifestieren. Exemplarisch diskutiert wird dieses Problem am Beispiel der Designbranche. Empirische Basis ist eine umfassende, qualitative Studie ueber kuenstlerisch-kreative Arbeit im arbeitsgesellschaftlichen Strukturwandel, die eine Feldstudie von zwei Feldern der Designbranche umfasst: Kommunikations- und Modedesign. Deutlich wird an diesem Beispiel, dass sich das Phaenomen der Erwerbshybridisierung korrespondierend mit der institutionellen Umwelt ausbildet, dass es daher zu strukturell differenzierten Grenzgaengen kommt und dass damit Herausforderungen fuer die Interessenpolitik im Kulturbereich verbunden sind. (This article examines labour relations in the creative industries. There is some empirical evidence to suggest that a new level of work flexibility is emerging in the creative industries, which can be described as employment hybridisation. The question is which labour conditions and industrial relations lead to hybrid employment patterns and which work realities are connected with them. I will argue that in the cultural industries hybrid employment patterns evolve that occur as boundaries between self-employment and employed working conditions. This argument is illustrated with examples from the design industry. The empirical basis is a comprehensive, qualitative study of artistic and creative work, including a field study of two fields in the design industry: communications and fashion design. It is clear from this example that the phenomenon of employment hybridisation corresponds with the institutional environment. Thus, there are structurally differentiated border crossings. Finally, this poses a challenge for industrial relations in the cultural sector.)
J49|Dinámica del mercado laboral por sexo en Venezuela: 1997-2012. Análisis descriptivo|Este trabajo tiene como objetivo estimar, analizar y comparar el comportamiento de los flujos de entrada y salida, y las probabilidades de transición instantáneas entre inactividad, desocupación y ocupación de hombres y mujeres en edad de trabajar (personas de 15 años y más) en Venezuela desde el 2do semestre de 1997 hasta el 1er semestre del 2012. Se contribuye a esta literatura mediante la inclusión de los flujos de entrada y salida del sector formal y el sector informal, ya que en Venezuela cerca del 48% de las personas ocupadas se clasifican en el sector informal. A tal efecto, se aplica la metodología empleada en Fernández y Montilla (2015) clasificando a la población por sexo. Este trabajo encuentra que las mujeres tienen mayor movilidad laboral que los hombres, mayor probabilidad de transitar hacia la inactividad y menor probabilidad de encontrar empleo.
J49|A Review of Online Crowdsourcing Platforms|Over the years a great number of different websites have emerged that offer crowd-sourcing services, which aim at taking advantage of the vast number of anonymous workers globally available to complete tasks. In this paper we review and analyze existing websites providing crowdsourcing services in an attempt to establish a framework that will allow systematic discussion, comparison and assessment of existing crowdsourcing platforms.
J49|Capacitación como componente de desarrollo productivo en las microempresas: El Caso de la FEDEMYPE Santa Cruz|Las MYPES son una parte importante de la economía nacional, los microempresarios identifican a la falta de capacitación como un factor determinante para mejorar su productividad; sin embargo, cuando se les pregunta qué tipo de capacitación necesitan, no existe consenso sobre sus necesidades. El presente estudio de caso busca mostrar la situación actual de las MYPES con respecto a sus necesidades de capacitación a través de un trabajo con la FEDEMYPE Santa Cruz. Entre las principales razones del porqué no existe consenso entre las necesidades de capacitación está la gran diversidad de las MYPES y el distanciamiento entre la oferta de capacitación brindada por instituciones gubernamentales y no gubernamentales con la demanda de capacitación de las micro y pequeñas empresas. Por otro lado, también se realizó una recapitulación de los tipos de capacitación que se socializó con la FEDEMYPE con el fin de complementar estudio.
J49|Local employment impact from competing energy sources: Shale gas versus wind generation in Texas|The rapid development of both wind power and of shale gas has been receiving significant attention both in the media and among policy makers. Since these are competing sources of electricity generation, it is informative to investigate their relative merits regarding local job creation. We use a panel econometric model to estimate the historical job-creating performance of wind versus that of shale oil and gas. The model is estimated using monthly county level data from Texas from 2001 to 2011. Both first-difference and GMM methods show that shale-related activity has brought strong employment to Texas. For example, based on the 5482 new directional/fractured wells drilled in Texas in 2011, the estimates imply that between 25,000 and 125,000 net jobs were created in that year alone. We did not, however, find a corresponding impact on wages. Our estimations did not identify a non-negligible impact from the wind industry on either local employment or wages.
J49|Forecasting Employment in Europe: Are Survey Results Helpful?|Abstract In this paper we evaluate the forecasting performance of employment expectations for employment growth in 15 European states. Our data cover the period from the first quarter 1998 to the fourth quarter 2014. With in-sample analyses and pseudo out-of-sample exercises, we find that for most of the European states considered, the survey-based indicator model outperforms common benchmark models. It is therefore a powerful tool for generating more accurate employment forecasts. We observe the best results for one quarter ahead predictions that are primarily the aim of the survey question. However, employment expectations also work well for longer forecast horizons in some countries.
J49|Tourism Policy, a Big Push to Employment: Evidence from a Multiple Synthetic Control Approach|This paper investigates the impact of tourism policy on employment, using the Tourism Development Policy (TDP) implemented in the Argentinean province of Salta during the years of 2003 to 2010 as a case study. Following the Synthetic Control Method for comparative case studies, we use a combination of non-treated Argentinean provinces to construct a synthetic control province which resembles relevant characteristics of Salta before the TDP implementation. Given the dual focus of the evaluated policy -one specific sector in one province- we also construct a synthetic control for the tourism sector using a combination of other sectors for Salta, and other sectors from other provinces. This novel approach based on multiple dimensions of the donor pool allows us to test the robustness of the estimated impact. We find that TDP implementation increased tourism employment in Salta by an average of 11 percent per year, for an overall impact of around 112 percent between 2003 and 2013. The analysis also suggests that larger impacts of the TDP occurred from the second to the seventh years after policy implementation. Results are robust across a series of placebo tests and sensitivity checks.
J49|Significance Of Turism In Economy Of The Eu S Member States, Particulary Concerning The Employment|Tourism can have a key role in the national economy by offering opportunity for employment, contributing to improvement of the current account balance and stimulating the economic growth. On the other hand, more and more attention should be paid to the serving of the tourist in certain countries where the number of the tourists is large as well as environmental and social consequences can be expected.Therefore, the governments are interested in the controlled development of tourism for economic, social, cultural, architectural and natural environmental reasons equally.Today, around the world, one of the most important governmental tasks is to stimulate the development of the tourism sector considering its key role in the job creation.This essay investigates the role of employment in economy of the developed countries, focusing on the states possessing the largest tourism revenue. The sector means an important pulling power for each macro economy having a positive effect on different areas of the economy. At the same time, the average income of the persons employed in the accommodation services and catering is “traditionally” one of the lowest recognised ones among the national economic sectors in the European countries. With analysing the data of the examined period and comparing them to the targets simultaneously, we can experience that, at the end of 2013-2014, a measure of growth started in point of the employment and the gross average income but it still lags behind the goals stated in 2005. The economic crisis coincided with this period, effects of which cannot be left out of account because it greatly influenced not only the Hungarian but the global tourism as well. However, in the long term, it seems likely that economic role of the tourism, including the stability and enlargement of the labour market, will intensify both globally and in the EU’s member states in future years.
J49|Benchmarking Metis Economic and Social Development|This is a report on the socio-economic development of the Metis in Canada. The report identifies appropriate indicators to benchmark Metis socio-economic development against non-Aboriginal socio-economic development, while establishing a benchmark against which future progress can be gauged. Quite briefly, there have been strong gains in Metis socio-economic development, especially concerning income and education. In particular, Metis median income reached 86.7 per cent of non-Aboriginal median income in 2010, up from 72.9 per cent in 2000. In terms of education, the share of the Metis with a college, CEGEP or other non-university certificate or diploma as their highest degree actually surpassed the share of the non-Aboriginal population in similar areas by 2011. However, there are still a number of gaps that remain. For example, the Metis continue to have poorer indicators of health, especially concerning smoking. Furthermore, the Metis still have lower levels of suitable housing than the non-Aboriginal population. One of the most interesting findings of the report is the large gaps that exist within the Metis Nation between provinces. The report concludes that concerted efforts, determined cooperation, and substantial participation from Metis leaders and Metis organizations at both the provincial and national level will be required to close the remaining gaps between provinces within the Metis Nation and between the aggregate Metis and non-Aboriginal populations.
J49|Aboriginal Labour Market Information in Canada: An Overview|This report, prepared for the Friendship Centres of Canada, provides a detailed overview and assessment of available sources of labour market information (LMI) on Aboriginal Canadians. The Friendship Centres play a pivotal role in community and economic development by providing training and employment opportunities, facilitating social development, and building human and resource capacity for Aboriginal Canadians. Better labour market information, and better use of existing LMI, can facilitate their work. The three most important sources of LMI for Aboriginal Canadians are the Labour Force Survey, National Household Survey, and Aboriginal Peoples Survey. The report identifies the exclusion of the Aboriginal population living on reserve in all Statistics Canada surveys except the National Household Survey and the Census as the most important lacuna in Canadian Aboriginal labour market information. The report concludes that despite the many gaps, there is a wealth of Aboriginal LMI available in Canada, at the national, regional and local levels, that can be used by Friendship Centres to better develop and target programs and services to the urban Aboriginal population.
J49|Review of Best Practices in Labour Market Forecasting with an Application to the Canadian Aboriginal Population|The Friendship Centres in Canada play a pivotal role in community and economic development by providing training and employment opportunities, facilitating social development, and building human and resource capacity for Aboriginal Canadians. The availability of occupational projections may facilitate the work of the Friendship Centres by providing valuable information concerning future labour market outcomes, allowing their programs to more appropriately prepare Aboriginal Canadians with the required skills, training and education to meet expected labour demand. By surveying the best practices in labour market demand and supply modeling used by national, sub-national and sectoral organizations, this report will help provide a stronger understanding of the potential power of labour market forecasting, while acknowledging the difficulties and obstacles inherent in any projection process. Furthermore, this report will discuss methodologies that could be implemented by the Friendship Centres to estimate the prospective occupational labour supply and demand facing Aboriginal Canadians.
J49|Temporary Help Employment in Recession and Recovery|The temporary help industry, although small, plays a significant role in the macro economy, reflecting employers' growing reliance on temporary help agencies to provide flexibility in meeting staffing needs. Drawing on detailed temporary-help order data between 2007 and 2011 from a large, nationally representative staffing company, we provide insights into the characteristics of temporary help work, employers’ use of temporary agencies to screen workers for permanent positions, and the industry's role in labor market adjustment over the business cycle. We estimate that the temporary help industry accounted for a large share of gross job losses and job gains over this period, as well as for a sizable share of net separations and hires. Nearly a third of assignments were observed to end prematurely due to worker performance problems (largely soft skills deficiencies) or quits, and hire rates of workers in temp-to-hire contracts were low. Although most temporary help assignments are short-lived, during the recession, companies lengthened temporary help assignments and reduced hiring from their pool of temps, possibly in response to economic uncertainty. Nominal wage growth among new temporary hires was weak over the five-year period and failed to keep pace with inflation.
J49|When Do Punishment Institutions Work?|While peer punishment sometimes motivates increased cooperation, it sometimes reduces cooperation. We use a lab experiment to study why punishment sometimes fails. We begin with a gift exchange game with punishment as it has typically been implemented therein since punishment has often backfired in this game. We modify two features of punishment that could increase its efficacy: punishment's strength and its timing (whether the punisher publicly pre-commits to punishment or acts after the punishee). We replicate the result that peer punishment in gift exchange games can reduce cooperation, but show that this bad outcome disappears if punishment is more powerful. This does not seem primarily due to punishment's threat leading to spiteful behavior: we find little evidence of spite, and the same punishment does not perform better when it is chosen after the fact. We find two main reasons that punishment decreases cooperation: lower wages are offered (a stick is substituted for a carrot); and many punishers don't design punishment to properly incentivize high effort, particularly when punishment is weak in power. Punishment that is not publicly pre-committed is not effective in this game, even though this kind of punishment is similar to that used in public good games in the literature where punishment does seem to increase cooperation. The only punishment institution that increases cooperation is high-power punishment that is publicly pre-committed, which works through strong incentives rather than reciprocity. Finally, the existence of a punishment institution often decreases social surplus (when punishment-related losses are considered), although it may eventually increase social surplus if it is powerful and publicly pre-committed.
J49|Die Zukunft der Zeitarbeit zwischen Re-Regulierung und qualitativer Weiterentwicklung|Das Wachstum der Zeitarbeit war in den letzten Jahren nicht mehr so dynamisch wie in den Jahren vor der Krise 2009. Es stellt sich die Frage, ob es sich in erster Linie um eine konjunkturell bedingte Wachstumspause handelt oder ob strukturelle Veränderungen zu beobachten sind. Solche Änderungen könnten durch eine zunehmend striktere Gestaltung des rechtlichen Rahmens hervorgerufen sein. Die von der großen Koalition avisierte weitere Regulierung könnte dazu führen, dass die arbeitsmarktpolitische Funktion der Zeitarbeit beeinträchtigt wird, ohne ihr dabei eine Perspektive für die qualitative Weiterentwicklung aufzuzeigen – was für die Zeitarbeitnehmer zu einem Problem wird. So ist der Anteil der Kundenunternehmen, die angesichts einer Beschränkung der Überlassungsdauer für Helfer auf die betriebliche Funktion lieber ganz verzichten, mit 32 Prozent höher als der Anteil, der bereit ist, die Zeitarbeitnehmer zu übernehmen (29 Prozent).
J49|Does attractiveness win? On the gender-specific impact of attractiveness on athletic performance in tennis|This study examines whether there are gender-specific differences in regard to physical attractiveness of professional tennis players and their performance. For this purpose, the top 100 male and female tennis players of the tennis world ranking in 2014 are examined. Athletic performance is measured by prize money earned for single seasons as well as for the whole career. Different OLS-regressions reveal a significantly positive relationship between physical attractiveness and athletic performance. However, this result holds for female tennis players only. For male tennis players, the impact is insignificant.
J49|Up or Out: Research Incentives and Career Prospects of Postdocs in Germany|" type=""main"" xml:id=""geer12010-abs-0001""> Academic careers in Germany have been under debate for a while. We conduct a survey among postdocs in Germany to analyze the perceptions and attitudes of postdocs regarding their research incentives, their working conditions, and their career prospects. We conceptualize the career prospects of a postdoc in a life-cycle perspective of transitions from academic training to academic or non-academic jobs. Only about half of the postdocs sees strong incentives for academic research, but there is quite a strong confidence to succeed in an academic career. Furthermore, postdocs who attended a PhD program show better career prospects and higher research incentives compared to others. Academic career prospects and motivation are strongest for assistant professors. Apart from this small group, however, postdocs report only a small impact of the university reforms of the last decade. Female postdocs show significantly higher research incentives but otherwise we find little gender differences. Finally, good prospects in non-academic jobs are not associated with a reduction in the motivation for research."
J49|Who hires foreign domestic workers? evidence from Lebanon|Foreign domestic workersÕ activities provide important market and non-market services in a large number of middle-income countries as these activities have an impact on the labor force participation and time allocation decisions of household members. This paper provides new evidence on the determinants of foreign domestic workersÕ employment using a socio-economic dataset from Lebanon. Controlling for household, household head, dwelling and regional characteristics, contrary to popular beliefs we find that the size of the household and the presence of elderly persons are not important determinants of the hiring decision of foreign domestic workers, while the probability of hiring a domestic worker is significantly higher for households with children and disabled persons. Interestingly, we find that the number of rooms in the residence rather than its total surface area or type to be the only relevant dwelling characteristic. The paper offers insights about the demand for foreign domestic workers that may be useful to policy makers in developing nations.
J49|Migration policy as a precondition for a common labour Market in the european union|Beside the free movement of capital, goods and services, the right to free movement is an essential part of the single European market. A genuine European labour market implies the free movement of all workers, including those who are not EU citizens. The paper explores the background and the current state of the EU common migration policy towards non-EU citizens. The paper deals with two dimensions of migration policies - admission and mobility within the EU area. The aim of the paper is to answer the question whether a common labour market can be considered accomplished while the conditions of entry and mobility for third-country nationals substantially lack convergence. The analysis of the legislation and statistical data shows that third-country nationals are not part of the European labour market as such
J49|Silver Economy In Eu – Long-Term Perspectives Of Labour Force Structure|This paper is focused on circumscribing in what manner labour force structure, as distinct economic factor, will influence, in next decades, process of building up a silver economy in EU. For this, we use statistical data, put to use so as to generate a proper prognosis of future increase in size of ageing population in EU, relative to size of total population. This task is accomplished using the strategy of comparing positions of different countries in European Union, the more economically developed Western EU economies and the less developed Eastern EU economies, so that to be able to argue whether European Union has its (certain) opportunities – and, of course, its drawbacks – for constructing its ‘silver economy’, and, the scope of these opportunities (which necessarily counterbalance drawbacks).
J49|Interlocking Directorships and Patenting Coordination|The aim of this paper is to investigate the role interlocking directorships play in the patenting activities of UK companies and provide further insights into the channels through which this relationship emerges. Our empirical analysis produces three main results: first, interlocking leads to a higher number of successful patent applications; second, interlocked firms are more likely to cite each other's patents, especially around the moment of interlocking; and, third, interlocked companies tend to increase the technological similarity of their patent portfolio in the immediate period following their first interlock. To rationalise these results, we develop a theoretical model that identifies interlocking directorships as a practice that prevents property right conflicts that often arise between firms that are technologically close to each other.
J49|The Effect of 21st Century Military Service on Civilian Labor and Educational Outcomes|I estimate the effect of military service during the Afghanistan and Iraq wars on civilian labor and educational outcomes using several empirical methodologies including sibling fixed effects and propensity score matching. Since military occupations and training have changed significantly in the past few decades, these effects may be different than those found in previous studies on veterans of earlier theaters. I find that veteran status increases civilian wages by approximately ten percent for minorities but has little or no effect on whites in this regard. Veterans of all demographic groups are found to be equally employable and equally as satisfied with their civilian occupation as non-veterans. For females and minorities, veteran status substantially increases the likelihood one attempts college. These veterans are found to be more apt to pursue and obtain a two year (associate’s) degree instead of a four year (bachelor’s) degree. Lastly, I find mixed evidence that veteran status increases the likelihood of public sector employment. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014
J49|Are attractive female tennis players more successful? An empirical analysis|This study examines whether there is a relationship between physical attractiveness of professional female tennis players ranked in the top 100 of the tennis world ranking in 2011 and their sporting success in terms of earned prize money and winning probabilities. OLS-regressions reveal a significantly positive relationship between physical attractiveness and sporting success in terms of prize money for the years 2012 and 2013 as well as for the whole career. Furthermore, a logit-model shows that the larger the difference in physical attractiveness is, the higher is the winning probability for the more attractive player in individual matches.
J49|Allein tätige Selbständige: starkes Beschäftigungswachstum, oft nur geringe Einkommen|Over the past two decades, the number of self-employed in Germany has risen dramatically. This is almost exclusively due to an increasing number of self-employed persons without employees (solo entrepreneurs). There has been a particularly marked escalation in the number of self-employed women. Although some solo entrepreneurs command high incomes, the average earnings of this section of the workforce are less than those of employed people. Many do not earn any more than employees in the low-pay sector. Although the proportion of low earners among solo entrepreneurs has fallen since the middle of the last decade, it still accounts for almost a third of them, or around 800,000 people. Solo self-employment is frequently only a temporary form of employment. Most solo entrepreneurs who cease trading take up dependent employment. This may be partly because self-employment originally only represented a stopgap for them in the absence of alternative employment opportunities. The meager income to be earned through self-employment might also play a role. In den vergangenen beiden Jahrzehnten ist die Zahl der Selbständigen in Deutschland kräftig gestiegen. Dies ist fast ausschließlich auf die Entwicklung bei allein tätigen Selbständigen (Solo-Selbständigen) zurückzuführen. Besonders stark hat sich dabei die Zahl selbständiger Frauen erhöht. Auch wenn ein Teil der Solo-Selbständigen hohe Einkünfte erzielt, liegt das mittlere Einkommen dieser Erwerbstätigengruppe unter dem der Arbeitnehmer. Viele kommen über Einkünfte, wie sie Arbeitnehmer im Niedriglohnsektor beziehen, nicht hinaus. Der Anteil der Geringverdiener unter den Solo-Selbständigen ist zwar seit Mitte der letzten Dekade gesunken, er liegt aber immer noch bei knapp einem Drittel oder etwa 800 000 Personen. Eine Solo-Selbständigkeit ist häufig nur eine vorübergehende Beschäftigungsform. Die meisten der Solo-Selbständigen, die ihr Geschäft aufgeben, wechseln in eine abhängige Beschäftigung. Dies mag auch daran liegen, dass für manche der Gang in die Selbständigkeit wegen fehlender Beschäftigungsalternativen ohnehin nur eine Notlösung war. Zudem könnte Unzufriedenheit mit dem Einkommen aus der selbständigen Beschäftigung eine Rolle spielen.
J49|Human Trafficking and Regulating Prostitution|We study sex trafficking in a marriage market model of prostitution. When traffickers can coerce women to sell sex, trafficked prostitutes constitute a non-zero share of supply in any unregulated market for sex. We ask if regulation can eradicate trafficking and restore the equilibrium that would arise in an unregulated market without traffickers. While all existing approaches – criminalization of prostitutes (“the traditional model”), licensed prostitution (“the Dutch model”), and criminalization of johns (“the Swedish model”) – fail to accomplish this goal, we show that there exists an alternative regulatory model that does. Political support for regulation hinges on the level of gender income inequality.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J49|Inter-industrial Relations and Sectoral Employment Development in German Regions|This paper analyses the impact of cluster structures on employment development in Germany according to the hypothesis of Porter (1998). It develops a new way of measuring the co-location of suppliers and buyers of intermediate goods in a region based on an input-output approach. The resulting indicator is implemented in a shift-share regression in order to analyse the importance of input-output linkages for the employment development in individual industries. One advantage of this approach is that the results can be compared to earlier studies on localization advantages according to Marshall (1890).
J49|How does Bid Visibility Matter in Buyer-Determined Auctions? Comparing Open and Sealed Bid Auctions in Online Labor Markets| Online labor markets are platforms that facilitate Buyer-Determined (BD) auctions in which buyers can identify and hire service providers who bid to offer IT services. We examine the effect of bid visibility (i.e., open bid versus sealed bid) on the biddersâ€™ entry strategies (number of bids and quality of bids) and auction performance (buyer surplus, contract probability, and buyer satisfaction). We first theoretically analyze equilibrium bidder entry, and we derive hypotheses on the effect of open bid versus sealed bid on bidder strategic entry and auction performance. Using a proprietary large-scale dataset that allows us to observe 1,816,886 bids from 106,147 open bid and 9,950 sealed bid auctions posted on Freelancer.com by 41,530 unique buyers, we find that, while sealed bid BD auctions receive more bids, open bid BD auctions consistently outperform sealed bid BD auctions in terms of the quality of bids and auction performance. Specifically, compared with sealed bid BD auctions, while open bid BD auctions attract 8.1% fewer bids, they receive 3.59% more bids from experienced service providers, they are 50% more likely to get contracted, and they result in at least 19% more in buyerâ€™s surplus. These findings are robust to different econometric specifications and propensity score matching estimators. Our study suggests that empirically, BD auctions do not exhibit revenue equivalence across auction designs, as predicted in the literature. The performance difference is attributed to the â€œscreening effectâ€ of open bid BD auctions that helps filter out low quality, inexperienced, bidders. Notably, the additional bids in sealed bid BD auctions result from the lack of pre-evaluation self-screening, and they are thus unusable, if not harmful, to auction performance by increasing buyersâ€™ bid evaluation costs. Contrary to conventional wisdom and industry practice that expect â€œthe more bids, the betterâ€ , which favors sealed bid BD auctions, our results demonstrate that fewer bids (albeit of higher quality), and thus open bid BD auctions, are a preferred option for online labor markets.
J49|Racial Position Segregation in Intercollegiate Football: Do Players become more Racially Segregated as they Transition from High School to College?|This study revisits the issue of racial position segregation or racial “stacking” in intercollegiate football. Estimating a probit model, we examine the impact that a player’s race has on the probability of him changing positions when he moves from high school to the collegiate ranks. Descriptive statistics of our data reveal significant evidence that racial position segregation is widespread in high school football. The data also offers much information about which players are likely to change positions and the positions that they are likely to switch to when transitioning from high school to college. Most notably, our probit results reveal that African American high school quarterbacks and white high school running backs are significantly more likely to change positions in college than their white and African American counterparts, respectively. Thus, while other positions do not appear to become more racially segregated as players transition from high school to college, the quarterback and running back positions do appear to become significantly more racially segregated.

J49|The value of life: Real risks and safety-related productivity in the Himalaya|This paper estimates the value of a statistical life from commercial Himalayan expeditions. Because deaths occur with a fair amount of regularity, fatality rates are calculated for each mountain trail and are, hence, disaggregated measures of risk. Also, since the marginal product of labor in the industry is (in part) the marginal product of safety, our revenue measures may account for unobserved safety-related productivity of guides. Guide safety is explicitly observed by market participants, and is reflected in higher wages for safer guides. Our VSL estimates are about $5M.
J49|Intimations of Keith Hart's 'Informal Economy' - In the Work of Henry Mayhew, P T Bauer and Richard Salisbury|This paper considers the idea of informality in market exchange, as introduced into the economic development literature by Keith Hart in the 1970s. In addition to Hart (1971, 1973) it will discuss three writers who may be considered his intellectual forerunners. Each, to a greater or less degree, anticipated the idea of informal economic activity and described it in a particular historical period and place. They are the mid-Victorian journalist Henry Mayhew (London, c.1850), the libertarian economist P. T. Bauer (British West Africa, c.1948) and the economic anthropologist R. F. Salisbury (colonial New Guinea, c.1952-1963). The principal texts relied upon are Mayhew's monumental London Labour and the London Poor (4 vols, 1851-61), Bauer's Economics of Under-Developed Countries (1957) and Salisbury's From Stone to Steel (1962) and Vunamami: Economic Transformation in a Traditional Society (1970).
J49|Health Behavior and Accident Risk: Obesity Is Associated with the Future Risk of Heavy Truck Crashes among Newly Recruited Commercial Drivers|This study estimates the dose-response relationship between Body Mass Index (BMI) and crash risk in commercial motor vehicle operators. Intake data was collected on 744 new truck drivers who were training for their commercial driver's licenses at a school operated by the cooperating trucking firm during the first two-week phase of instruction. Drivers were then followed prospectively on the job using the firm's operational data for two years, or until employment separation, whichever came first. Multivariate Poisson regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the relationship between crash risk and BMI, controlling for exposure using miles driven, trip segments, and job type. Results from the Poisson regression indicated that the risk ratio (RR) for all crashes was significantly higher for drivers in the obesity Class II and Class III categories: RR= 1.6, confidence interval 1.2-2.1 and RR= 1.49, confidence interval 1.12-1.99, respectively. Similarly, the multivariate Cox Proportional Hazard model results showed that crash risk was significantly higher for obesity class II (BMI 35 to 40; RR = 1.35, P =0.06) when compared to normal BMI (BMI 18.5 to
J49|Determinants of Domestic Workers' Employment: Evidence from Lebanese Household Survey Data|This paper provides new evidence on the determinants of domestic workers' employment using a unique micro-level dataset on Lebanese households drawn from the National Household Budget Survey (2005) conducted by Central Administration of Statistics (CAS). Controlling for household, household head, dwelling, and regional characteristics, we find that the probability of hiring a domestic worker is significantly higher for larger households, female headed households, larger dwellings, and increases with aggregate household consumption. Furthermore, regional differences are found to be highly significant where households located outside the capital city are less likely to retain a domestic worker. These insights can be potentially useful for policymakers in their effort to regulate the industry revolving around domestic work.
J49|Migration as a rural development strategy and the migrants involved : an account of a migrants' hometown in Sichuan, China|"This paper attempts to describe part of the history of Chinese rural migration to urban industrial areas. Using a case study of a township in Sichuan, the author examines a type of rural development which she defines as a ""bottom-up"" style strategy of regional development. Different types of social mobility are observed in the case study, and over its long history, migration in the township has offered diverse means of social mobility to the local peasants. The paper concludes by considering the diversity and limits of Chinese social mobility at this stage."
J49|Patrones de victimizacion y criminalidad en la Zona Metropolitana de Guadalajara, 2009|El propOsito de este trabajo es presentar las estadIsticas descriptivas del proyecto “Victimizacion y violencia en el Area metropolitana de Guadalajara”. Los delitos incluidos en la investigacion son: robo a casa habitacion, robo parcial o total de vehiculo, asalto, ataque, amenaza, fraude, extorsion, secuestro y acoso o delitos sexuales. Entre los datos mas relevantes podemos mencionar los siguientes: 22% de los encuestados sufrio algun tipo de delito, 28% de los hogares sufrio delito. En cuanto a delitos con mayor incidencia estan robo a casa habitacion 15%, robo a vehiculo 14% y robo o asalto 31%. El estudio tambien incluye informacion relativa a la percepcion de la inseguridad, de la cual podemos mencionar que solo 51% de las familias se siente segura. Pero si consideramos las familias que sufrieron algun delito, tal cifra se reduce significativamente a 37%, mientras que aquellas que no sufrieron algun delito el porcentaje se eleva al 54%.
J49|台灣公私部門薪資差異問題之研究|「公部門薪資是否過高」，一直是民眾關心的議題，尤其，前(2010)年當考試院院長關中先生的「公務人員跟一般人民不同，並且薪水低，需要保障」、「公務員錄取率只有3%，不是每個人都能當公務員」等言論一出，甚至引發不少民眾對此議題的爭論。為探討該議題，本研究計畫首先採用Oaxaca的工資差異拆解式，估計台灣公部門相對於私部門是否存在「不可解釋的工資溢價」的問題？其次，估計公、私部門「雇主與從業員工的市場訊息」。估計結果主要如下：(1) 即使公部門的從業員工與私部門的從業員工都具有相同的人力資本或生產力，公部門員工除了能賺取到一筆與私部門員工相同的「正常工資」之外，還能額外溢領到一筆「超額工資」或「經濟租」，因而，依據Olsen的「競租理論」，會進一步引發「競租」活動。(2) 公部門內無論雇主或受雇者對於市場工資率的「訊息欠缺」，都顯著低於私部門；而且，無論是公部門或私部門，雇主與受雇者的這種訊息欠缺問題，都會隨著雇用期間或工作年資的增長而獲得改善。 其次，本研究計畫根據公共經濟文獻上的論點，以及Roy (1951)和Willis and Rosen (1979)的「自我選擇」或「樣本選擇性誤差」，提出「公私部門薪資差異」形成的可能原因，主要有四：(1) 公部門使用的勞動不但須創造一般經濟學上所稱的「邊際產品收益」，且須創造公共經濟學所稱的「邊際產品選票」，其中後者是私部門勞工所不需要創造出來的產值。(2) 在「政府官員追求預算極大化」的前提下，政府官員在提供某一最低水準的勞務時，往往設法將該勞務水準送交到立法機構的預算案極大化。(3) 若公、私工作部門的工作能力呈正相關，但具有前者工作能力的離散度高於具有後者工作能力的離散度，則根據「相對利益」理論，或「超級明星效果」與「任何人都能做的效果」，我們所能觀察到的樣本將顯示，公部門的平均工資顯著高於私部門。(4) 假若公、私工作部門的工作能力呈負相關，且這兩種工作能力之群體的統計分配離散度相近，則根據「絕對利益」理論，我們所能觀察到的樣本將顯示，公部門的平均工資與私部門相近。
J49|Inter-industrial relations and sectoral employment development in German regions|This paper aims to find evidence for the positive impact of cluster structures on employment development in Germany. It develops a new way of measuring the co-location of suppliers and buyers of intermediate goods in a region as well as the importance for the employment development in individual industries. The findings indicate that co-location of inter-connected industries did have a positive effect on employment growth in 16 out of 56 industries between 1998 and 2007 supporting the assumption that agglomeration advantages tend to occur within regional clusters rather than within single industries. However, for the majority of industries such advantages cannot be identified.
J49|Environmental innovation and employment dynamics in different technology fields: An analysis based on the German community innovation survey 2009|The employment effects of environmental technologies are in the focus of politicians but there are only few studies analyzing these effects for different environmental innovation fields. We use the 2009 wave of the German part of the Community Innovation Panel (CIS) allowing for such an analysis at the firm level. The main focus of the paper lies on the analysis of the adaptation behavior of firms with respect to the relationship of employment and (environmental) innovation. We use an endogenous switching regression approach to take the simultaneous haracter of innovation activities and employment demand into consideration. Our econometric analysis shows that innovative firms in general are characterized by a significantly more dynamic employment development. Especially the realization of environmental process innovations leads to a higher employment within the firm. The theoretical background of this finding is that process innovation induced cost savings improve the competitiveness of firms. This has a positive effect on demand and thus also increases employment. A more detailed analysis by different environmental innovation fields shows that material and energy savings are positively correlated to employment because they especially help to increase the profitability and competitiveness of the firm. On the other side, air and water process innovations that are still dominated by end-of-pipe technologies have a negative impact on the employment development.
J49|Regional wage differentials in Portugal: Static and dynamic approaches|This work aims at studying regional wage differentials both in a static and in a dynamic perspective. Previous studies have typically studied this issue using the Blinder and Oaxaca static decomposition. This approach does not provide clear information about the sources explaining the change in regional wage differentials along the years. To overcome this problem this study also uses Junh, Murphy and Pierce (1991,1993) decomposition. We analyse the case of Portugal for 1995 and 2002. Our results show that, although there are small changes in the interregional wage inequality, particularly between the region of Lisboa and the other regions, there are important and counteracting factors shaping this outcome. In fact, Lisboa has reinforced its position as the region with more qualified workers, but the gap in unobserved characteristics has decreased.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

El ejercicio muestra que los mayores desarrollos teóricos y empíricos se concentran en el estudio de la relación entre el trabajo de los menores y las variables de capital humano, en especial, la educación y la salud; relaciones complejas debido a que no existe una contundente evidencia de los efectos negativos del trabajo de los niños sobre estas variables. El documento destaca que con los desarrollos más recientes de la literatura se han desvirtuado hipótesis como el ""luxury axiom"", que atribuye el problema a la pobreza, y aparecen enfoques más amplios que incluyen los efectos de los mercados imperfectos, las migraciones y los programas de transferencias sobre el fenómeno de estudio."
J49|The socio-economic determinants of terrorism and political violence in Western Europe (1994–2007)|The main objective of this paper is to empirically investigate the socio-economic causes of terrorism and political violence in a sample of 12 countries in Western Europe. First, we show that in western European countries the classical economic argument of opportunity cost is confirmed. That is, the larger is the set of current economic opportunities for individuals the lower is the likelihood or the willingness for them to be involved in a terrorist activity. Second, expected future economic growth seems to be associated with an increase in current terrorist activities. Eventually, our results also show that terrorist brutality (measured in people killed) is positively associated with real GDP per capita.
J49|¿Quiénes son los NiNis en México?|The objetive of this article is to characterize the population between 15 and 29 years old who does not attend school and does not work (NiNi, as they are know in Mexico). We used data from the 1990, 2000 and 2010 Cesuses of Population, the 1992-2010 Income and Expenditure Surveys and the 2005-2010 National Labor Surveys in Mexico. We find that the porportion of NiNis in the population has decreased between 1990 and 2010. However, there are important differences between males and females for the last decade. We find that after the 2008 global recession there is an increase in the male NiNi proportion. The percetage of female NiNis decreased during the entire period, mostly due to a higher female labor force participation and an increase in school attendance. We find that in 2010 there were 8.6 million NiNis nationally (28.9% of the population in the age group), 2.05 million of which are men and 6.54 million are women. Finally we find evidence that the probability of being a NiNi is mostly related to educational attainment and income in the household for males; and for females it is mostly correlated with their decision to do domestic work.
J49|Parents jobs in Australia: work hours polarisation and the consequences of job quality and gender equality| This paper documents the gendered polarisation of work hours between mothers and fathers in Australia. Drawing on a large Australian sample of employee parents, we investigate the links between job quality and employment contract. Our focus is on mothers and fathers of young children – families facing high care demands – and investigate whether shorter and longer hour jobs carry the same contract and quality costs. Using a truncated measure of job quality, we find for both mothers and fathers that moderate full time hour jobs were the jobs with optimal quality and stable employment contracts. Poor job quality and casual contracts were common in very short hour jobs, usually worked by mothers. At the other end of the work hour spectrum, the very long hour jobs predominantly worked by fathers also showed a dip in job quality. Our study suggests that the gendered polarisation of hours in the Australian labour market, supported by a one-and-a-half earner family strategy, undermines parents’, particularly mothers’, access to good quality jobs. It also reinforces gender inequality by making it harder for fathers to fully engage in parenting and mothers to fully participate in employment and earn a decent income, with consequent hardship in later life.
J49|Influences on Indigenous Labour Market Outcomes|This staff working paper (by Savvas, Boulton, and Jepson) examines factors that potentially influence Indigenous labour market outcomes (LMOs). It uses regression analysis, and builds on the simple model that was presented in the ‘Overcoming Indigenous Disadvantage: Key Indicators (OID) 2011’, by including additional variables. The analysis uses the 2008 National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Survey (NATSISS), a rich source of information on the characteristics of Indigenous people, including data on LMOs and many factors that might contribute to them. The analysis does not make comparisons with non-Indigenous Australians. Empirical analysis can be used to test and quantify relationships that have been developed in theory. For example, policy makers might be interested in those factors that have the greatest association with Indigenous people’s decisions to participate in the labour market and their success in obtaining a job. The purpose of this analysis is to quantify those associations. The aim is to add variables that represent social and cultural factors to the basic model in the 2011 OID Report to obtain insight into the effects of unobserved personal characteristics, and whether the way Indigenous people engage with their community and culture affects their LMOs. The views expressed in this paper are those of the staff involved and do not necessarily reflect those of the Productivity Commission.
J49|Education Signalling and the School-to-work Transition|This paper studies the relation between labour market institutions and educational systems and how this relation may affect youth unemployment rates. By constructing a signalling model in which education can be used as a signal of workers’ unobserved productivity and firms face firing costs, we investigate how the structure of the educational system and the labour market institutions may influence the school-to-work transition of young unexperienced workers. In particular, we find that different educational systems can lead to different youth unemployment rates, even for high-skilled individuals. Besides, the framework presented in this paper allows to understand how the existence of minimum wages affects individual’s education decision and helps to explain some of the observed empirical regularities.
J49|The Dynamics of Job Creation and Job Destruction: Is Sub-Saharan Africa Different?|This paper analyzes the creation, destruction and reallocation of jobs in order to understand the micro-dynamics of aggregate employment change in African manufacturing. The nature and magnitude of gross job flows are examined using a unique panel data of Ethiopian manufacturing establishments over the period 1996-2007. We also assess the relative importance of firm demographics, industry effects and business cycles for job flows. The rates and patterns of job creation and destruction in our sample are comparable to the findings from developed and emerging economies suggesting that African firms adjust their labor force in a manner broadly similar to firms elsewhere and that African labor markets are not uniquely restrictive in terms of undermining job reallocation across firms. We also find, as in many other countries, that job reallocation is relatively higher in industries dominated by smaller and younger establishments. However, unlike other regions, job reallocation in our sample is pro-cyclical and its variation across industries bears little similarity to the patterns found in other developed and emerging economies. Small firms in Africa create jobs mainly at the point of market-entry and play a limited role in terms of contributing to manufacturing employment through post-entry expansion.
J49|The Impact of Innovation Activities on Employment in the Environmental Sector – Empirical Results for Germany at the Firm Level|The paper explores employment effects of environmental product innovations at the firm level. Whereas there are many studies analysing this relationship for general innovations, studies for the environmental sector are still rare.On the background of high political attention connected with hopeful employment perspectives, a separate analysis of this sector in comparison to other, non-environmental fields seems to be very important.
J49|Evidence on women trafficked for sexual exploitation: A rights based analysis|The aim of this paper is to investigate which factors influence the pattern of enforcement (violation) of basic rights among women trafficked for sexual exploitation. A conceptual frameworkis adopted where the degree of agency and the possibility to influence the terms of sex-based transactions are seen as conditional on the enforcement of some basic rights. Using IOM data on women assisted in exiting from trafficking for sexual exploitation, we investigate the enforcement (violation) of five uncompromisable rights, namely the right to physical integrity, to move freely, to have access to medical care, to use condoms, and to exercise choice over sexual services. By combining classification trees analysis and ordered probit estimation we find that working location and country of work are the main determinants of rights enforcement, while individual and family characteristics play a marginal role. Specifically, we find that (i) in lower market segments working on the street is comparatively less ‘at risk’ of rights violation; (ii) there is no consistently ‘good’ or ‘bad’ country of work, but public awareness on trafficking within the country is important; (iii) the strength of organized crime in the country of work matters only in conjunction with other local factors, and (iv) being trafficked within one’s country, as opposed to being trafficked internationally, is associated with higher risk of rights violation<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

J49|Is Nonfarm Diversification a Way Out of Poverty for Rural Households? Evidence from Vietnam in 1993-2006|school. Using the four high quality household living standards surveys available to date this paper reveals that Vietnam’s rural labour force has been markedly diversifying toward nonfarm activities in the doi moi (renovation) reform period. The employment share of the rural nonfarm sector has increased from 23 percent to 58 percent between the years 1993 and 2006. At the individual level, the results indicate that participation in the rural nonfarm sector is determined by a set of individual-, household-, and community-level characteristics. Gender, ethnicity, and education are reported as main individual-level drivers of nonfarm diversification. Lands as most important physical assets of rural households are found to be negative to nonfarm employment. It is also evident that both physical and institutional infrastructure exert important influences on individual participation in the nonfarm sector. At the household level, a combination of parametric and semi-parametric analysis is adopted to examine whether nonfarm diversification is a poverty exit path for rural households. This paper demonstrates a positive effect of nonfarm diversification on household welfare and this effect is robust to different estimation techniques, measures of nonfarm diversification, and the usage of equivalent scales. However, the poor is reported to benefit less than the non-poor from nonfarm activities. Though promoting a buoyant nonfarm sector is crucial for rural development and poverty reduction, it needs to be associated with enhancing access to nonfarm opportunities for the poor.
J49|The effects of globalization on child labor in developing countries|This paper inquires the effects of globalization on child labor in developing countries via cross-country analysis by decomposing globalization to its components; foreign direct investment (FDI) and trade. The findings reveal that the relationship between the child labor supply and gross domestic product per capita (PCGDP) can be expressed as a U shape. The study indicates that the child labor increases in the developing countries whose PCGDP levels are above $7500 since the net effect of globalization is positive for the positive substitution effect is bigger than the negative income effect. Data have been collected from UNICEF and World Bank.
J49|Impacts of the current economic crisis on Southeast Asian labour markets|Southeast Asian labour markets are characterized by the diversity of the countries of which they are part and by the historical antecedents of colonialism that have largely given them their nature. Most have adopted a form of the export-oriented, import-substituting low labour cost manufacturing paradigm of economic development known as the East Asian Economic Model (EAEM). Having already passed through the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997 and its disruptive effects, workers in the region are facing a different set of challenges as a result of the present ongoing crisis: these include structural changes to the EAEM and the possibility of public unrest in the continuing absence of genuine democratization across most of the region. These factors add some distinctive features to regional labour markets which, nevertheless, consist of people with the same aspirations and desires as those of workers throughout the world.
J49|Labour Market Structure: A Brief Literature Survey|Labour market is a multi-dimensional entity, with inexorable institutional affiliation. Therefore, the studies on labour market fail to evolve a logical framework to its structure with satisfactory consensus to the theoreticians in totality. It is very interesting to examine the various dimensions of labour market. This paper reviews certain research contributions on labour market structure, segmentation and vulnerability issues.
J49|O potencial criador de emprego e renda do turismo no Brasil<BR>[The potential to create employment and income from tourism in Brazil]|The main objective of this paper is to asses the tourism activity in Brazil, and examine, particularly, its capacity to generate employment. To this aim an input output matrix, that considers the tourism as a set of sectors of the economy, was computed for the year 2006. This matrix made it possible to examine the main relationships between tourism and the rest of the economy. Forward linkages and backward linkages of the tourism sector were computed. In addition, the effects of the development of the tourism sector on income and employment were analyzed and compared in this respect with the average of the Brazilian economy.
J49|The Dispossessed: A Labor-Market Analysis of Extreme Political Violence|Highly-educated individuals are over-represented among violent operatives of insurgent organizations in the Middle East. This suggests four inter-related questions: (1) Why do those who seem to have good prospects willingly endanger their own lives? (2) What incentives drive these highly educated individuals to terrorist organizations in particular? (3) Why do sub-state welfare organizations turn violent? (4) Why do these organizations send so many highly educated, thoroughly dedicated members to their deaths instead of employing them in some other way? We answer these questions using a multidisciplinary approach, organized in a supply-demand framework, to study the market for violent operatives. We show how the conditions of a failing state give extra salience to personal significance for highly educated but dispossessed individuals and raise their value as violent operatives, creating gains from trade between them and the leaders of extremist organizations.
J49|Polish Households' Behavior in the Regular and Informal Economies|This paper analyzes characteristics of the informal economy in Poland in the context of transition, using a specific survey carried out in the framework of the classic Labor Force Survey, conducted by the Polish National Statistical office (gus), in 1995. The participation probabilities of three types of informal activities (working, buying and hiring) are discussed. Their interdependencies are analyzed in the light of the hypothesis of network or neighborhood effects. The impact of a household’s participation in informal markets on its regular consumption is estimated by imputing the probability of its informal activity in the consumption surveys and panels. Such participation does significantly influence more than half of household’s expenditure on goods and services. Moreover, the participants of the informal economy distinguish themselves by higher individual full prices (integrating both monetary and non-monetary constraints and resources).
J49|Erwerbstätige mit Nebentätigkeiten in Deutschland und in Europa|In den meisten europäischen Ländern sind Erwerbstätige mit einer Nebentätigkeit häufiger als in Deutschland zu finden. Allerdings ist hierzulande die Zahl der Personen mit mehreren Beschäftigungsverhältnissen in den letzten Jahren weit über dem europäischen Durchschnitt gewachsen. Das Bild bei der mehrfachen Beschäftigung wird nicht etwa von Personen bestimmt, die in ihrem ersten Beschäftigungsverhältnis wegen der Ausübung nur einfacher Tätigkeiten geringe Einkommen erzielen, die sie mit einem Zweitjob aufbessern müssen. Sie sind nach den Ergebnissen des Mikrozensus unter den Zweitjobbern relativ wenig zu finden. Viel häufiger gehen solche Personen einer zweiten Erwerbstätigkeit nach, die in ihrem ersten Job einen anspruchsvollen Beruf ausüben; nicht selten handelt es sich dabei um Akademiker. Das ist in den anderen europäischen Ländern meist ebenso. Zwar lässt sich feststellen, dass bei einer Reihe von Beschäftigten die Nebentätigkeiten geringere berufliche Anforderungen als der Hauptberuf stellen und dass im Zeitverlauf die Zahl der Personen mit einfachen Nebentätigkeiten in überdurchschnittlichem Maße zugenommen hat. Sie sind aber in der Minderheit. Werden die geleisteten Wochenstunden aus Haupt- und Nebenjob zusammengenommen, sind es vor allem die gut Qualifizierten, die auf lange Arbeitszeiten kommen. Mehrfachbeschäftigungen sind also eher eine Sache der Mittelschicht.
J49|Employment, Mental Health and Economic Rationality at An Age of Neo-Liberal Globalisation|The present study examines the place of the mental health sufferers within the current labour market, with particular emphasis on the economic and social prospects sufferers from mental disorders may have, as well as on the concrete possibilities for their integration in the labour market. The study's central question is the following: are there any real prospects for integration of mental sufferers in a labour market dominated by conditions and practices of ruthless capitalism, or are we in a reality witnessing a renewed attempt at excluding mental sufferers from the social dynamic, given that the dominant economic reason requires the dependence of employability of a person on his/her cognitive skills and on his/her capacity to submit this mentality to the requirements of the prevailing market conditions? The study attempts to address these issues by questioning the recent Mental Reform Act promulgated in Greece. Our analysis of the Act is supplemented with a theoretical exploration of the relationship that exists between economic rationality and the psychological normality with a view of diagnosing the contribution of the former in the determination of the latter within the context of contemporary labour relations.
J49|An International Comparison of Small Business Employment|Contrary to popular perceptions, the United States has a much smaller small-business sector (as a share of total employment) than other countries at a comparable level of economic development, according to this new CEPR report. The authors observe that the undersized U.S. small business sector is consistent with the view that high health care costs discourage small business formation, since start-ups in other countries can tap into government-funded health care systems.
J49|Determining the Labour-Market Areas of Cyprus from the 2001 Commuting Flows|The article utilises the 2001 inter-municipal travel-to-work flows in Cyprus and for the first time delineates the country’s labour market areas (LMAs) on the basis of the 25% commuting threshold (the average used by EU member states in such studies). The findings suggest that the country consists of five economically integrated areas of over 40 thousand inhabitants as well as 26 somewhat isolated clusters of communities or individual communities that collectively host 14 thousand people (2% of the country’s population). Situated on mountainous terrain or along a meandering part of the buffer zone established in the wake of the 1974 Turkish invasion, most of these communities are incorporated into the main LMAs at the (lower) commuting threshold of 20%. The resulting spatial formations bear a rough resemblance to the country’s administrative districts. Overall, the findings enhance our understanding of how the country functions at the sub-national level, which, in turn, permits the formulation of better-targeted economic policy interventions.

Relying on Belgian input-output tables for the year 2000 and on detailed employment data (SAM sub ]matrix), we investigate the patterns of the employment in the environmental industry, by considering the worker types differentiated by gender, educational attainment or a combination of these characteristics. The employment multiplier analysis of environmental employment reveals some interesting differences between employment of the overall economy and environmental employment for the level of education as well as for the gender type.
J49|L'intérim : un secteur dual entre protection et précarité|This working paper analyses temporary agency work in France, focusing both on the regulatory framework of the sector, and on the characteristics of firms and employees. The growth of the sector over the last 15 years has favoured the concentration of the big firms, but the smallest agencies have not disappeared, which results in an increased segmentation. Such a characteristic can also be identified at the level of the workers' profiles: a segment of qualified and specialized temporary workers has emerged, but the large majority of agency workers remain in the industrial sector, where it is used as a flexibility tool. Globally temporary agency work remains characterized by low income (given discontinuities between the missions, or part time work), hard working conditions, and a limited access to training (with a majority of very short training sessions). However the analysis of some low wage sectors, like hotels and restaurants, or food industry, reveals that temporary agency work is challenged by other types of flexible contracts that offer a lower level of protection for workers

J49|Al Qaeda and Jihadist Terrorism in the Light of Contest Theory, Empirical Evidence for the period 2004-2008|This paper finds an empirical evidence that al Qaeda behaves as a contest organizer rewarding a prize to candidate extremist groups. Would-be terrorists must then compete with each other to prove their commitment and ability. Hence to maximize their own probability of winning the prize, each group (maximizes its effort). In particular, in the presence of costless information each candidate group can observe the results of attacks of other groups. Therefore, each group tries to make attacks at least equally destructive as the foregoing attacks. The testable implication is that: the number of victims of terrorist attacks is associated with the number of victims of past attacks. Resulting evidence confirms the hypothesis. However, results show that al Qaeda-style jihadist terrorist activity depends also upon grievance for poverty and socio-economic conditions.
J49|Los Pregraduados Trabajan. Análisis Del Grado De Inserción De Los Estudiantes De La Facultad De Ciencias Económicas De La Universidad Nacional De Loma|RESUMENEn este trabajo se presenta un análisis del grado de inserción de los estudiantes de la Facultad de Ciencias Económicas de la Universidad Nacional de Lomas de Zamora en el mercado laboral argentino entre los años 1999 y 2007, periodo en el cual se presenta una elevada proporción de estudiantes económicamente activos. Se encontró que los individuos ocupados trabajaban aproximadamente cuarenta horas semanales en promedio y se desempeñaron principalmente en los sectores comercio, servicios e industria; también hubo cierto nivel de trabajo no registrado así como de rotación de empleos. Existieron asimismo alumnos subocupados y sobreocupados. Los motivos por los cuales los estudiantes deseaban participar en el mercado laboral estuvieron relacionados principalmente con la voluntad de adquirir experiencia profesional así como con necesidades económicas. La tasa de desocupación fue siempre superior a la del mercado nacional, siendo el desempleo un fenómeno que afectó en mayor medida a las mujeres. Durante el período, el comportamiento de las tasas de ocupación y de desocupación tuvo su respectiva correspondencia con las fluctuaciones en el nivel de actividad económica con excepción del año 2006.ABSTRACTAn analysis of the participation in the argentine labor market of the Lomas de Zamora University´s students, degree in business and accountancy, is described in this paper for the 1999-2007 period. It came out from the research that a high percentage of these students worked or were looking for a job if they were unemployed. The students worked approximately forty hours a week in average, mainly in the following sectors: commerce, services and industry. Not registered employment and employment rotation were also observed. There was a group of students that worked unvoluntarily less than thirty five hours a week and another group that worked more than forty five hours. Due to different reasons, the students decided to participate in the labor market, specially because they wanted to acquire professional experience as well as they wanted to satisfy some economical needs. The unemployment rate was higher than that observed in the national labor market and female students were principally affected by unemployment. The employment and unemployment rates behaved accordingly to the fluctuation of the economical activity level except during 2006.
J49|Trabajando con mis padres: el efecto del mercado laboral adulto sobre el trabajo infantil en Colombia|El trabajo infantil puede ser una condición que atente contra la acumulación de capital humano, en la medida que impide el acceso efectivo a educación de calidad. Por otro lado, el trabajo infantil se puede dar como un mecanismo de suavización de ingresos frente a choques negativos a la oferta laboral del hogar, o como complemento de la oferta laboral adulta en el hogar. Este documento busca separar e identificar el efecto complementario y de sustitución entre el trabajo infantil y la oferta laboral adulta. Se encuentra que el trabajo infantil y el trabajo adulto son complementarios dentro del hogar, y que esta complementariedad es robusta ante distintas especificaciones. A su vez, esta complementariedad también se presenta cuando el trabajo de los niños no está directamente relacionado con los negocios del hogar.
J49|The Labor Market of Italian Politicians|Like voters (the represented), politicians (the representees) are the heart and soul of representative democracy. But isnt being a politician just like any other job? After we get past the rhetoric, is politics any different than other occupations? In the political sector, voters, parties and politicians represent the counterparts of consumers, firms and workers/managers in the market sector. In fact, the analogy is much deeper than it may appear at first sight. In the market sector, consumers determine to a large extent the success of a firm and ultimately the managements fate. However, managers are chosen by the firms, which typically have an objective that is different from those of consumers and managers. Likewise, while in all democratic systems the voters ultimately determine who is elected, it is typically the case that political parties nominate candidates for public office. Furthermore, the objectives of voters and parties with respect to the selection of candidates may differ, and are constrained by the career ambitions of individuals with political aspirations. But then, what really makes a career in the political sector different from a career in any other economic sector? There are at least three distinctive features that characterize the labor market in the political sector. First, politicians are typically under the spotlight, receiving the attention of the media and of a variety of citizens organizations. This makes politics a showcase, where politicians in office can display their political skills, while it might be more difficult for individuals working in the market sector to reveal their market ability. Second, inter-party competition for potential politicians is likely to be of secondary importance, as ideological preferences are more likely to attract individuals toward specific parties at the beginning of their political careers. Third, it is often the case that political parties take care of their losers by reserving partys positions to defea<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J49|Investigating the drugs-crime channel in economics of crime models: Empirical evidence from panel data of the German States|The rising trends both in drug addiction and crime rates are of major public concern in Germany. Surprisingly, the economic theory of crime seems to ignore the drugs-crime nexus, whereas the criminological literature considers illicit drug use a main reason of criminal activities. This paper provides an econometric assessment of the drugs-crime channel within a Becker-Ehrlich model of crime supply. Estimation with panel data from the German states allows us to take into account further factors that might influence both drug abuse and crime. The results indicate that drug offences have a significant impact, in particular on property crimes. We attribute this to a strong economic-related channel of drug abuse on crime.
J49|The impact of innovation activities on employment in the environmental sector : empirical results for Germany at the firm level|"""The paper explores employment effects of environmental product innovations at the firm level. The empirical analysis is based on the establishment panel of the Institute for Employment Research (Nuremberg). A descriptive analysis shows that more than 50% of the firms in the environmental sector developed new products or improved existing products or services. The most dynamic environmental fields were analytics, consulting, measurement technology, waste disposal and recycling. A firm specialised in environmental research and development seems to have the best employment perspectives in the short and in the long run. Our econometric analysis had to address a simultaneity problem because the decision of a firm on the realisation of innovations and on the enlargement or reduction of employment is mutually dependant. Therefore, we apply a bivariate probit model that allows estimating the two variables simultaneously. The econometric results show that the influence of environmental innovation activities on the employment development is significantly positive. Furthermore, the quantitative importance of the new products with regard to the whole turnover of the firm is also important for employment growth. Within the bivariate probit model, the determinants of environmental innovation activities are also explored. They may be interpreted as indirect influences on the employment development of the firm. The results show that the improvement of the innovative capacities by R&D and further education measures and the existence of a high qualified human capital are significantly important for the development of new products in the environmental sector. A good strategy to improve the innovativeness of a firm seems to be a diversification of environmental product lines offered by the firm."" (Author's abstract, IAB-Doku) ((en))"
J49|How Hurricanes Affect Employment and Wages in Local Labor Markets|This paper adopts a generalized-difference-in-difference (GDD) technique outlined in Ariel R. Belasen and Solomon W. Polachek (IZA Discussion Paper #2976) to examine the impact of hurricanes on the labor market. We find that earnings of the average worker in a Florida county rises over 4% within the first quarter of being hit by a major Category 4 or 5 hurricane relative to counties not hit, and rises about 1¼% for workers in Florida counties hit by less major Category 1-3 hurricanes. Concomitantly, employment falls between 1½ and 5% depending on hurricane strength. On the other hand, the effects of hurricanes on neighboring counties have the opposite effects, moving earnings down between 3 and 4% in the quarter the hurricane struck. To better examine the specific shocks, we also observe sectoral employment shifts. Finally, we conduct a time-series analysis and find that over time, there is somewhat of a cobweb with earnings and employment rising and falling each quarter over a two-year time period.
J49|Why football players may benefit from the ‘shadow of the transfer system’|The transfer system imposed by the football governing bodies on employment relations made sure that a player could not leave his current club and sign with another club without the current club's explicit consent. The 1995 Bosman judgement of the European Court of Justice declaring football players to free agents after expiration of their contracts and the 2001 intervention of the European Commission, which, among other things, limited contract durations in football, can be interpreted as the two major steps towards restricting the application of the transfer system. Based on a bargaining model with stochastic player productivity, we show that less restrictive transfer rules reallocate ex post bargaining power from players to clubs. This reallocation is efficient and in the ex ante self-interest of players. The right to charge transfer fees enables clubs to insure their players. The players, in turn, benefit by converting risky future income into riskless current income. Overall, player utility is higher under more than under less restrictive transfer rules.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

As a result, while individual careers within the political sector are inevitably linked to the opportunities available within parties, the extent to which individual endowments of political and market skills are correlated, or experience in the political (market) sector is also valuable in the market (political) sector, links the labor markets of the two sectors. This link affects the selection of politicians, the politicians careers, and the relationship between parties and voters.
J49|Analysis Of Invisible Child Labour In Hayatabad, Peshawar|This study was undertaken in Hayatabad Town, Peshawar. The study investigates socio-economic factors affecting invisible child labour. The study was based on a sample of 95 households and the data were collected in July 2006. The study found that although the wages of working children were small but they contributed significantly to their households’ income. More than half of the working children were not satisfied with their present job and their employers and more than half of working children reported that their employers were harsh with them. The regression results showed that household income, landholdings and parents’ education were significant determinants of invisible child labour in the study area.
J49|Workplace Flexibility and Institutions in Europe. A Tale of Two Countries|This paper studies the determinants of the joint adoption of employment, wage and working time flexibility in workplaces, paying attention to the existence of complementarities. To better understand the role of country-specific institutional features, we compare the adoption of flexibility in Italy and Great Britain, two EU countries characterized by quite different product and labour market regulation. Empirical analysis based on establishment-level data shows that the probability of adopting any forms of flexibility is highly influenced by both firm characteristics and institutional variables, mainly by employment protection, union power and firm-level bargaining. Country-specific patterns also emerge: in Italy employment and wage flexibility are complement and they are both substitute for time flexibility; in Great Britain the flexibility mix is less clear cut. These results suggest that both policy makers and social partners should be aware that incentives or restrictions to specific forms of flexibility are likely to produce effects also on the use of other flexible work arrangements.
J49|Empresas de inserción y empresas sociales en Europa|This article reviews research on Work Integration Social Enterprises (WISE) and social enterprises in Europe and analyses the current situation. WISE present paradigmatic examples of social enterprises within the framework of the emergence of European perspectives on social entrepreneurship and the third sector. The hypothesis in question sees them as organizations whose management covers a variety of objectives, resources and stakeholders. Theoretical debates focus on issues such as their sustainability as hybrid organizations, innovation in governance, and their relationship with share capital. The study of WISE has evolved through the typological analysis of their empirical diversity and through the questioning of their role in labour markets, the status and rights of their beneficiaries, and their relationship with employment policies.
J49|El trabajo infanto-juvenil y el estado nutricional de los menores colombianos|Este trabajo estudia la relación entre el trabajo infanto-juvenil y el estado nutricional de los menores colombianos. Usando información de la Encuesta de Demografía y Salud (ENDS) 2005, se analiza el efecto del trabajo en la nutrición de los menores trabajadores entre 6 y 17 años. Se encuentra evidencia de que existe una relación positiva entre el trabajo y la nutrición de los menores, afectada en algunos casos por la asistencia escolar y por pertenecer al quintil más pobre de la población. Los resultados sugieren que el trabajo infanto-juvenil tiene un efecto positivo sobre la nutrición, a través de la generación directa de ingreso extra para el hogar, o al permitir que se libere mano de obra adulta de los trabajos del hogar. Respaldando la teoría y la evidencia empírica, las variables socio-económicas del hogar resultan estar fuertemente relacionadas con el estado nutricional de los menores
J49|How Disasters Affect Local Labor Markets: The Effects of Hurricanes in Florida|This study improves upon the Difference in Difference approach by examining exogenous shocks using a Generalized Difference in Difference (GDD) technique that identifies economic effects of hurricanes. Based on the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages data, worker earnings in Florida counties hit by a hurricane increase up to 4 percent, whereas earnings in neighboring counties decrease. Over time, workers experience faster earnings and slower employment growth than workers in unaffected counties. Hurricanes have a greater impact in coastal and Panhandle counties, and powerful hurricanes have greater economic effects than weaker ones. Further, the GDD technique is applicable to analyze a wider range of exogenous shocks than hurricanes.
J49|Trabajo infantil en los niños y jóvenes beneficiarios del programa familias en acción: Una evaluación de impacto|En este artículo se evalúa empíricamente el comportamiento de las familias beneficiarias del Programa Familias en Acción, frente a la decisión de enviar a sus hijos a estudiar o a trabajar y se examina si el Programa, además de su reconocido impacto sobre la asistencia escolar y la nutrición de los niños beneficiarios, tiene algún impacto sobre el trabajo infantil. Para tal efecto, se utiliza el método de pareamiento dirigido por probabilidad de similitud o propensity score matching, combinado con diferencias en diferencias. Se encuentra que el Programa tiene un efecto positivo, aunque pequeño, sobre los niños que permanecían inactivos (no estudian ni trabajan) y aumenta la tasa de asistencia de los niños trabajadores, a la vez que reduce la probabilidad de que las familias beneficiarias, ante crisis o eventos adversos, decidan enviar a sus hijos al mercado laboral.

J49|La Oferta De Servicios Del Sector Financiero Formal En Bogotá|Con base en la información utilizada para Bogotá a nivel de sector censal sobre el número de oficinas bancarias en cada uno de ellos, y después de controlar por diversas variables, se encuentra evidencia de que las entidades bancarias están sub-representadas en las áreas de la ciudad donde habitan los hogares de más bajos ingresos. En el caso de las entidades financieras cooperativas (EFC), una vez se controla por las variables mencionadas, no se puede rechazar la hipótesis de que sus sucursales se encuentran aleatoriamente distribuidas en relación a los ingresos de los hogares. Adicionalmente se encuentra que el número de sucursales bancarias por sector censal es creciente con la seguridad del sector, la infraestructura en salud y la presencia de centros religiosos y culturales, el porcentaje del sector ocupado por comercio o residencias. Por otro lado, es decreciente en el porcentaje del sector ocupado por la industria en el sector, la densidad de la población, y la tasa de desempleo. El estudio hace énfasis en el efecto multiplicador que tienen factores como la seguridad y la provisión de actividades y servicios básicos como la recreación y la salud. Estos resultados permiten priorizar acciones tendientes a incrementar los niveles de bancarización de los pobres en las principales ciudades Colombianas, y en ciudades similares de otros países de Latinoamérica y el Caribe.
J49|Measuring employment outcomes for Indigenous Australians|This paper presents the results of a logit estimation of employment probabilities for Australia’s Indigenous population using the 2002 National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Survey (NATSISS). The population is disaggregated by gender and geographic location and separate logit models are estimated for each group. The results indicate that there is substantial heterogeneity across these sub-groups and provide some evidence for incorporating this into employment models and policy outcomes. Further, the findings suggest that individuals located in urban centres will, in fact, be more employable than any other region conditional on their obtaining desired labour market characteristics.
J49|¿Cuánto es el premio al salario por pertenecer a un sindicato en el Ecuador?: Un análisis usando Propensity Score Matching<BR>[How much it is the prize to the wage to belong to a union in Ecuador?: An analysis using Propensity Score Matching]|In this paper it is wanted to respond the question how much is the prize in the wages of people that belong to an union or workers association in the Ecuador, so much in the public sector as private, with regard to those that don't belong, and observe if this differential is attributed to personal differences and of the work type, for the Ecuadorian case. For that we use a focus of matching statistical semi-parametric, well-known as propensity score matching to compare the results of the workers that belong to an union “matched” with the workers that don't belong to the same one to deduce the causal effect on the wages of the members union, finding prizes of 37% until 99% but, approximately. For this obtained secondary data of the survey of conditions of life carried out in the year 1998, belonging to the project LSMS that implement the World Bank.
J49|Where Are The Women? Gender, Labor, And Discourse In The Noida Export Processing Zone And Delhi| Export processing zones (EPZs) are like islands of globalization. Much of the literature on EPZs and export-oriented industries (EOIs) notes a preponderance of women who are constructed as “cheap,” “nimble fingered,” and “docile” labor. This literature is dominated by socialist feminist thinkers, and this paper argues that there is a need to incorporate the insights of postmodern feminist thinkers. The article focuses on the role that language, discourse, and subjectivity play in the gendering process in handmade jewelry production in the Noida Export Processing Zone (NEPZ) and in the ranch production units related by common ownership in Delhi, India. It thus gives “voices” to women and men, and brings out their agency in structuring the labor market. The study confirms that gender division of labor is a product of discursive and material practices that are reproduced through discourses into which different actors invest, and that feed into the gendered subjective identities of these actors.
J49|Introduction / The Status Of Women Economists In Us Universities And The World / The Status Of Women Economists In Uk Universities / The Status Of Women Economists In Canadian Universities / The Status Of Women Economists In China'S Universities| These Explorations, by eight authors from Canada, China, the US, and the UK, examine the current status of women in economics (with an eye mainly toward their status in the academic branch of the profession). The four sections of the work analyze results of surveys that show the distribution of academic positions among women economists in universities in Canada, the UK, the US, and China. The work also provides a short history of the development of committees and groups interested in furthering the status of women in the economics profession and suggests ways to improve the efforts of such groups and the status of women economists.
J49|How Does Product Market Competition Shape Incentive Contracts?| This paper studies the effect of product market competition on the explicit compensation packages that firms offer to their CEOs, executives and workers. We use a large sample of both traded and nontraded UK firms and exploit a quasi-natural experiment associated to an increase in competition. The sudden appreciation of the pound in 1996 implied different changes in competition for sectors with different degrees of openness. Our difference in differences estimates show that a higher level of product market competition increases the performance pay sensitivity of compensation schemes, in particular for executives.

J49|Labor Market Regulations and Income Inequality: Evidence for a Panel of Countries|This paper presents evidence on the impact of labor regulations on income inequality using two recently published databases on labor institutions and outcomes (Rama and Artecona, 2002; Botero, Djankov, La Porta, López-de-Silanes and Shleifer, 2003) and different cross-section and panel data analysis techniques for a sample of 121 countries over the 1970-2000 period. When we consider the techniques most likely to be robust, we find that: (i) de jure regulations do not improve income distribution; (ii) relative compliance with existing regulations improves income distribution; (iii) de facto regulations are weakly associated with improving income inequality. This result partly reflects the fact that regulations are endogenous and, more interestingly, different regulations have quite distinct effects. In particular, we find that any redistributive effect of labor regulations may come from trade union membership, public employment and mandated benefits (proxied by maternity leave).<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

It closes by considering what needs to be done worldwide to improve the status and increase the participation of women in the economics profession.
J49|Temporary Jobs and the Exit to Open-Ended Jobs in the Swedish Labour Market|This paper analyses exit probabilities from different types of temporary jobs to open-ended jobs in Sweden during 1991-1999. The main aim of the study is to illuminate how the exit probabilities, and their determinants, differ by type of temporary job. A second focus is how the exit probabilities differ depending on origin and gender, i.e. a segmentation aspect. The results show that the exit probabilities differ between different types of temporary jobs, and that variables that have been shown to affect the incidence of temporary jobs, also in many cases are significant determinants of the probability to leave (or not leave) a temporary job. Our results also show that all types of temporary jobs (but probation) on average perform rather poorly as stepping-stones into open-ended jobs. By calculating predicted exit probabilities we also show that there are differences between the genders, and also between native origins. The probability to exit to open-ended jobs are on average lower for females than for males, and they are also, on average, lower for foreign-born workers than for native Swedes.
