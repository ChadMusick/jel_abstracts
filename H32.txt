H32|Brexit and Uncertainty: Insights from the Decision Maker Panel|The UK's decision to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum created substantial uncertainty for UK businesses. The nature of this uncertainty is different from that of a typical uncertainty shock because of its length, breadth and political complexity. Consequently, a new firm‐level survey, the Decision Maker Panel (DMP), was created to investigate this, finding three key results. First, Brexit was reported to be one of the top three sources of uncertainty for around 40 per cent of UK businesses in the two years after the vote in the June 2016 referendum, and this proportion increased further in Autumn 2018. Hence, Brexit provided both a major and persistent uncertainty shock. Second, uncertainty has been higher in industries that are more dependent on trade with the EU and on EU migrant labour. Third, the uncertainties around Brexit are primarily about the impact on businesses over the longer term rather than shorter term, including uncertainty about the timing of any transition arrangements and around the nature of Brexit.
H32|The Impact of Brexit on UK Firms|We use a major new survey of UK firms, the Decision Maker Panel, to assess the impact of the June 2016 Brexit referendum. We identify three key results. First, the UK’s decision to leave the EU has generated a large, broad and long-lasting increase in uncertainty. Second, anticipation of Brexit is estimated to have gradually reduced investment by about 11% over the three years following the June 2016 vote. This fall in investment took longer to occur than predicted at the time of the referendum, suggesting that the size and persistence of this uncertainty may have delayed firms’ response to the Brexit vote. Finally, the Brexit process is estimated to have reduced UK productivity by between 2% and 5% over the three years after the referendum. Much of this drop is from negative within-firm effects, in part because firms are committing several hours per week of top-management time to Brexit planning. We also find evidence for smaller negative between-firm effects as more productive, internationally exposed, firms have been more negatively impacted than less productive domestic firms.
H32|Firm-Level Political Risk: Measurement and Effects|We adapt simple tools from computational linguistics to construct a new measure of political risk faced by individual US firms: the share of their quarterly earnings conference calls that they devote to political risks. We validate our measure by showing it correctly identifies calls containing extensive conversations on risks that are political in nature, that it varies intuitively over time and across sectors, and that it correlates with the firm’s actions and stock market volatility in a manner that is highly indicative of political risk. Firms exposed to political risk retrench hiring and investment and actively lobby and donate to politicians. These results continue to hold after controlling for news about the mean (as opposed to the variance) of political shocks. Interestingly, the vast majority of the variation in our measure is at the firm level rather than at the aggregate or sector level, in the sense that it is neither captured by the interaction of sector and time fixed effects, nor by heterogeneous exposure of individual firms to aggregate political risk. The dispersion of this firm-level political risk increases significantly at times with high aggregate political risk. Decomposing our measure of political risk by topic, we find that firms that devote more time to discussing risks associated with a given political topic tend to increase lobbying on that topic, but not on other topics, in the following quarter.
H32|Expected Effects of the US Tax Reform on Other Countries: Global and Local Survey Evidence|The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act constitutes the largest change to the US tax system since the 1980s and thoroughly alters the way in which multinational companies are taxed. Current assessments on the reform’s international impact vary widely. This article sheds light on the tax reform’s expected effects on other countries. We first use representative German business survey data to analyse the impact of the reform on German firms. Many firms with substantial US revenues or production capacities in the US intend to expand US investment in response to the reform, in particular large firms and manufacturing companies. The effects on investment in Germany are ambiguous: While some firms substitute between investment locations, others expand in both countries. We subsequently extend our analysis to the global level using worldwide survey data. The results suggest a negative impact on tax revenues and investment in countries with close economic ties to the US.
H32|Can Government Demand Stimulate Private Investment? Evidence from U.S. Federal Procurement|We study the effects of federal purchases on firms’ investment using a novel panel dataset that combines federal procurement contracts in the United States with key financial firm-level information. We find that 1 dollar of federal spending increases firms’ capital investment by 7 to 11 cents. The average effect masks heterogeneity: Effects are stronger for firms that face financing constraints and they are close to 0 for unconstrained firms. In line with the financial accelerator model, our findings indicate that the effect of government purchases works through easing firms’ access to external borrowing. Furthermore, industry-level analysis suggests that that the increase in investment at the firm level translates into an industry-wide effect without crowding-out capital investment of other firms in the same industry.
H32|The Risk of Policy Tipping and Stranded Carbon Assets|If global warming is to stay below 2°C, there are four risks of assets stranding. First, substantial fossil fuel reserves will be stranded at the end of the fossil era. Second, this will be true for exploration capital too. Third, unanticipated changes in present or expected future climate policy cause instantaneous discrete jumps in today’s valuation of physical and natural capital. Fourth, if timing and intensity of climate policy are uncertain, revaluation of assets occurs as uncertainty about future climate policy is resolved. E.g. abandoning climate policy plans immediately boosts scarcity rent, market capitalization, exploration investment and discoveries. To explain and quantify these four effects, we use an analytical model of investment in exploration capital with intertemporal adjustment costs, depletion of reserves and market capitalization, and calibrate it to the global oil and gas industry. Climate policy implements a carbon budget commensurate with 2°C peak warming and we allow for different instruments: immediate or delayed carbon taxes and renewable subsidies. The social welfare ranking of these instruments is inverse to that of the oil and gas industry which prefers renewable subsidy and delaying taxes for as long as possible. We also pay attention to how the legislative “risk” of tipping into policy action affects the timing of the end of the fossil era, the profitability of existing capital, and green paradox effects.
H32|Profit-Sharing Rules and the Taxation of Multinational Internet Platforms|This paper analyzes taxation of an Internet platform attracting users from different jurisdictions. When corporate income tax rates are different in the two jurisdictions, the platform distorts prices and outputs in order to shift profit to the low-tax country. We analyze the comparative statics effects of an increase in the tax rate of one country. When cross-effects are present in both countries, the platform has an incentive to increase the number of users in the high-tax country and decrease the number of users in the low-tax country. When externalities only flow from one market to another, an increase in the corporate tax rate results either in a decrease or an increase in the number of users in both countries depending on the direction of externalities. We compare the baseline regime of separate accounting (SA) with a regime of formula apportionment (FA), where the tax bill is apportioned in proportion to the number of users in the two countries. Under FA, an increase in the corporate tax rate increases the number of users in the low-tax country and decreases the number of users in the high-tax country. We use a numerical simulation to show that the high-tax country prefers SA to FA whereas the low-tax country prefers FA to SA.
H32|How Responsive are Firms to the Corporate Wealth Tax?|"The corporate wealth tax is commonly associated with a non-optimal policy in terms of fiscal revenue and efficiency. However, there is no empirical evidence regarding the behavioral response of firms to this tax. By using a bunching"" methodology, which takes advantage of the non-linearities introduced by the tax design in Colombia, this paper estimates the elasticity of corporate wealth with respect to the statutory tax rate. Results indicate that, in the years when the tax is in force, we observe between 23.8% and 35.7% more firms at the wealth cuto_s where the tax rate changes. This implies estimated elasticities of 0.250 and 0.296 for firms with wealth around 3 billion pesos, which points out negative and inelastic responses of firms' wealth when facing an increase in the statutory tax rate. Absent _scal externalities, the estimated elasticities are associated with a revenue loss and marginal deadweight loss of around 1% of fiscal revenue on the evaluated taxpayer firms."
H32|Impacto redistributivo de la tributación a los dividendos en Colombia|Colombia introdujo en 2017 un impuesto a los dividendos con una tarifa del 10% que se elevó al 15% a partir de 2019. Cuando se agoten las utilidades de las vigencias fiscales 2016 y anteriores, no sujetas al tributo, se espera que el impuesto recaude $1,2 billones, aproximadamente el 1% de los ingresos tributarios nacionales y 0,13% del PIB. Los contribuyentes del último decil de la renta asumen casi la totalidad del impuesto, pues en ese grupo se concentra el 94% de los dividendos. Su tarifa efectiva promedio pasa del 15,4% hasta el 17,1% con la aplicación del tributo. La tributación conjunta socio-sociedad se situaría en un intervalo comprendido entre 30% y 40,5% en 2022, explicado por la tarifa del 30% sobre la renta corporativa y del 15% sobre los dividendos. Sin embargo, los efectos redistributivos del impuesto a los dividendos son muy limitados, puesto que su tarifa es prácticamente única para cualquier nivel de renta y afecta tan solo a 158 mil personas, el 0,3% de la población colombiana o el 5% de las personas naturales que presentan declaración de renta. El índice de Gini no cambia cuando se introduce el impuesto a los dividendos. La desigualdad de la renta disponible de los contribuyentes pasa de 0,431 a 0,428. La progresividad del impuesto a los dividendos podría mejorar si el foco del impuesto sobre la renta se traslada al nivel individual y se gravan los dividendos con tarifas marginales crecientes. Sin embargo, esta ruta parece un poco riesgosa, porque requiere contar con una administración tributaria moderna, para afrontar de manera eficiente el control y servicio de millones de contribuyentes. Adicionalmente, la tarifa promedio que se aplica en la renta corporativa será del 30% a partir de 2022, mientras que en el nivel personal la tarifa nominal promedio apenas se acerca al 9%. Esta circunstancia eventualmente podría reducir la recaudación total del impuesto de renta. *** Colombia introduced a tax on dividends in 2017 with a tax rate of 10% that was raised to 15% starting in 2019. The profits of 2016 and previous fiscal periods, which are not covered by the dividend tax, will be gradually finished and then the dividend tax could raise COP$ 1.2 billion, approximately 1% of national tax revenues and 0.13% of GDP. Taxpayers located in the last decile of rent assume almost entire dividend tax, since in that group is concentrated 94% of dividends. Their effective average tax rate goes from 15.4% to 17.1%, as result of application of this tax. The partner-partnership joint taxation would be between 30% and 40.5% in 2022, explained by the tax rate of 30% on corporate income and 15% on dividends. However, the redistributive effects of dividend tax are very limited, because its tax rate is practically unique for any level of income and affects only 158 thousand people, 0.3% of Colombian population or 5% of personal income taxpayers who present an income tax statement. The Gini index does not change when dividend tax is introduced. The inequality of taxpayers' disposable income goes from 0.431 to 0.428. The progressivity of dividen tax could be improved if income tax focus is transferred to individual level and dividens are taxed with marginal tax rates are applied to the dividends. However, this route seems a little risky, because it requires a modern tax administration to efficiently face the control and service for millions of personal income taxpayers. Additionally, the average rate applied to corporate income will be 30% from 2022, while at the personal level the average nominal rate is only close to 9%. This circumstance could eventually reduce income tax overall collection.
H32|VAT Notches, Voluntary Registration, and Bunching: Theory and UK Evidence|Using administrative tax records for UK businesses, we document both bunching in annual turnover below the VAT registration threshold and persistent voluntary registration by almost half of the firms below the threshold. We develop a conceptual framework that can simultaneously explain these two apparently conflicting facts. The framework also predicts that higher intermediate input shares, lower product-market competition and a lower share of business to consumer (B2C) sales lead to voluntary registration. The predictions are exactly the opposite for bunching. We test the theory using linked VAT and corporation tax records from 2004-2014, finding empirical support for these predictions.
H32|Does Mandating Social Insurance Affect Entrepreneurial Activity?|This paper estimates the effect of relaxing the social insurance mandate on entrepreneurial activity. We use a unique discontinuity in Finland that allows certain entrepreneurs not to pay social insurance contributions on their income. Using rich administrative data, we find that relaxing the social insurance mandate leads entrepreneurs to significantly reduce their contributions, which they channel instead into their firms. While young firms use this windfall to increase business activity, older ones use it to improve their net lending position by purchasing stocks. Our results imply that the social insurance mandate is binding and its efficiency cost is heterogeneous.
H32|The Welfare Costs of Misaligned Incentives: Energy Inefficiency and the Principal-Agent Problem|In many settings, misaligned incentives and inadequate monitoring lead employees to take self-interested actions contrary to their employer's wishes, giving rise to the classic principal-agent problem. In this paper, I identify and quantify the costs of misaligned incentives in the context of an energy efficiency appliance replacement program. I show that contractors (agents) hired by the electric utility (the principal) increase their compensation by intentionally misreporting program data to deliberately authorize replacement of non-qualified refrigerators. I provide empirical estimates of the impacts of misaligned incentives on (1) the effectiveness of energy efficiency retrofits and (2) welfare. I estimate that unqualified replacements reduce welfare by an average of $106 and save only half as much electricity as replacements that follow program guidelines. The same program without a principal-agent distortion would increase welfare by $60 per replacement. The resul ts provide novel evidence of how principal-agent distortions in the implementation of a potentially beneficial program can undermine its value.
H32|The Economic Effects of Trade Policy Uncertainty|We study the effects of unexpected changes in trade policy uncertainty (TPU) on the U.S. economy. We construct three measures of TPU based on newspaper coverage, firms' earnings conference calls, and aggregate data on tari rates. We document that increases in TPU reduce investment and activity using both firm-level and aggregate macroeconomic data. We interpret the empirical results through the lens of a two-country general equilibrium model with nominal rigidities and firms' export participation decisions. In the model as in the data, news and increased uncertainty about higher future tariffs reduce investment and activity.
H32|Working Paper 04-19 - Tax incentives for business R&D in Belgium - Third evaluation|Belgium has committed to raise investment in research and development (R&D) to 3% of GDP by 2020. In fulfilment of this commitment, the federal government introduced different tax incentives in support of business R&D. This paper presents the results of the third evaluation of the efficiency of these tax incentives, covering the period 2003-2015.
H32|Intended and unintended effects of public incentives for innovation. Quasi-experimental evidence from Italy|This paper provides an extensive empirical evaluation of a policy introduced in Italy at the end of 2012 to incentivize young innovative start-up firms. Using a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) we estimate the causal effects of the policy on the firms’ share of intangible assets, turnover, number of employees, and number of partners. Our results indicate that two years after its implementation the policy was effective only in increasing the number of partners, thus attracting private investments, but failed, at least in the short run, in boosting innovation or increasing employment. It follows that the new investors generated by the policy might have been attracted only by the tax benefit and had little interest in innovation.
H32|Why the Norwegian Shareholder Income Tax is Neutral|This note extends the work by Sørensen (2005) and others by demonstrating why the Norwegian Shareholder Income Tax may be neutral between the two sources of equity funds, i.e. new share issues and retained earnings, despite the fact that the retention of earnings to finance new investment does not add to the tax benefits. The analysis crucially relies on the assumption that the deduction for the imputed rate of return is capitalized into the market prices of corporate shares. Absent capitalization, the shareholder tax is rather likely to leave the distortions caused by the double taxation of corporate source income unaffected.
H32|消費税における閾値と小規模企業の集積 : 2019年増税への展望|本稿は帝国データバンクの大規模データを用い消費税の免税点の影響を検証する。集積動機を明らかにするため、2014年の消費税増税を準実験の機会と捉え、集積推計法を用い企業度数分布の歪みを増税前後で比較する。分布が益税の増加に反応していないことから、事務負担回避が集積の理由だと示唆される。また、歪みが発生させる経済的損失を考察するため、集積行動の形態も検討する。間接的エビデンスは租税回避を示唆している。推計では、免税点は約5万7千社の行動を歪ませ、それに伴い毎年170億円規模の益税が発生している。, We examine the behavior of small firms near the exemption threshold under Japan's value-added tax (VAT). We employ Teikoku Data Bank's large-scale firm database and find visible bunching of firms just below the threshold of 10 million yen. To better understand the motive for bunching, we utilize the 2014 VAT hike as a quasi-experiment, since it increased the financial benefit of VAT exemption. Despite the increased financial incentive, the relative bunching mass remains unchanged, suggesting that the cost of complying with tax regulations motivates the bunching behavior. We also consider whether those bunching firms make real adjustments or conduct tax avoidance. We find indirect evidence favoring the tax-avoidance hypothesis. Our estimates suggest that the VAT threshold distorts the behavior of 57,000 firms, resulting in lost tax collection of 17 billion yen per annum. With Japan facing another round of VAT hike in October 2019, our research provides additional insights to inform the forthcoming policy change.
H32|Profit taxation and royalties: evidence from gold mines in Sub-Saharan Africa|In this paper, we analyze theoretically and empirically the effects of tax changes on firms’ profits in extractive industries. In the theoretical part, we assume a country that levies a profit tax and a royalty on the profits of extractive firms to maximize its tax revenues. The mining companies may reduce their taxable income by cost manipulation. By analyzing the optimal choice of the government and of the firms, we first establish the optimal tax policy and then we investigate the impact of the optimal fiscal policy on firms’ profits. In the empirical part of the paper, we estimate the effect of the profit tax and royalty on the extracting firms’ profit in African countries during the period spanning from 2007 to 2018. We use the Mining Intelligence database to constitute a panel of annual individual data on 363 gold mines located in 21 Sub-Saharan countries. We obtain an inverse relationship between the tax rate change of the two tax instruments and the profit of the firms.
H32|How Elastic is the Demand for Tax Havens? Evidence from the US Possessions Corporations Tax Credit|Why do some firms adopt certain tax havens, and how sensitive is the demand for tax havens? We address these questions by studying how the repeal of section 936 tax credits affected firms with affiliates in Puerto Rico. We first describe the characteristics of US multinationals that were exposed to section 936. We then show that the market value of exposed firms decreased after losing access to section 936, implying that firms could not perfectly substitute to other tax havens. Finally, we find that firms exposed to section 936 did not respond by expanding their network of tax havens.
H32|Tax Policy and Local Labor Market Behavior|Since 2002, the US government has encouraged business investment using accelerated depreciation policies that significantly reduce investment costs. We provide the first in-depth analysis of this stimulus on employment and earnings. Our local labor markets approach exploits cross-industry differences in policy generosity interacted with county-level variation in industry concentration. Places that experience larger decreases in investment costs see a level increase in employment that implies a $53,000 cost-per-job. We find no positive effects on average earnings. In contrast, we document a persistent growth in capital. These results imply a capital-labor substitution elasticity that grows over time and can exceed unity.
H32|Does Mandating Social Insurance Affect Entrepreneurial Activity?| This paper estimates the effect of relaxing the social insurance mandate on entrepreneurial activity using rich administrative data from Finland. We find that relaxing the social insurance mandate leads entrepreneurs to reduce their contributions by 16%, which they channel instead into their firms. While young firms use the saved cash to increase their sales by 11% and labor costs by 6%, older firms use it to improve their net lending position by purchasing stocks. Our results imply that the impact of the social insurance mandate on business activity is heterogeneous and depends on the age of the firm.
H32|Bunching of Small Businesses at the Value-AddedTax Threshold in Japan: Lessons for the 2019 Tax Hike|We examine the behavior of small firms near the exemption threshold under Japan's value-added tax (VAT). We employ Teikoku Data Bank's large-scale firm database and find visible bunching of firms just below the threshold of 10 million yen. To better understand the motive for bunching, we utilize the 2014 VAT hike as a quasi-experiment, since it increased the financial benefit of VAT exemption. Despite the increased financial incentive, the relative bunching mass remains unchanged, suggesting that the cost of complying with tax regulations motivates the bunching behavior. We also consider whether those bunching firms make real adjustments or conduct tax avoidance. We find indirect evidence favoring the tax-avoidance hypothesis. Our estimates suggest that the VAT threshold distorts the behavior of 57,000 firms, resulting in lost tax collection of 17 billion yen per annum. With Japan facing another round of VAT hike in October 2019, our research provides additional insights to inform the forthcoming policy change.
H32|Financial Stability: Does Social Activism Matter?|We investigate the impact of social activism on financial system stability. Financial stability was analysed from two complementary perspectives: bank-led financial stability and financial system stability driven by sector-wide credit supply. Social activism was analysed from three perspectives: gender equality advocacy, environmental sustainability advocacy, and social protection advocacy. The findings reveal that gender equality and environmental sustainability advocacy have significant positive effects for financial stability while social protection advocacy has a significant negative effect for financial stability. Also, social activism has negative effects for financial stability in the post-2008 financial crisis era. Finally, there are differential effects for country-groups, for instance, social activism strongly improves bank-led financial stability in African countries and for BLEND countries (countries that are eligible for IDA borrowing based on per capita income levels and are also creditworthy for some borrowing from the International Bank of Restructuring and Development (IBRD). The findings are relevant for the on-going debate about whether social inclusivity and activism has any economic value for the stability of businesses and the financial system. The findings have implications
H32|The Effect of Fiscal Incentives on Business R&D|This paper analyses the determinants of business R&D choices. In particular, it provides new empirical evidence on the effectiveness of fiscal policies aimed at driving companies to invest in R&D activity. By computing two very accurate proxies for firm-specific tax savings achievable when investing in R&D, and by exploiting exogenous changes in fiscal legislation in Italy, this study investigates if fiscal considerations affect companies’ choice to invest in R&D and how much to spend in such activity. The empirical analysis is based on an unbalanced panel data set composed of 163 Italian companies, covering the years 2004-2010. A two-step approach has been implemented, by combining a probit and a tobit estimation model. The results deliver strong empirical evidence that fiscal incentives significantly affect business R&D choices, by one side, increasing companies’ likelihood to invest in R&D, and, by the other, fostering companies’ R&D expenditure.
H32|Should There Be Lower Taxes on Patent Income?|A “patent box” is a term for the application of a lower corporate tax rate to the income derived from the ownership of patents. This tax subsidy instrument has been introduced in a number of countries since 2000. Using comprehensive data on patents filed at the European Patent Office, including information on ownership transfers pre- and post-grant, we investigate the impact of the introduction of a patent box on international patent transfers, on the choice of ownership location, and on invention in the relevant country. We find that the impact on transfers is small but present, especially when the tax instrument contains a development condition and for high value patents (those most likely to have generated income), but that invention itself is not affected. This calls into question whether the patent box is an effective instrument for encouraging innovation in a country, rather than simply facilitating the shifting of corporate income to low tax jurisdictions.
H32|Effects of higher required rates of return on the tax take in an oil province|For different reasons the oil companies might apply higher required rates of return than they did some years ago, and this will have consequences for investments and tax revenue in oil provinces. By applying various required rates of return as well as various oil prices, this study derives future Norwegian tax revenue during 2018-2050 by using a partial equilibrium model for the global oil market. The model explicitly accounts for reserves, development and production. Both investment in new reserves and production are profit driven. With rising required rates of return less of the high cost reserves become profitable to develop and investments decline. Because the government in practice carries a large fraction of the investments, less investment in a period increases the tax base and the tax income. The initial effect is offset by a subsequent reduction in production which has a negative effect on future taxes. The result is that increasing required rates of return will lead to small variations in net present value of total tax revenue. With lower oil prices, tax take increases significantly when required rates of return rise.
H32|Role of the Distribution Structure in Responsible Trade|Aware of the high importance of consumers' private information concerning their willingness-to-buy fair trade goods and taking into account the superior price they are willing to pay for this kind of goods with respect to conventional ones, we choose to feed the debate relative to the appropriateness of the different potential retailing channels. We use a common agency game framework to analyze the changes in the price level according various forms or distribution organization : direct competition between upstream producers or manufacturers (or cooperatives of producers / manufacturers), creation of a cooperative at the downstream stage, delivery of the final good to classical retailing networks. It appears that the private information parameter as well as the nature of the relationship between suppliers on the one hand and the retailer on the other hand are the key variables that determine the price paid by consumers. The conventional retailing channel brings excessively high prices with respect to a distribution made by an entity likely to be assimilated to a cooperative because of a double margin effect that is lessened in the cooperative case since the latter objective function involves additional elements such as providing services to upstream actors.
H32|Relevance of Potential Supply Structures in Frameworks involving Consumer's private Information: the Case of Fair Trade|Fair trade actors have to deal with a signicant degree of information asymmetry as regard their willingness-to-buy such goods and their willingness-to-pay for them. Many debates and controversies have paved the way for the development of fair trade, in particular concerning the distribution channel that had to be preferred. We use a common agency game framework to analyze the changes in the price level according various schemes of upstream-downstream organization and relationships. Both the private information parameter and the nature of the relationship between suppliers are the key variables that determine the price paid by consumers. If the choice of a dedicated structure does not appear relevant when costs or the number of competing producers are high, the framework of a sequential contracting process always results sub-optimal. What really matters is the nature of the firms involved and the convergence of interests. An equilibrium close to the socially optimal issue may emerge.
H32|Tax Elasticity Estimates for Capital Stocks|We use panel cointegration techniques to estimate the long-run user cost elasticity of capital (UCE) in a small open economy. The estimates exploit three sources of variation in Canadian tax policy: across provinces, industries, and years. The UCE is estimated to be between -1.1 and -1.3 for machinery and equipment. We also provide semi-elasticities of capital with respect to marginal effective tax rates (METR). Our construction of the user costs makes use of a detailed data set on federal and provincial tax policy variables.
H32|Leverage Dynamics: Do Financial Development and Government Leverage Matter? Evidence from a Major Developing Economy|This study analyses leverage dynamics of Turkish non-financial firms over the last 20 years using a confidential and unique firm-level dataset. Results of dynamic panel estimations reveal that financial development fosters corporate leverage while government indebtedness inhibits it. Both impacts are more pronounced for private firms rather than public firms. Besides, even though improvements in financial development foster long-term debt usage for both SMEs and large firms, this impact seems stronger for SMEs. Conspicuously, results reveal that SMEs suffer much more than large firms in crowding-out periods of government leverage while both SMEs and large firms benefit in crowding-in periods. Moreover, higher business risk hinders corporate leverage of private firms and SMEs, which is not the case for either large firms or public firms. Results are robust to alternative firm size classification schemes and alternative model specifications.
H32|Dutch Shell Companies and International Tax Planning|This paper uses the financial statements of special purpose entities (SPEs) for explaining the origin and destination of dividend, interest, and royalty flows passing the Netherlands. We find that Bermuda is the most important destination for royalty flows. These flows come from Ireland, Singapore and the United States. For dividend and interest payments the geographical pattern is more widespread. We find a substantial tax reduction for royalties by using Dutch SPEs compared to a direct flow between the origin and destination country. However, we cannot find such tax savings for dividends and interest with an approximation based on statutory tax rates. When controlling for country characteristics in our regression analysis we do find that tax differentials partially explain the geographical patterns of income flows diverted through the Netherlands. This is the case for the likelihood that a route is used, as well as for the size of the flows. This paper is one of the first using bilateral income flows as dependent variables instead of bilateral FDI stocks or flows.
H32|Exports and labor costs: evidence from a French policy|Abstract We investigate the role that labor costs hold in exporters’ performance. To do so, we exploit a large-scale French reform that granted most firms a tax credit proportional to the wagebill of their employees paid below a given threshold. This policy effectively translated into a cut in labor cost whose magnitude varies depending on firm-specific wage structures. We use the predicted treatment intensity based on pre-reform composition of the labor force as an instrument for the actual policy-induced firm-level change in labor costs. Although our point estimates are consistent with commonly estimated firm-level trade elasticities combined with reasonable labor shares in total costs, coefficients are found to be very noisy, suggesting lack of robust evidence of a causal effect of the policy. We discuss several potential explanations for our results as well as their implications.
H32|Social Networks and Tax Avoidance: Evidence from a Well-Defined Norwegian Tax Shelter|In 2005, over 8% of Norwegian shareholders transferred their shares to new (legal) tax shelters intended to defer taxation of capital gains and dividends that would otherwise be taxable in the aftermath of 2006 reform. Using detailed administrative data we identify family networks and describe how take up of tax avoidance progresses within a network. A feature of the reform was that the ability to set up a tax shelter changed discontinuously with individual shareholding of a firm and we use this fact to estimate the causal effect of availability of tax avoidance for a taxpayer on tax avoidance by others in the network. We find that take up in a social network increases the likelihood that others will take up. This suggests that taxpayers affect each other's decisions about tax avoidance, highlighting the importance of accounting for social interactions in understanding enforcement and tax avoidance behavior, and providing a concrete example of “optimization frictions” in the context of behavioral responses to taxation.
H32|Collusive Tax Evasion by Employers and Employees: Evidence from a Randomized Field Experiment in Norway|Third-party reporting and employers’ tax withholding are powerful compliance mechanisms, as long as the employer and employee do not collude to evade. Using data from randomly assigned on-site audits among 2,462 Norwegian firms, we provide evidence of collusive tax evasion. We find that firms assigned to be audited increased their subsequent wage reporting on behalf of their employees by 18 percent relative to firms assigned to the control group. The effect is more pronounced among small firms with few employees. Our results document the limitations of third-party reporting, but also that these limitations can be counteracted by relatively inexpensive on-site audits.
H32|How effective is an incremental ACE in addressing the debt bias? Evidence from corporate tax returns|The Allowance for Corporate Equity (ACE) introduced in Italy in 2011 has decreased the fiscal distortion between the costs of equity and debt by introducing the deductibility from taxable income of a notional return on capital increases. In this paper we estimate the impact of the ACE on the leverage ratio of Italian manufacturing firms. Using a novel instrumental variable approach to identify the causal effect, we find that the introduction of the incremental ACE has substantially reduced the leverage ratio of its beneficiaries. The effect of the reform increases with age and decreases with the size of the enterprise. These results suggest that an incremental ACE may be an effective policy tool to reduce the leverage ratio of European firms
H32|Tax Evasion and Financial Development under Asymmetric Information in Credit Markets|Recent empirical studies have documented that the incidence of firms' tax evasion on their sales is negatively correlated with the country's level of financial development. Our analysis shows that this stylized fact can be theoretically accounted for within a small-open-economy model of optimal tax enforcement under asymmetric information in credit markets. In an economy with a more developed financial sector that exhibits smaller agency costs, we find that the government will raise its optimal probability of tax auditing, which in turn leads to more tax compliance. It follows that financial development and tax evasion are inversely related, as observed in the actual data.

H32|La realizzazione del Piano di Investimenti per l'Europa|The Investment Plan for Europe - which is known as the Juncker Plan and is aimed at European economic recovery â€“ is estimated to provide a relatively large amount of financial resources for SMEs and different areas of public infrastructure. This estimate was based on a high value of the multiplier that was forecasted and applied to the guarantees of the approved projects. At the end of the first period (2015-2017), it was considered appropriate to review some of the international scientific literature on this Plan, in order to analyse if the results achieved up until that point coincide with its initial objectives. The main outcome of this analysis - in contrast to the success attributed to the Plan by the European Commission - is that verification is substantially unattainable, since even the quantitative results thus far disseminated for the Juncker Plan have been obtained by estimates, which have never been illustrated in a comprehensive manner.
H32|Informal sector innovation in Ghana: Data set and descriptive analysis|While informal enterprises and their activities dominate sub-Saharan African (SSA) economies, data on 'informal' innovation activities remain lacking. This paper presents descriptive statistics from survey data collected in 2016, on the types of innovations informal enterprises adopt and/or adapt in urban Ghana (Accra and Tema). Using zones defined in the Ghana Informal Enterprise Survey (GIFS) of the World Bank as area-based frame, and randomly selecting and canvassing 17 zones, the study identified and interviewed 513 informal enterprises. The analysis reveals that informal enterprises do innovate. Innovations, as found in formal enterprises as well, are not big swings, that is, not radical but incremental, and are found to occur over several years. These suggest that incremental innovations, notwithstanding, are important to the survival of sampled informal enterprises.
H32|Taxes and the Location of Targets|This paper uses firm-level data to investigate the impact of taxes on the international location of targets in M&A. In principle, a higher tax rate in the target’s country could make an acquisition there more likely, less likely, or have no effect at all. We combine financial and ownership data for companies in ORBIS in 2005 with domestic and cross-border acquisitions in ZEPHYR between 2006 and 2008. We estimate a random parameters form of mixed logit model. We find that the statutory tax rate in the target country has a negative impact on the probability of an acquisition in that country, with an average elasticity of around 1. The size of the effect differs (i) between acquirers that were multinational or domestic in 2005; (ii) between domestic and cross-border acquisitions; and (iii) depending on whether the acquirer’s country has a worldwide or territorial tax system.
H32|How do tax incentives affect business investment? Evidence from German bonus depreciation|"We analyse how tax incentives in the form of accelerated depreciations (""bonus depreciation"") affect business investment. By exploiting exogenous variation in tax regulation of a regional bonus depreciation program in the former East Germany, we identify and quantify the impact from bonus depreciation on building and equipment investments at the extensive and intensive margins in the German manufacturing industry. We observe a stronger response for building investments and from large firms. There is only weak evidence of subsidy shopping but stronger evidence of investment shifting to years with more generous bonus depreciation regulations."
H32|Do country risk factors attenuate the effect of taxes on corporate risk-taking?|This study examines whether country-specific risk attenuates the association between tax policies and corporate risk-taking. We define country-specific risk (political and fiscal budget risk) as taxpayer's risk that tax refunds on losses cannot be paid due to the institutional environment or fiscal reasons. We exploit a cross-country panel with 234 changes in corporate tax rates and 49 changes in loss offset rules. We investigate whether government risk-sharing via loss offset rules and tax rates affects risk-taking conditional on country risk. We also examine whether tax rate changes, that scale the risk-sharing effect, influence the propensity to conduct risky projects in different country-level risk environments. Our results suggest that country-level risk fully attenuates the previously documented association between tax policies and corporate risk-taking. It attenuates both the effectiveness of loss offset rules and tax rate changes on corporate risk-taking. While changes in tax policy are attractive to policymakers because alternative instruments to encourage risk-taking cannot as easily be adjusted, we provide significant evidence that country risk considerably limits policymakers' ability to induce firm risk-taking via changes in tax policies.
H32|The effect of double taxation treaties and territorial tax systems on foreign direct investment: Evidence for Spain|The paper evaluates the effect of Double Taxation Treaties (DTTs) on Spain's inward and outward Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) for the period 1993-2013. Estimates produce positive and statistically significant coefficients. However, there are some differences between the inbound and outbound samples, the type of DTT and the group of developed and developing FDI partner countries. Moreover, interpretation of results differs depending on the fixed or random effects estimation technique used. The paper also analyses the effect on FDI of the rules agreed in DTTs and applied by the investors' residence country in order to correct international double taxation. The authors conclude that the tax saving derived from the application by Spain of the territorial system is positively related to investment from this country to abroad. However, the tax saving provided by the application by the partner countries of the territorial system does not have a significant effect on the investment of these countries into Spain.
H32|Tax Influence on Financial Structures of M&As|A well-known strategy of tax avoidance by multinationals is to locate debt in subsidiaries in countries with a high tax rate. In case of M&As it is particularly advantageous to locate debt at the level of holdings. By using firm-level data provided by the German Central Bank, I show empirically that indeed the probability that a firm is held by a holding in the same country increases with the local tax rate. Furthermore, consolidating the balance sheets of firms and their holdings leads to a stronger effect of taxes on the debt ratio. However, I find this effect only for a sample of all firms and no additional effect in case of M&As. I conclude that those findings may be one explanation why previous studies have found relatively low effects of taxes on debt financing.
H32|Tax influence on financial structures of M&As|In this paper, I investigate the influence of tax incentives on the financial structures of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) conducted by multinational entities (MNE). Previous research has already found evidence for tax avoidance by debt shifting. I analyze the importance of locating debt at holdings which own the operating firm. Placing debt at the level of the holding is more advantageous since it allows inter alia for debt financing up to the purchase price. Accordingly, by using firm-level data provided by the German Central Bank I show empirically that the probability that a firm is held by a holding in the same country increases with the tax rate in that country (though the effect is rather small). As a limitation, I find this effect only for a sample of all firms and no additional effect in case of M&As (denoted as M&A firms). Since this way of debt financing requires that interest payments of holdings are used to offset profits of the operating firms, I consolidate financial structures of holdings and the operating firms. I discuss theoretically and show with descriptive statistics that this consolidation - the major contribution of my paper - leads to a higher total debt ratio compared to the unconsolidated case. However, this effect can only be observed in particular for the subsample of those M&A firms which actually belong to such structures of holdings and operating firms and does not lead to an increase of the debt ratio in the sample of all M&A firms. Finally, I show that the tax sensitivity of external debt financing increases with the consolidation (though again with no additional effect in case of M&A firms). I conclude that those findings may be one explanation why previous studies have found relatively low effects of taxes on debt financing.
H32|Environmental Pollution Policy of Small Businesses in Nigeria and Ghana: Extent and Impact|This study provides a comprehensive assessment of firmsâ€™ operation and environmental protection polices in Nigeria and Ghana, where there has been a rising industrial growth amidst low regulatory and institutional frameworks. We analyze the extents to which firmsâ€™ adoption of environmental protection policies affect their performances. We use firm-level data of 842 firms (447 for Nigeria and 395 for Ghana) distributed across different regions of both countries for our descriptive and econometric estimations. We find, among other things, that firmsâ€™ adoption of internal policies on environmental protection is dismally low in both Nigeria (32 percent) and Ghana (17 percent), with policies focused on reducing solid (38 percent, Nigeria; and 35 percent, Ghana), gaseous (22 percent, Nigeria; and 44 percent, Ghana), and liquid (24 percent, Nigeria; and 14 percent, Ghana) pollution. Training appears to be an important intervention that can help improve firmsâ€™ adoption of such policies. We also found that firmsâ€™ adoption and implementation of environmental protection policies significantly improve their performance.

H32|Elasticidad del ingreso corporativo gravable en Colombia|En este documento se estima la elasticidad de la utilidad de las empresas con respecto a la tasa efectiva marginal de tributación neta, en un contexto de frecuentes reformas tributarias. Esta medición es relevante, dado el amplio margen de maniobra que tienen las firmas para responder ante cambios en los impuestos, y por la importancia del impuesto de renta corporativo sobre la actividad económica y el balance fiscal. El análisis se realiza para las reformas tributarias implementadas en Colombia, durante el periodo 2008-2014, utilizando Mínimos Cuadrados en dos etapas y la Regresión por Cuantiles Edógena con Datos Panel. Los cálculos de las tasas efectivas marginales de tributación muestran que la carga tributaria que recae sobre las empresas es inferior a la tasa estatutaria definida por la ley, debido a las deducciones establecidas en el estatuto tributario. Por su parte, los resultados de las elasticidades señalan que las respuestas de las firmas dependen de la reforma evaluada y de las características de las empresas. **** In this paper, we estimate the elasticity of profits before taxes with respect to the net-off marginal effective tax rate in a context of frequent tax reforms. This measurement is relevant, given the wide margin of maneuver that firms have to respond to changes in taxes, and the importance of corporate income taxes on economic activity and the fiscal balance. The analysis is carried out for the tax reforms implemented in Colombia, during the period 2008-2014, using Least Squares in two stages and Endogenous Quantile Regression for Panel Data. The marginal effective tax rates used in the estimations shows that the corporate tax burden of firms is lower than the statutory tax rate defined by law, due to tax deductions and tax exemptions established by Law. In turn, the results of the elasticities show that the firms' responses depend on the specific tax reform and on the companies' characteristics.
H32|Searching for profit-shifting in China|This paper investigates profit-shifting behaviour among multinational corporations (MNCs) in China. The authors exploit the flat-rate structure of China's corporate income tax, along with its system of targeted, preferential rates, to estimate the relationship between profits and tax rates. Their sample consists of approximately 60,000 observations of foreign-owned MNCs from the years 2005-2009. Using the traditional approach of regressing before-tax profits on tax rates, the authors find evidence consistent with profit-shifting. However, this approach is suspect because the nature of China's tax preferences makes it especially vulnerable to omitted variable bias. Accordingly, the authors employ finite mixture modelling to search for the existence of a group of profit-shifting MNCs. While their analysis identifies two types of firms, subsequent investigation failed to produce any evidence linking these to profit-shifting behavior. Robustness checks exploiting the panel nature of the dataset, along with further investigation of investment-tax elasticities, confirm the authors' null finding of profit-shifting. One reason for the lack of profit-shifting among Chinese MNCs may be that corporate tax rates were relatively low during this period.
H32|Do US Firms Pay Less Tax than their European Peers? On Firm Characteristics, Profit Shifting Opportunities, and Tax Legislation as Determinants of Tax Differentials|Using pairs of similar US and European firms listed on the S&P500 or StoxxEurope600, we examine effective tax differentials between US multinational corporations (MNCs) and their European peers. We show that statutory tax rates and profit shifting opportunities are important determinants of effective tax rates. Our findings suggest substantially lower total tax payments of US MNCs after the 2017 US tax reform. Based on past reforms of Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) rules and of the principle of worldwide taxation, we confirm that international tax legislation affects effective tax expenses. We also provide evidence for heterogeneity in firm responses: MNCs with profit shifting opportunities benefit most from more-lenient CFC rules.
H32|Tax morale and the role of social norms and reciprocity - Evidence from a randomized survey experiment|We present the first randomized survey experiment in the context of tax compliance to assess the role of social norms and reciprocity for intrinsic tax morale. We find that participants in a reciprocity treatment have significantly higher tax morale than those in a social-norm treatment. This suggests that a potential backfire effect of social norms is outweighed if the consequences of violating the social norm are made salient. We further document the anatomy of intrinsic motivations for tax compliance and present first evidence that previously found gender effects in tax morale are not driven by differences in risk preferences.
H32|How do small firms respond to tax schedule discontinuities? Evidence from South African tax registers|Abstract We study the responsiveness of small- and medium-sized firms to a small-business corporate income tax schedule using population-wide administrative data from South Africa. We find sizeable bunching of firms at the corporate income thresholds where the corporate tax rate increases, implying active responses to corporate income taxes. The observed bunching is very sharp and reacts immediately to changes in the location of the kink points. These observations suggest that a sizeable part of the response is driven by reporting responses rather than real economic behavior. We find indicative evidence that reporting behavior is linked to underreporting of sales and legal tax-planning activities.
H32|Collusive tax evasion by employers and employees. Evidence from a randomized fi eld experiment in Norway|Third-party reporting and employers’ tax withholding are powerful compliance mechanisms, as long as the employer and employee do not collude to evade. Using data from randomly assigned on-site audits among 2,462 Norwegian firms, we provide evidence of collusive tax evasion. We find that firms assigned to be audited increased their subsequent wage reporting on behalf of their employees by 18 percent relative to firms assigned to the control group. The effect is more pronounced among small firms with few employees. Our results document the limitations of third-party reporting, but also that these limitations can be counteracted by relatively inexpensive on-site audits.
H32|Investment Incentives and Tax Competition under the Allowance for Growth and Investment (AGI)| We employ a dynamic investment model to study the investment incentives of the Allowance for Growth and Investment (AGI) proposed by the European Commission in its two-step approach towards the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB). We show that the AGI strengthens investment incentives in high-tax countries and decreases the CCCTB-induced investment push towards low-tax countries. Furthermore, we show that the AGI decreases tax competition and that a sufficiently generous AGI reduces tax competition between countries when introduced with the CCCTB. We also provide new results for the standard Allowance for Corporate Equity (ACE) discussed intensively in the literature. In particular, we show that the ACE reduces the CCCTB-induced investment push towards low-tax countries and that the ACE reduces tax competition between countries. Despite the positive implications of the AGI for investment incentives and tax competition, the ACE performs slightly better in both respects. In addition the ACE also offers better neutrality properties. On the other hand, the ACE is criticized for its possible inherent tax revenue losses; with AGI these losses would be smaller. However, the trade-off between better incentives and higher revenue loss also appears to persist with the AGI.

H32|What Influences Private Investment? The Case of the Czech Republic|What influences private investment in the Czech Republic? This paper arrives at a conclusion based on a survey of fixed-asset purchases in 30,000 non-financial corporations over the period 2008-2015. BVAR models are estimated on aggregates for 19 industries and the whole non-financial economy. As our results show, foreign demand is the most important factor for Czech business investment, especially in manufacturing and tourism. We also find an increased importance of expectations and uncertainty during the period under review. According to our findings, business investment is fostered by a devalued currency and is crowded out by public investment. The most profound crowding-out was seen in manufacturing and agriculture, whereas services, trade, and construction exhibit crowding-in. Finally, EU funds are found to be successful in providing occasional support to private investment.
H32|Heterogeneity in the tax pass-through to spirit retail prices: Evidence from Belgium|On 1st November 2015, the Belgian government increased the excise tax on alcoholic beverages. For spirits with 40% of alcohol and bottle size of 70cl, this tax change is equivalent to an amount of 2,43€ per bottle of spirits. This paper studies the impact of this tax reform on the retail price of six major brands of spirits, using a difference-in-differences method. The estimation is based on a balanced panel of scanner data from a major supermarket chain and uses the retail prices of the same brands sold in France by the same supermarket chain as a control group. Having information on each store geographical location, we can further test for heterogeneity in tax pass-through according to the intensity of local competition and the scope for cross-border shopping. We find that the tax was quickly passed through spirit retail prices already during the first month of tax implementation and that it was mostly over-shifted. Unlike the (nearly) uniform pricing in US retail chains, we show spatial variation in prices across stores, and we find a large heterogeneity in tax pass-through linked to variation in local competition and price elasticity of demand. Although the tax reform has considerably increased the relative price of Belgian spirits with respect to all its neighboring countries, we find a lower tax shifting only in stores bordering on Luxembourg. Which is the neighboring country with the lowest spirit prices before the alcohol tax reform. These findings have important implications for alcohol control policies as they highlight the risk that the health benefits of alcohol taxation can vary greatly across households according to where they live.
H32|Social networks and tax avoidance. Evidence from a well-defined Norwegian tax shelter|In 2005, over 8% of Norwegian shareholders transferred their shares to new (legal) tax shelters intended to defer taxation of capital gains and dividends that would otherwise be taxable in the aftermath of 2006 reform. Using detailed administrative data we identify family networks and describe how take up of tax avoidance progresses within a network. A feature of the reform was that the ability to set up a tax shelter changed discontinuously with individual shareholding of a firm and we use this fact to estimate the causal effect of availability of tax avoidance for a taxpayer on tax avoidance by others in the network. We find that take up in a social network increases the likelihood that others will take up. This suggests that taxpayers affect each other's decisions about tax avoidance, highlighting the importance of accounting for social interactions in understanding enforcement and tax avoidance behavior, and providing a concrete example of “optimization frictions” in the context of behavioral responses to taxation.
H32|How Do Firms Respond To Place-Based Tax Incentives?|In this paper, we evaluate the effects of payroll tax changes on firm behavior, by exploiting a unique policy setting in Norway, where a system of geographically differentiated payroll taxes was suddenly abolished due to an EU regulation. We find that firms are only partially able to shift the increased costs from higher payroll tax rates onto workers’ wages. Instead, firms respond to the tax increase primarily by reducing employment. The drop in employment following the tax reform is particularly pronounced in labor intensive firms—which experience a larger windfall loss due to the tax reform than non-labor intensive firms—and in multi-establishment firms—which respond to the payroll tax increase in part by reducing the number of establishments per firm. Overall, our findings point to liquidity effects whereby a sudden and largely unexpected payroll tax increase aggravates firms’ liquidity constraints, forcing them to cut employment to bring down costs.
H32|How does the state destroy incentives in innovation financing?|We investigate the effect of state subsidy on the behavior of entrepreneur and venture capitalist in a double moral hazard and fixed investment model under positive externalities. We infer that investment subsidy and success fee improve the incentives, ease credit rationing, hence boost private financing, which explains the popularity of hybrid venture capital systems. The main disadvantage of these systems is, however, that the entrepreneur is encouraged to minimize his/her own capital investment and to ask for the maximal state subsidy available. It may happen that public sources go to entrepreneurs capable to finance their projects privately, so state subsidies increase state deficit (and private profits) without any effects on public welfare leaving other important areas underfinanced. We also prove that state guarantee definitely creates perverse incentives, hence it is not recommended in our model.
H32|Public Debt and the Slope of the Term Structure|The maturity-weighted public debt-to-GDP ratio predicts negatively one- to five-year cumulative nominal consumption growth. Moreover, a higher debt-to-GDP ratio is associated with higher yield spreads, controlling for output gap and inflation. I examine these facts in a New Keynesian DSGE model in which growth and inflation are endogenous. In this model, high government debt forecasts low growth and deflation, making bonds attractive assets in high debt states. Furthermore, due to mean-reversions of fundamental processes that drive the economy, longer-term bonds are better hedges than shorter-term ones, resulting in increases in the slope of the term structure at times of high public debt and hence the empirical regularities seen in the data. My model can also explain several other puzzling phenomena, including the bond premium puzzle, the bond yield volatility puzzle, the failure of the expectations hypothesis, and the ability of a linear combination of the forward rates and the forward spread to forecast excess bond returns.
H32|The Value Added Tax Incidence – the Case of the Book Market in CEE Countries|Conducting effective economic policy requires understanding of how taxes are shifted. The value added tax rates on books in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia in 2003 – 2012 differed much and changed several times, hence it was a good case for exploring the tax incidence. The main objective of the article is to answer the question to whom (consumers, capital, labour) and to what extent the burden of the value added tax on books was shifted. Although the tax is often classified as a consumption tax, the tax on books wasn’t shifted to consumers at least within five months after a tax rate change. The research suggests that the tax is shifted to capital and labour. According to the econometric models, an increase of the value added tax rate on books of 1 percentage point leads to a decrease of the return on equity of book publishers between 0,43 and 0,76 percentage point. It suggests that the value added tax on books was partly shifted to capital. Although wages are rigid, employees bear, to some extent, the burden of the value added tax. The regressions allow concluding that an increase of the value added tax rate of 1 percentage point leads to a reduction in the average wage in book publisher companies in the range 0,84% - 0,92%.
H32|Acceptability of Urban Transport Pricing| Several studies all over the world have considered transport pricing measures as promising attempts to solve urgent traffic problems in urban areas. An important precondition for the successful implementation of pricing measures is public and political acceptability. However, empirical findings show that the acceptability of such measures is rather low. The general objectives of this report are to assess acceptability of various urban transport pricing measures and policy packages, to analyse the reasons for the lacking acceptability and how this may be improved where appropriate. The relevant policy packages were derived from AFFORD Deliverable 1 (Milne, Niskanen and Verhoef, 2000). A public acceptability questionnaire survey was carried out in Athens, Como, Dresden and Oslo. The political acceptability survey was carried out as a phone interview with politicians in Como and Dresden.
H32|Essays on public economics| This doctoral thesis is a collection of four essays in public economics that look at various public policies and their impacts on low-income and otherwise vulnerable individuals. The essays share the general aim of studying the effectiveness of public policies in achieving their stated goals. The first essay is single-authored by the candidate, and the latter three are collaborations with one or more co-authors. In the first essay, I use a unique dataset compiled from Finnish registers and surveys to provide a comprehensive characterisation of the take-up behavior of Finnish welfare benefits (housing allowance and social assistance) using descriptive methods. I provide various stylised facts on take-up and discuss how income dynamics matter for understanding take-up and benefit targeting. The second essay focuses on the impact of information on benefit takeup. We study the information campaign in the context of the introduction of the guarantee pension program in Finland in 2011 and find that receiving a mailed information letter and application form significantly increased take-up compared to non-recipients. In the the third essay, we analyse the impact of employersâ€™ disability insurance (DI) contributions on the incidence of disability pensions among their workers. Experience rating is used in DI in Finland in order to increase employersâ€™ incentives to prevent disabilities among their workers. We use detailed data and an empirical strategy that allows us to identify the causal effect of experience rating on disability inflow. Our analysis finds that the policy is not effective in reducing disabilities. The fourth essay uses a theoretical framework to provide optimal tax and transfer rules for poverty reduction in developing countries. We modify the standard optimal tax framework by restricting tax instruments to be linear, which are more feasibly implemented in countries with a lower administrative capacity. We show that when we change from the standard objective of welfare maximisation to that of poverty minimisation, which better depicts the concrete objectives of such countries, the optimal tax and transfer rules are changed.
H32|Using a Kinked Policy Rule to Estimate the Effect of Experience Rating on Disability Inflow|"We study whether the experience rating of employers' disability insurance premiums affects the inflow to disability benefits in Finland. To identify the causal effect of experience rating, we exploit ""kinks"" in the rule that specifies the degree of experience rating as a function of firm size. Using comprehensive matched employer-employee panel data, we estimate the effects of experience rating on the inflow to sickness and disability benefits. Our results suggest that experience rating has reduced the disability inflow among men under age 50. For other groups we find no significant effects, yet we cannot rule out relatively small effects."
H32|Investment Incentives and Tax Competition under the Allowance for Growth and Investment (AGI)|The European Commission’s Allowance for Growth and Investment (AGI) has proposed investment incentives in its two-step approach towards the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB). In this latest EconPol working paper, the authors demonstrate that the AGI strengthens investment incentives in high-tax countries and decreases the CCCTB-induced investment push towards low-tax countries. They also demonstrate that the AGI decreases tax competition and that a sufficiently generous AGI reduces tax competition between countries when introduced with the CCCTB.
H32|The Dynamic Effects of Personal and Corporate Income Tax Changes in the United States: Reply to Jentsch and Lunsford|In this reply to a comment by Jentsch and Lunsford, we show that, when focusing on the relevant impulse responses, the evidence for economic and statistically significant macroeconomic effects of tax changes in Mertens and Ravn (2013) remains present for a range of asymptotically valid inference methods.
H32|Environmental investment decisions: experimental evidence of team versus individual decision making|We study experimentally how investment decisions are affected by equally stringent but different policy regime treatments and how differences depend on whether decisions are made individually or in groups. In our experiment, subjects decide on an investment level either individually or jointly in groups of three. In addition, decisions are made subject to either a tax or performance standard treatment. We find that investments are significantly higher and closer to the level that maximizes revenues of the hypothetical firm in the performance standard treatment. This holds for both individual and group decisions, but we find no evidence of an interaction effect. Even though groups seem to have a knowledge advantage, they are not able to benefit from it, since intragroup communication is not able to transmit the microeconomic reasoning to group members without such knowledge. Also, groups are not able to attenuate the attention bias of focusing on selective information depending on the specific policy treatment.
H32|Corporate tax evasion and unreported wages: The effect of compulsory staff registers|One way to decrease corporate tax evasion is to introduce a reform that makes it easier for the tax authorities to detect and punish firms that evade taxes. Such a reform was implemented by the Swedish policymakers in 2007 when they launched a law that required restaurants and hairdressers to introduce staff registers with detailed information on when their employees were present at the workplace. The Swedish Tax Authority was also given the opportunity to perform unannounced control visits, and firms that had not correctly completed their staff registers had to pay a fine. To evaluate the effects of this reform on reported wages, we first identify control industries that resemble the counterfactual outcome of the treated industries using a Propensity Score Matching model. Next, we compare how wage reporting has evolved among the treated and control firms using firm-level difference-in-difference analysis. We find no statistically significant effects of staff registers on wage reporting up to three years after the reform was implemented. Our findings suggest that the staff register requirement has led to at best minor increases in wage reporting after four years. We conclude that the introduction of staff registers has been an inefficient way of addressing corporate tax evasion and reducing unreported wages, especially considering the substantial administrative costs and the increased regulatory burden for the treated firms.
H32|The characteristics of family firms: exploiting information on ownership, kinship, and governance using total population data|Abstract Family firms are often considered characteristically different from non-family firms. However, our understanding of family firms suffers from an inability to identify them in total population data; information is rarely available regarding owners, their kinship, and their involvement in firm governance. We present a method for identifying domiciled family firms using register data; this method offers greater accuracy than previous methods. We apply this method to Swedish data concerning firm ownership, governance, and kinship from 2004 to 2010. We find that the family firm is a significant organizational form, contributing over one third of all employment and gross domestic product (GDP). Family firms are common in most industries and range in size. Furthermore, we find that, compared to private non-family firms, family firms have fewer total assets, employment, and sales and carry higher solidity, although family firms are more profitable. These differences diminish with firm size. We conclude that the term “family firm” includes a large variety of firms, and we call for increased attention to their heterogeneity.
H32|Firm types, price-setting strategies, and consumption-tax incidence|We analyze price responses to large restaurant VAT rate reductions in two different European countries. Our results show that responses in the short and medium run were clustered around two focal points of zero pass-through and full pass-through. Differences between independent restaurants and chains is the key explanation for this pattern. While nearly all independent restaurants effectively ignored the tax reductions and left consumer prices unchanged, a substantial fraction of restaurants belonging to chains chose a rapid and complete pass-through. In the longer run, prices converged, but primarily through a price reversion among chain restaurants. The stark difference in price responses does not appear to arise because of different market characteristics such as location, initial price levels, meal types and restaurant segment.
H32|The Rise of Private Foundations as Owners of Swedish Industry: The Role of Tax Incentives 1862–2018|The tax system has at times favoured firm control through private foundations, which has been argued to inhibit high-impact entrepreneurship and economic growth. However, research has been hampered due to a lack of systematic historical tax data. The purpose of this study is threefold. First, we describe the evolution of tax rules for private foundations in Sweden between 1862 and 2018. Second, we calculate the marginal effective tax rate on capital income. Third, we examine the incentives to use private foundations as a means for corporate control by comparing the taxation of private foundations and of high-impact entrepreneurs. Tax incentives help explain why economically significant private foundations were founded between World War I and the 1960s.
H32|L'opus di Mauro Fasiani|Scopo di questo lavoro non è quello di discutere il pensiero scientifico di Fasiani, ma solo di attirare l'attenzione degli studiosi facendo conoscere il contenuto dei suoi apporti scientifici, perché Mauro Fasiani non sembra occupare ancora il posto che merita nell'ambito scientifico. In questo lavoro viene quindi presentato un profilo biografico di Mauro Fasiani, seguito da una breve analisi dei suoi scritti scientifici disposta secondo i principali filoni delle sue ricerche. Segue una bibliografia delle sue opere e la bibliografia degli scritti riguardanti il suo apporto scientifico. Il lavoro si conclude con la presentazione di trentotto schede, ciascuna corrispondente ad un suo saggio; rispetto agli scritti elencati nella bibliografia, mancano le schede corrispondenti a otto scritti, considerati del tutto trascurabili.
H32|Using a Kinked Policy Rule to Estimate the Effect of Experience Rating on Disability Inflow| We study whether the experience rating of employersâ€™ disability insurance premiums affects the inflow to disability benefits in Finland. To identify the causal effect of experience rating, we exploit â€œkinksâ€ in the rule that specifies the degree of experience rating as a function of firm size. Using comprehensive matched employer-employee panel data, we estimate the effects of experience rating on the inflow to sickness and disability benefits. Our results suggest that experience rating has reduced the disability inflow among men under age 50. For other groups we find no significant effects, yet we cannot rule out relatively small effects.
H32|Information Frictions and Learning Dynamics: Evidence from Tax Avoidance in Ecuador|We show how experience and dynamic learning processes reduce the obstacles to optimization imposed by information frictions when individuals newly enter the formal sector economy. Most importantly, we provide causal evidence on the exact mechanisms through which individuals learn about the functioning of government programs. To this aim, we exploit novel and rich administrative data on the universe of taxpayers in Ecuador and the introduction of generous tax deduction policies. Key to the identification of information transmission is exogenous worker mobility between firms. We find that the spread of information is driven by mobility of managers and tax experts.
H32|The Elasticity of Corporate Income: Panel Data Evidence from Switzerland|I estimate the tax elasticity of corporate income. The analysis is based on panel variation o ered by decentralized corporate taxation in Switzerland. According to the baseline estimate, an increase in a municipality's corporate tax rate by 1% results in a decrease of aggregate corporate income (defined as the sum of corporate taxable incomes in that municipality) by about 0.43%. The elasticity is fairly stable across municipality types regarding population size, centrality of location, and average income. Furthermore, I find evidence that a significant part of the aggregate-level elasticity is attributable to firm mobility across jurisdictions.
H32|Corruption and tax compliance: Evidence from small retailers in Bamako, Mali|We investigate the impact of corruption on tax compliance using a sample of 700 small business in Bamako, Mali. Our results show that paying bribes reduced tax compliance by almost ten percentage points.
H32|A tax competition approach to resource taxation in developing countries|In this paper, we investigate the effect of cost misreporting of extractive firms on the optimal design of tax policies. We build a two-period, two-country model where governments aim to attract a foreign-owned multinational firm to raise tax revenues by levying a pro.t tax and a royalty. The firm overstates its production costs and decides in which country to locate. We find that cost overstatement pushes royalties upward but remains detrimental for tax revenues as well as capital invested by the firm. The mining country that attracts the extractive firm is often the country with the highest coefficient of overstatement. However, the firm may locate in the country with the lowest overstatement and lowest royalty if both countries have the same profit tax.
H32|The effect of entrepreneurial origin on firms’ performance - The case of Portuguese academic spinoffs|We investigate the role of different entrepreneurial origin on firms’ performance by comparing academic spinoff firms with their non-academic counterparts and using alternative growth measures. Estimates based upon dynamic panel-data models reveal that academic spinoffs grow through resources accumulation and internationalization. However, comparatively to non- academic counterparts, they fail to translate these advantages into productivity gains. Also, despite younger academic spinoff outperform, in terms of sales growth, firms from different entrepreneurial origin, they fail to retain these scale effects, as they grow older. Portuguese academic spinoffs are contributing to economic development by creating new jobs, yet their relevance as a source of sustained economic value is limited so far. Policy implications are discussed in light of these findings.
H32|Sectoral Heterogeneity, Production Networks, and the Effects of Government Spending|We study the effects of government spending shocks in an economy with multiple interconnected production sectors that differ in their price rigidity, factor intensities, use of intermediate inputs, and contribution to final demand. The cumulative aggregate output multiplier associated with an aggregate government spending shock is 84% larger than that obtained in the average one-sector economy. This amplification is mainly driven by sectoral heterogeneity in price rigidity and the presence of input-output linkages. We also document substantial heterogeneity in the aggregate effects of sector-specific government spending shocks, and identify the key factors that account for it. Government spending shocks tend to have larger effects on aggregate output when they originate in sectors that have relatively rigid prices and high labor shares in value added, and are located downstream in the production network.
H32|The Dynamic Effects of Computerized VAT Invoices on Chinese Manufacturing Firms|This paper uses a balanced panel of large manufacturing firms to study the dynamic effects of computerizing VAT invoices on tax revenues and firm behavior in China, 1998-2007. We find that computerization explains 10.8% of cumulative VAT revenues and increases the effective average tax rate by approximately 9-12% in the seven subsequent years. The evidence suggests that the effects of computerization change over time: tax revenue gains are likely to be smaller in the long run. Meanwhile, firms reduce output and input, and increase productivity monotonically over time.
H32|Should there be lower taxes on patent income?| A “patent box” is a term for the application of a lower corporate tax rate to the income derived from the ownership of patents. This tax subsidy instrument has been introduced in a number of countries since 2000. Using comprehensive data on patent filings at the European Patent Office, including information on ownership transfers pre- and post-grant, we investigate the impact of the introduction of a patent box on international patent transfers, on the choice of ownership location, and on invention in the relevant country. We find that the impact on transfers is small but present, especially when the tax instrument contains a development condition and for high value patents (those most likely to have generated income), but that invention itself is not affected. This calls into question whether the patent box is an effective instrument for encouraging innovation in a country, rather than simply facilitating the shifting of corporate income to low tax jurisdictions.
H32|Unintended Consequences of Eliminating Tax Havens|We show that eliminating firms’ access to tax havens has unintended consequences for economic growth. We analyze a policy change that limited profit shifting for US multinationals, and show that the reform raised the effective cost of investing in the US. Exposed firms respond by reducing global investment and shifting investment abroad — which lowered their domestic investment by 38% — and by reducing domestic employment by 1.0 million jobs. We then show that the costs of eliminating tax havens are persistent and geographically concentrated, as more exposed local labor markets experience declines in employment and income growth for over 15 years. We discuss implications of these results for other efforts to limit profit shifting, including new taxes on intangible income in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.
H32|How Do Firms Respond to Place-Based Tax Incentives?|In this paper, we evaluate the effects of payroll tax changes on firm behavior, by exploiting a unique policy setting in Norway, where a system of geographically differentiated payroll taxes was suddenly abolished due to an EU regulation. We find that firms are only partially able to shift the increased costs from higher payroll tax rates onto workersâ€™ wages. Instead, firms respond to the tax increase primarily by reducing employment. The drop in employment following the tax reform is particularly pronounced in labor intensive firmsâ€”which experience a larger windfall loss due to the tax reform than non-labor intensive firmsâ€”and in multi-establishment firmsâ€”which respond to the payroll tax increase in part by reducing the number of establishments per firm. Overall, our findings point to liquidity effects whereby a sudden and largely unexpected payroll tax increase aggravates firmsâ€™ liquidity constraints, forcing them to cut employment to bring down costs.
H32|Replication and reconciling of the CICE evaluations on employment (2013-2014)|We reproduce the main estimates of the effects of the CICE (Tax Credit for Competitiveness and Employment) on employment presented by the TEPP and LIEPP teams for France Stratégie based on the methodological indications described in their first research reports (september 2016 and march 2017). After the reconstitution of the samples, globally validated by comparisons in descriptive statistics, we reproduce their different empirical strategies. The effects on employment reproduced are consistent with the results presented by TEPP: positive, significant and of the same order of magnitude for the firms most exposed to the CICE (fourth quartile of exposure to the CICE). On the other hand, the effects on employment by socio-professional category do not reproduce the results of TEPP. For LIEPP, the replication of the methodology leads to results similar to those presented in their report on aggregate employment in 2013 and 2014 (no significant and positive effect), and as well as on the breakdown by socio-professional category. We then compare the specifications of the two teams. The differences in results persist on a common sample, and are robust to the linear or non-linear specification of the treatment. However, we observe a particular sensitivity of the results to the presence or absence of past productivity of firms, in level, among the explanatory variables of employment growth. We present two reconciled specifications that lead to consistent results, shedding light on origins of the divergence. We do not conclude on employment effects of the CICE, as the work of the two teams is still ongoing.
H32|Corporate Effective Tax Rates: Model Description and Results from 36 OECD and Non-OECD Countries|Variations in the definition of the corporate tax base across countries can have significant impacts on tax liabilities associated with a given investment. An accurate assessment of the effects of corporate tax systems on investment thus needs to build on a consistent methodological framework covering not only statutory tax rates (STRs) but also many provisions affecting the base such as, e.g., fiscal depreciation. The new OECD model described in this paper provides such a framework; building on the theoretical model developed by Devereux and Griffith (1999, 2003) it presents forward-looking effective tax rates (ETRs) for 36 OECD and Selected Partner Economies taking into account a wide range of corporate tax provisions. Empirical results confirm that corporate tax bases vary considerably across countries and asset categories; since tax bases are typically narrower in countries with higher STRs, ETRs tend to be less dispersed across countries than STRs.
H32|Climate Policy and Stranded Carbon Assets: a Financial Perspective|Unanticipated climate policy curbs the value of physical capital that is costly to adjust. We illustrate this by showing that climate policy to keep peak global warming below 2°C depresses the share prices of oil and gas majors and their market capitalisation, curbs exploration investment and oil and gas discoveries, boosts proven reserves left abandoned in the crust of the earth, cuts exploitation investment, and induces an earlier onset of the carbon-free era. For a given carbon budget, an immediate carbon tax is the first-best response but delaying the carbon tax or a renewable energy subsidy to meet the same temperature target are preferred by shareholders because they introduce Green Paradox effects and protect the profitability of existing capital.
H32|The Superiority of Biased Reviewers in a Model of Simultaneous Sales|This paper considers the impact of reviewers on sales of products of quality unknown to consumers. Sales occur simultaneously after consideration by a reviewer with a known level of bias. Consumers observe the reviewer`s decision and a private signal. We find that: (a) with flexible prices and signals that are not too revealing the reviewer most biased against the product is best for profits; (b) with flexible prices and very revealing private signals the reviewer most biased in favour is optimal; (c) with fixed prices then a reviewer biased against, but close to unibased, is optimal.
H32|R&D cooperation in SMEs: the direct effect and the moderating role of human capital|We analyze the determinants of R&D cooperation for SMEs in Italy. We introduce in the literature human capital as one of the main determinants of R&D cooperation, concentrating on its moderating role, and specifically focusing on the high-tech sector. Using an extremely rich dataset, we improve the literature, building robust explanatory variables, and disaggregating the cooperation by partner. We find that human capital facilitates cooperation, but its moderating role depends on the type of disaggregation and/or the partner.
H32|The corporate governance of profit shifting|Tax-motivated profit shifting is an increasingly important element in the agenda of academics and policy-makers in the effort to understand tax-planning behavior and to promote tax fairness. In this research, we view profit shifting as the outcome of corporate governance characteristics of multinational enterprises (MNEs), ceteris paribus. Using a sample of 860 parent firms from 24 countries, 6,698 subsidiaries in 49 countries, we first measure profit shifting from the responses of subsidiary profits to parent earnings shocks. We draw on several agency theories of the firm and we show that elements of board structure, directors’ experience and networks, and CEO duality have an economically important influence on the aggressiveness of profit shifting. Using our baseline specification, a one-standard deviation change in these board characteristics implies an 11.06% total response in our measure of profit shifting.
H32|The GFC Investment Tax Break|The Australian Government established a temporary tax break for investment as part of its stimulus response to the global financial crisis. The policy gave all businesses undertaking equipment investment extra tax deductions and gave larger deductions to small businesses. We exploit this differential treatment to identify the effect of the tax credit using business-level datasets from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The key conclusions that emerge are: 1. The tax break had a strong effect on business-level investment. We find this result using both difference-in-differences and regression discontinuity methods. 2. The tax break increased the investment of companies , despite Australia's imputation system for corporate dividends implying that their costs of capital were unaffected. This suggests that a non-standard mechanism, such as a relaxation in financial constraints, underlies part of the response to tax incentives. To the extent that this is the case, it may suggest that such policies are more effective during downturns, when financial constraints are more binding. Relatedly, there is no evidence that businesses responded by bringing forward investment from future years (i.e. intertemporal substitution). 3. The tax break was important on a macroeconomic level. General equilibrium estimates suggest that both GDP growth and the cash rate would have been significantly lower in 2009 without the tax break. While our work suggests that tax rates and breaks can affect real decisions for Australian corporates, despite the existence of the dividend imputation system, it provides only limited guidance on the potential effects of policies other than the one we study. Other policies will differ in terms of their timing, permanence and targeting, all of which could influence their effectiveness.
H32|Corporate Income Tax, Legal Form of Organization, and Employment|A dynamic stochastic occupational choice model with heterogeneous agents is developed to evaluate the impact of a corporate income tax reduction on employment. In this framework, the key margin is the endogenous entrepreneurial choice of legal form of organization. A reduction in the corporate income tax burden encourages adoption of the C corporation legal form, which reduces capital constraints on firms. Improved capital reallocation increases overall productive efficiency in the economy and therefore expands the labor market. Relative to the benchmark economy, a corporate income tax cut can reduce the non-employment rate by up to 7 percent.
H32|The effect of corporate taxes on investment: Evidence from the Colombian firms|The paper assesses the role of taxes on investment in Colombian firms. The analysis is carried out at the firm level for the period 2003-2014. During this period, the national government set five different tax reforms, including changes in the statutory tax rates, tax credits and incentives for corporate investment. The effect of corporate taxation on investment is estimated by first determining the impact of taxation on the cost of capital by computing the effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs) at firm level. Then, we estimate the impact of the cost of capital on investment through a panel data regression. Endogeneity is controlled by an instrumental variable approach, simulating post-reform effective marginal tax rates under pre-reform firm characteristics. Results are robust with different control variables, although some significant differences by size and economic sector of the firm are found.
H32|The corporate political activity of MNEs under the pressures of institutional duality|The paper investigates how multinational subsidiaries develop their political strategies within the constraints of institutional duality. Based on the empirical investigation of western subsidiaries operating in the post-socialist institutional context of Hungary, I develop a model that illustrates how political capabilities – affected by institutional duality - underpin the lobbying strategy of MNE subsidiaries. The article makes a theoretical connection between the literatures on institutional duality and corporate political activity (CPA) and makes three distinct theoretical contributions. First, I transfer the analysis of nonmarket strategies from the institutional to the firm level, by opening the black box of how subsidiaries develop host country strategies. Second, by focusing on the process of how subsidiaries turn external and internal resources into political capabilities, I argue that institutional duality should be viewed as an endogenous aspect of the institutional framework, which equips firms with political capabilities, rather than an exogenous factor that constraints companies and disadvantage them in the host environment (Nell et al., 2014, Tempel et al., 2006). Third the study contributes to the theory of MNE parent-subsidiary management literature by extending our knowledge on how parent strategies affect the development of subsidiary’s political strategies.
H32|Does dividend tax impede competition for corporate charters?|We develop a model of jurisdictional competition for corporate charters among the states in which a firm’s agency cost depends on the federal dividend income tax rate and the takeover regulations of its domicile state. When firms are mobile across states, the federal dividend income tax rate affects both the intensity of competition among the states and the equilibrium level of state takeover regulations. Our model shows that increasing dividend tax rate weakens the competition for corporate charters under a condition: dividend-paying and the market for corporate control are complementary corporate governance mechanisms. This condition holds empirically, suggesting that dividend tax not only discourages firms from paying dividends but also weakens their corporate governance by disincentivizing states to improve their corporate laws.
H32|Prices versus Standards and Firm Behavior: Evidence from an Artefactual Field Experiment|We conduct an artefactual field experiment in which 164 managers and senior advisors recruited from Swedish industry were presented with a task of maximizing net revenue from abatement investments under three different but equally stringent environmental policy regimes. We find that investment decisions are strongly influenced by type of policy instrument. Economic instruments and performance standards cause different attentional and judgment biases that are inconsistent with standard economic theory. Inconsistencies are larger with economic policy instruments (tax and subsidy) than with performance standards even though subjects’ attention to cost minimization was greater with economic instruments than under performance standards. Inconsistencies are larger with economic policy instruments (tax and subsidy) than with performance standards even though subjects’ attention to cost minimization was greater with economic instruments than under performance standards.
H32|Taxation of Swedish Firm Owners: The Great Reversal from the 1970s to the 2010s|By the late 1960s, real effective taxation of income from individual firm ownership in Sweden approached 100 percent. A series of tax reforms has reversed this situation. This paper (1) elucidates the thinking behind the vision of creating a largely market-based system without wealthy capitalists and how that vision guided tax policy; (2) outlines and evaluates the changes in the tax code since the late 1970s, their empirical and intellectual basis, and their implications for the taxation of individual firm ownership; and (3) compares the size of the largest individual wealth holdings in the mid-1960s to their equivalents in the 2010s and discusses how the general public’s views have changed regarding sizeable income streams and wealth from business activity. Today, the tax code favors already wealthy individuals, while high labor income taxation combined with a high valuation of existing assets renders wealth accumulation difficult for persons with no initial wealth.
H32|How to Use One Instrument to Identify Two Elasticities|We show that an insight from taxation theory allows identification of both the supply and demand elasticities with only one instrument. Ramsey (1928) and subsequent models of taxation assume that a tax levied on the demand side only affects demand through the price after taxation. Econometrically, we show that this assumption functions as an additional exclusion restriction. Under the Ramsey Exclusion Restriction (RER) a tax reform can serve to simultaneously identify elasticities of supply and demand. We develop a TSLS estimator for both elasticities, a test to assess instrument strength and a test for the RER. Our result extends to a supply-demand system with J goods, and a setting with supply-side or non-linear taxes. Further, we show that key results in the sufficient statistics literature rely on the RER. One example is Harberger’s formula for the excess burden of a tax. We apply our method to the Norwegian labor market.
H32|Are some owners better than others in Czech privatized firms? Even meta-analysis can’t make us perfectly sure|We use a total of 1171 estimates extracted from 34 previous studies and perform a meta-analysis to examine the relationship between ownership structures and firm performance in Czech mass-privatized firms. We find that, in contrast to the remarkable effect of foreign ownership on firm performance and restructuring activities, domestic private entities were incapable of outperforming the state as owners of Czech companies. Our assessment of publication selection bias, however, indicates that the collected estimates do not contain genuine evidence for many types of corporate ownership. Further development and improvement in this study area are necessary to capture the true effect. Finally, we also point out the importance to draw (meta-analysis) inferences based on studies that employ adequate methodology.
H32|Ownership dynamics and firm performance in an emerging economy: a meta-analysis of the Russian literature| This paper provides a meta-analysis of studies on the effect of ownership on the performance of Russian firms over 20 years of rapid institutional and economic changes. We review 29 studies extracted from the EconLit and Web of Science databases with a total of 877 relevant estimates. We find that the government negatively affects company performance regardless of its administrative level. In contrast, private ownership is positively associated with firm performance. However, the effect size and statistical significance are notably varied among different types of private ownership. While the effect of insider (employee and management) ownership is comparable to that of foreign investors, the effect of domestic outsider investors is considerably smaller. Our assessment of publication selection bias reveals that the existing literature does not contain genuine evidence for a series of ownership types and, therefore, some of the findings have certain limitations.
H32|Effectiveness of Fiscal Incentives for R&D: Quasi-experimental Evidence|We exploit a 2008 UK policy reform that increased the tax incentives for R&D in medium-sized enterprises relative to large ones, to overcome the endogeneity of exposure to such tax credits. We estimate a difference-in-difference design on the universe of corporation tax filings in the United Kingdom, combined with other datasets. We find a positive and significant impact of tax credits for R&D, implying a user-cost elasticity estimate of around −1.6. This magnitude implies around $1 in additional private R&D spending per dollar foregone in tax revenue.
H32|Tax competition among U.S. states: Racing to the bottom or riding on a seesaw?|Dramatic declines in capital tax rates among U.S. states and European countries have been linked by many commentators to tax competition, an inevitable “race to the bottom,” and underprovision of local public goods. This paper analyzes the reaction of capital tax policy in a given U.S. state to changes in capital tax policy by other states. Our study is undertaken with a novel panel data set covering the 48 contiguous U.S. states for the period 1965 to 2006 and is guided by the theory of strategic tax competition. The latter suggests that capital tax policy is a function of “foreign” (out-of-state) tax policy, preferences for government services, and home state and foreign state economic and demographic conditions. The slope of the reaction function – the equilibrium response of home state to foreign state tax policy – is negative, contrary to casual evidence and many prior empirical studies of fiscal reaction functions. This result, which stands in contrast to most published findings, is due to two critical elements that allow for delayed responses to foreign tax changes and responses to aggregate shocks. Omitting either of these elements leads to a misspecified model and a positively sloped reaction function. Our results suggest that the secular decline in capital tax rates, at least among U.S. states, reflects synchronous responses among states to common shocks rather than competitive responses to foreign state tax policy. While striking given prior empirical findings, these results are fully consistent with the implications of the theoretical model developed in this paper and presented elsewhere in the literature. Rather than “racing to the bottom,” our findings suggest that states are “riding on a seesaw.” Consequently, tax competition may lead to an increase in the provision of local public goods, and policies aimed at restricting tax competition to stem the tide of declining capital taxation are likely to be ineffective.
H32|Market Power in Emission Permit Markets: Theory and Evidence from the EU ETS|Abstract A well-known result about market power in emission permit markets is that efficiency can be achieved by full free allocation to the dominant firm. I show that this result breaks down when taking the interaction between input and output markets into account, even if the dominant firm perceives market power in the permit market alone. I then examine the empirical evidence for price manipulation by the ten largest electricity firms during phase I of the EU ETS. I find that some firms’ excess allowance holdings are consistent with strategic price manipulation, and that they cannot be explained by price speculation or by precautionary purchases to insure against uncertain future emissions. My results suggest that market power is likely to be an empirically relevant concern during the early years of emission permit markets.
H32|Market Power and Instrument Choice in Climate Policy|This paper compares a clean energy standard (CES) and a carbon tax (CT), using theory and quantitative experiments. A two-stage duopolistic competition in the electricity sector between a polluting plant and its non-polluting rival anchors the model underlying these experiments. The CT induces both plants to contribute to clean electricity, whereas the CES only incentivizes the non-polluting plant. Ultimately, what matters for the ranking of these instruments is the size of the pre-existing competitive gap between the two rival plants. When this gap is sufficiently small, the CES becomes the more cost-effective instrument, irrespective of the pre-specified emissions reduction target.
H32|Business Taxation and Wages: Redistribution and Asymmetric Effects|Empirical evidence on the degree of business-tax shifting is rare. It remains open to which extent the tax burden is shifted, whether there are differences for tax increases and decreases, or whether there exists some treatment heterogeneity. Using a large administrative panel data set, we exploit the regional variation of the German business-income taxation and find that 65% to at most 93% is shifted to labour through real wage adjustments. We find that business taxation increases wage inequality significantly. Workers in a weak labour-market position bear the highest part of business taxation. The incidence effect of tax reliefs is significantly higher than that of tax increases. Therefore, reducing business taxes might, surprisingly, effectively reduce inequality.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H32|All the President’s Friends: Political Access and Firm Value|Using novel data on White House visitors from 2009 through 2015, we find that corporate executives’ meetings with key policymakers are associated with positive abnormal stock returns. We also find evidence suggesting that following meetings with federal government officials, firms receive more government contracts and are more likely to receive regulatory relief (as measured by the tone of regulatory news). The investment of these firms also becomes less affected by political uncertainty after the meetings. Using the 2016 presidential election as a shock to political access, we find that firms with access to the Obama administration experience significantly lower stock returns following the release of the election result than otherwise similar firms. Overall, our results provide evidence suggesting that political access is of significant value to corporations.
H32|The Taxation of Recreational Marijuana: Evidence from Washington State|The median United States voter supports the legalization of marijuana, at least in part due to a desire to increase state tax revenues. However, states with legal markets have implemented wildly different regulatory schemes with tax rates ranging from 3.75 to 37 percent, indicating that policy makers have a range of beliefs about industry responses to taxes and regulation. We examine a policy reform in Washington: a switch from a 25 percent gross receipts tax collected at every step in the supply chain to a sole 37 percent excise tax at retail. Using novel, comprehensive administrative data, we assess responses to the reform throughout the supply and consumption chain. We find the previous tax regime provided strong incentives for vertical integration. Tax invariance did not hold, with some types of firms benefiting much more than predicted. Consumers bear 44 percent of the additional retail tax burden. Finally, we find evidence that consumer demand for marijuana is price-inelastic in the short-run, but becomes price-elastic within a few weeks of a price increase.
H32|The Evolution of Corporate Cash|We put the recent increase in corporate cash in historic perspective by studying nearly 100 years of average and aggregate cash holdings. Corporate cash more than doubled in the first 25 years of our sample before returning to 1920 levels by 1970. Since then, average and aggregate patterns diverge. To understand these patterns, we examine both time-series and cross-sectional variation in cash policies and draw several conclusions. First, the increase in average cash ratios since 1980 is driven entirely by a shift in the cash policies of new entrants, while within-firm changes have been negative or flat since WW II. Second, the cross-sectional relations documented on modern data are remarkably stable back to the 1920s. Third, despite the stability of these relations, firm characteristics explain little of the time series variation in aggregate cash holdings over the century. Macroeconomic conditions, corporate profitability and investment, and (since 2000) repatriation tax incentives help fill this gap.
H32|Payroll Taxes, Firm Behavior, and Rent Sharing: Evidence from a Young Workers' Tax Cut in Sweden|This paper uses administrative data to analyze a large and long-lasting employer payroll tax rate cut from 31% down to 15% for young workers (aged 26 or less) in Sweden. We find a zero effect on net-of-tax wages of young treated workers relative to slightly older untreated workers, even in the medium run (after six years). Simple graphical cohort analysis shows compelling positive effects on the employment rate of the treated young workers, of about 2-3 percentage points, which arise primarily from fewer separations (rather than more hiring). These employment effects are larger in places with initially higher youth unemployment rates. We also analyze the firm-level effects of the tax cut. We sort firms by the size of the tax windfall and trace out graphically the time series of firms' outcomes. We proxy a firm's windfall with its share of treated young workers just before the reform. First, heavily treated firms expand after the reform: employment, capital, sales, value added, and profits all increase. These effects appear stronger in credit-constrained firms, consistent with liquidity effects. Second, heavily treated firms increase the wages of all their workers – young as well as old – collectively, perhaps through rent sharing. Wages of low paid workers rise more in percentage terms. Rather than canonical market-level adjustment, we uncover a crucial role of firm-level mechanisms in the transmission of payroll tax cuts.
H32|Firm-level political risk: Measurement and effects|We adapt simple tools from computational linguistics to construct a new measure of political risk faced by individual US firms: the share of their quarterly earnings conference calls that they devote to political risks. We validate our measure by showing that it correctly identifies calls containing extensive conversations on risks that are political in nature, that it varies intuitively over time and across sectors, and that it correlates with the firm's actions and stock market volatility in a manner that is highly indicative of political risk. Firms exposed to political risk retrench hiring and investment and actively lobby and donate to politicians. Interestingly, we find that the incidence of political risk across firms is far more heterogeneous and volatile than previously thought. The vast majority of the variation in our measure is at the firm-level rather than at the aggregate or sector-level, in the sense that it is neither captured by time fixed effects and the interaction of sector and time fixed effects, nor by heterogeneous exposure of individual firms to aggregate political risk. The dispersion of this firm-level political risk increases significantly at times with high aggregate political risk. Decomposing our measure of political risk by topic, we find that firms that devote more time to discussing risks associated with a given political topic tend to increase lobbying on that topic, but not on other topics, in the following quarter.
H32|The Employer Penalty, Voluntary Compliance, and the Size Distribution of Firms: Evidence from a Survey of Small Businesses|A new survey of 745 small businesses shows little change in the size distribution of businesses between 2012 and 2016, except among businesses with 40–74 employees, in a way that is closely related to whether they offer health insurance coverage. Using measures of both size and voluntary regulatory compliance, the paper links these changes to the Affordable Care Act’s employer mandate. Between 28,000 and 50,000 businesses nationwide appear to be reducing their number of full-time-equivalent employees to below 50 because of that mandate. This translates to roughly 250,000 positions eliminated from those businesses.
H32|Permit allocation rules and investment incentives in emissions trading systems|This paper argues that, in situations where choices are made between mutually exclusive investment projects and where there are economic rents, free allocation of tradable emission permits in emissions trading systems can weaken incentives for firms to invest in less carbon-intensive technologies compared to the case where permits would be auctioned. The reason is that permit allocation rules affect economic rents differentially when different product benchmarks apply to products that are close substitutes. Examples of permit allocation rules favouring more emission-intensive technologies for outputs that are close substitutes are found in the California Cap and Trade Program and in the European Union Emissions Trading System. This lack of technology-neutrality is exacerbated in the long run as future patterns of substitutability between technologies are uncertain. Free permit allocation can broaden support for carbon pricing, but this paper shows that this carries a cost in terms of environmental effectiveness if it discourages investment in low-carbon assets.
H32|Tax planning by multinational firms: Firm-level evidence from a cross-country database|This paper exploits firm-level data from the ORBIS database to assess international tax planning by multinational enterprises (MNEs). Profit shifting to lower-tax rate countries is measured by comparing the profitability of MNE entities having different links to countries with different tax rates and thus different profit shifting opportunities. The paper also considers other aspects of tax planning that have been less documented in the empirical literature, such as the exploitation of mismatches between tax systems and preferential tax regimes, by comparing how profits reported by MNE entities are taxed relative to non-multinational entities with similar characteristics. The analysis builds on available unconsolidated financial account data, which, despite its limitations, is considered as the best existing cross-country firm-level data. Results are based on a very large sample of firms (1.2 million observations of MNE accounts) in 46 OECD and G20 countries and a sophisticated procedure to identify MNE groups. They provide robust evidence that MNEs shift profits to lower-tax rate countries and that large MNEs also exploit mismatches between tax systems and preferential tax treatment to reduce their tax burden. Overall, the estimated net tax revenue loss ranges from 4% to 10% of global corporate tax revenues. The empirical analysis also shows that strong “anti-avoidance” rules against tax planning are associated with reduced profit shifting, but also higher compliance costs for firms. Planification fiscale des entreprises multinationales : Des preuves basées sur des données internationales d'entreprises Ce document exploite les données d’entreprises de la base de données ORBIS pour évaluer la planification fiscale internationale des entreprises multinationales. Les transferts de bénéfices vers les pays à taux d'imposition inférieur sont mesurés en comparant la rentabilité des entités multinationales ayant des liens différents avec des pays ayant des taux d'imposition différents et donc différentes possibilités de transferts de bénéfices. Le document examine également d'autres aspects de la planification fiscale qui ont été moins documentés dans la littérature empirique, comme l'exploitation des disparités entre les systèmes fiscaux et les régimes fiscaux préférentiels, en comparant la façon dont les bénéfices déclarés par les entités multinationales sont imposés par rapport à des entités non-multinationales avec des caractéristiques similaires. L'analyse se fonde sur des données financières non consolidées, qui, malgré leurs limites, sont considérées comme le meilleur échantillon international de données d’entreprises existant. Les résultats sont basés sur un très grand échantillon d'entreprises (1,2 millions d'observations de comptes de multinationales) dans 46 pays de l'OCDE et du G20 et une procédure sophistiquée pour identifier les groupes multinationaux. Ils fournissent des preuves solides que les multinationales transfèrent leurs bénéfices vers les pays à taux d’imposition inférieur et que les grandes multinationales exploitent également les disparités entre les systèmes fiscaux et les traitements fiscaux préférentiels pour réduire leur fardeau fiscal. Au total, la perte de recettes fiscales nette estimée varie de 4% à 10% des recettes mondiales d’impôt sur les sociétés. L'analyse empirique montre également que des règles strictes « anti-évitement » contre la planification fiscale sont associés à des transferts de bénéfices réduits, mais aussi à des coûts de conformité plus élevés pour les entreprises.
H32|Business registration pillars: Good regulatory practice for ASEAN|Business registration is crucial for ensuring accountable, transparent and viable business environments. By bringing businesses into the formal economy, governments are able to provide more strategic and targeted policies for businesses and consumers. The objective of this working paper is to look at the importance of business registration for governments, businesses and citizens. It explores the this issue through a series of case studies that support good practices in customer orientation and joined-up government. Each of the different case studies fall under a pillar that aims to support countries in the development of their business registration systems.The paper also aims to provide policy directions for countries in Southeast Asia when developing modern business registration systems and provides some background for the development of ASEAN’s regional business registration principles.
H32|Impact of the Tax System on the Competitiveness of Businesses and Capital Inflow. International comparison within the CEE region|This study starts the investigation of the correlations between taxation and the competitiveness of businesses by clarifying some general issues. It examines the different channels of tax regulation that affect the competitiveness of businesses. Although the study has an international scope, it focuses primarily on the Visegrád countries. The relationship between the investors’ willingness and taxation is also analysed. The study concludes that in a European context there is no close correlation between the competitiveness of the tax system and capital inflow. In the opinion of the author, the regulatory system should be simplified primarily, with a view to improving the investment environment of the Visegrád countries. One important conclusion of the study is that the competitiveness of the businesses of the region is encumbered less by the size of tax burdens and much more by the complicacies of tax regulation and the time-consuming nature of the administrative tasks connected to taxation.
H32|The Correlations of Corporate Investments, European Union Grants and Competitiveness|Despite being one of the leaders in the absorption of EU grants, the catch-up performance of Hungary has been poorer than that of the other Member States joining the EU in 2004 and 2007. Among the possible causes, this article attempts to take a closer look at the effects of direct aid to companies, proposing an argument that also draws on the results of multivariate regression analysis carried out on a proprietary database. The effect of aid on companies is partly manifested in a moderate degree of monopolisation in domestic markets. The international competitiveness of companies fails to improve, and increased employment is accompanied by deteriorating productivity in the short term. In modern development approaches, to ensure that aid to companies produces a sufficient catch-up effect, improvements are needed in research, development and innovation, and in the quality of human resources, and highly efficient support needs to be provided for infrastructure development.
H32|The economic distortions of a border-adjusted corporate cash flow tax|This paper explores the efficiency distortions under two types of destination-based corporate cash-flow taxes. Auerbach and Devereux (2015) have shown that a sales-apportioned cash-flow tax will distort consumer prices; this paper shows that those distortions are generally quite small, and are limited solely to industries in which economic profits are earned, and consump- tion is already significantly distorted. This paper also shows that a border-adjusted cash-flow tax will distort consumption decisions that cross borders, such as travel, higher education, and retirement location. In addition, it would affect labor migration decisions, especially for mi- grants who plan either to migrate only temporarily, or to remit a substantial fraction of their earning back to their home country.
H32|Determinants of Registration of Unincorporated Enterprises under State Value Added Tax Act in India|Unincorporated enterprises often bypass formal regulations in general and taxation in particular. Bringing unincorporated enterprises under taxation system is a challenge often faced by tax administrators and it is in this regard the present study explores the factors which influence decision of unincorporated enterprises to get registered with State Value Added Tax (VAT)/ sales tax authority. This analysis is limited to the decision regarding registration. It is not necessary that enterprises which are registered will pay taxes and/or file return- however; the process of registration does provide some information to the tax department for follow up. The study throws up some interesting results for policy makers and tax administrators.
H32|The Capital Gains Tax: A Curse but also a Blessing for Venture Capital Investment|This article documents a statistical association between the number and success of venture capital investments and the capital gains tax rate. To do this, we analyze investment data and taxes of 32 countries from 2000 to 2010. In our data, higher capital gains tax rates are associated with fewer firms financed and a lower probability for ventures receiving follow-up funding. However, if the first investment is received when taxes are high, the probability of a firm eventually going public or being acquired increases. We conclude that high tax rates are associated with fewer, but on average more successful companies.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H32|Debt-Market Friction, Firm-specific Knowledge Capital Accumulation and Macroeconomic Implications|This paper studies research and development (R&D) investment and accumulation of firm-specific knowledge capital (i.e., human capital) in the presence of debt market frictions, highlighting the macroeconomic implications. Empirically, R&D investment and knowledge capital are negatively correlated with debt at the firm level, which is in contrast with the positive relationship between physical investment and firm debt. I propose a new model to account for these facts: Firms accumulate firm-specific knowledge capital through R&D investment. However, knowledge capital - different from physical capital - cannot be used as banking collateral. Firms with high R&D investment opportunities rely more on internal finance and less on external debt. The model is quantitatively consistent with empirical facts along several dimensions. Based on the model, I then study the implications of two industrial policies. A practice that encourages using intellectual property as collateral for bank loans has a relatively small effect. I recommend a policy of tax credits for R&D investment. In fact, this policy can increase output by more than 5% and welfare by more than 3% in the long run. (Copyright: Elsevier)
H32|Place-Based Preferential Preferential Tax Policy and Its Spatial Effects: Evidence from India’s Program on Industrially Backward Districts|The Government of India initiated a program in 1994 to promote manufacturing in districts designated as backward. The way the backward districts were identified enables us to employ a regression discontinuity design to evaluate the impacts of the program. We find that the program’s 5-year tax exemption to manufacturers led to a significant increase in firm entry and employment in relatively better-off backward districts, particularly in light manufacturing industries. However, the program also resulted in negative spillover effects in districts which were neighboring these backward districts and relatively weaker in economic activity. The findings emphasize that the spatial effects of place-based policies deserve greater attention from policy makers.
H32|Shades of Grey: Business Compliance with Fiscal and Labour Regulations|Firms face many legal regulations, including corporate tax laws and labour laws. There are many ways for firms to evade these legal requirements. Firms may employ workers informally to skip out on safety or health standards or to avoid paying payroll taxes. Firms may also misreport sales transactions to minimize sales or business tax liabilities. Much of the literature examining firm behaviour assumes that a firm's decision to evade one type of regulation (such as labour regulation) is perfectly linked to the decision to evade another (such as corporate income taxes). In this paper, we separate these two evasion decisions and allow firms to decide whether to evade labour market regulations (including the payment of payroll taxes) independently from their decisions to evade business taxes. We find that the design of the tax system and firm entry decisions generate both positive and negative correlations between these two evasion decisions. We characterize the firms’ optimal entry and evasion behavior and derive the government's optimal tax policies. A pure pro t tax system with no payroll tax system, which is optimal in absence of business tax evasion, is no longer desirable when such evasion must be considered.
H32|How Do Peers Impact Learning? An Experimental Investigation of Peer-to-Peer Teaching and Ability Tracking|Classroom peers are believed to influence learning by teaching each other, and the efficacy of this teaching likely depends on classroom composition in terms of peers’ ability. Unfortunately, little is known about peer-to-peer teaching because it is never observed in field studies. Furthermore, identifying how peer-to-peer teaching is affected by ability tracking—grouping students of similar ability—is complicated by the fact that tracking is typically accompanied by changes in curriculum and the instructional behavior of teachers. To fill this gap, we conduct a laboratory experiment in which subjects learn to solve logic problems and examine both the importance of peer-to-peer teaching and the interaction between peer-to-peer teaching and ability tracking. While peer-to-peer teaching improves learning among low-ability subjects, the positive effects are substantially offset by tracking. Tracking reduces the frequency of peer-to-peer teaching, suggesting that low-ability subjects suffer from the absence of high-ability peers to teach them.
H32|Business Taxation and Wages: Redistribution and Asymmetric Effects|Empirical evidence on the degree of business-tax shifting is rare. It remains open to which extent the tax burden is shifted, whether there are differences for tax increases and decreases, or whether there exists some treatment heterogeneity. Using a large administrative panel data set, we exploit the regional variation of the German business-income taxation and find that 65% to at most 93% is shifted to labour through real wage adjustments. We find that business taxation increases wage inequality significantly. Workers in a weak labour-market position bear the highest part of business taxation. The incidence effect of tax reliefs is significantly higher than that of tax increases. Therefore, reducing business taxes might, surprisingly, effectively reduce inequality.
H32|Quelle incidence du CICE sur les salaires et l'emploi Une évaluation pour la période 2014-2017 t2 sur données de branches|Ce Working paper prolonge et actualise l'article de Ducoudré, Heyer et Plane (2015) qui analysait les premiers effets du Crédit d'Impôt pour la Compétitivité et l'Emploi (CICE) sur l'emploi et les salaires en utilisant des données trimestrielles par branche fournies par les comptes nationaux. Ce travail s’inscrit dans le débat sur l'évaluation du CICE récemment ravivé par les résultats du dernier rapport du comité de suivi de ce dispositif (France Stratégie, 2017) montrant qu'il n’y avait pas de consensus sur l'ampleur de ses effets sur l'économie française . Cette mesure, actuellement remise en cause par le nouvel exécutif, aurait, selon ce comité, un effet « difficile à déceler sur les salaires » et « positif mais modéré » sur l'emploi. Mais, les conclusions de ce rapport sont prudentes et appellent à prolonger et à multiplier les analyses de ce dispositif. Classification-JEL: H25, H32, J23, J31
H32|Tax Policy Effects on Business Incentives in Pakistan|The Pakistan system of taxing enterprises has undergone major changes in recent years. Nevertheless, the corporate tax system remains plagued by a number of problems, problems that relate to the neutrality, the yield, and the simplicity of the tax system. This chapter discusses these issues, with a focus on the distorting effects of tax policy on business invest.
H32|A trade-off theory of ownership and capital structure|This paper determines the optimal ownership share held by a unit into a second unit when both face a tax-bankruptcy trade-off. Full ownership is optimal when the first unit has positive debt, because dividends help avoid its default. Positive debt is, in turn, optimal when its corporate tax rate exceeds a threshold, and/or thin capitalization rules place an upper limit on the debt level in the second unit, and/or the Volcker Rule bans bailout transfers to the second unit. Full ownership is no longer optimal only if there is a tax on intercorporate dividend. This theory rationalizes observations on multinationals, financial conglomerates, and family groups.
H32|Knocking on Tax Haven’s Door: Multinational Firms and Transfer Pricing|This paper analyzes the transfer pricing of multinational firms. Intrafirm prices may systematically deviate from arm’s-length prices for two motives: pricing to market and tax avoidance. Using French firm-level data on arm’s-length and intrafirm export prices, we find that the sensitivity of intrafirm prices to foreign taxes is reinforced once we control for pricing-to-market determinants. Most important, we find no evidence of tax avoidance if we disregard tax haven destinations. Tax avoidance through transfer pricing is economically sizable. The bulk of this loss is driven by the exports of 450 firms to ten tax havens.
H32|Pratiques managériales frauduleuses en Algérie : diversité, ampleur et perceptions des acteurs|This paper aims to analyze the diversity and breadth of managerial fraud practices through the involved agents perceptions’. For this, we exploited the results of two surveys of 28 private enterprises and public officials in nine different regions in Algeria. Our results showed widespread practices of corruption and commercial or tax fraud, with an institutionalization of practices, and the existence of rational process of innovation in the fraud. These fraud practices appear to be an efficient response of businesses to adapt organization to a complex administrative context, in an unstable economic environment and an abundance of public financial funds. ....French Abstract: L’objet de cet article est d’analyser la diversité et l’ampleur des pratiques de fraude managériale à travers les perceptions des acteurs impliqués. Pour cela, nous avons exploité les résultats de deux enquêtes menées auprès de 28 entrepreneurs privés et de 9 fonctionnaires publics dans différentes régions en Algérie. Nos résultats ont montré entre autres, une généralisation des pratiques de corruption et de fraude commerciale et fiscale, accompagnée d’une institutionnalisation des pratiques, et de l’existence de processus rationnel d’innovation dans la fraude. Ces pratiques de fraude apparaissent comme une réponse d’adaptation des entreprises à un contexte administratif complexe, à un environnement économique instable et à une abondance des disponibilités financières publiques.
H32|Effective tax rates and the user cost of capital when interest rates are low|Interest rates are a key component of both user cost and effective tax rate measures of company taxation, and each is regularly used in empirical tests of tax impacts on investment. However, it is shown that when interest rates are low the two measures are not monotonically related. Using a simulated sample of observations, this feature is found to generate perverse estimates of the effects of taxation on the investment plans of firms.
H32|Los determinantes del autosuministro de agua para actividades productivas en un entorno urbano. El caso del municipio de Zaragoza|El objetivo de este trabajo es analizar el autosuministro de agua procedente de captaciones subterráneas para usos productivos en un entorno urbano, utilizando el modelo en dos etapas de Heckman. Disponemos de microdatos de 2.893 empresas localizadas en el municipio de Zaragoza para el año 2012. Los resultados indican que el agua autosuministrada y el agua de red son sustitutivos, lo que alerta sobre la limitada eficacia de las políticas de precios centradas sólo en el abastecimiento público de agua para conseguir reducir la presión sobre el recurso y confirma la necesidad de una gestión integral del agua. Comprobamos también que el volumen de agua autosuministrada no depende de su coste variable, lo que evidencia su reducida magnitud en la escala de costes de la empresa. Resulta reseñable, en particular, la ausencia de una tarifa que grave la captación de agua de los acuíferos, imprescindible para disponer de un instrumento económico de gestión de esta demanda.
H32|La demanda de agua urbana para actividades productivas. Una aplicación a la industria española|El objetivo de este estudio es estimar la demanda de agua de red para usos industriales, con especial atención a las diferencias sectoriales. Disponemos de un panel de datos para las comunidades autónomas españolas para el periodo 1993-2013, desagregado en 11 ramas de actividad. Los resultados indican que la política de precios del agua puede emplearse eficazmente para incentivar un menor uso del recurso (elasticidad de -0,66), aunque advertimos una fuerte heterogeneidad sectorial que hace necesaria la utilización de instrumentos adicionales. En general, las ramas en las que el agua supone una mayor proporción de los costes totales presentan también una mayor elasticidad
H32|The debt tax shield, economic growth and inequality|We study the implications of the corporate debt tax shield in a growth economy that taxes household income and firm profits and redistributes tax revenues in an attempt to harmonize the lifetime consumption opportunities of households that differ in their endowments. Our model predicts that the debt tax shield (1) increases the risk-free rate, (2) leads to a higher growth rate of the economy, and (3) increases the degree of disparity in households' lifetime consumption opportunities. We further show that the debt tax shield affects the tradeoff between the goals of achieving a high growth rate of the economy and a low degree of inequality and quantify this tradeoff.
H32|Formula apportionment: Factor allocation and tax avoidance|This paper addresses the question of how firms react to tax incentives in a formula apportionment (FA) tax regime. Under FA, the profits of all consolidated entities of a business group are summed and then allocated according to a formula based on FA factors. We hypothesize that firms may change the allocation of real production factors and/or manipulate the FA factor through tax avoidance strategies. Analysing FA tax effects of the German local business tax with payroll expense as the exclusive FA factor, we find empirical evidence consistent with both hypotheses. Regarding the allocation of production factors, we observe significant tax effects on labour input at the intensive margin but not on labour input at the extensive margin. In addition, we find evidence of an indirect FA spillover effect on capital investment. Our findings on tax avoidance proxies are consistent with tax-induced manipulations of payroll expense as an FA factor to save tax payments.
H32|Under cover: detecting the existence of profit-shifting in China|"This paper investigates profit-shifting behaviour among a large sample of multinational corporations (MNCs) in China. While profit-shifting behaviour is difficult to observe directly, it can be inferred from the behaviour of firms. That is the approach taken by Egger, Merlo, and Wamser (Unobserved tax avoidance and the tax elasticity of FDI 2014, henceforth EM&W) in their seminal analysis of tax elasticity of German MNCs. They developed a two-component mixture model that categorized MNCs into tax ""avoiders"" and ""non-avoiders"" based upon the estimated elasticities of investment to taxes. The authors of this paper apply their approach to their sample of MNCs in China. Like EM&W they find evidence of two distinct groups of MNCs. One group is responsive to changes in taxes, reducing investment when taxes increase. The other group is unresponsive to taxes, so that investment is not significantly associated with changes in tax rates. The authors show that the characteristics of these groups closely match the ""avoiders"" and ""non-avoiders"" of EM&W's sample. Even so, their estimated tax elasticities are much smaller than EM&W. This suggests that the extent of profit-shifting was relatively small during China's period of preferential tax treatment for foreign investors."
H32|Are Spanish companies involved in profit shifting? Consequences in terms of tax revenues|In this paper the authors analyze the existence of profit shifting between Spain and other OECD and EU countries. Using a sample of 1,169 Spanish subsidiaries owned by foreign OECD and EU parent companies and a sample of 317 EU subsidiaries owned by Spanish parent companies, taken from the AMADEUS Database for the period 2005 to 2014, and a simple tax rate difference as a measure of the tax incentive, the authors obtain a negative effect of corporate income taxes on reported profits. When the tax rate differences between Spain and the foreign countries vary by one percentage point, reported profits vary by approximately 2.7 to 3%. This is consistent with profit shifting activity by corporations and matches the empirical results in the literature. Furthermore, the authors calculate the impact of this activity on Spain's tax revenues from the sample of Spanish subsidiary companies. They obtain that the tax revenues vary from year to year, depending on the level of taxation of the main investor countries in Spain in comparison to the Spanish tax rate.
H32|Transfer pricing regulation and taxation of royalty payments|The digital economy is characterized by the use of intellectual property such as software, patents, and trademarks. The pricing of such intangibles is widely used to shift profits to low‐tax countries. We analyze the implications of different OECD methods to regulate transfer pricing and the role of a source tax on royalty payments for abusive transfer pricing. First, we show that under the traditional transfer pricing methods mispricing of royalty payments does not affect investment behavior. In contrast, the Transactional Profit Split Method that is promoted by the OECD for evaluating firms in the digital economy triggers higher investment in order to facilitate higher profit shifting. Second, royalty taxation is effective in reducing (such) abusive profit shifting, but always reduces investment. Third, a royalty tax rate below the corporate tax rate leads to overinvestment in a tax system with allowance for corporate equity (ACE).
H32|The Effects of Pre-announced Consumption Tax Reforms on the Sales and Prices of Consumer Durables|This paper utilizes a unique micro data set on consumer durables to study the effect of consumption tax reforms on the time path of consumption. The dataset reports the monthly sales of individual products and their consumer prices in 22 European countries, which enacted numerous consumption tax reforms in recent years. We implement a reduced form specification for sales that allows us to test theoretical predictions by a standard inter-temporal model of consumer choice under different assumptions about the pass-through of taxes into prices. Our identification strategy exploits the trading of individual products in multiple countries. The results document that changes in baseline consumption tax rates are fully and quickly shifted into consumer prices and exert very strong effects on the time path of consumption. We find that a one percentage point increase in consumption taxes causes an inter-temporal shift in consumption by 3 or more percent. In addition, purchases of durable goods increase temporarily by about 2 percent in the last month before a tax increase.
H32|International taxation and M&A prices|We show that corporate taxation systems regarding foreign dividends and capital gains across 49 countries differ in many aspects, contradicting the requirements for capital ownership neutrality and indicating that ownership patterns are distorted. Consequently, a national tax policy maker may ask which taxation system improves the position of its multinational entreprises in bidding for foreign targets. To address this question, we develop a theoretical model on the impact of foreign dividends and capital gains taxation on cross-border M&A prices from the acquirer's perspective and theoretically compare different taxation systems. In a next step, we empirically validate our model in a regression analysis on a large cross-border M&A data set. Based on this analysis, we find that foreign dividends taxation rather than capital gains taxation impacts M&A prices. Finally, we provide tax policy suggestions.
H32|Impact of controlled foreign corporation rules on post-acquisition investment and profit shifting in targets|We investigate real investment, financial revenues and profits in formerly domestic firms once they enter a multinational entity (MNE) through an acquisition. We argue that following the acquisition, those targets are tax-optimized in a profit shifting context if they are acquired by MNEs with no controlled foreign corporation (CFC) rules in their headquarters' countries. In this case, we hypothesize that MNE-wide profit shifting opportunities decrease high-tax targets' cost of capital, which may have a positive effect on real investment of these targets. In addition, we hypothesize that financial revenues respectively profits of low-tax targets increase after the acquisition, since they may become destinations of profit shifting themselves. In line with the effects on real investment, profits of high-tax targets should decline. We find evidence for the effects on real investment. Further, these effects can no longer be observed in case of existing CFC rules in the acquirer's headquarters' country. This finding may suggest that CFC rules effectively mitigate MNE-wide profit shifting which in turn has detrimental investment effects. We also find some evidence for the expected effects for financial revenues but not for the profit measure.
H32|Tax Policy and Heterogeneous Investment Behavior|We estimate the effect of temporary tax incentives on equipment investment using shifts in accelerated depreciation. Analyzing data for over 120,000 firms, we present three findings. First, bonus depreciation raised investment in eligible capital relative to ineligible capital by 10.4 percent between 2001 and 2004 and 16.9 percent between 2008 and 2010. Second, small firms respond 95 percent more than big firms. Third, firms respond strongly when the policy generates immediate cash flows, but not when cash flows only come in the future. This heterogeneity materially affects investment-weighted estimates and supports models in which financial frictions or fixed costs amplify investment responses.
H32|The Effect of Corporate Taxes on Investment: Evidence from the Colombian Firms|The paper assesses the role of taxes on investment in Colombian firms. The analysis is carried out at the firm level for the period 2003-2014. During this period, the national government set five different tax reforms, including changes in the statutory tax rates, tax credits and incentives for corporate investment. The effect of corporate taxation on investment is estimated by first determining the impact of taxation on the cost of capital by computing the effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs) at firm level. Then, we estimate the impact of the cost of capital on investment through a panel data regression. Endogeneity is controlled by an instrumental variable approach, simulating post-reform effective marginal tax rates under pre-reform firm characteristics. Results are robust with different control variables, although some significant differences by size and economic sector of the firm are found.
H32|How to Use One Instrument to Identify Two Elasticities|We show that an insight from taxation theory allows identification of both the supply and demand elasticities with only one instrument. Ramsey (1928) and subsequent models of taxation assume that a tax levied on the demand side only affects demand through the price after taxation. Econometrically, we show that this assumption functions as an additional exclusion restriction. Under the Ramsey Exclusion Restriction (RER) a tax reform can serve to simultaneously identify elasticities of supply and demand. We develop a TSLS estimator for both elasticities, a test to assess instrument strength and a test for the RER. Our result extends to a supply-demand system with J goods, and a setting with supply-side or non-linear taxes. Further, we show that key results in the sufficient statistics literature rely on the RER. One example is Harberger’s formula for the excess burden of a tax. We apply our method to the Norwegian labor market.
H32|Implausible Large Differences in the Sizes of Underground Economies in Highly Developed European Countries? A Comparison of Different Estimation Methods|In this paper, first, the MIMIC estimation method is described and criticized and due to a double counting problem a correction is suggested. Second, the measurement methods used for National Accounts Statistics – the discrepancy method and two new micro survey methods – are described and a third, a micro method, using a combination of company manager surveys and their knowledge to calibrate the size of the shadow economy in firms, is presented, too. Third, a detailed comparison of the four micro estimation methods with the MIMIC and the corrected MIMIC method are presented. One major result is that the corrected MIMIC method, especially, comes quite close to various types of lately developed micro survey methods.
H32|Taxation and corporate risk-taking|In the recent period of low growth, many governments look for ways to encourage economic activity. Risky investment by firms is an important source of macroeconomic growth. This paper contributes to recent literature on firm risk-taking by exploring if the corporate tax system can provide incentives for firms to undertake risky investment. To do so, we first model that the effect of taxes on firm risk-taking depends on loss offset possibilities. We then confirm our predictions empirically using a large international firm-level dataset. We find that firm risk-taking is positively and significantly related to the length of the tax loss carryback and carryforward periods and that this relation increases with the level of the tax rate. For firms that cannot expect to offset losses, higher tax rates reduce risk-taking. If loss offset is probable, however, corporate tax rates have a significant and positive effect on risk-taking.
H32|International Transfer Pricing and Tax Avoidance : Evidence from Linked Trade-Tax Statistics in the UK|This paper employs unique data on export transactions and corporate tax returns of UK multinational firms and finds that firms manipulate their transfer prices to shift profits to lower-taxed destinations. It uncovers three new findings on tax-motivated transfer mispricing in real goods. First, transfer mispricing increases substantially when taxation of foreign profits changes from a worldwide to a territorial approach in the UK, with multinationals shifting more profits into low-tax jurisdictions. Second, transfer mispricing increases with a firm's R&D intensity. Third, tax-motivated transfer mispricing is concentrated in countries that are not tax havens and have low-to-medium-level corporate tax rates.
H32|Assessing the Effects of Climate Policy on Companies' Greenhouse Gas Emissions|We study the effect of climate policy on companies’ greenhouse gas emissions using emissions data for the headquarters and subsidiaries of the world’s biggest manufacturing, energy, and utility companies. Our results suggest that financial incentives and legal requirements to audit energy use reduce companies’ emissions, whereas support schemes aimed at promoting the combined generation of heat and power increased emissions of non-utility companies and feed-in tariffs aimed at increasing the use of renewable energy sources for electricity generation increase emissions of utility companies. We also find loans and subsidies for energy efficiency improvements to increase emissions in the short term. In addition, our results provide a solid foundation for researchers seeking consistent and comparable estimates on the mitigation effects of typical climate policy instruments in a cross-country setting.
H32|Learning to Tax ?- Interjurisdictional Tax Competition under Incomplete Information|We present a multi-period model in which countries set source-based taxes without having precise information how their and their neighbours' tax rates affect the tax base. Countries can learn from past experience and from observing their neighbours' outcomes and/or tax policy choices. We consider the sequence of Markov perfect equilibria and show that the beliefs become more precise over time and, eventually, correct. The precision of beliefs in a given period increases in the number of observed countries. In equilibrium, tax rates are inefficiently low if the value of learning is positive and the pace of learning increases in the level of tax rates (because higher tax rates trigger larger tax base effects which helps learning); in the presence of fiscal externalities, tax rates are too homogeneous (because variance in tax policies enhances learning). If, due to fiscal externalities, the value of learning is negative, the opposite may be true. From the viewpoint of empirical measurement, the model generates time patterns that look as if countries react to each other even if there are no fiscal externalities. We conclude that the existing evidence may therefore be inconclusive with regard to the existence of tax competition.
H32|The Effect of Disaggregate Information on the Expectation Formation of Firms|This paper studies a new aspect of firms’ expectation formation by asking whether expectations primarily reflect aggregate, industry-wide information (e.g., industry trends) or disaggregate information (e.g., firm-specific information). First, we show that disaggregate information is strongly associated with expectations even when controlling for aggregate information at high-dimensional industry levels. Moreover, aggregate and disaggregate information explain comparable shares of the variance in expectations. Second, we exploit a natural experiment to identify the causal effect of new information on expectations. The predictable demand effects for durable goods due to the German VAT increase of 2007 implied that, at the time, durable goods retailers had access to more reliable information about their future demand than non-durable goods retailers. Utilizing this observation in a difference-in-differences design, we find that “treated” firms were significantly more forward-looking ahead of the VAT-induced demand shifts. Overall, our results suggest that firms rationally incorporate disagreggate information into their expectations.
H32|Essays on the Behavior of Firms and Politicians|Die vorliegende Dissertation besteht aus sechs eigenständigen Kapiteln, die vom Verhalten von Firmen und Politikern im weiteren Sinne handeln. Nach einer Einführung in die Thematik wird im ersten Teil der Dissertation ausgeführt, wie institutionelle und politische Rahmenbedingungen das Verhalten von Firmen beeinflussen. In Kapitel 2 werden die Einflussgrößen von Schenkungen von Betriebsvermögen in deutschen Familienunternehmen untersucht. Umfrageergebnisse zeigen, dass bei größeren Unternehmen und bei Unternehmen mit guter Geschäftslage die Schenkungswahrscheinlichkeit stieg. In Kapitel 3 wird untersucht, wie politische Unsicherheit Investitionsentscheidungen von Unternehmen beeinflusst, wofür Daten über realisierte Investitionsquoten, Investitionspläne und -revisionen verwendet werden. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die realisierten Investitionsquoten in den Jahren, in denen Landtagswahlen stattfanden im Durchschnitt niedriger waren als in Jahren, in denen keine Landtagswahlen stattfanden. Unternehmen schienen jedoch schon bei der Investitionsplanung die Wahlunsicherheit zu antizipieren, denn sie revidierten ihre Pläne kaum. In Kapitel 4 wird untersucht, ob politische Unsicherheit beeinflusst, wie Unternehmer ihre aktuelle Geschäftslage und zukünftige Geschäftsentwicklung wahrnehmen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass Unternehmer erwarteten, dass ihr Geschäft sich besser vor Landtagswahlen und schlechter nach Landtagswahlen entwickeln wird. Der zweite Teil dieser Dissertation untersucht, wie ideologische Orientierung und Eigeninteresse von Politikern ihr Ethos und Verhalten prägen. Kapitel 5 beschreibt, wie ideologische Orientierung Einstellungen und Handlungen von Politikern in Deutschland prägt. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass Worte und Taten deutscher Landespolitiker und -regierungen in Bezug auf Haushaltskonsolidierung und Schuldenbremsen voneinander abgewichen haben. In Kapitel 6 wird untersucht, ob Parteien Politiker, die in namentlichen Abstimmungen von der Parteilinie abweichen, bestrafen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen nicht, dass Parteien das Abstimmungsverhalten beachteten und Politiker bestraften, die gegen die Parteienlinie gestimmt haben. In Kapitel 7 wird untersucht, inwiefern unterschiedliche ideologische Orientierungen der deutschen Wirtschaftsforschungsinstitute die Politikberatung in der Gemeinschaftsdiagnose beeinflusst haben.
H32|Handelseffekte von Grenzkontrollen|Eine neue empirische Untersuchung des ifo Instituts zeigt, dass selbst bei einem vollständigen Zusammenbruch des Schengen-Raums das BIP in Deutschland lediglich zwischen 4 und 11 Mrd. Euro pro Jahr sinken würde; die weitaus realistischere Wiedereinführung von Kontrollen an den Flüchtlingsrouten würde zu Effekten zwischen 1 und 3 Mrd. Euro führen. Für Österreich liegen die Verluste bei 80 bis 210 Mio. Euro. Diese Kosten machen jedoch nur einen Bruchteil jener Belastungen aus, die durch fortgeführte ungeregelte Massenzuwanderung entstehen würden.
H32|Handelseffekte von Grenzkontrollen|Das am 26. März 1995 in Kraft gesetzte Schengener Abkommen hat einen Europäischen Binnenraum der Personenfreizügigkeit geschaffen und damit ein beispielloses kontinentales Integrationsziel erreicht. Die Bedrohung durch globalen Terrorismus sowie ein starker Anstieg der Flüchtlingszahlen in Europa seit Sommer 2015 haben eine Grundsatzdebatte darüber hervorgerufen, inwieweit offene Binnengrenzen politisch und ökonomisch haltbar sind. Diese Studie adressiert drei Fragestellungen: Wie stark wird die Reisezeit durch Grenzkontrollen beeinträchtigt? Beeinflusst die Abschaffung der Grenzkontrollen durch das Schengener Abkommen den grenzüberschreitenden Handel in Waren und Dienstleistungen? Welche Wohlfahrtseffekte sind aufgrund einer Veränderung internationaler Handelsvolumina in Folge einer Wiedereinführung von Grenzkontrollen im Schengen-Raum zu erwarten? Die Studie findet, dass die Überwindung von Ländergrenzen innerhalb des Schengen-Raumes um etwa 20 Minuten schneller gelingt als zwischen zwei Ländern, von denen mindestens eines nicht dem Schengen-Raum angehört. Eine Wiedereinführung der Grenzkontrollen im Schengen-Raum würde die bilateralen Warenexporte je Grenzübertritt um 2,7% reduzieren; entspricht einem Zolläquivalent von 0,54%. Die bilateralen Dienstleistungsexporte je Grenzübertritt würden um 4,2% reduziert; entspricht einem Zolläquivalent von 0,82%. Die deutschen BIP Einbußen durch einen vollständigen Zusammenbruch des Schengen-Raumes lägen zwischen 4 und 11 Mrd. Euro pro Jahr. Die weitaus realistischere Wiedereinführung von Kontrollen an den Flüchtlingsrouten würde für Deutschland zu BIP Effekten zwischen -1 und -3 Mrd. Euro jährlich führen. Ähnliche Analysen wurden für Bayern, Österreich und die Europäische Union durchgeführt.
H32|Tax morale and the role of social norms and reciprocity: Evidence from a randomized survey experiment|We present the first randomized survey experiment in the context of tax compliance to assess the role of social norms and reciprocity for intrinsic tax morale. We find that participants in a reciprocity treatment have significantly higher tax morale than those in a social-norm treatment. This suggests that a potential backfire effect of social norms is outweighed if the consequences of violating the social norm are made salient. We further document the anatomy of intrinsic motivations for tax compliance and present first evidence that previously found gender effects in tax morale are not driven by differences in risk preferences.
H32|Banks Defy Gravity in Tax Havens|This paper provides the first quantitative assessment of the contribution of global banks in intermediating tax evasion. Applying gravity equations on a unique regulatory dataset based on comprehensive individual country-by-country reporting from all the Systemically Important Banks the European Union, we find that: 1) Tax havens generate a threefold extra presence of foreign banks; 2) The favorite destinations of tax evasion intermediated by European banks are Luxembourg and Monaco 3) British and German banks display the most aggressive strategies in tax havens; 4) New transparency requirements imposed in 2015 have not changed European banks commercial presence in tax havens; 5) Banks intermediate EUROS 550 billion of offshore deposits, that is 5% of their origin countries' GDP.
H32|Tributación sobre las utilidades empresariales en Colombia: una comparación de los regímenes impositivos de antes y después de la ley 1819 de 2016|Este ensayo examina los principales cambios en la tributación empresarial en Colombia derivados de la Ley 1819 de 2016. La carga tributaria sobre las utilidades de las sociedades y sobre los dividendos recibidos por sus dueños se estima utilizando un enfoque de tarifas potenciales marginales, que permite valorar el efecto global de la reforma impositiva y los efectos de medidas individuales contenidas en ella, en comparación con lo que presumiblemente habría ocurrido si el régimen tributario precedente se hubiera mantenido vigente. En contra de la interpretación predominante en la teoría económica neoclásica, esas tarifas se describen como potenciales y no como efectivas debido a que no incorporan los efectos de la evasión y la traslación impositivas y a que están sujetas a las contingencias propias de los negocios. Los resultados indican que la carga tributaria potencial empresarial se reducirá de manera notoria en el período 2016-2022 como consecuencia de la reforma, anticipando la reducción que también se habría presentado bajo la legislación anterior. ****** This essay examines the main changes in business taxation in Colombia derived from Law 1819 of 2016. The tax burden on corporate profits and on dividends received by the stockholders is estimated using a marginal potential tax rates approach, which allows assessing the overall effect of the tax reform and the effects of individual measures contained therein, compared with what presumably would have occurred had the previous tax regime been maintained. Contrary to the prevailing interpretation in neoclassical economic theory, such rates are described as potential rather than as effective because they do not incorporate the effects of tax evasion and shifting, and are subject to a variety of business contingencies. The results indicate that the potential business tax burden will be noticeably reduced in the period 2016-2022 as a result of the reform, anticipating the reduction that would also have occurred under the previous legislation.
H32|Banks in Tax Havens: First Evidence based on Country-by-Country Reporting|Since the Great Financial Crisis, several scandals have exposed a pervasive light on banks' presence in tax havens. Taking advantage of a new database, this paper provides a quantitative assessment of the importance of tax havens in international banking activity. Using comprehensive individual country-by-country reporting from the largest banks in the European Union, we provide several new insights: 1) Tax havens attract large extra banking activity beyond the standard factors based on gravity equations; 2) For EU banks, the main tax havens are located within Europe: Luxembourg, Isle of Man and Guernsey rank at the top of the foreign affiliates; 3) Attractive low tax rates are not sufficient to drive extra activity; 4) High quality of governance is not a driver, but banks avoid countries with weakest governance; 5) Banks also avoid the most opaque countries; 6) The tax savings for EU banks is estimated between EUR 1 billion and EUR 3.6 billion.
H32|The long-term impact of trade with firm heterogeneity|After the emergence and development of heterogeneous firm trade models, some (most notably Arkolakis, Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare 2012, ACR) have argue that a family of these models (e.g. a Melitz-type model with Pareto distributed firms) do not add to the evaluation of welfare effects of freer trade. In this paper we expand that model in two directions: we introduce a very simple growth mechanism and we allow for asymmetric countries. Introducing simple dynamics in the heterogeneous firm model adds new static and dynamic effects to the well-known decrease in prices that increases welfare in the static model. The constant level of nominal expenditure is affected as firm selection changes the average value of firms which modifies consumers' resource constraint. The growth rate of real consumption is also affected by firm selection since greater average efficiency means a larger amount of resources are required to create a new variety. Country asymmetry yields differentiated results between countries. We provide a welfare formula comparable to that in ACR to show how the new mechanisms can interplay in our model and highlight the effects of firm heterogeneity in this context. In all cases net welfare results depend on parameter values which highlights how much welfare evaluations depend on region's characteristics.
H32|Are Tax Credits Effective in Developing Countries? The Recent Uruguayan Experience|Investment promotion through tax incentives has been a key component of the growth strategies pursued in Uruguay by the last three administrations. A new regime was estab- lished, regulated by Executive Decree 455, which implemented a major overhaul in the main channel for subsidizing investment. This regime immediately generated a battery of research- able questions about its effectiveness and efficiency. Using a large data set, first put together for this study from firm-level administrative records kept by the tax collection and pensions institutes between 2005 and 2011, we test the hypotheses of significant and positive effects of obtaining a tax credit through the new regime on investment and employment outcomes. A matched difference-in-differences strategy confirms that the promotion regime introduced in 2008 had a statistically significant effect on the firms’ rate of investment (around 11 percent), while the effects on employment growth rate were more ambiguous. These findings are but- tressed by several robustness tests. Further probing uncovers heterogeneity along the promotion timeline, with the greatest effect on the investment rate occurring in a project’s first year.
H32|Financial Transaction Taxes, Market Composition, and Liquidity|We use the introduction of a financial transaction tax (FTT) in France in 2012 to test competing theories on its impact. We find no support for the idea that an FTT improves market quality by affecting the composition of trading volume. Instead, our results are in line with the hypothesis that a lower trading volume reduces liquidity and in turn market quality. Consistent with theories of asset pricing under transaction costs, we document a shift in security holdings from shortâ€ term to longâ€ term investors. Finally, we find that moderate aggregate effects on market quality can mask large adjustments made by individual agents.
H32|Uncertainty and firm dividend policy—A natural experiment|We examine how firms respond to uncertainty around U.S. tax policy changes, namely the individual level tax rate increases set to take effect on January 1, 2011 and January 1, 2013. We provide evidence that firms time the uncertainty in the tax environment and revise their dividend policy to an expected tax increase. We find that firms are likely to initiate their dividends or intensively increase their existing dividend amount one year before the expected tax increase. In addition, in 2012 when there is much less uncertainty on dividend tax changes than in 2010, firms are less likely to initiate a regular dividend but are more likely to initiate special dividends. The results suggest that firms facing less tax uncertainty are less likely to make long-term commitments on regular dividend payments but are more likely to take advantage of the last-minute low tax benefits by issuing special dividends. Furthermore, the response to the possible elimination of a tax cut was strongest in firms with high levels of tax-affected ownership, supporting the argument that when facing policy uncertainty, firms behave to prepare for the worst scenarios from the viewpoint of the shareholders, which in this case is a tax increase.
H32|Sectors and the additionality effects of R&D tax credits: A cross-country microeconometric analysis|Do the additionality effects of R&D tax credits vary across sectors? The paper presents a micro- econometric analysis of this question for three countries: Norway, Italy and France. We use a panel of firm-level data from three waves of the Innovation Surveys carried out in these countries for 2004, 2006 and 2008. The study estimates input and output additionality effects of R&D tax credits in each of these economies, and it investigates how these effects differ across sectors characterized by different R&D orientation and competition conditions. The results point out that firms in industries with high R&D orientation have on average higher propensity to apply to R&D fiscal incentives schemes and stronger input and output additionality effects. Output additionality is found to differ among the three examined countries.
H32|Evaluación de una política de sustitución de energías fósiles para reducir las emisiones de carbono|Background: The energy reform from 2008 promotes the generation and use of renewable energy. Methods: The aim of this work is to evaluate the effectiveness of an environmental policy which promotes the replacement of fossil fuels with renewable energy through tax policy, using a general equilibrium model. Results: Results show that the efficacy of an environmental policy depends on the elasticity of substitution existing in the economy. Conclusions: It is crucial to invest in research and in the development of technology that promotes technological change and fosters greater use of renewable energy, particularly in the most polluting productive sectors in Mexico. It also shows that it is necessary to accelerate energy transition, using clean energy sources as part of the policies and strategies to mitigate greenhouse gases.// Antecedentes: La reforma energética del 2008 promueve la generación y el uso de las energías renovables. Métodos: El objetivo de este trabajo es evaluar la efectividad de una política ambiental que promueva la sustitución de energías fósiles, por energías renovables a través de una política fiscal, para ello se utiliza un modelo de equilibrio general. Resultados: Los resultados muestran que la eficacia de una política ambiental depende de la elasticidad de sustitución existente en la economía. Conclusiones: Resulta crucial invertir en la investigación y el desarrollo de tecnología que promueva el cambio tecnológico y propicie un mayor uso de las energías renovables, sobre todo en los sectores productivos más contaminantes en México. Asimismo, se muestra que es necesario acelerar una transición energética, que utilice fuentes de energía limpia, como parte de las políticas y estrategias de mitigación de gases de efecto invernadero.
H32|Quelle incidence du CICE sur les salaires et l'emploi ? Une évaluation pour la période 2014-2017 t2 sur données de branches|Ce Working paper prolonge et actualise l'article de Ducoudré, Heyer et Plane (2015) qui analysait les premiers effets du Crédit d'Impôt pour la Compétitivité et l'Emploi (CICE) sur l'emploi et les salaires en utilisant des données trimestrielles par branche fournies par les comptes nationaux. Ce travail s’inscrit dans le débat sur l'évaluation du CICE récemment ravivé par les résultats du dernier rapport du comité de suivi de ce dispositif (France Stratégie, 2017) montrant qu'il n’y avait pas de consensus sur l'ampleur de ses effets sur l'économie française . Cette mesure, actuellement remise en cause par le nouvel exécutif, aurait, selon ce comité, un effet « difficile à déceler sur les salaires » et « positif mais modéré » sur l'emploi. Mais, les conclusions de ce rapport sont prudentes et appellent à prolonger et à multiplier les analyses de ce disposit
H32|The effects of tax-deductible reserves on investment incentives| This paper investigates how tax-deductible reserves affect the incentive to invest. We consider two different variants: a periodization reserve (PER), which allows the firm to defer tax payments for a certain number of years, and an investment reserve (IVR), which postpones tax payments but has the particular goal of allowing the firm to finance investments from untaxed funds. The latter is assumed to include a penalty levied if the reserve is not used to cover investment. We find that PER lowers the effective tax rate and produces a smaller reduction in the firmâ€™s cost of capital. The impacts of IVR are more complex. With a low penalty, its effects equal those of PER. In both cases they could be mimicked more easily by a reduction in statutory tax rate. However, with a high penalty and high ceiling for allocations, IVR equals a neutral cash flow tax. Similarly, if the firm distributes maximum dividends (binding dividend constraint), both PER and IVR are investment neutral. These neutrality results only concern investment financed from retained profits.
H32|The Role of Transfer Prices in Profit-Shifting by U.S. Multinational Firms : Evidence from the 2004 Homeland Investment Act|"Using unique transaction-level microdata, this paper documents profit-shifting behavior by U.S. multinational firms via the strategic transfer pricing of intra-firm trade. A simple model reveals how differences in tax rates, both the corporate tax rates across countries and the dividend repatriation tax rate over time, affect the worldwide profit-maximizing transfer-prices set by firms for intra-firm exports and imports. I test the predictions of the model in the context of the 2004 Homeland Investment Act (HIA), a one-time tax repatriation holiday which generated a discreet change in the incentives for U.S. firms to shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions. Matching individual trade transactions by firm, product, country, mode-of-transport, and month across arms-length and related-party transactions (following Bernard, Jensen, and Schott (2006) ) yields a measure of the transfer-price wedge at a point in time. A difference-in-difference strategy reveals that this wedge responds as predicted by the model: In the period following passage of the HIA, the export transfer price wedge increased in low-tax relative to high-tax countries, while the import transfer price wedge exhibited the opposite behavior. Consistent with the form of tax avoidance known as ""round-tripping, the results imply $6 billion USD of under-reported U.S. exports, nearly $7 billion USD of over-reported U.S. imports, and roughly $2 billion USD in foregone U.S. corporate tax receipts."
H32|Fiscal policy and aggregate demand in the USA before, during, and following the Great Recession|Abstract We examine the direct effect of federal and subnational fiscal policy on aggregate demand in the USA by introducing the Fiscal Effect (FE) measure. FE can be decomposed into three components. Discretionary FE quantifies the effect of discretionary or legislated policy changes on aggregate demand. Cyclical FE captures the effect of the automatic stabilizers—changes in government taxes and spending arising from the business cycle. Residual FE measures the effect of all changes in government revenues and outlays which cannot be categorized as either discretionary or cyclical; for example, it captures the effect of the secular increase in entitlement program spending due to the aging of the population. Unlike other approaches, FE is a bottom-up approach that allows for differential effects on aggregate demand depending on the type and length of the policy change. Thus, FE is arguably the most detailed and comprehensive measure available of the stance of US fiscal policy in relation to aggregate demand. We use our new metric to examine the contribution of fiscal policy to growth in real GDP over the course of the Great Recession and current expansion. We compare this contribution to the contributions to growth in aggregate demand made by fiscal policy over past business cycles. In doing so, we highlight that the relatively strong support of government policy to GDP growth during the Great Recession was followed by a historically weak contribution over the course of the current expansion.
H32|International Transfer Pricing and Tax Avoidance: Evidence from Linked Trade-Tax Statistics in the UK|This paper employs unique data on export transactions and corporate tax returns of UK multinational firms and finds that firms manipulate their transfer prices to shift profits to lower-taxed destinations. It uncovers three new findings on tax-motivated transfer mispricing in real goods. First, transfer mispricing increases substantially when taxation of foreign profits changes from a worldwide to a territorial approach in the UK, with multinationals shifting more profits into low-tax jurisdictions. Second, transfer mispricing increases with a firm’s R&D intensity. Third, tax-motivated transfer mispricing is concentrated in countries that are not tax havens and have low-to-medium-level corporate tax rates.
H32|Who Benefits from State Corporate Tax Cuts? A Local Labor Markets Approach with Heterogeneous Firms|This paper estimates the incidence of state corporate taxes on the welfare of workers, landowners, and firm owners using variation in state corporate tax rates and apportionment rules. We develop a spatial equilibrium model with imperfectly mobile firms and workers. Firm owners may earn profits and be inframarginal in their location choices due to differences in location-specific productivities. We use the reduced-form effects of tax changes to identify and estimate incidence as well as the structural parameters governing these impacts. In contrast to standard open economy models, firm owners bear roughly 40 percent of the incidence, while workers and landowners bear 30-35 percent and 25-30 percent, respectively.
H32|Transfer Pricing by Multinational Firms: New Evidence from Foreign Firm Ownerships|Using a firm-level dataset of Danish exports between 1999-2006, we find robust evidence for profit shifting by multinational corporations. Our triple difference estimations exploit the response of export unit values to acquisitions of foreign affiliates and to changes in statutory corporate tax rates. This identification strategy corrects for a downward bias resulting from firms adjusting arm's length prices to obscure transfer price manipulations. We find that Danish multinationals reduce the unit values of their exports to low tax countries between 5.7 to 9.1 percent. This difference corresponds to a tax revenue loss of 3.24 percent of Danish multinationals' tax returns.

H32|Regulation, tax and capital structure: evidence from administrative data on Italian banks|This paper explores the effect of taxation on the capital structure of banks. For identification, we exploit exogenous regional variations in the rate of the Italian tax on productive activities (IRAP) using administrative, confidential data on regional banks provided by the Bank of Italy (1998-2011). We find that IRAP rate changes do not always lead to a change in banks’ leverage: banks close to the regulatory constraints do not change their leverage when tax rates change. This holds true for both tax cuts and tax hikes. Among less constrained entities, the leverage of smaller banks is more responsive to changes in tax rates than that of larger banks. Overall, the tax system has little effect on the capital structure of banks, especially for larger and possibly more systemically important institutions; regulatory constraints instead seem to be a first-order determinant. Our findings cast doubt on the role of the tax system as a cause or tool for addressing the negative externalities of excessive leverage in the banking system.
H32|Estimating the Short Run Effects of South Africa's Employment Tax Incentive on Youth Employment Probabilities using A Difference-in-Differences Approach|What effect did the introduction of the Employment Tax Incentive (ETI) have on youth employment probabilities in South Africa in the short run? The ETI came into effect on the 1st of January 2014. Its purpose is to stimulate youth employment levels and ease the challenges that many youth experience in finding their first jobs. Under the ETI, firms that employ youth are eligible to claim a deduction from their taxes due, for the portion of their wage bill that is paid to certain groups of youth employees. We utilize nationally representative Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS) data for the period from January 2011 to June 2014, and implement a difference-in-differences methodology at the individual level to identify the effects of the ETI on youth employment probabilities. Our primary finding is that the ETI did not have any statistically significant and positive effects on youth employment probabilities. The point estimate from our preferred regression is -0.005 and the 95% confidence interval is from -0.017 to 0.006. We thus obtain a fairly precisely estimated 'zero effect'. We also find no evidence that the ETI has resulted in an increase in the level of churning in the labour market for youth. What our results imply is that any decrease in tax revenues that arise from the ETI are effectively accruing to firms which, collectively, would have employed most of these youth even in the absence of the ETI. We conclude with a discussion of some of the policy implications of our findings.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

H32|Under Cover: Estimating the Existence of Profit-Shifting by MNCs in China|This paper investigates profit-shifting behaviour among a large sample of multinational corporations (MNCs) in China. While profit-shifting behaviour is difficult to observe directly, it can be inferred from the behaviour of firms. That is the approach taken by Egger, Merlo, & Wamser (2014, henceforth EM&W) in their seminal analysis of tax elasticity of German MNCs. They developed a two-component mixture model that categorized MNCs into tax “avoiders” and “non-avoiders” based upon the estimated elasticities of investment to taxes. We apply their approach to our sample of MNCs in China. Like EM&W we find evidence of two distinct groups of MNCs. One group is responsive to changes in taxes, reducing investment when taxes increase. The other group is unresponsive to taxes, so that investment is not significantly associated with changes in tax rates. We show that the characteristics of these groups closely match the “avoiders” and “non-avoiders” of EM&W’s sample. Even so, our estimated tax elasticities are much smaller than EM&W. This suggests that the extent of profit-shifting was relatively small during China’s period of preferential tax treatment for foreign investors.
H32|The unintended consequences of childcare regulation: Evidence from a regression discontinuity design|In several countries governments fund childcare provision but in many others it is privately funded as labor regulation mandates that firms have to provide childcare services. For this later case, there is no empirical evidence on the effects generated by the financial burden of childcare provision. In particular, there is no evidence on who effectively pays (firms or employees) and how (e.g., via wages and/or employment). Our hypothesis is that in imperfect labor markets, firms will transfer childcare cost on to their workers. To analyze this, we exploit a discontinuity in childcare provision mandated by Chilean labor regulation.
H32|Do tax incentives for research increase firm innovation? An RD design for R&D|We present the first evidence showing causal impact of research and development (R&D) tax incentives on innovation outcomes. We exploit a change in the asset-based size thresholds for eligibility for R&D tax subsidies and implement a Regression Discontinuity Design using administrative tax data on the population of UK firms. There are statistically and economically significant effects of the tax change on both R&D and patenting, with no evidence of a decline in the quality of innovation. R&D tax price elasticities are large at about 2.6, probably because the treated group is from a sub-population subject to financial constraints. There does not appear to be pre-policy manipulation of assets around the thresholds that could undermine our design, but firms do adjust assets to take advantage of the subsidy post-policy. We estimate that over 2006-11 business R&D would be around 10% lower in the absence of the tax relief scheme.
H32|Tackling Spillovers by Taxing Corporate Income in the European Union at Source|This paper surveys and evaluates the corporation tax (CT) systems of the Member States of the European Union on the basis of a comprehensive taxonomy of actual and potential regimes, which have as their base either profits, profits and interest, or economic rents. The current regimes give rise to various instate and interstate spillovers, which violate the basic tenets – neutrality and subsidiarity – of the single market. The trade-offs between the implications of these tenets – harmonization and diversity, respectively – can be reconciled by a bottom-up, reversible strategy of strengthening source-based taxation and approximating tax rates. The strategy starts with dual income taxation, proceeds with final source withholding taxes and rate approximation, and is made complete by comprehensive business income taxation. Common base taxation, if desired, should probably be left to the Member States themselves.
H32|Taxation, industry integration and production efficiency|Taxes levied on production processes (e.g. VAT), are today a very important source of government revenues in developed economies. Theories of optimal taxation conclude that these taxes are detrimental to production efficiency, when firms operate in perfectly competitive markets. These theories draw on the neoclassical approach, which regards firms as single production units. The present paper investigates the effects of taxation on production efficiency, accounting for the organization of an industry. The model shows that a lump-sum tax does not have any effect on the organization of the industry, while a non lump-sum tax can be designed that induces an organizational change of the industry. The paper shows that the effect of this ”tax induced organizational change” on production efficiency ultimately depends on the characteristics of the market.
H32|Investor Taxation, Firm Heterogeneity and Capital Structure Choice|We analyze the effect of investor level taxes, firm-specific ownership structure and firm-specific payout policy on firms’ capital structure choice. Our analysis is based on data for 10,983 firms from 13 Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries over the time period 2002-2012. Our results show a significant impact of the net tax benefit of debt on the debt ratio of firms. Ignoring firm heterogeneity, an increase in the net tax benefit of debt by 10 percentage points leads to an increase in the debt ratio of 2.49 percentage points. Taking into account investor-level taxation and firm heterogeneity, an increase in the net tax benefit of debt of 10 percentage points leads to an increase in the debt ratio of only 1.27 percentage points, if the firm’s largest individual domestic owner has more than 50% of the shares. If all individual domestic owners together have more than 50% of the shares, an increase in the net tax benefit of debt of 10 percentage points leads to a negligible increase in the debt ratio of 0.05 percentage points.
H32|The effects of size-based regulation on small firms: evidence from VAT threshold| Various types of size-based regulations for firms are typical in most countries (tax schedules, accounting rules, health and safety standards etc.). However, there is only limited evidence of how owners of small firms respond to such rules, and what are the underlying mechanisms behind the observed behavior. We study these questions by examining the effects of the value-added tax (VAT) sales threshold using tax register data on the universe of Finnish firms and their owners. We find sizable bunching of firms in the sales distribution just below the VAT threshold. This implies that small firms actively avoid VAT liability. We utilize variation in both the VAT rate and reporting requirements to provide compelling evidence that the response is caused by the compliance costs of VAT reporting rather than the size of the tax rate. This shows that the costs related to reporting and understanding taxes induce greater distortions than pure tax incentives, especially among low-income entrepreneurs. In addition, we find no explicit evidence of avoidance or evasion, which suggests that firms respond by reducing their true output. Also, bunching behavior is very permanent, implying that the VAT threshold hinders the growth of small firms.
H32|Electoral incentives and firm behavior: Evidence from U.S. power plant pollution abatement|Researchers have utilized the fact that many states have term limits (as opposed to being eligible for re-election) for governors to determine how changes in electoral incentives alter state regulatory agency behavior. This paper asks whether these impacts spill over into private sector decision-making. Using data from gubernatorial elections in the U.S., we find strong evidence that power plants spend less in water pollution abatement if the governor of the state where the plant is located is a term-limited democrat. We show that this evidence is consistent with compliance cost minimization by power plants reacting to changes in the regulatory enforce- ment. Finally, we show that the decrease in spending has environmental impacts as it leads to increased pollution.
H32|Shifting-Profits through Tax Loopholes. Evidence from Ecuador|Based on a natural experiment that took place in Ecuador in the context of a capital outflow tax, this paper presents suggestive evidence of the emergence of an abnormal transfer pricing behavior. We exploit the fact that some imports were eligible to a tax-credit measure aiming to offset the capital outflow tax. The identification strategy relies on the fact that a foreign multinational enterprise has only an incentive to increase the unit value -transfer price- for profit shifting motivations of products eligible to the tax-credit. Then, comparing the evolution of the unit value of eligible products (the treatment group) with that of non eligible products (the comparison group) before and after the tax-credit measure, we estimate the over-reporting incentive's impact on the reported value. Results show that the declared unit value of eligible imports increased following the introduction of the tax-credit measure. Various tests suggest that this abnormal increase is attributable to a profit-shifting behavior.
H32|Corporate investment decisions under political uncertainty|I investigate how political uncertainty influences corporate investment decisions employing a unique panel dataset of German manufacturing firms. I use data on firms’ self-reported investment realizations, plans and revisions. The firm-specific user cost of capital captures the current institutional framework, but does not reflect the uncertainty about changes in government policies firms are faced with. I therefore augment the neo-classical investment model by a measure of political uncertainty resulting from the electoral process. The results show that realized investment ratios decreased by 10.5% in years when state elections occurred relative to the average investment ratio in years with no state election. Firms however seem to anticipate electoral uncertainty already when making investment plans and hardly revise their plans. Investment revisions occur because of updated information about realized sales growth and not because of resolved electoral uncertainty. I also find that electoral uncertainty negatively influences add-on investments which face a high degree of irreversibility, while non-capacity expanding investments are not influenced by electoral uncertainty.
H32|Does political uncertainty influence firm owners‘ business perceptions?|Using microdata that serve as the foundation of the ifo Business Climate Index, Germany’s leading business cycle indicator, I examine whether political uncertainty influences how firm owners perceive their present state and future development of business. I use state election months as indicators of times of high political uncertainty. The results show that firm owners are optimistic regarding their expected business development before state elections. After state elections firms change their expectations and expect their business to develop worse. It is conceivable that firm owners are more optimistic prior to state elections because politicians promised individual policies to gratify the firms’ needs during election times. Firms might be disappointed after elections as the promises made during election campaigns by politicians turn out to be empty words.
H32|La responsabilidad institucional pública: un análisis para el mejoramiento de la gestión y la gerencia en la administración pública|Las crecientes demandas de organizaciones sociales y defensoras de Derechos Humanos frente a la gestión de las Entidades públicas y privadas, exigen que éstas busquen superar la simple producción de bienes o servicios a usuarios internos y externos, en razón a que los ciudadanos reclaman una relación basada en su reconocimiento como sujetos de derechos y en una gestión ética que no se limite a la básica aplicación formal de normas legales. Desde esta perspectiva, en el marco de la Responsabilidad social y partiendo del concepto de lo público (en el que está implícito lo social), este estudio pretende señalar lineamientos para la construcción de la Responsabilidad Institucional Pública (RIP) -equivalente a la Responsabilidad Social Empresarial del sector privado-, con el fin de contribuir al fortalecimiento del sentido misional y legitimidad de las Entidades Estatales, desde una llamada a lo ético; ello, a partir de los resultados del diagnóstico de las prácticas de RIP evidenciadas en tres entidades del sector público colombiano: una entidad del nivel ejecutivo central, una empresa social del estado(ejecutora) y un organismo de control . De los resultados obtenidos se encuentra que, el factor que alcanza mayor coincidencia en la afirmación de tales prácticas, es el de transparencia (en lo que hace referencia al cumplimiento de requisitos formales); en tanto que el de desarrollo del capital humano, es en el que se da menor reconocimiento de su aplicación.
H32|Monopoly Power and Endogenous Product Variety: Distortions and Remedies|The inefficiencies related to endogenous product creation and variety under monopolistic competition are two-fold: one static—the misalignment between consumers and producers regarding the value of a new variety; and one dynamic—time variation in markups. Quantitatively, the welfare costs of the former are potentially very large relative to the latter. For a calibrated version of our model with these distortions, their total cost amounts to 2 percent of consumption. Appropriate taxation schemes can implement the optimum amount of entry and variety. Elastic labor introduces a further distortion that should be corrected by subsidizing labor at a rate equal to the markup for goods, in order to preserve profit margins and hence entry incentives.
H32|Optimal Taxation and R&D Policies|We study the optimal design of firm taxation and R&D subsidies in a dynamic model in which the returns to R&D investment by firms are heterogeneous across firms and uncertain over time. A firm's quality and risky returns are private information. We use a mechanism design approach to solve for the optimal taxation of firms and R&D policies over the firms' life cycle. We highlight the crucial parameters and elasticities that determine the sign and magnitude of the optimal policies. We calibrate the model to U.S. firm data to quantitatively illustrate the evolution of the optimal taxes and subsidies over firms' life cycles. Finally, we evaluate the performance of simpler tax and subsidy instruments, namely linear taxes and R&D subsidies, size-dependent, or firm age-dependent policies.
H32|Taxation, Industry Integration and Production Efficiency|Taxes levied on production processes (e.g. VAT), are today a very important source of government revenues in developed economies. Theories of optimal taxation conclude that these taxes are detrimental to production efficiency, when firms operate in perfectly competitive markets. These theories draw on the neoclassical approach, which regards firms as single production units. The present paper investigates the effects of taxation on production efficiency, accounting for the organization of an industry. The model shows that a lump-sum tax does not have any effect on the organization of the industry, while a non lump-sum tax can be designed that induces an organizational change of the industry. The paper shows that the effect of this ”tax induced organizational change” on production efficiency ultimately depends on the characteristics of the market.
H32|The Paradox of Effective Labor Regulation|Why some countries choose a combination of highly protective laws and little enforcement is a puzzle that cannot be rationalized with traditional explanations. This paper collects administrative, legal and household survey data to emphasize a stylized fact about labor regulation that has been generally overlooked – countries with more protective employment regulations tend to enforce these regulations less, and usually focus their enforcement efforts on large firms.
H32|Fiscal Support and Earnings Management|It is well documented that firms tend to manipulate earnings before IPO (initial public offerings) and SEO (seasoned equity offerings). This study contributes to the literature by providing the first evidence on whether and how fiscal support in the form of preferential tax treatment and financial subsidy affects a firm's earnings management behaviors. Using data for Chinese firms that have conducted IPO and SEO, I find that firms have a lower level of earnings management prior to the offerings if they enjoy more preferential tax treatment or more financial subsidies from local governments. My results are consistent with the view that firms that receive stronger fiscal support have smaller demand for earnings management, which is a costly tool for a firm to achieve its desired earnings targets.
H32|Finance methodology of Free Cash Flow|Free Cash Flow (FCF) was adopted in the late 1980s as a financial tool to evaluate the firm and its individual projects. We question the procedure of calculating the FCF where a significant portion of Current Liabilities is offset against Current Assets, thereby creating the hybrid asset Net Working Capital (NWC). Borrowed from accounting methodology, that procedure distorts the FCF size, composition, volatility, and estimated value. Our empirical analysis shows that the nature and extent of those distortions can misinform the firm's stockholders, lenders and borrowers, and investors at large. We propose a revised FCF that would avoid those distortions.
H32|Trade and growth with heterogeneous firms revisited|In a recent paper, Baldwin and Robert-Nicoud (2008) explore the growth and welfare effects of trade liberalization in a model with firm heterogeneity that allows for endogenous growth and a diversity of innovation mechanisms. Their main welfare conclusion is that freer trade has an unambiguously positive static effect while the sign of the dynamic effect, stemming from the change in the growth rate of varieties, depends on the type of technology imposed for innovations. This paper revisits these conclusions. By carefully following algebraic expressions in the original work, we point at inaccuracies and explore their consequences. Our main finding is that the sign of the static effect is not always positive. Consumers may experience an immediate loss from openness if the value of the firms they own decreases due to greater import competition. Moreover, the sign of the static effect on expenditure is always the opposite to that of the dynamic effect stemming from variety growth, so the results presented here highlight the existing tension between static and dynamic effects. Our results speak to the most recent literature on welfare effects in trade models.
H32|The impact of social pressure on tax compliance: A field experiment|We study the effect of social pressure on tax compliance, focusing on the compliance of shop sellers to the legal obligation of releasing tax receipts for each sale. We carry out a field experiment on bakeries in Italy, where a strong gap exists between the legal obligation and the actual behavior of sellers. Social pressure is manipulated by means of an explicit request for a receipt when not released. We employ an innovative approach to the identification of the treatment effect. We find that a single request for a receipt causes a 17 per cent rise in the probability of a receipt being released for a sale occurring shortly thereafter, causing on average more than two receipts to be released. We also find strong evidence of persistence in compliance decisions.
H32|The evolution of firm-level distributions for Ukrainian manufacturing firms|We document rich variation across observed firms’ characteristics, and the accompanying macroeconomic volatility, often related to political turmoil for Ukrainian manufacturing firms. We use a unique annual firm-level data for the period from 2001 to 2009 compiled from the Derzhkomstat. To understand the evolution of distributions we utilize functional principal component analysis while accounting for the effects associated with firms’ region, industry, trade status, and firm turnover. The overall improvements in firm productivity in Ukraine’s manufacturing in 2001–2009 vary substantially by industry, trade status and with firm turnover, while regional effects are less important.
H32|Corruption and firm tax evasion|Although corruption and tax evasion are distinct and separate problems, they can easily become intertwined and reinforcing. A society that is more corrupt may enable more tax evasion as corrupt officials seek more income via bribes; conversely, higher levels of tax evasion may drive corruption by offering more opportunities for bribes. While a large body of work on each subject separately has emerged, the relationship between the two problems has remained a largely unexplored area. This paper focuses on how the potential for bribery of tax officials affects a firm's tax evasion decisions. To test how the potential for bribery affects a firm's tax reporting decisions, we use firm-level information on reporting obtained from the World Enterprise Survey and the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey. Our basic estimation approach uses instrumental variables methods to control for the potential endogeneity of evasion and corruption. We also use propensity score matching methods as a robustness check. Our results show that it is corruption that largely drives higher levels of evasion; that is, corruption of tax officials is a statistically and economically significant determinant of tax evasion. The presence of tax inspectors who request bribes results in a reduction of sales reported for taxes of between 4 and 10 percentage points. Additionally, larger bribes result in higher levels of evasion. Overall these results indicate that governments seeking to decrease tax evasion – and so increase tax revenues – must work first to ensure an honest tax administration.
H32|The impact of depreciation savings on investment: Evidence from the corporate Alternative Minimum Tax|Over the past decade, the United States has offered investment incentives in the form of larger depreciation savings, namely, bonus depreciation. The neoclassical investment model implies that investment responds to changes in depreciation savings, but there have been few direct attempts to investigate this implication. This paper examines investment patterns surrounding the 1999 shortening of the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) depreciation recovery periods, finding strong evidence that firms subject to the AMT increase investment in response to the AMT reform. The empirical results show that firms subject to the AMT increase their investment, measured as the ratio of capital expenditures to capital stock, by around 0.0418 to 0.0622, compared to firms subject to the regular tax. Given their average annual investment rate of approximately 0.27 during this period, the results imply a relative increase in investment of 15%--23%. By contrast, I find that the 2002 introduction of bonus depreciation, available both for firms subject to the regular tax and for firms subject to the AMT, affects both groups of firms similarly. The estimation uses an empirical specification developed from the Summers (1981) tax-adjusted q model, and the results imply that the responsiveness of investment to the tax term is somewhat larger than previously estimated.
H32|On the implications of introducing cross-border loss-offset in the European Union|This article investigates a tax competition model where countries compete for capital and profits of multinational enterprises (MNEs) through statutory tax rates and cross-border loss-offset provisions, which allow a transfer of foreign subsidiaries' losses to the parent company. A joint implementation of full cross-border loss-relief is welfare maximizing, because it ensures production efficiency and no profit shifting in equilibrium. Local governments choose zero level of the loss-relief in a noncooperative equilibrium, if only capital is mobile and relax the loss-offset, when MNEs engage in profit shifting. Therefore, allowing multinationals to undertake international tax planning activities may be welfare-improving in our model.
H32|Ownership and exit behavior: evidence from the home health care market|In the US health care system a high fraction of suppliers are not-for-profit companies. Some argue that non-profits are “for-profits in disguise” and I test this proposition in a quasi-experimental way by examining the exit behavior of home health care firms after a legislative change considerably reduced reimbursed visits per patient. The change allows me to construct a cross provider measure of restriction in reimbursement and to use this measure and time-series variation due to the passage of the law in my estimates. I find that exits among for-profit firms are higher than those of not-for-profit firms, rejecting the null that these sectors responded to the legislation in similar ways. In addition, my results expand the view that “not-for-profit” firms are a form of “trapped capital.” There is little capital investment in the home health care market, so the higher exit rates of for-profit firms after the law change indicate the possible role of labor inputs in generating differences in exit behavior across sectors.
