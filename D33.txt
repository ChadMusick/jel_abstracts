D33|Labor Shares in Some Advanced Economies|We study the joint impact of three measurement issues in the empirical literature on the labor share: (i) start and end periods for the empirical analysis; (ii) accounting for self-employment; and (iii) accounting for residential real estate income. When we correct for these three potential biases, we do not find a general decline in the labor share in our sample of advanced economies. In that respect the behavior of the US labor share after 2000 presents a puzzle.
D33|Firm Heterogeneity and the Aggregate Labour Share|Using a static model of firm behaviour with imperfect competition on the product and labour markets, we quantify the effect of firm heterogeneity in total factor productivity, market power, capital, wages and prices on the aggregate labour share. In particular, we suggest a new decomposition of the aggregate labour share in terms of the first moments of the joint distribution of these variables across firms, providing a bridge between the micro and the macro approach to functional distribution. We provide an application of our method to the UK manufacturing sector, using firm-level data for the period 1998-2014. The analysis confirms that heterogeneity matters: in an economy populated only by representative firms, the labour share would be 10 percentage points lower. Among all the dimensions studied, heterogeneity in total factor productivity and labour market power are the most relevant ones, whereas heterogeneity in product market power matters the least, with wages and prices in between. However, the observed fall in the aggregate labour share over the period is mostly explained by a widening of the disconnect between average productivity and real wages, with a smaller role for an increase in the average product and labour market power of firms after the Great Recession, while changes in the dispersion of these variables mostly offset each other.
D33|The inflation-distribution nexus: a theoretical and empirical approach|There are two unconnected strands of the inflation-distribution literature, one that studies the impact of inflation on income distribution and the other the impact of distribution on inflation. This paper is an attempt to fill a gap in this literature, by taking into account the simultaneous determination between inflation and income distribution. We set forth a Post-Keynesian model in which inflation and income distribution are jointly determined in a dynamical system of difference equations. The theoretical framework advanced in the paper allows us to show that conflicting claims on income, expectation formation and the realisation of increasing returns to scale ascribed to demand-pull and distributive factors also play a key role in the determination of the inflation and income distribution dynamics. Then, we conducted an empirical investigation of the relationship between inflation and distribution. Both empirical exercises were done using GMM estimator. This econometric technique is robust to reverse causality as it uses lagged observations in difference and level of endogenous variables as instruments and hence is the preferred method of estimation. Our findings corroborate our theoretical model by showing that, in average, increases in the wage share tend to exert a downward pressure in future inflation. Our estimates also show that the wage share is highly dependent of its past values, thus suggesting that income distribution may be only sensitive to autonomous (political) factors.
D33|Factor reallocation and growth: what if there are labor saving innovations?|We claim that the standard methodology to study the effects of the reallocation of factors on growth is not adequate in the presence of biased innovations. Labor-saving innovations increase output per worker and may decrease the marginal productivity of labor. Therefore, a reallocation of labor from a sector with higher output per worker to a sector with lower output per worker may be productivity enhancing.
D33|Birth Rates, Factor Shares, and Growth|Increases in capital shares affect the marginal productivity of capital, stimulating capital accumulation. Can a decrease in labor shares reduce the supply of labor? We explore this question using a model of fertility inspired by Caldwell (1982) and Boldrin and Jones (2002). Individuals may transfer wealth to the future in two ways: by saving and by having children. Raising children has a cost in terms of current consumption but generates future income through intergenerational transfers. In this setting, a redistribution of income from labor to capital affects the return of savings and children in opposite ways and generates incentives for more savings and fewer children. Two pieces of evidence motivate our model. First, recent historical evidence shows that the increases in capital shares that preceded the Industrial Revolution coincided with falling birth rates. Second, for current developed economies, changes in labor shares correlate positively with changes in fertility rates, and negatively with changes in saving rates.
D33|Redistributive Growth|We study long term effects of the technological shift to intangible capital, whose creation relies on the commitment of skilled human capital in firm production. Humancapital cannot be owned, so firms need less financing. Human capital cannot be credibly committed so firms need to reward it by deferred compensation, diluting future profits. As human capital income is not tradeable, total investable assets fall. The general equilibrium effect is a gradual fall in interest rates and a re-allocation of excess savings into rising valuations of existing assets such as real estate. The concomitant rise in house prices and wage inequality leads to higher household leverage.
D33|Explorando los cambios de la pobreza en Argentina: 2003-2015|Este trabajo explora los cambios en la pobreza de ingresos en Argentina durante el período 2003-2015 utilizando diversas metodologías de descomposición. Los resultados sugieren que la mejora generalizada en el mercado laboral luego de la crisis fue el principal factor detrás de la fuerte caída de la pobreza en el período 2003-2007. En contraste, la reducción de la pobreza durante la etapa 2007-2011 está asociada al papel más activo que tomó la política social. Finalmente, durante el período 2011-2015 ningún factor contribuyó significativamente a la reducción de la pobreza. This paper explores the changes in income poverty in Argentina during the period 2003-2015 using various decomposition methodologies. The results suggest that the generalized improvement in the labor market after the crisis was the main factor behind the sharp fall in poverty in the period 2003-2007. In contrast, the reduction of poverty between 2007 and 2011 is associated with the most active role played by social policy. Finally, during the period 2011-2015, no factor could contribute significantly to the reduction of poverty
D33|Pobreza Crónica en Datos de Corte Transversal: Estimaciones para Argentina|El objetivo de esta nota es contribuir a la medición de la pobreza crónica en un contexto de ausencia de paneles largos. Se propone asociar pobreza crónica a la alta probabilidad de haber sido pobre en los distintos escenarios del pasado. Se argumenta que la pobreza crónica así definida aproxima mejor a los hogares de alta vulnerabilidad que la típica caracterización en función de la insuficiencia de ingresos, o de un número limitado de atributos no monetarios.
D33|Sraffian Indeterminacy in General Equilibrium Revisited|In contrast to Mandler's (1999a; Theorem 6) impossibility result about the Sraffian indeterminacy of the steady-state equilibrium, we first show that any regular Sraffian steady-state equilibrium is indeterminate in terms of Sraffa (1960) under the simple overlapping generation economy. Moreover, we also check that this indeterminacy is generic. These results are obtained by explicitly defining a simple model of overlapping generation economies with Leontief production techniques, in which we also explain the main source of the difference between our results and Mandler (1999a; section 6).
D33|Sraffa, saggio di interesse, sistema fiscale|This paper covers three closely interrelated stages. The first regards Sraffa’s theory. It is argued in particular that: a) Sraffa’s 1925 and 1926 articles are closely linked to Production of Commodities by means of Commodities, inasmuch they state the minimal cost, which informs indirectly the 1960 book; b) minimum costs are linear and parallel to the x axis in competition, so they are independent of the quantity produced; c) any deviation from this situation entails rents; d) rents can derive from decreasing returns (agriculture, mines) or from increasing returns (oligopoly, monopoly). Sraffa’s system solutions are discussed in depth. Particular attention is attached to the determination of the rate of interest. This leads to interconnections with the Keynesian system, which are developed in the second stage. Here the necessity emerges of rendering structural what it now conjunctural, pushing the rate of interest towards zero. This target can be reached by a fiscal instrument, i.e. by levying a tax on gross interest, close to 100%. Thus public debt ceases to be a risk, and the public deficit may increase, as happens in the majority of countries worldwide. The third stage regards the fiscal system. To obtain a similar treatment of interest, and also to try to hit oligopolies effectively, we need to render the fiscal system global. The problem arises with the remaining fiscal structure, now dominated by the principle of a worldwide basis. It is shown that this circumstance has to cease, and that internal revenue must be collected on bases which are exclusively internal. Therefore primarily the direct taxation, and then the indirect, must be reshaped. It is most interesting that a consonance is found with the taxation in vigour up the Seventies, and with De Viti theory of fiscal systems, which is national and based on the benefit principle.
D33|Distributional change: Assessing the contribution of household income sources|We develop a decomposition of distributional change by factor components to quantify how changes in the association between sources of income and changes in their marginal distributions contribute to the change in the distribution of household incomes over time. The two components are further broken down to isolate the contribution of specific income sources. Application to the change in the distribution of household incomes in Luxembourg between 2004 and 2013 reveals contrasted results: increased association between spouse earnings, public transfers, and taxes depressed the income share of poor households while changes in marginal distributions increased incomes in the upper half of the distribution.
D33|Labour Productivity, Wages and the Functional Distribution of Income in Portugal: A Sectoral Approach|The main purpose of this paper is to studythe functional distribution of income in Portugal in the long run, considering the period between 1953 and 2017. The labour share in income or value added depends on two fundamental variables, the labour productivity and the average labour compensation.The trends of these variables are quantified, for the aggregate economy and for its main productive sectors. An interesting result emerges, namely the different dynamics across sectors, both for the (unadjusted)wage share (considering only the wages of employees) and for the adjusted labour share (considering also as labour compensation one fraction of mixed income). Moreover, a shift-share analysis is used, in order to distinguish the importanceof each sector’s wage share evolution (“within”effect) and the changes in each sector’s weight (structural changes, or “between”effect). Finally, a first attempt to incorporate the effect of wage inequalityon the functional distribution of income is made, subtracting the labour compensation of the highest paid workers (top 10%, 5% and 1%) in order to calculate the wage share of the (so-called) typical workers.
D33|Which Ladder to Climb? Decomposing Life Cycle Wage Dynamics|Wages grow and become more unequal as workers age. Economic theory focuses on worker investment in human capital, search for employers, and residual wage shocks to account for these life cycle wage dynamics. We highlight the importance of jobs: collections of tasks and duties defined by employers within the production process. We provide empirical evidence that climbing the career ladder toward jobs characterized by more responsibility, complexity, and autonomy accounts for the largest part of life cycle wage dynamics. It accounts for 50% of average wage growth, 50% of rising differences between gender, and virtually all of rising dispersion within gender over the life cycle.
D33|Rethinking growth and distribution in the US: Financial, healthcare and professional-business services as intermediate consumption of the economy|Since the 1980s, financial, healthcare and professional-business services (PBS) have grown rapidly and produced more of the US value-added, however, these services do not produce final uses for households. This paper explores the impacts of treating finance, healthcare, and PBS as intermediate consumption of the economy on US growth rates, decomposition of expenditures, and distribution of income over 1947-2017. After adjustments to the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPAs), the annual per capita growth declines by one-fourth after 1980, decomposition of expenditures changes in favor of investment and government spending, and the compensation of employees (CE) share of output declines sharply as more than 90% of the expenditures on finance, healthcare and PBS are financed out of CE. Average CE stagnates even though labor productivity continues to grow after adjustments; thus creating a productivity gap. The current treatment of finance, healthcare, and PBS in the NIPAs not only overestimates growth but also understates income inequality.
D33|Labour share developments over the past two decades: The role of public policies|Labour share developments over the past two decades have differed widely across OECD countries, with about half of them experiencing significant declines. This paper analyses the role of public policies in shaping labour share developments across countries. The results suggest that pro-competition product market reforms raise the labour share by reducing producer rents. Labour market reforms that strengthen the bargaining position of workers, such as tightening employment protection or raising minimum wages, may raise wages in the short term but risk triggering the substitution of capital for labour in the medium term. On average, across countries, such reforms are estimated to reduce the labour share. By contrast, promoting the re-employment of workers who lose their jobs through active labour market policies unambiguously raises the labour share.
D33|Demand and distribution regimes, output hysteresis, and cyclical dynamics in a Kaleckian model|This study analyses the interaction of demand, income distribution, and natural output level in a dynamic Kaleckian model with output hysteresis. Hysteresis means that the natural output level depends on the path of the demand-driven actual output level. We consider wage-led and profit-led demand regimes and goods market-led and labour market-led income distribution regimes. We find that the stability of the steady state is closely related to hysteresis in certain regimes. Limit cycles can arise when the strong flexibility of either prices or wages to the output gap is combined with a moderate degree of natural output hysteresis. We make the persuasive case that a Kaleckian model with a wage-led demand regime and anticyclical profit share is less unstable and that pseudo-Goodwin cycles can arise in the profit-led demand regime with a procyclical profit share.
D33|Rich and ever richer: Differential returns across socio-economic groups|This paper estimates rates of return across the gross wealth distribution in eight European countries. Like differential saving rates, differential rates of return matter for Post Keynesian theory, because they impact the income and wealth distribution and add an explosive element to growth models. We show that differential rates of return matter empirically by merging data on household balance sheets with long-run returns for individual asset categories. We find that (1) the composition of wealth differentiates between three socioeconomic groups: 30% are asset-poor, 65% are middle-class home owners, and the top 5% are business-owning capitalists; (2) rates of return rise across all groups; and (3) rates of return broadly follow a log-shaped function across the distribution, where inequality in the lower half of the distribution is higher than in the upper half. If socioeconomic groups are collapsed into the bottom 95% workers and top 5% capitalists, then rates of return are 5.6% for the former and 7.2% for the latter.
D33|Does Marginal Productivity Mean Anything in Real Economic Life ?|The equality between factor pay and marginal product is a major component of the neoclassical paradigm. The paper begins with a brief historical review of this principle. Follows a questioning about the relevance of this law as an argument in the social debates: does marginal product represent the very contribution of the agent and if so, is it a legitimate reference for the setting of remuneration? Our answer to the first part of the question is irresolute; to the second, it is negative. But most of the article is devoted to analysing the economic realism of the said law, both empirically and theoretically. We review some statistical studies present in the literature, with particular attention for the debate regarding the regressions of Cobb and Douglas. Evidence does not strengthen the neoclassical law of retribution. The paper analyses the factors that hinder either the determinateness of marginal product or the equalisation between it and factor's remuneration. Are analysed: - the restrictions inherent in the law of marginal productivity: constant returns to scale and perfect competition - an alternative explanation of interest: the Austrian theory - incentive wage theories: efficiency wage and tournament theory. The article then considers the particular case of the CEO's remuneration.

D33|Dual Productivity Analysis: A KonÃ¼s/Shephard Approach|A primal (or direct) productivity index is conventionally defined as the ratio of an output quantity index to an input quantity index. There have been attempts in the literature to define and implement dual and indirect productivity indexes based on price changes rather than quantity changes. Although dual and indirect productivity indexes share a common motivation, the measurement of productivity change when prices are measured more accurately than quantities, they differ analytically, from one another and from primal productivity indexes. We introduce a new dual productivity index, based on contributions of KonÃ¼s and Shephard, and we compare our dual productivity index with a primal productivity index based on the work of Malmquist. We also compare these two theoretical productivity indexes with analogous empirical Fisher productivity indexes. We provide an empirical application to US agricultural productivity growth.
D33|A Microeconomic Analysis of the Declining Labor Share in Japan|The labor share in Japan has been declining significantly over the last three decades, accompanied by persistent stagnation and an unprecedented increase in economic inequalities. Since these dynamics are likely to be interrelated, understanding the drivers of the labor share might contribute significantly to the Japanese economic and policy debate. Surprisingly, the existing literature on the labor share in Japan is rather limited and confined to country or industry studies. We first attempt to analyze the drivers of the labor share in Japan at the firm level. To this aim, we employ a panel of manufacturing firms from the Basic Survey of Japanese Business Structure and Activities, spanning from 2001 to 2012. By means of panel data estimators, we show how, besides technological variables, firms’ labor share depends significantly on the share of regular workers, on the importance of firms’ international engagement, and on various institutional settings of the product and labor markets.
D33|Sectoral Composition of Output and the Wage Share: a Two-Sector Kaleckian Model|This paper looks at structural change as one additional source of decline in the wage share. First, we provide a decomposition of changes in aggregate wage shares into changes due to variations in output composition and in sectoral wage shares for nine OECD countries between 1977 and 2010. We show that the rise in the service sector is a relevant factor in explaining the fall of the wage share, at least for some countries. Next, we develop a two-sector Kaleckian growth model consisting of the service and manufacturing sectors. We assume that structural change is exogenous as it arises from a shift in consumers' preferences or in the saving rate. We show that, when mark-ups are relatively higher in the service sector, a shift in the sectoral composition of demand in favor of the service sector good generates a rise in the profit share.
D33|Labour Productivity, Wages and Functional Distribution of Income in Portugal: A Sectoral Approach|This paper studies the evolution of the functional distribution of income in Portugal. The changes in the labour share of income result from two important trends, namely the evolutions of labour productivity and the average wage. And the global trends of these variables at the national level are a weighted average of the corresponding trends in the different sectors or industries, each one with its own peculiarities and deserving an attentive analysis. All these trends are quantified and explained, using several databases covering the Portuguese case in a long run period, 1953-2017 (EU- KLEMS, OECD- STAN, INE-Contas Nacionais; Banco de Portugal-Séries Longas; Ministério do Trabalho-Quadros de Pessoal). Particular attention is given to the Mixed Income problem, adjusting the Labour Share with the (imputed) labour component of the self-employed workers? income. The consequences of wage inequalities are also taken into account, calculating the (adjusted) labour share of the so-called ?tipical workers?, those of the (99%, 95% or 90%) bottom scale of the wage distribution. At the sectoral level, by means of a shift share analysis, the absolute change in the labour share is divided into two components, the ?within industries? effect (changes in the labour share of each sector) and the ?between industries? effect (changes in the gross value added relative weight of each sector).

This paper analyzes how factors that influence inequality due to commercial globalization interact each other. For which a reliable Classifier Tree -selected through a modeling process of bootstrapping- is built, it has 14 knowledge rules and classifies 84% of the observations correctly. This model indicates that inequality?s changes into a country, due greater economic integration, depend principally on the labor market? structure ?in agricultural countries and urbanization processes (industrialization) it reduces depending in turn on the rule of law; on the other hand, in countries with a strong service sector and good trade terms it increases in periods of stagnation or with low levels of high technology exports.
D33|Sraffian Indeterminacy in General Equilibrium Revisited|In contrast to Mandler’s (1999a; Theorem 6) impossibility result about the Sraffian indeterminacy of the steady-state equilibrium, we first show that any regular Sraffian steady-state equilibrium is indeterminate in terms of Sraffa (1960) under the simple overlapping generation economy. Moreover, we also check that this indeterminacy is generic. These results are obtained by explicitly defining a simple model of overlapping gener- ation economies with Leontief production techniques, in which we also explain the main source of the difference between our results and Mandler (1999a; section 6).
D33|How the rich are different: Hierarchical power as the basis of income and class|What makes the rich different? Are they more productive, as mainstream economists claim? I offer another explanation. What makes the rich different, I propose, is hierarchical power. The rich command hierarchies. The poor do not. It is this greater control over subordinates, I hypothesize, that explains the income and class of the very rich. I test this idea using evidence from US CEOs. I find that the relative income of CEOs increases with their hierarchical power, as does the capitalist portion of their income. This suggests that among CEOs, both income size and income class relate to hierarchical power. I then use a numerical model to test if the CEO evidence extends to the US general public. The model suggest that this is plausible. Using this model, I infer the relation between income size, income class, and hierarchical power among the US public. The results suggests that behind the income and class of the very rich lies immense hierarchical power.
D33|Shifting tax burden to top income earners: What is the best way to reduce inequality?|The authors analyze to what extent and how the tax burden should be shifted towards top income earners in order to reduce income inequality. Starting from Lambert and Aronson (Inequality decomposition analysis and the Gini coefficient revisited 1993) and Alvaredo (A note on the relationship between top income shares and the Gini coefficient 2011) decomposition by income groups, they prove that for three types of revenue-neutral linear personal income tax reforms based on Pfähler (1984) the redistributive effect is always higher than before the reform; and when the size of the rich group is sufficiently small (e.g. 1%), the best option is allocating tax changes proportionally to net income, and the worst doing it proportionally to tax liabilities. An empirical illustration of the theoretical results is provided using micro data from the Spanish PIT.
D33|Income distribution and the multiplier: An exploration of nonlinear distribution effects in linear Kaleckian distribution and growth models|In this paper, I show that the income-autonomous demand multiplier of Keynesian-Kaleckian models is endogenous to changes in income distribution. This effect gives rise to non-linearity of distributional effects, even in basic models. Under certain conditions, an important consequence from the distribution-sensitive multiplier is that a higher wage share can have increasingly expansionary effects, which might even shift a profit-led investment regime to a wage-led one in the basic post-Kaleckian model. Surprisingly, the respective literature on distribution and growth largely ignored these features of Keynesian-Kaleckian macroeconomic models. After a theoretical discussion on the implications of the distribution-sensitive multiplier in basic closed- and openeconomy models, I present a counterfactual illustration based on empirical parameter estimations from the literature and the development of functional income distribution for selected EU countries. My analysis indicates that a rising profit share has put partial downward pressure on the wage-ledness of aggregate demand in many EU countries. These results stress the relevance of this particular form of path dependency for empirical research and policy debates on distribution and growth.
D33|Increasing inequality in lifetime earnings: A tale of educational upgrading and changing employment patterns|This paper provides a detailed decomposition analysis of rising lifetime earnings inequality in Germany using individual employment biographies constructed from high-quality administrative data. The results show that significant parts of rising lifetime earnings inequality among West German men born between the years 1955 and 1974 can be attributed to a lower labor market participation (as a consequence of longer periods of both part-time and non-employment) as well as the educational expansion among later cohorts. The paper also points towards potentially important changes in the penalty linked to employment interruptions, but only finds a moderate impact of skill-biased technological change beyond educational upgrading. The analysis reveals similarities with the development in the U.S. in the sense that the cohorts studied did not only face an increase in inequality, but also a stagnation in earnings for a major part of their career. This trend is even stronger when looking at changes within education groups.
D33|The mightier, the stingier: Firms’ market power, capital intensity, and the labor share of income|What determines the proportion of a firm’s income that workers receive as compensation? This paper uses longitudinal firm data from a period of substantial labor share variation to understand the firm-level determinants of the labor share of income—a question that has so far only been addressed with country- and sector-level data. Firms with greater market power and a higher ratio of capital to labor allocate a smaller proportion of their value added to workers. These results suggest that firm-level drivers play a key role in the evolution of the aggregate labor share, which have declined significantly since the 1970s.
D33|The Rise and Fall of Unproductive Activities in the US Economy 1964-2015: Facts, Theory and Empirical Evidence|The general idea about unproductive labour and the associated with it activities is that they tend to expand and by expanding reduce the investible product and the growth potential of the economy, however little is known about the determinants of their movement. In this study, we take a closer look at the US unproductive labour and activities in general during the long enough 1964-2015 period. As possible determinants of the movement of unproductive activities we consider the economy-wide average rate of profit, the real interest rate and the degree of capacity utilization. The Toda Yamamoto causality tests, as well as the ARDL econometric model, lend support to the view that the unproductive expenditures and activities are determined rather than determine the above variables. Furthermore, the error correction term indicates that a long-run equilibrium relationship exists and it is attainable after the passage of not too long time.
D33|Fiscal Policy, as the “Employer of Last Resort”: Impact of Direct fiscal transfer (MGNREGA) on Labour Force Participation Rates in India|We examine the impact of conditional fiscal transfers on public employment across gender in India taking the case of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). The MGNREGS, as an “employer of last resort” fiscal policy, is a direct employment transfer, which guarantees to provide 100 days of paid work opportunities at a predetermined wage for public works in India through a self-selection criterion. Using unit record data of the latest 68th round of NSS Employment-Unemployment survey, we examined gender differential impacts of MGNREGS on labour force participation rates across States in India. The unit of analysis in our paper is not ‘household’, but is one step ahead to capture the intra-household level of participating behaviour in the economic activity. The results, based on the survey enumerating 2,80,763 individuals in rural areas, revealed that there is a striking heterogeneity in the gender impacts of job guarantee programme across States of India. The probit estimates showed that MGNREGS job card holder’s labour force participation rates were higher than the non-card holders and the result was more pronounced for women. The analysis of the time-use patterns and the unpaid care economy statistics of job guarantee card holders obtained from the unit records also shows that augmenting public investment in care economy infrastructure is significant for the job guarantee programme to function at its full potential in India.
D33|A note on re-switching and the neo-Austrian concept of the average period of production|The neo-Austrian average period of production is calculated by taking the shares of costs referable to each period out of the total amount of costs as weights. Once this notion had been introduced, its inverse relationship with the rate of interest prompted some scholars to believe that it could serve as a good measure of capital intensity. As will be shown, however, this new average period poses some problems. On the one hand, the inverse relationship mentioned above does not preclude the re-switching of production methods. On the other, if re-switching occurs, the most roundabout method may paradoxically be the one that gives the smallest net output per worker. This result can affect the revival of the Austrian business-cycle theory.
D33|Financialization and Endogenous Technological Change: a Post-Kaleckian Perspective|In post-Keynesian literature, Hein (2012a) was the first to incorporate financialization as an influential positive determinant of the rate of technological change. However, financialization is more like a two-edged sword which can affect technological progress negatively as well. We capture both the positive as well as the negative effect of financialization on technological progress which encapsulates the possibility of multiple equilibria. In analyzing the long run of the model we endogenize the financialization parameter as well. We then show how two subsystems (technological progress and financialization dynamics) when interact with each other, can produce instability and cycles for the whole system. We show that under certain circumstances, higher speed of diffusion of technological innovation, more regulated financial markets, and higher intra-class competition among firms are desirable for stabilizing the economy. Finally, we provide some policy prescriptions for the same.
D33|Structural Change and the Wage Share: a Two-Sector Kaleckian Model|In this paper, we look at structural change, and in particular at the shrinking size of manufacturing in favor of the service sector, as one additional source of decline in the wage share. To the purpose, we build on Dutt (1988) to develop a two-sector Kaleckian model of growth and distribution, where the economy consists of the service and manufacturing sectors. The service good is only used for consumption while the manufacturing good is used both for consumption and accumulation of the capital stock. We assume that structural change is exogenous as it arises from a shift in consumers' preferences. We show that, when mark-ups are relatively higher in the service sector, a shift in the sectoral composition of demand in favor of the service sector good generates a rise in the pro
D33|Wage Growth Puzzles and Technology|Economists have been grappling with both a long-run and a shorter-run wage 'puzzle'. The long-run wage puzzle is why real wages have for decades been growing slower than labour productivity: that is, why the labour share of national income has been falling. The shorter-run puzzle is why nominal wages have for some years been growing slower than model-based forecasts have predicted. This paper suggests that an important part of the explanation for both puzzles may lie at the individual firm level, rather than at the macro level. The uneven take-up of new technology is resulting in increasing dispersion in productivity performance across firms in a given industry. High productivity firms would appear to be using most of their higher levels of productivity to reduce prices and increase profit margins rather than passing most of it on to their workforce in higher wages, while the productivity 'laggards' have limited scope to pay higher wages. If employment growth is much less dispersed than productivity growth across firms, as overseas evidence suggests is the case, these observations may help to explain not just declining labour shares of national income but also low average productivity growth and subdued nominal wages growth. The paper sets out some research proposals designed to further explore these linkages. Given the broadening application across industries of new information and communication technology, if the above forces are indeed at play they may prove pervasive and long lasting, with important implications for monetary policy over the cycle.
D33|Productivity and Misallocation in General Equilibrium|We provide a general non-parametric formula for aggregating microeconomic shocks in general equilibrium economies with distortions such as taxes, markups, frictions to resource reallocation, and nominal rigidities. We show that the macroeconomic impact of a shock can be boiled down into two components: its “pure” technology effect; and its effect on allocative efficiency arising from the associated reallocation of resources, which can be measured via changes in factor income shares. We also derive a formula showing how these two components are determined by structural microeconomic parameters such as elasticities of substitution, returns to scale, factor mobility, and network linkages. Overall, our results generalize those of Solow (1957) and Hulten (1978) to economies with distortions. To demonstrate their empirical relevance, we pursue different applications, focusing on markup distortions. For example, we operationalize our non-parametric results and show that improvements in allocative efficiency account for about 50% of measured TFP growth over the period 1997-2015. We also implement our structural results and conclude that eliminating markups would raise TFP by about 40%, increasing the economywide cost of monopoly distortions by two orders of magnitude compared to the famous 0.1% estimates of Harberger (1954).
D33|Which Ladder to Climb? Wages of Workers by Job, Plant, and Education|Wages grow but also become more unequal as workers age. Using German administrative data, we largely attribute both life-cycle facts to one driving force: some workers progress in hierarchy to jobs with more responsibility, complexity, and independence. In short, they climb the career ladder. Climbing the career ladder explains 50% of wage growth and virtually all of rising wage dispersion. The increasing gender wage gap by age parallels a rising hierarchy gap. Our findings suggest that wage dynamics are shaped by the organization of production, which itself likely depends on technology, the skill set of the workforce, and labor market institutions.
D33|The Basis for Legitimate Entitlement to Profit in Islamic Law|This paper is intended to investigate the basis for legitimate profit in Islamic law and compare it to the theories held by modern conventional economics regarding the cause of profit. This study shall use the theoretical framework of the Hanafi concept of damān (guarantee) and apply it to the cases of fixed revenue and profit. Finally, this paper aims at exposing how the Hanafi formulation of damān, along with capital and labor, can be useful in explaining and determining the basis for a legitimate profit in Islamic law.
D33|On The Second Stage Of The Cambridge Capital Controversy|The second stage of the Cambridge capital controversy concerns the neo‐Walrasian theory of value and distribution. Since production is not understood in this theory as employing factors of production but rather commodities, that is goods and services with date and place of delivery, some scholars maintained that it is not affected by the problems that emerged, during the first stage of the controversy, as regards the conception of capital as a factor of production and the rate of interest as the price for its use. The reply of the ‘neo‐Ricardians’ was based on two arguments. The first regarded the relevance of the new notions of equilibrium adopted in the neo‐Walrasian approach, with particular reference to temporary and Arrow–Debreu equilibria, and the second the possibility that the phenomena of re‐switching and reverse capital deepening, by affecting the working of the saving‐investment market, could cause equilibrium multiplicity and instability also in a neo‐Walrasian framework.
D33|Lost Inflation?|Concern about “lost inflation” has been heightened recently by the apparent inability of central banks in the largest democracies, a decade beyond the GFC, to restore their “safe” CPI inflation ranges. This paper examines the deflationary forces against which monetary policy is now aligned, namely migration, the race to the bottom in capital taxation, and biased technical change, and assesses the consequences looking forward. While inflation rates have edged lower over the past two decades the most important change has been declines in long maturity yields, initially driven by strong growth in high-saving Asia and by redistribution in the advanced economies to high-saving households, and bolstered subsequently by return pessimism due to low growth in measured productivity. Ironically, today’s low rates also stem from conventional monetary policy failure, expanded central bank balance sheets and the resulting global “bond bubble”. Future monetary policy effectiveness as deflationary forces continue will depend in the advanced economies on government interventions to address underlying inequality and financial market “normalisation”.
D33|Deflation forces and inequality|Proximity to short yield zero lower bounds has challenged the inflation targeting central banks of the advanced regions. Central to this development are three-decade declining trends in long yields and underlying real, equilibrium interest rates that have flattened yield curves, restricting “normalisation” and adding deflationary pressure by boosting demand for portfolio money. Inflationary forces, such as fiscal deficits, industrial protection and resurgent regional growth, have proved comparatively weak. In this paper global modelling is used to show that key deflationary forces in these regions include automation, the race to the bottom in capital taxation and immigration. Each is shown to redistribute income so as to expand the welfare gap between the low-skilled and capital owners by 2.5 to 3.5 per cent per year. The high saving rates of capital owners depress real equilibrium rates and their expanding portfolios demand monetary expansion. These forces ensure that the challenges of macro stabilisation and distributional policy making are both intertwined and urgent.
D33|Automation, taxes and transfers with International rivalry|Continued automation and declines in low-skill shares of GDP have been widespread globally and linked to inequality. We examine the long-term, global consequences of policies that foster automation or address the distributional consequences of it, using a six-region global macro model. Results depend on whether welfare criteria are Rawlsian, emphasizing the performance of low-skill households, Benthamite, which aggregate pecuniary measures, capital-owner friendly, or simply based on real GDP. Even where automation delivers only bias against the low skilled, we find that the fostering it is a dominant strategy under all but the Rawlsian criterion. We then consider a post automation scenario in which worker displacement is significant, examining inequality constraining but balance-preserving fiscal interventions, such as tax-financed “earned income tax credits”. These generate only small international spillover effects and are for the most part not preferred under all criteria except the Rawlsian one.
D33|Corporatism and the Labour Income Share|Econometric Investigation into the Impact of Institutions on the Wage Share of Industrialised Nations The aim of this paper is to evaluate the changing impact of corporatism – cooperation between business, labour and state interest groups – over the period 1960-2010 and across industrialised economies on the development of the share of labour in national income. Also due to data issues this relationship has not been extensively analysed in the literature so far. A new time-variant corporatism index developed by Jahn (2016) allows us to fill this gap. Using different panel data techniques, samples and control variables, our main results suggest that there is a robust non-linear relationship at work. While the linear effects of both corporatism and the public sector share are positive, the coefficient of the interaction term of these two institutional indicators is negative and hence indicates a negative slope for countries with both a high level of corporatism and a large government share in GDP in explaining the change as well as the level of the adjusted wage share in the long run. To a certain extent the two institutions can be seen as substitutes. In countries where the role of the state has been reduced, the existence of a more centralised wage bargaining system has limited the extent of the fall in the share of labour in national income. In countries with less prevalent collective bargaining systems, a similar effect can be achieved by higher government spending. We therefore argue for a stronger role for centralised wage bargaining in economic policy-making, especially in countries where the share of government spending in GDP is low.
D33|The growth of US top income inequality: A hierarchical redistribution hypothesis|"What accounts for the growth of US top income inequality? This paper proposes a hierarchical redistribution hypothesis. The idea is that US firms have systematically redistributed income to the top of the corporate hierarchy. I test this hypothesis using a large scale hierarchy model of the US private sector. My method is to vary the rate that income scales with hierarchical rank within modeled firms. I find that this model is able to reproduce four intercorrelated US trends: (1) the growth of the top 1% income share; (2) the growth of the CEO pay ratio; (3) the growth of the dividends share of national income; and (4) the ""fattening"" of the entire income distribution tail. This result supports the hierarchical redistribution hypothesis. It is also consistent with the available empirical evidence on within-firm income redistribution."
D33|Capitalist income and hierarchical power: A gradient hypothesis|"This paper offers a new approach to the study of capitalist income. Building on the ""capital as power"" framework, I propose that capitalists earn their income not from any productive asset, but from the legal right to command a corporate hierarchy. In short, I hypothesize that capitalist income stems from hierarchical power. Based on this thinking, I hypothesize that the capitalist fraction of an individual's income is a gradient function of hierarchical power (which I define as the number of subordinates under one's control). Using data from US CEOs, I find evidence that this is true. Furthermore, a hierarchical model of the United States that generalizes this data accurately reproduces many aspects of the US distribution of capitalist income, including the relation between income size and capitalist income fraction. This evidence suggests that the ownership structure of US society is closely linked to the hierarchical structure of firms. This has important implications for the study of income distribution."
D33|Automatisierung, Wachstum und Ungleichheit|Die Automatisierung stellt eines der wichtigsten Phänomene dar, welche aktuell innerhalb der Wirtschaftswissenschaften und der breiteren Öffentlichkeit diskutiert werden. Dabei finden sich in Bezug auf die Frage, wie sich die Automatisierung gesamtwirtschaftlich auswirkt, sehr unterschiedliche Positionen: Am einen Ende wird auf die negativen Beschäftigungseffekte verwiesen, wenn Menschen mehr und mehr durch Maschinen ersetzt werden und ihre am Markt angebotene Arbeitsleistung nicht mehr nachgefragt somit obsolet wird. Gleichzeitig wird die Automatisierung auch für einen Anstieg der wirtschaftlichen Ungleichheit verantwortlich gemacht. Optimistischere Stimmen verweisen andererseits auf die Entwicklung seit der Industriellen Revolution, die durch fortlaufende technologische Veränderungen mit hohem Produktivitätswachstum und damit starken Wohlfahrtssteigerungen einherging, ohne dass es langfristig zu Massenarbeitslosigkeit gekommen ist. Der vorliegende Aufsatz diskutiert einige allgemein relevante empirische Daten und skizziert ein einfaches theoretisches Wachstumsmodell zur Analyse der Automatisierung. Die hierbei festgehaltenen Ergebnisse werden unter Bezugnahme auf die aktuelle wirtschaftswissenschaftliche Literatur zu den bisherigen und für die Zukunft zu erwartenden ökonomischen Effekten der Automatisierung vertieft und erweitert. Aus den verschiedenen Ansatzpunkten und Überlegungen werden schließlich wirtschaftspolitische Handlungsmöglichkeiten abgeleitet, wobei auch jeweils diskutiert wird, welchen Einschränkungen diese Maßnahmen unterliegen.
D33|Financialisation, distribution & the macroeconomic regimes before & after the crisis: A post-Keynesian view on Denmark, Estonia & Latvia|"Since the early 1980s, financialisation has become an increasingly important trend in developed capitalist countries, with different beginnings, speed and intensities in different countries. Rising inequality has been a major feature of this trend. Shares of wages in national income have declined and personal income inequality has increased. Against this background unsustainable demand and growth regimes have developed and dominated the major economies before the crisis: the ""debt-led private demand boom"" and the ""export-led mercantilist"" regime. The current paper applies this post-Keynesian approach on the macroeconomics of finance-dominated capitalism to three Baltic Sea countries, Denmark, Estonia and Latvia, both for the pre-crisis and the post-crisis period. First, the macroeconomics of finance-dominated capitalism are briefly reiterated. Second, the financialisation-distribution nexus is examined for the three countries. Third, macroeconomic demand and growth regimes are analysed, both before and after the crisis."
D33|Optimal Taxation of Robots|I study the optimal taxation of robots and labor income. In the model, robots substitute for routine labor and complement non-routine labor. I show that while it is optimal to distort robot adoption, robots may be either taxed or subsidized. The robot tax exploits general-equilibrium effects to compress the wage distribution. Wage compression reduces income-tax distortions of labor supply, thereby raising welfare. In the calibrated model, the optimal robot tax for the US is positive and generates small welfare gains. As the price of robots falls, inequality rises but the robot tax and its welfare impact become negligible.
D33|Emigrant Selection and Wages: the Case of Poland|In this paper, I use a unique individual-level pre-migration labour market dataset for Poland to examine emigrant selection in two major destination countries, the United Kingdom and Germany. I compare the pre-migration observable and unobservable characteristics of emigrants with those of non-emigrants in Poland. First, I find that Polish emigrants to the UK are more similarly educated to non-emigrants while being more negatively selected on residual wages. Second, emigrants to Germany are disproportionately more likely to fall in the middle of the education distribution but they are no different than non-emigrants in terms of unobservable skills. The familiar predictions of the Borjas (1987) model allow me to partially undercover the mechanism driving the selection patterns of Polish emigrants. I contribute to the migrant selection literature by providing additional evidence on how migrants respond to differences in both labour markets and migration policies across countries.

D33|Effect of Microfinance on Poverty and Welfare: New Evidence from 9 provinces in Cambodia|The most recent studies at national level give emphasis to the failure of microfinance services in Cambodia since the bad practice is subordinate to high interest rate, non-productive loan, over-indebtedness, landless and migration. This paper examines the effect of microfinance, also putting weight on access to formal and productive loans, by using cross-sectional data in 2015 of 411 households, who are beneficiaries of the Agriculture Cooperative (AC) community supported by the World Vision, in 9 provinces of Cambodia. The binary choice model as well as bivariate and censoring model along with addressing the endogenous treatment effect were applied. The findings show that access to microfinance services in every aspect reduces poverty and promotes household’s welfare, proxied by per capita income, except there is insignificant effect on per capita economic assets and expenditure on child’s well-being after the Wald test of exogeneity and the Newey’s minimum chi-squared estimator with the twostep option were computed. However, these results must be interpreted with caution because the data is subject to specific sample selection.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D33|A short episodic history of income distribution in Argentina|Abstract In this paper, we use tax and household survey data to assess the history of income distribution in Argentina since the beginning of the 20th century. Until the 1970s, the country experienced a fall in inequality in spite of lower income growth. Since then, inequality has generally increased possibly as a result of large-scale shocks such as macroeconomic crises and reform attempts, resulting in a convergence towards traditionally more unequal neighboring countries.

D33|The Relative Skill Demand of Superstar Firms and Aggregate Implications|This paper proposes a new reason for why the relative demand for skilled workers has increased over past decades. I suggest that increases in market concentration and the rise of superstar firms may be important causes for the rise in demand for skill. I use detailed employer-employee data for the Swedish manufacturing sector between 1997 and 2014 to validate my hypothesis. My analysis demonstrates a strong correlation between firm size and the skilled share of a firm’s worker mix. The slope of this relationship is at its steepest in the right tail of the size distribution. I also, as Autor et al. (2017b), find a substantial rise in market concentration in Swedish manufacturing, both in the aggregate and across sub-sectors. The rise in market concentration is strongly correlated with a rise in the relative usage of skilled workers. Furthermore, a majority of the change in skill usage is due to between-firm variation, a reallocation of production across firms. This supports the notion that market concentration, rather than a general skill upgrading across all firms, has caused the rise in skill demand. Finally, the reallocation of production was most pronounced in industries characterized by large increases in market concentration. I estimate that about a tenth of the rise in the usage of skilled labor in Swedish manufacturing is due to the increasing importance of the largest firms.
D33|On the Ricardian invariable measure of value in general convex economies|This study examines the possibility of an invariable measure of value when price changes induced by income redistribution between profit and wages take place in general convex economies. While Ricardo searched for an invariable measure of value with respect to changes in both the factor income distribution and the technique, Sraffa constructed a standard commodity serving as a measure of the change in a factor income distribution alone by leaving aside the possibility of changes in the size and composition of output and means of production. This study allows for the possibility that a change in factor income distribution involves a change in technique, and proposes an extension of Sraffaâ€™s standard commodity. Then, we show that it serves as an invariable measure of value with respect to the income redistribution, even though it involves a change in technique. Finally, we examine whether the linear distributional relation is preserved.
D33|The Heckscher—Ohlin—Samuelson Trade Theory and the Cambridge Capital Controversies: On the Validity of Factor Price Equalisation Theorem|This paper examines the validity of the factor price equalisation theorem (FPET) in relation to capital theory. First, it presents a survey of the literature on Heckscher—Ohlin—Samuelson (HOS) models that treat capital as a primary factor, beginning with Samuelson (1953). In addition, by consulting the Cambridge capital controversies, this paper observes that the validity of the FPET relies crucially on this setting. It does no longer hold whenever capital is assumed to be a bundle of reproducible commodities. This paper also refers to the recent literature on the dynamic HOS trade theory and argues that such studies ignore the difficulties posed by the capital controversies. It thereby concludes that the FPET holds even when capital is modelled as a reproducible factor. In conclusion, the paper suggests the necessity of reconstructing basic theories of international trade without relying on the FPET.
D33|The Race Between Demand and Supply: Tinbergen's Pioneering Studies of Earnings Inequality|Understanding inequality and devising policies to alleviate it was a central focus of Jan Tinbergen's lifetime research. He was far ahead of his time in many aspects of his work. This essay places his work in the perspective of research on inequality in his time and now, focusing on his studies on the pricing of skills and the evolution of skill prices. In his most fundamental contribution, Tinbergen developed the modern framework for hedonic models as part of his agenda for integrating demand and supply for skills to study determination of earnings and its distribution and the design of effective policy. His lifetime emphasis on social planning caused some economists to ignore his fundamental work.
D33|From classes to copulas: wages, capital, and top incomes|Abstract Public debates about the rise in top income shares often focus on the growing dispersion in earnings, and the soaring pay for top executives and financial-sector employees. But can the change in the marginal distribution of earnings on its own explain the rise in top income shares? Are top executives replacing capital owners in the group of top-income earners, or are we rather witnessing a fusion of top capital and top earnings? This paper proposes an extension of the copula framework and uses it for exploring the changing composition of top incomes. It illustrates that changes in top income shares can easily be decomposed into respective changes in the marginal distributions of labour and capital income and the changing association between the two types of income. An application using tax record data from Norway shows that the association between top labour and capital incomes grew stronger between 1995 and 2005 in the top half of the wage and capital income distribution, though it declined for the top 1% of capital income receivers. A gender decomposition demonstrates that the association of wage and capital incomes at the top is particularly striking for men, whilst women are largely under-represented in the top halves of the two marginal distributions.

D33|Innovation, Wages, and Polarization in China|Using data from CHIPS 1995-2013, we find polarization of employment from middle-income Skilled jobs to work in the Unskilled and Self-Employment job categories. This redistribution of employment is consistent with the automation of routine noncognitive tasks in the skilled sector as analyzed in a number of papers on advanced economies and some work on the Chinese economy. While the Unskilled and Self-Employment jobs remain below median income, the redistribution of employment has not been associated with a commensurate polarization of labor income. We find no evidence of polarization of either employment or income at the upper end of the job-skill spectrum.
D33|Which Ladder to Climb? Wages of workers by job, plant, and education|How much does your wage depend on what you learned, for whom you work, or what job you do? Using largely unexplored administrative data from Germany allows us to relate 80\% of wage variation to observable characteristics of jobs, firms, and workers. One wage determinant stands out: the hierarchy level of a worker, which summarizes responsibility, complexity, and independence of a job. This variable is typically absent in other data sources. The hierarchy ladder explains almost all the rise in wage-dispersion by age and half of the wage growth in life. It also is key to explain gender wage differences.

D33|Equitable Redistribution without Taxation: A lesson from East Asian Miracle countries|Does uncertainty of labor earning over the life-time increase income inequality? – This paper finds that there is a direct positive relationship between life-time uncertainty and income inequality. Earlier studies single out the effect of uncertainty to pin point the effects of predictable factors (i.e. education, family background, etc.), whereas the uncertainty is treated as uncontrollable factor. This paper finds that, the degree of earning uncertainty is predictable to a large extent, which is one of the corner-stones of life cycle models with stochastic earnings. Therefore, the uncontrollable uncertainty can be influenced by policy decisions. The EAM countries have set examples of such policies and have shown that despite their rapid economic growth, inequality has been decreased in those countries. The degree of earning uncertainty can be reduced by creating more jobs in less volatile Dependent Employment. In other words, by giving a worker higher opportunity to find a less volatile job, earning uncertainty can be reduced. And reduced earning uncertainty eventually results in reduced income inequality.
D33|Is Automation Labor-Displacing? Productivity Growth, Employment, and the Labor Share|Many technological innovations replace workers with machines, but this capital-labor substitution need not reduce aggregate labor demand because it simultaneously induces four countervailing responses: own-industry output effects; cross-industry input–output effects; between-industry shifts; and final demand effects. We quantify these channels using four decades of harmonized cross-country and industry data, where we measure automation as industry-level movements in total factor productivity (TFP) that are common across countries. We find that automation displaces employment and reduces labor's share of value-added in the industries in which it originates (a direct effect). In the case of employment, these own-industry losses are reversed by indirect gains in customer industries and induced increases in aggregate demand. By contrast, own-industry labor share losses are not recouped elsewhere. Our framework can account for a substantial fraction of the reallocation of employment across industries and the aggregate fall in the labor share over the last three decades. It does not, however, explain why the labor share fell more rapidly during the 2000s

D33|"Fiscal Policy, as the ""Employer of Last Resort"": Impact of MGNREGS on Labour Force Participation Rates in India"|"We examine the impact of conditional fiscal transfers on public employment across gender in India taking the case of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). The MGNREGS, as an ""employer of last resort"" fiscal policy, is a direct employment transfer, which guarantees to provide 100 days of paid work opportunities at a predetermined wage for public works in India through a self-selection criterion. Using unit record data of the latest 68th round of NSS Employment-Unemployment survey, we examined gender differential impacts of MGNREGS on labour force participation rates across States in India. The unit of analysis in our paper is not `household', but is one step ahead to capture the intra-household level of participating behaviour in the economic activity. The results, based on the survey enumerating 2,80,763 individuals in rural areas, revealed that there is a striking heterogeneity in the gender impacts of job guarantee programme across States of India. The probit estimates showed that MGNREGS job card holder's labour force participation rates were higher than the non-card holders and the result was more pronounced for women. The analysis of the time-use patterns and the unpaid care economy statistics of job guarantee card holders obtained from the unit records also shows that augmenting public investment in care economy infrastructure is significant for the job guarantee programme to function at its full potential in India."
D33|Labour share developments over the past two decades: The role of technological progress, globalisation and “winner-takes-most” dynamics|Over the past two decades, real median wage growth in many OECD countries has decoupled from labour productivity growth, partly reflecting declines in labour income shares. This paper analyses the drivers of labour share developments using a combination of industry- and firm-level data. Technological change in the investment goods-producing sector and greater global value chain participation have compressed labour shares, but the effect of technological change has been significantly less pronounced for high-skilled workers. Countries with falling labour shares have witnessed both a decline at the technological frontier and a reallocation of market shares toward “superstar” firms with low labour shares (“winner-takes-most” dynamics). The decline at the technological frontier mainly reflects the entry of firms with low labour shares into the frontier rather than a decline of labour shares in incumbent frontier firms, suggesting that thus far this process is mainly explained by technological dynamism rather than anti-competitive forces.
D33|A class of proximity-sensitive measures of relative deprivation|We introduce a new class of generalized measures of relative deprivation. The class takes the form of a power mean of order p. A characteristic of the class is that depending on the value of the proximity-sensitive parameter p, the class is capable of accommodating both a decreasing weight (the case of p>1), and an increasing weight (the case of p∈(0,1)) accorded to given changes in the incomes of the individuals who are wealthier than the reference individual, depending on their proximity in the income distribution to the reference individual.
D33|Patterns of Convergence (Divergence) in the Euro Area: Profitability Versus Cost and Price Indicators|Abstract We document that profitability—profit margins—has diverged in Euro-area countries since the introduction of the euro. Changes in profitability only partially overlap with changes in unit labour costs and producer prices, which are the indicators more commonly used in the literature to assess the competitiveness of euro-area member countries. We provide suggestive evidence that changes in profitability are correlated with changes in relative export performance, whereas the correlations between export and price and export and unit labour costs are unclear. We check the robustness of this correlation on a panel of 10 countries that adopted the euro between 1999 and 2001, and two-digit manufacturing sectors covering the period from 1999 to 2015, and conclude that profitability in the tradable sector is a useful indicator to assess the competiveness of euro-area countries. This is consistent with the recent international trade literature, according to which firms that export more are also more efficient or produce better products, as well as charging higher mark-ups.
D33|World changes in inequality: an overview of facts, causes, consequences and policies|This paper reviews various issues linked to the rise of inequality observed particularly in developed countries over the last quarter century. Various data on the time profile of inequality are examined, which do not always fit the common view that inequality is everywhere trending upwards. Overall, changes in inequality appear to be very country-specific. The same conclusion obtains when examining the causes of these changes. There is little doubt that common forces affected the distribution of income in most countries, but idiosyncratic factors have amplified their effects in some cases and offset them in others. Country-specificity also holds with regard to policies aimed at correcting inequality, even though globalisation imposes constraints on some key redistribution tools such as taxation and the regulation of financial markets. International coordination and, in particular, more transparency in cross-border financial operations are needed if governments are to recover some autonomy in these matters.
D33|The role of trade and offshoring in the determination of relative wages and child labour| Incorporating family decisions in a two-period model of the world economy, we predict that trade liberalization raises the skill premium and reduces child labour in developing countries where the adult labour force is sufficiently well educated to attract production activities from abroad that will increase the demand for skilled relative to unskilled labour. Elsewhere, liberalization will reduce the skill premium, but it will not necessarily raise child labour. Our prediction is not rejected by the data, and it explains why child labour is negatively associated with trade openness in those developing countries where the labour force was relatively well educated when the liberalization took place, but not elsewhere.
D33|Wedges: Distribution, Distortions, and Market Integration|This paper proposes a stylized model of policy determination and imperfect international integration. A policy wedge aims to correct laissez-faire market imperfections and/or redistribute welfare across heterogeneous agents. Policy is subject to both race-to-the-bottom and beggar-thy-neighbor forces if the country's politico-economic equilibrium interacts with the rest of the world. Variation of international market wedges induces patterns of country-specific regulation and deregulation that depend on political and structural features in non-obvious, intuitive, and empirically realistic ways.
D33|Productivity and Misallocation in General Equilibrium|We provide non-parametric formulas for aggregating microeconomic shocks in economies with distortions such as taxes, markups, frictions to resource reallocation, financial frictions, and nominal rigidities. We allow for arbitrary elasticities of substitution, returns to scale, factor mobility, and input-output network linkages. We show how to separately measure changes in technical and allocative efficiency, thereby generalizing Solow (1957) and Hulten (1978) to inefficient economies. We also show how to compute the social cost of distortions. We pursue applications focusing on firm-level markups in the US. We find that improvement in allocative efficiency, due to the reallocation over time of market share to high-markup firms, accounts for about half of aggregate TFP growth over the period 1997-2015. We also find that eliminating the misallocation resulting from the large and dispersed markups estimated in the data would raise aggregate TFP by about 15%, increasing the economy-wide cost of monopoly distortions by two orders of magnitude compared to the famous 0.1% estimate by Harberger (1954). These exact numbers should be interpreted with care since the data is imperfect and requires substantial imputation.
D33|Evaluación de la Hipótesis de Kuznets para Colombia con una aproximación de series de tiempo: 1977-2005|La desigualdad en un país puede tener graves consecuencias en el desarrollo económico, especialmente en lo que respecta a la política social, siendo de alta relevancia el estudio de las causas de sus variaciones. En ese sentido, este documento pretende explicar cómo se ve afectada la desigualdad ante cambios en el crecimiento económico, la población y la tasa de cambio nominal. Siguiendo la hipótesis de la curva de Kuznets (1955) una desmejora del indicador de inequidad en el corto plazo logra mayor igualdad en el largo plazo como efecto del crecimiento económico. El estudio se hace para Colombia con datos trimestrales, para el período entre 1977 y 2005. Nuestros resultados sugieren que la hipótesis de Kuznets puede explicar la relación entre crecimiento económico y distribución del ingreso en Colombia. Por otro lado, no se encuentra efecto de corto plazo sobre la distribución del ingreso con respecto al crecimiento poblacional, ni a la tasa de cambio. En el largo plazo, se encuentra que el aumento en la población empeora la desigualdad y que la depreciación del peso incrementa la desigualdad.
D33|La industria colombiana 1975-2014: inequidad entre trabajo y capital|Como parte de una investigación sobre transnacionalización del gran capital colombiano, se analiza la distribución funcional de la riqueza creada en la industria durante casi 40 años. Se destacan los cambios en la composición de su producción bruta, así como la concentración de la producción y la centralización del capital, fenómenos liderados por grupos financieros que datan del siglo pasado. También se indaga sobre la evolución de la productividad laboral y del empleo, y los eventuales efectos de los cambios tecnológicos en este sector. Se concluye que en la distribución del valor agregado industrial gana peso relativo el capital, con detrimento de la parte que corresponde al trabajo.
D33|The historical evolution of the wealth distribution: A quantitative-theoretic investigation|We derive qualitative and quantitative predictions of a microfounded model of wealth inequality and look at how the model's predictions compare with actual outcomes in the United States over the postwar period. The model's microeconomic core emphasizes that a household faces important earnings risks (deriving from the risk of unemployment and from uncertain wages) and cannot fully insure against these risks. To capture these features, we base our work on the broadly used Bewley-Huggett-Aiyagari (BHA) setup. Our model also features stochastic movements in saving rates that go beyond the mere precautionary-savings motive inherent in the BHA setup: we posit some randomness in discount factors, as in Krusell and Smith (1998). We demonstrate that such randomness gives rise to a Pareto-shaped right tail of the wealth distribution, a feature that appears to approximate the data well and that has been discussed much recently and derived in a variety of highly stylized models. Piketty and Zucman (2014) develop one such model and we argue that it can be viewed as a reduced form for the model we present here, and indeed also for the one in Krusell and Smith (1998).
D33|Wedges: Distribution, Distortions, and Market Integration|This paper proposes a stylized model of policy determination and imperfect international integration. A country-specific policy wedge corrects labor market imperfections and/or redistributes welfare across differently wealthy agents. Capital market integration with the rest of the world, indexed by another wedge, shapes the politico-economic equilibrium policy through race-to-the-bottom and beggar-thy-neighbor channels. The policy and welfare implications of tighter international integration depend in sharp and empirically realistic ways on country-specific political and structural features.
D33|Automation and Inequality with Taxes and Transfers|The dependence of real income and inequality on changes in factor abundance, total factor productivity, factor bias, the relative cost of capital goods and the progressivity of the tax system are quantified using an elemental general equilibrium model with three households. Observed declines in low-skill labour shares are shown to have been generic in the OECD and to have been responsible for most of the increase in US inequality between 1990 and 2016. The widely anticipated future twist away from low-skill labour toward capital is then examined, in combination with expected changes in population and its skill composition. With downward rigidity of low-skill wages the potential is identified for unemployment to rise to extraordinarily high levels. Productivity growth at twice the pace since 1990 is shown to limit this, though it does not slow the concentration of income. The superior policy response is shown to be a generalization of the US “earned income tax credit” system, with financing from taxes on consumption, rather than capital income.
D33|Automation and Inequality in China|In transitional economies like China, comparatively low real wages imply sub-OECD labor and skill shares of value added and comparatively high capital shares. Despite rapid real wage growth, however, rather than converge toward the OECD, China’s low-skill labor share has been falling, due to structural and technical change. Here this dependence is quantified using an elemental national model with three households. Since 1994, a third of the total change in the Gini coefficient is estimated to be due to structural change and the rest to mainly skill-biased technical change. Widely anticipated further twists away from low-skill labor toward capital are then examined, assuming downward rigidity of low-skill wages and transfers that sustain low-skill welfare via taxes on capital income. The potential is identified for unemployment to rise extraordinarily, with negative effects mitigated if the population declines or if the share twists are accompanied by very strong total factor productivity growth.
D33|Poverty, employment and inequality in the SDGs: heterodox discourse, orthodox policies?|Malte Luebker recalls that employment and labour issues were entirely absent from the initial set of MDGs, and that only in 2005, somewhat hastily, a new target was added to address this oversight. He therefore welcomes that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development makes ample reference to employment and inequality. Goal 8 is devoted to â€˜Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for allâ€™ and expands on two familiar themes, productivity and employment, while adding labour rights as a new element. The more nuanced treatment of labour arguably presents a notable advance in attaining a wider set of progressive policies concerned with addressing rising inequalities. While the SDGs are strong on some policies that have direct impact on the primary and secondary distribution of incomes, they lack an explicit endorsement of freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. Hence, they fail to mention the mechanisms that give workers a voice and a meaningful stake in development.
D33|EMU and Labour Market Policy: Tensions and Solutions|Reforms observed in EMU do not conform to commonly expressed views that international economic integration comes with labour market deregulation, and that both are beneficial. This essay examines the country-specific policy reforms evidence generated by inception of Economic and Monetary Union and by its disruption during the Great Recession and the Eurozone crisis, outlines non-technically how a distributional perspective can explain key features of those experiences, and discusses how these empirical observations and theoretical insights may bear on the sources and consequences of more general tensions between Europe’s policymaking framework and market integration process.
D33|Neoclassical inequality|In a model with a worker-capitalist dichotomy, we show that the relationship between inequality (measured as a ratio of incomes for the two types) and growth is complicated; zero growth generally lowers inequality, except under extreme parameterizations. In particular, the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor in production needs to be substantially greater than one in order for income inequality be higher with zero growth, in fact higher than nearly all estimates. If this condition is not met, factor prices adjust strongly causing the fall in the return to capital (the rise in wages) to reduce income inequality. Our results extend to models with endogenous growth.
D33|Effective demand and Say’s law in Marxist theory: an evolutionary perspective|In this paper I theorize the roles of effective demand and Say’s Law in the Marxist theory of exploitation and accumulation. I claim that an exogenous rate of exploitation implies deploying the strongest version of Say’s Law, which leads profit rates not to equalize across sectors. Marx’s own procedure in Capital III was therefore logically mistaken. Once Keynes’ principle of effective demand is introduced, the rate of exploitation, and hence the distribution of income between wages and profits, becomes endogenous to aggregate demand. Profit rates can then equalize across sectors and prices of production can function as gravitational centers for market prices in a competitive economy. I develop an innovative evolutionary approach to demonstrate how effective demand, within the Marxist framework, determines the rate of exploitation and the rate of profit. At the intersection of Marx, Keynes, and Kalecki, my evolutionary framework integrates effective demand, functional income distribution, profit rate equalization, technological diffusion, and the gravitation towards prices of production.
D33|Inequality of opportunity and household education expenditures: Evidence from panel data in China|This paper offers one of the first pieces of empirical evidence on the impact of inequality of opportunity on household education investment by using the panel data from China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) in three waves (2010, 2012 and 2014). Our result suggests that inequality of opportunity has a negative effect on household education expenditures. This result is robust to a series of robustness checks. Furthermore, for relatively disadvantaged households (household heads with less education, income, or rural hukou status), inequality of opportunity has a larger negative effect on their education expenditures. Policy suggestions to lower inequality of opportunity may include reducing labor market discrimination based on gender and hukou status, balancing education resources to create more equal educational opportunities, and offering children education subsidies in low-income families.
D33|So close yet so unequal: Spatial inequality in American cities|Rich income data and a new methodology are employed to investigate patterns and consequences of spatial inequality in American cities over the last 35 years. New Gini-type indices, which assess spatial inequality using individual neighborhoods of variable size as primitives, uncover from the data robust evidence of growing income inequality within the neighborhood. The welfare implications of this trend are investigated through reduced-form models, addressing potential bias due to sorting across and within cities. An exogenous increase of the income mix in the neighborhood is found to yield a significant drop in intergenerational mobility gains for young people.
D33|Wages, Innovation, and Employment in China|"We investigate the role of factor-priced-induced innovation in mediating the employment impact of expanding production in China. Our empirical approach implements concepts developed in Acemoglu (2010) and complements the approaches summarized by Wei, Xie, and Zhang (2017) that focus on directly observable aspects of innovation (R&D, patent activity, etc.); labor-force characteristics including the availability of ""surplus"" labor, investments in human capital; and investments in physical capital. It complements work on the causes of a decline in labor's share in total output as documented in Bai and Qian (2010) and in Molero-Simarro (2017). Our empirical results to date support the hypothesis that wage-induced technology change has influenced productivity growth in China, at least in the decade of the 1990s, but perhaps less so or not at all after the middle of the next decade."
D33|Immigrant locations and native residential preferences: Emerging ghettos or new communities?|Strong political movements voicing opposition to immigration are on the upswing. Does such potential antagonism translate into residential dynamics? We study whether natives fled from immigrant areas in reaction to the largest and fastest migration shock in the OECD. The inflow–causing the population of Spain to grow by 10% between 1998 and 2008–represented a largely new phenomenon, the size of which had not been factored into previous expectations, thereby providing quasi-experimental sources of variance. Our results show that immigrant inflows caused mild native displacement from denser, established neighborhoods, but also more real estate development in these areas. In parallel, both natives and immigrants were collocating in booming suburban communities, resulting in no changes to overall measures of ethnic segregation. In light of the results, we argue that whenever ethnic-minority arrivals spur the creation of new neighborhoods, conventional empirical methods overstate the degree of native flight.
D33|The Global Gender Gap in Labor Income|This paper introduces a new measure of economic gender inequality (EGI) based on the ratio of women’s share of national labor income to men’s. This measure captures both the principles of equal pay for equal work and non-discrimination. Importantly, it can be calculated from existing data and is comparable across countries and time. We show that EGI has only been improving slowly and that current aggregate EGI is equivalent to 1.2 billion women working for nothing. Moreover, this gap is expected to increase in coming decades. Instrumental variable estimates suggest that while increases in income reduce EGI, living standards will have to triple for equality to be achieved in countries such as Mexico or Turkey.
D33|American Exceptionalism in Market Income Inequality: An Analysis Based on Microdata from the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) Database|The US has exceptionally high inequality of disposable household income. Among working-age households (those with no persons over age 60), that high level of inequality is caused by a high level of market income inequality (i.e., income before taxes and transfers), paired with a moderate level of redistribution. In this paper, we look more deeply at market income inequality, focusing on its main component – labor income – across a group of 24 OECD countries. We disaggregate the working-age population into household types, defined by the number and gender of the household’s earners and the partnership and parenting status of its members. We concentrate on comparing US results with those of the other OECD countries. Our main finding is that high levels of labor income inequality in the US cut across diverse subgroups. We conclude that within-group inequality of labor incomes in the US is, in almost all groups, high by OECD standards. So it is neither an unusual household composition, nor unusually high mean labor incomes of some groups (nor indirectly, unusually low levels of redistribution), that explain high US disposable income inequality, but instead the fact that high and low labor incomes are universally spread across all household/demographic categories.
D33|Regional inequality in decentralized countries: a multi-country analysis using LIS|The aim of this paper is to analyze the regional disparities of six decentralized countries using LIS microdata. In order to determine the extent of the territorial variable in the explanation of income inequality, we carry out two complementary analyses. On the one hand, we perform the classical decomposition by population subgroups of different inequality measures. On the other hand, we implement a semiparametric decomposition analysis based on the method proposed by DiNardo, Fortin and Lemieux.
D33|Moving Closer or Drifting Apart: Distributional Effects of Monetary Policy|Our paper picks up the current controversial debate about increasing (income) inequality due to recent monetary policy measures in major advanced economies. We use a VAR framework identified with sign restrictions to figure out how income inequality related measures react to monetary policy in six different advanced economies. These countries differ by their absolute income inequality as well as their redistribution. We choose the U.S., Canada and South Korea as countries with very little redistribution and Sweden, the Czech Republic and Hungary as countries with relatively high redistribution. While all economies experience an increase in Gini coefficients of gross income in the presence of an expansionary monetary policy shock, only the U.S., Canada and South Korea also show a significant response in Gini coefficient of net income. To figure out how the transmission of monetary policy to income inequality works we pick up the two major channels dominant in the literature: The employment channel and the income composition channel. The latter is analyzed by data from national accounts concerning two different kinds of income households receive: Labor related income and capital payments, both net. While we find that capital owners profit disproportionately in the less redistributing countries, we observe a more even reaction in both income types. This indicates that the harmful effects of expansionary monetary policy on the market income distribution are mitigated if the degree of redistribution is high.
D33|Intertemporal CGE Analysis of Income Distribution in Turkey|This study focuses on the effects of public policies on the size distribution of income in Turkey. To this end, an intertemporal dynamic equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents in a small open economy framework is constructed. This study serves several extensions to the literature via its algebraic structure and the calibration process in which various micro-level data sets are utilized. The results reveal that, in line with the previous findings of the literature, increasing budget allocations to unilateral social transfer programs has no significant effect on the size distribution of income and has adverse effects on the labor market decisions of relatively poor laborers. On the contrary, subsidizing the cost of labor has positive impacts on labor supplies and the size distribution of income improves in favor of relatively poor households.
D33|Russian Real Wages Before and After 1917: in Global Perspective|The paper measures real wages in St Petersburg, Moscow, and Kursk between 1853 and 1937 and compares them to real wages in Boston, Manchester, Bombay, and Cairo. Russian living standards grew little between 1853 and 1913 and were like Egypt and India. Wages in the UK and USA were 2.5 - 5 times greater. Real wages in Russia almost doubled between 1913 and 1928. When seen in a Russian perspective, this looks like a big advance; when seen internationally, it is much less so. Real wages dropped to their pre-War level between 1928 and 1937 during the industrialization drive.
D33|The fall of the Labor share and the rise of superstar firms|"The fall of labor's share of GDP in the United States and many other countries in recent decades is well documented but its causes remain uncertain. Existing empirical assessments of trends in labor's share typically have relied on industry or macro data, obscuring heterogeneity among firms. In this paper, we analyze micro panel data from the U.S. Economic Census since 1982 and international sources and document empirical patterns to assess a new interpretation of the fall in the labor share based on the rise of \superstar firms."" If globalization or technological changes advantage the most productive firms in each industry, product market concentration will rise as industries become increasingly dominated by superstar firms with high profits and a low share of labor in firm value-added and sales. As the importance of superstar firms increases, the aggregate labor share will tend to fall. Our hypothesis offers several testable predictions: industry sales will increasingly concentrate in a small number of firms; industries where concentration rises most will have the largest declines in the labor share; the fall in the labor share will be driven largely by between-firm reallocation rather than (primarily) a fall in the unweighted mean labor share within firms; the between-firm reallocation component of the fall in the labor share will be greatest in the sectors with the largest increases in market concentration; and finally, such patterns will be observed not only in U.S. firms, but also internationally. We find support for all of these predictions."
D33|Productivity and Misallocation in General Equilibrium|We provide a general non-parametric formula for aggregating microeconomic shocks in general equilibrium economies with distortions such as taxes, markups, frictions to resource reallocation, and nominal rigidities. We show that the macroeconomic impact of a shock can be boiled down into two components: its ``pure'' technology effect; and its effect on allocative efficiency arising from the associated reallocation of resources, which can be measured via changes in factor income shares. We also derive a formula showing how these two components are determined by structural microeconomic parameters such as elasticities of substitution, returns to scale, factor mobility, and network linkages. Overall, our results generalize those of Solow (1957) and Hulten (1978) to economies with distortions. To demonstrate their empirical relevance, we pursue different applications, focusing on markup distortions. For example, we operationalize our non-parametric results and show that improvements in allocative efficiency account for about 50% of measured TFP growth over the period 1997-2015. We also implement our structural results and conclude that eliminating markups would raise TFP by about 40%, increasing the economywide cost of monopoly distortions by two orders of magnitude compared to the famous 0.1% estimates of Harberger (1954).
D33|Regularities in Prices of Production and the Concentration of Compositions of Capitals|Recent developments in price of production models have proposed a hypothesis on the structure of the input coefficient matrices to explain the empirical near-linearity and monotonicity found in prices as a function of income distribution - the tendency towards zero of subdominant eigenvalues. The objective of this paper is twofold: First, based on the behavior of observed eigenvalues, the paper shows that they cannot explain by their own the regularities found in prices of production. Second, it is shown theoretically and empirically the existence and relevance of an additional force acting on the input matrix and the labor coefficient vector: the concentration of industries' vertically integrated compositions of capital around their average. It is argued that the combined effect of these two factors produces the empirical regularities in relative prices. The tendency of the vertically integrated labor to means of production proportions to cluster around their average reveals the existence of an economic force acting on the structure of technology of observable economies and calls for an explanation. The paper relies on the US 1987- 2007 Input-Output accounts, at the highest disaggregation level (between 370-466 sectors), for the empirical evidence in this paper.
D33|Growth, Income Distribution, and the ‘Entrepreneurial State’|In this paper, we introduce a twofold role for the public sector in the Goodwin (1967) model of the growth cycle. The government collects income taxes in order to: (a) invest in infrastructure capital, which directly affects the production possibilities of the economy; (b) finance publicly funded research and development (R&D), which augments the growth rate of labor productivity. We study two versions of the model: with and without induced technical change, that is with or without a feedback from the labor share to labor productivity growth. In both cases we show that: (i) provided that the output-elasticity of infrastructure is greater than the elasticity of labor productivity growth to public R&D, there exists a tax rate that maximizes the long-run labor share, and it is smaller than the growth-maximizing tax rate; (ii) the longrun share of labor is always increasing in the share of public spending in infrastructure; (iii) different taxation schemes have an impact on the stability of growth cycles.
D33|Decomposition of Gender Income Gap in Rural Informal Micro-enterprises: An Unconditional Quantile Approach in the Handloom Industry|There exists a noteworthy gender income gap in the micro-entrepreneurial activities, and typically the females earn lower than the males. While such gender income gap in wage employment is well-documented, the aspect needs attention in the context of the micro-en-trepreneurship, particularly in the informal sector. It is important to analyze how differently the gender difference in endowments affect the income of the male and the female micro-entrepreneurs. The present study, based on primary data, analyses gender income gap and its compositions throughout the income distribution of the handloom micro-entrepreneurs in Assam. On an average, the female micro-entrepreneurs earn 51 percent lesser than their male counterpart. The unconditional quantile decomposition reveals that the gender income gap increases along the income distribution. The differences in the productive characteristics (endowment effects) explain much of the income gap at the median level and beyond than the heterogeneous returns to such characteristics (discriminatory effects). The endowment effects related to education, financial literacy, risk attitude, SHGs membership, and technol-ogy adoption are found in favor of the male micro-entrepreneurs. The results suggest that poor management of entrepreneurial activities of the female results in wider gender gap throughout the income distribution. The study urges for policy prescriptions towards dis-semination of technological, financial, and managerial know-how to make the females more organized towards addressing the gender income gap.
D33|Has the Labour Share Declined?: It Depends|We revisit the issue of how best to measure the labour and capital shares in OECD economies, distinguishing between production- and income-based perspectives. The former adopts a producer perspective with gross income as a reference: it uses a production function in a market setting. The latter adopts a consumer perspective with net income as a reference, taking account of depreciation and including taxes and subsidies as perceived by final consumers. We confirm a statistically significant but small decline in the labour share across OECD countries over the past two decades under a production perspective. But this appears to result mainly from a rise in the gross capital share caused by rising depreciation rates. Accordingly, we find little or no decline in the labour share under an income perspective, where income is measured net and after depreciation. Using a novel dataset from Korea, we further dissect the capital share and suggest that in periods of price bubbles of land, rising asset values are a key element behind rising capital shares. We also show how introducing land prices can explain how both labour shares and real prices of investment goods can decline without assuming a large elasticity of substitution between labour and capital.

D33|On green production taxes|Proposals are often made to tax goods which are environmentally damaging. Many such goods are consumed both directly by households and industry at large: for example, carbon-intensive fuel, waste water or congested road space. This paper adopts a tax-reform setting to evaluate such a policy. The welfare impact is shown to depend on an input-substitution effect and an output effect on final consumption, where the latter effect can be conveniently analysed via the standard concept of the marginal welfare cost of a commodity tax. Finally, it is shown that raising a production tax is welfare enhancing if the current tax is below marginal external cost and revenues are recycled via the commodity tax with the highest marginal welfare cost.
D33|Innovative entrepreneurship evaluation in opinion of service company managers in Podlaskie Province|The analysis of contemporary economies pursuing service based economies shows the issue concerning the innovation in services. It seems to be important from the standpoint of modifying the actions of enterprises and economies on competitive, local, national and international arenas. The economic practice and public activity prove there is a need for intelligent growth. It consists in the development of economy that is based on knowledge and innovation – the development which produces high added value. Thus, it is necessary to foster creative entrepreneurship that inclines towards the introduction of changes at the level of an enterprise which results in contributing to the creation of good economic condition in general. Research background: The article regards the issue of Podlaskie enterprises that tend to introduce innovation within the services of a higher level, understood as services, that creates added value from the point of view of service company managers. Purpose of the article: The aim of the article is to examine the opinions of managers from Podlaskie on innovation in services and whether the range of provided services is accepted by service receivers. Methodology/methods: The realization process of the assumed goal shall use the monograph and survey methods as well as analysis and synthesis. The survey is directed at managers of Polish companies in Podlaskie province. It regards factors that rule the inclination for the introduction of changes in service nature and its quality in the period of 1-3 years (stimulating and inhibitive). Findings & Value added: The research shows that the analyzed sub sector of services is an interesting area in the context of innovation in the micro scale and thus has potential for further study.
D33|Stability of the labour shares: evidence from OECD economies|In light of ongoing concern about rising inequality in the developed economies, this paper revisits the old standing issue of the stability of the labour share. The paper focuses specifically on the empirical aspect of the problem and considers statistical properties of the labour share in OECD economies over 1960-2014 period, using a battery of time series models and unit root tests. We account for structural changes in labour share using Lagrange Multiplier (LM) unit root tests with up to two structural breaks, address the problem of heterogeneous level shifts using LM panel unit root test, and examine four types of statistical patterns (trend stationarity, mean reversion, random walk with and without drift) using Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. Empirical results indicate diverse patterns in labour share movements, with downward deterministic trend with break(s) being the most preponderant. The upward trends are observed in a limited set of economies (Belgium, Luxembourg, and Netherlands). Overall, the stability of labour share hypothesis appears to find only weak support. Exploratory analysis demonstrates that most of the structural breaks are economically significant, short-term fluctuations in series correlate strongly with business cycle turning points, whilst medium-term movements in labour share are adequately explained in terms of broader political and also country-specific factors.
D33|Piyasa ekonomisine geçiş süreci ve sonrasında Türkiye'de GINI katsayılarının analizi: Alternatif GINI formülü yaklaşımı<BR>[During and after the process of transition to market economy, an analysis of income distribution in Turkey: An alternative GINI formula approach]|This study considers the Gini 1 and alternative Gini 2 coefficients for households’ % income shares from 1963 to 2015 in Turkey. Throughout regarding calibrations, one might see that, despite the existence of some deviations from trend and some Gini 1 and Gini 2 coefficients’ differences, (a) there exists an improvement in the distribution of income until 2011, except for the year 2009 when the global crisis was experienced, but an average deterioration in the distribution for 2011-2015 period is experienced, (b) the geographical regions of the Turkish economy reveal different outcomes. For the period 2006-2015, it is observed that in the regions of Istanbul, West Marmara, Central Anatolia and North East Anatolia, the Lorenz curve has moved away from full equilibrium line, but in the regions of Aegean, Eastern Marmara and Eastern Black Sea, on the average, a convergence towards the equilibrium from the Lorenz curve has appeared. In other three regions, the Gini coefficients improve on average in Western Anatolia, Mediterranean and Western Black Sea regions. The Gini coefficients are increasing in the period 2006-2011 in the Middle East Anatolia and falling in 2015. In the South East Anatolia Region, there is no progress in the period 2006-2011, but, there happens to be a recovery in income distribution in 2015.
D33|Capital Intensity, Unproductive Activities and the Great Recession of the US Economy|The purpose of this article is to show that the ‘great recession’ of 2007 in the USA is of the classical type with basic features the rising value composition of capital which more than fully offset the rising rate of surplus value giving rise to a falling rate of profit. The tendential fall of the latter, from a point onwards, led to a stagnant mass of real net profits, thereby decreased net investment and eventually impacted on employment. The evolution of capital intensity and the consequences of unproductive activities remain key issues in the discussions of capital accumulation and its periodic ruptures
D33|Reproduction Structure and Technological Progress in Economy: The Role of Talents as Capital|"Human activities in concrete production are diversified from product manufacturing, service production to management technology. Technological progress is organized into such various human activities. This paper is written on our “Talents capital hypothesis”, after surveying the genealogy of economic thought since Smith, and, carefully examining the theoretical basis of the hypothesis. The concept “Talents capital” comprehensively captures the human activities. The hypothesis is that realistic technological progress should be based on qualitative development of ""Talents capital"", that is, accumulation and succession of production-related knowledge and technology, embodied in workers group (=personal owner of individual enterprises as well as employee (including corporate officer) in general enterprises) ."
D33|Die Verteilung von Einkommen und Vermögen in der Schweiz<BR>[The Distribution of Income and Wealth in Switzerland]|Das Interesse an der Verteilung von Einkommen und Vermögen ist in jüngster Zeit wieder neu entbrannt. Nicht zuletzt, weil nach vielen Jahren der Stabilität die Ungleichheit in vielen Ländern wieder zunimmt. Auch in der Schweiz geniesst die Frage nach der Einkommens- und Vermögensverteilung in der öffentlichen und politischen Diskussion grosse Aufmerksamkeit. Die Analyse über die letzten 100 Jahre zeigt, dass im Ländervergleich das Niveau der Einkommen und Löhne in der Schweiz hoch ist, die Ungleichheit zwischen Arm und Reich wenig stark ausgeprägt ist und sich die Öffnung der Einkommensschere über die Zeit in engen Grenzen hält. Die Ausnahme bilden die Superreichen, deren Anteile in jüngster Zeit deutlich zugenommen haben. Die relativ egalitäre Primärverteilung der Einkommen und Löhne und die föderale Struktur mit ihrem Steuerwettbewerb führen dazu, dass Bedarf und Ausmass der Umverteilung relativ gering ausfallen. Als Kehrseite der Medaille ist die hohe Stabilität wohl ein Grund dafür, dass die Einkommensmobilität im internationalen Vergleich gering ausfällt. Dafür fällt das Durchschnittsniveau der Einkommen rekordhoch aus. Die gefundenen Aussagen gelten verstärkt für die Vermögen. Diese reagieren viel träger auf Einzelereignisse, weil sie über Jahrzehnte aufgebaut werden. Die anhaltende politische Stabilität und die berechenbare Wirtschaftspolitik haben der Schweiz neben sehr hohen Durchschnittsvermögen eine sehr persistente Vermögensverteilung beschert, womit sie unter Industrieländern eine grosse Ausnahme darstellt. Entsprechend ist die Vermögenskonzentration im internationalen Vergleich sehr hoch. Das Ausmass relativiert sich aber, wenn wir die für die Schweiz wichtigen Pensionskassenvermögen miteinbeziehen.
D33|Distributional Consequences of Capital Accumulation, Globalisation and Financialisation in the US| In this paper we examine the dynamic contributions of capital accumulation, globalisation, and financialisation to the functional-personal income distribution nexus. We analyse the labour share under the prism of monopoly and frictional growth, and disclose the dramatic upward trend in inequality. On this basis, we estimate a two-equation model for the income distribution in the US over the 1960-2009 period. We show that the labour share is affected positively by capital intensity and negatively by trade, while the Gini statistic is fueled by the falling labour share and increasing financial payments. Using counterfactual simulations, a key finding is that the decrease in capital intensity in the eighties accounted for about 76% of the labour share fall, while its increase in the 2000s prevented inequality from worsening three times more than it actually did. In turn, had financialisation not increased after 2005, inequality would have decreased to its level in the early noughties. In the Great Recession years of tense socioeconomic conditions, looking at income distribution through the lens of the wage-productivity gap could enlighten economic policy.
D33|Sources of Income Inequality: A Comparison of Japan and the United States|We compare the sources of income inequality in Japan and the United States. We exploit two longitudinal household surveys to decompose the income inequality in both countries. For Japan, we use Keio Household Panel Survey data and the five latest waves (2009–2013). For the United States, the data comes from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and covers the years 2009, 2011, and 2013. To ensure comparability between the two countries, we restrict our sample to household heads between 35 and 65 years old and currently working. In a first step, we calculate the Gini coefficient of labor income for the two samples. We find that the Gini coefficient of labor income is higher in the United States (0.453) than in Japan (0.329), corroborating well-established previous findings. In a second step, we decompose the income inequality in both countries by using a comparable set of variables. Our results show that differences in the number of years of education and marital status explain the largest part of income inequality in Japan. In the United States, education and working hours are the strongest contributors to unequal income distribution. Finally, when introducing additional, country-specific variables, we find that working for a large company and being an irregular worker are important drivers of inequality in Japan. For the United States, lower wages for African Americans appears to contribute 5%–10% to income inequality.
D33|Endogenous Technical Change In Alternative Theories Of Growth And Distribution|This paper surveys the last two and a half decades of nonâ€ neoclassical literature on endogenous technical change and the functional income distribution. We distinguish between classicalâ€ Marxian and postâ€ Keynesian models, and analyze them under three different assumptions on the determinants of technical change: capital accumulation, income distribution, and labor market tightness. The balanced growth implications of alternative models are compared with neoclassical exogenous and endogenous growth theories. Despite the strong differences in the assumptions regarding the substitutability between capital and labor, the role of different classes in society, and whether or not productive factors are fully employed, the various alternative models can be classified in a way that highlights remarkable similarities with their neoclassical counterparts. Both neoclassical and alternative theories of endogenous growth: (i) have shown that longâ€ run growth is sensitive to investment decisions, and (ii) rely on a linear spillover from the stock of knowledge to the production of innovations. The comparison highlights the different channels emphasized by competing theories: saving behavior and market structure in the neoclassical theories, as opposed to income distribution, the state of the labor market, and investors' behavior in alternative theories.
D33|Financialisation and distribution in three main Eurozone countries from a Kaleckian perspective: France, Germany and Spain compared – before and after the crisis|In this paper we analyse the effects of financialisation on income distribution, before and after the Great Financial Crisis and the Great Recession, for three main Eurozone countries, France, Germany and Spain. We apply a Kaleckian perspective in which the focus will be on functional income distribution and thus on the relationship between financialisation and the wage share or the gross profit share. Financialisation may affect aggregate wage or gross profit shares of the economy as a whole through three channels: first, the sectoral composition of the economy, second the financial overhead costs and profit claims of the rentiers, and third the bargaining power of workers and trade unions. We examine empirical indicators for each of these channels, both before and after the crisis. We find that these countries have shown broad similarities regarding redistribution before the crisis, however, with some differences in the underlying determinants. These differences have carried through to the period after the crisis and have led to different results regarding the development of distribution since then.
D33|Financialisation and distribution in three main Eurozone countries from a Kaleckian perspective: the US, the UK and Sweden compared – before and after the crisis|In this paper we analyse the effects of financialisation on income distribution, before and after the Great Financial Crisis and the Great Recession, for the two liberal Anglo-Saxon economies, the US and the UK, and for a typical Nordic welfare state economy, Sweden. We apply a Kaleckian perspective in which the focus will be on functional income distribution and thus on the relationship between financialisation and the wage share or the gross profit share. Financialisation may affect aggregate wage or gross profit shares of the economy as a whole through three channels: first, the sectoral composition of the economy, second the financial overhead costs and profit claims of the rentiers, and third the bargaining power of workers and trade unions. We examine empirical indicators for each of these channels, both before and after the crisis. We find that these types of countries have shown broad similarities regarding redistribution before the crisis, however, with major differences in the underlying determinants. These differences have carried through to the period after the crisis and have led to different results regarding the development of distribution since then.
D33|The Czech Government?s Strategy for Fighting Inequality|Defenders of globalization often argue that, whatever distress it may cause for the rich-world workers, it has been good for poor or less affluent countries. The inequality as measured by the distribution of income between the rich and poor countries, has globally narrowed. But within each country, the story is less pleasing. We may use three different arguments to support this conclusion: 1) differentiation among workers. A-skilled workers in rich countries; B-low skilled workers in rich countries; C-high-skilled workers in poor countries; D-low-skilled workers in poor countries. The new slogan originating in the Silicon Valley works with the ?gig economy? and with the appearance of the new workers category - contract workers. 2) growth of crony capitalism (measured by the crony capitalism index). 3) social and economic mobility. The authors came to the conclusion that inequality of workers in the Central European post-communist countries will never reach the income level corresponding to their counterparts of groups A and B in the developed economies of the EU and the inequality in the Czech Republic contrary to the general accepted opinion about egalitarian society has been growing.
D33|The Difference Approach to Productivity Measurement and Exact Indicators|There are many decompositions of productivity growth for a production unit that rely on the ratio approach to index number theory. However, the business and accounting literatures tend to favour using differences rather than ratios. In this paper, three analogous decompositions for productivity growth in a difference approach to index number theory are obtained. The first approach uses the production unitâ€™s value added function in order to obtain a suitable decomposition. It relies on various first order approximations to this function, but the decomposition can be given an axiomatic interpretation. The second approach uses the cost constrained value added function and assumes that the reference technology for the production unit can be approximated by the free disposal conical hull of past observations of inputs used and outputs produced by the unit. The final approach uses a particular flexible functional form for the producerâ€™s value added function and provides an exact decomposition of normalized value added.
D33|Automation and inequality with taxes and transfers|The dependence of real income and inequality on changes in factor abundance, total factor productivity, factor bias, the relative cost of capital goods and the progressivity of the tax system are quantified using an elemental general equilibrium model with three households. Observed declines in low-skill labour shares are shown to have been generic in the OECD and to have been responsible for most of the increase in US inequality between 1990 and 2016. The widely anticipated future twist away from low-skill labour toward capital is then examined, in combination with expected changes in population and its skill composition. With downward rigidity of low-skill wages the potential is identified for unemployment to rise to extraordinarily high levels. Productivity growth at twice the pace since 1990 is shown to limit this, though it does not slow the concentration of income. The superior policy response is shown to be a generalization of the US “earned income tax credit” system, with financing from taxes on consumption, rather than capital income.
D33|Automation and inequality in China|In transitional economies like China, comparatively low real wages imply sub-OECD labor and skill shares of value added and comparatively high capital shares. Despite rapid real wage growth, however, rather than converge toward the OECD, China’s low-skill labor share has been falling, due to structural and technical change. Here this dependence is quantified using an elemental national model with three households. Since 1994, a third of the total change in the Gini coefficient is estimated to be due to structural change and the rest to mainly skill-biased technical change. Widely anticipated further twists away from low-skill labor toward capital are then examined, assuming downward rigidity of low-skill wages and transfers that sustain low-skill welfare via taxes on capital income. The potential is identified for unemployment to rise extraordinarily, with negative effects mitigated if the population declines or if the share twists are accompanied by very strong total factor productivity growth.
D33|Inequality of Opportunity in Sweden:A Spatial Perspective|This paper investigates the spatial dimensions of inequality of opportunity by integrating parental neighbourhood characteristics as exogenous factors influencing the life chances of individuals. We construct egocentric neighbourhoods, where contextual variables are quantified by an approach based on k nearest neighbours. The analyses are carried out with multilevel models departing significantly from previous studies where solely OLS regressions were employed. Using Swedish longitudinal register data, we show that the parental neighbourhood is highly influential in educational inequality of opportunity and remains so for earnings inequality of opportunity even years after exposure.
D33|Macroeconomic effects of personal and functional income inequality: Theory and empirical evidence for the US and Germany|This paper presents a simple illustrative post-Kaleckian model of distribution and growth that incorporates personal income inequality and interdependent social norms. The model shows in an easily accessible manner how personal and functional income inequality can potentially have contrary effects on aggregate demand and growth. It can illustrate some of the major domestic developments that took place in different countries in the decades prior to the Great Recession and which were connected to inequality and country specific consumption and saving behaviour. Furthermore, aggregate consumption functions are estimated for the United States and Germany. The finding of previous studies regarding a higher elasticity of aggregate consumption with respect to wage income than with respect to profit income is confirmed. We find positive long-run effects of personal income inequality on consumption in the US. The effect is strongest for the top 10% income share and the Gini index and less strong for the top 5% and 1% income shares. While this is evidence for relative consumption patterns, it also supports the view that the 'super rich' are a somewhat distant strata for most people - questioning the notion of expenditure cascades from the very top to the very bottom of the distribution. For Germany, we fail to find compelling evidence for substantial effects of personal income distribution.
D33|Financialisation and distribution in the US, the UK, Spain, Germany, Sweden and France: Before and after the crisis|In this paper we analyse the effects of financialisation on income distribution, before and after the Great Financial Crisis and the Great Recession. The focus is on functional income distribution and thus on the relationship between financialisation and the wage share or the gross profit share. The analysis is based on a Kaleckian theory of income distribution adapted to the conditions of financialisation. Financialisation may thus affect aggregate wage or gross profit shares of the economy as a whole through three channels: first, the sectoral composition of the economy, second the financial overhead costs and profit claims of the rentiers, and third the bargaining power of workers and trade unions. We examine empirical indicators for each of these channels for six OECD economies, both before and after the crisis. The country set contains the 'private demand boom' economies before the crisis, the US, the UK, and Spain, the 'export-led mercantilist' economies Germany and Sweden, and France representing a 'domestic demand-led' economy. We find that these countries have shown broad similarities regarding redistribution before the crisis, however, with major differences in the underlying determinants. These differences have carried through to the period after the crisis and have led to different results regarding the development of distribution since then.

D33|The Impact of Income Inequality, Environmental Degradation and Globalization on Life Expectancy in Pakistan: An Empirical Analysis|Purpose: This study has investigated the impact of income inequality, globalization and environmental degradation on life expectancy in Pakistan. The study uses time series data for the period 1980-2015 for empirical analysis. Methodology: Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and Phillip and Perron (PP) unit root tests are employed for examining the order of integration of the variables. Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach is used for investigating the cointegration among the variables of the model. For examining the causal relationship Granger Causality test is used. Findings: The results of the study reveal that income inequality and environmental degradation have negative and significant impact on life expectancy in Pakistan. On the other hand globalization has positive and significant impact on life expectancy in Pakistan. The results of Granger causality show that there is unidirectional causality running from all independent variables to dependent variable. Recommendations: The study opens new insights for policy makers.
D33|Does Inequality Hamper Innovation and Growth?|The paper builds upon the Agent Based-Stock Flow Consistent model presented in Caiani et al. (2015) to analyze the relationship between income and wealth inequality and economic development. For this sake, the original model has been amended under three main dimensions: first, the households sector has been subdivided into workmen, office workers, researchers, and executives which compete on segmented labor markets. Conversely, firms are now characterized by a hierarchical organization structure which determines, according to firms’ output levels, their demand for each type of workers. Second, in order to account for the impact of income and wealth distribution on consumption patterns, different households classes - also representing different income groups - have diversified average propensities to consume and save. Finally, the model now embeds technological change in an evolutionary flavor, affecting labor productivity evolution in the consumption sector through product innovation in the capital sector, where firms invest in R&D and produce differentiated vintages of machineries. The model is then calibrated using realistic values for both income and wealth distribution across different income groups, and their average propensities to consume. Results of the simulation experiments suggest that more progressive tax schemes and labor market policies aiming to increase low and middle workers’ coordination, and to support their wage levels, concur to foster economic development and to reduce inequality, though the latter seem to be more effective under both respects. The model thus provides some evidence in favor of a wage-led growth regime, where improvements of middle-low levels workers’ conditions create positive systemic effects, which eventually trickle up also to high income-profit earners households.
D33|A stylised macroeconomic model incorporating green capital in the framework of Viability Theory|New Zealand’s Treasury, as illustrated by its Living Standards Framework, desires policy that not only promotes economic growth, but also sustainability and equity. This paper studies how taxation and abatement policy can work to keep an economy viable in regards to capital stocks, consumption, debt, environment and the relative factor share (a proxy for income inequality), as well as the trade-oﬀs it faces in diﬀerent levels of pollutant industry. This is done in the context of Viability Theory, a branch of mathematics suited for policy analysis. The results show that reducing an economies environmental impact is key for achieving the multi faceted growth laid out in the Living Standards Framework.

D33|Housing prices, mortgage interest rates and the rising share of capital income in the United States|Piketty (2014) documents how the share of aggregate income going to capital in the United States has risen in the post-war era. Rognlie (2015) has since shown that this is largely due to the housing sector. This paper explores the determinants of the secular rise in the share of housing capital income (or 'rental income') in the US economy. I first decompose the aggregate national accounts by geographic region and also by type of housing. I then exploit variation across US states in factors that could explain housing capital income, such as interest rates, housing prices and income growth. The analysis shows that the long-run increase in the aggregate share of housing capital income is mainly due to higher imputed rental income going to owner-occupiers. I also find evidence that the rise in the share of housing capital income over recent decades reflects a combination of: 1) lower real interest rates; 2) lower consumer price inflation; and 3) constraints on the supply of new housing in some large US cities. In effect, the paper documents that the fall in nominal interest rates over the 1980s and 1990s raised the demand for housing and pushed up housing prices and rents (relative to non-housing prices) in supply-constrained areas. I estimate that the long-term decline in interest rates can explain more than half the increase in the share of nominal income spent on housing since the early 1980s.

D33|Trade and Distributional Impacts of Genetically Modified Crops in India: A CGE Analysis|Against the background of declining agricultural productivity and a large population, genetically modified (GM) crops could play a key role in India. The current article uses a modified GTAP model to study empirically the overall impacts of the adoption of GM cotton, soybean, maize and rice on various sectors of the Indian economy through computable general equilibrium analysis. The impacts of a compulsory labelling policy and positive and negative preference shifts towards GM rice by Indian consumers are also analysed along with the effects on income distribution. The results indicate that productivity improvements from GM technology adoption in India have a significant positive impact on Indiaâ€™s production, trade and welfare. Even a possible ban on the import of GM rice from India by European Union (EU) will not have any negative welfare impact on Indian consumers, though the export of Indian rice will be much lower.

D33|Distributive Conflict, Growth, and the ‘Entrepreneurial State’|In this paper, we introduce a twofold role for the public sector in the Goodwin (1967) growth cycle model. The government collects income taxes in order to: (a) invest in infrastructure capital, which directly affects the production possibilities of the economy; (b) finance publicly funded research, which augments the growth rate of labor productivity. We first focus on a special case in which labor productivity growth depends entirely on public research, and show that: (i) provided that the output-elasticity of infrastructure is greater than the elasticity of labor productivity growth to public R&D, there exists a tax rate tau* that maximizes the long-run labor share, but not a growth-maximizing tax rate; (ii) the long-run labor share is always increasing in the share of public spending in infrastructure, and (iii) the presence of public R&D is not enough to stabilize the distributive conflict. We then study a more general model with induced technical change where, as is well known in the literature, the distributive conflict is resolved in the long run. With induced technical change: (iv) the labor share-maximizing tax rate is the same as in the special case; (v) the long-run share of labor is always increasing in the share of public spending in infrastructure, and (vi) maximizing growth requires to levy a tax rate in excess of tau*.
D33|The High Profitability of Big Chinese State-Owned Banks and China’s Growth Model|Abstract A striking feature of China’s amazing growth in the last 35 years or so is the declining share of labor income as a share of the overall national income of China. This article makes a contribution to the ongoing discussion of how to explain this empirical finding by analyzing the sources of the high profitability of big Chinese state-owned banks. Using the methodology of an international peer group financial indicator analysis combined with a simple regression model it can be shown that the comparatively high profitability of Chinese banks depends on their ability to wield some monopoly power on both the product as well as the labor market. Other than stressed in the relevant financial literature the high profitability is not merely the result of an artificially high interest rate margin. The empirical findings indicate that it is above all the result of comparatively low staff expenses, which in turn explains why the share of labor income is declining.
D33|Third Parties and Specific Investments|Abstract Competitive advantage is typically based on a unique nexus of firm-specific investments that creates inimitable quasi-rents. Because it is impossible to write complete contracts on how to distribute the quasi-rents, stakeholders tend to underinvest in firm-specific assets to avoid the hold-up risk. This paper empirically tests the effect of third-party ownership on specific investments. Third-party ownership assigns the rights of residual control to independent fiduciaries. We conduct variations of the trust game, in which a third party, rather than the receiver, distributes the returns on investments. A randomly chosen third party with a fixed payment induces larger investments over time although the experimental design rules out reputation building. If receivers select the third parties, this benefit vanishes. If the third party receives a reward for the appointment, investments actually decrease. Investors (unwarrantedly) fear lower back transfers in such cases.
D33|The Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson Model and the Cambridge Capital Controversies|This paper examines the validity of the factor price equalisation theorem (FPET) in relation to capital theory. Additionally, it presents a survey of the literature on Heckscherâ€“Ohlinâ€“Samuelson (HOS) models that treat capital as a primary factor, beginning with Samuelson (1953). Furthermore, this paper discusses the Cambridge capital controversy, which contends that marginal productivity theory does not hold when capital is assumed to be as a bundle of reproducible commodities instead of as a primary factor. Consequently, it is shown that under this assumption, the FPET does not hold, even when there is no reversal of capital intensity. This paper also demonstrates that the recent studies on the dynamic HOS trade theory generally ignore the diÂ¢ culties posed by the capital controversies and are thereby able to conclude that the FPET holds even when capital is modelled as a reproducible factor. Our analysis suggests that there is a need for a basic theory of international trade that does not rely on factor price equalisation and a model that formulates capital as a bundle of reproducible commodities.
D33|Business in the United States: Who Owns It, and How Much Tax Do They Pay?|"""Pass-through"" businesses like partnerships and S-corporations now generate over half of US business income and account for much of the post-1980 rise in the top-1% income share. We use administrative tax data from 2011 to identify pass-through business owners and estimate how much tax they pay. We present three findings: (1) relative to traditional business income, pass-through business income is substantially more concentrated among high-earners; (2) partnership ownership is opaque: 20% of the income goes to unclassifiable partners, and 15% of the income is earned in circularly owned partnerships; and (3) the average federal income tax rate on US pass-through business income is 19%--much lower than the average rate on traditional corporations. If pass-through activity had remained at 1980's low level, strong but straightforward assumptions imply that the 2011 average US tax rate on total US business income would have been 28% rather than 24%, and tax revenue would have been approximately $100 billion higher."

D33|Preferencias por la redistribución para el caso uruguayo: aproximación a través de movilidad social y percepciones|These study principal aim is to contribute, and start the discussion about the determinants of the preferences for redistribution for the Uruguayan society, specially making emphasize on channels related to beliefs and perceptions. Firstly, after presenting a brief theoric discussion in which the classical model is explained, new theories are added. The aim is to prove whether for the Uruguayan case, these channels apply. The methodologic strategy adopted implies working with longitudinal data, “Estudio Longitudinal de Bienestar en Uruguay”, having been carried in 2004, 2006 and 2011/12. Estimations are based on POLS method. Hypothesis under analysis imply contrasting if the preferences for redistribution are explained, partly, by income, bias of income distribution, effective and perceived social mobility, and opinions about social justice. Results suggest that income, bias of income distribution and experienced social mobility between generations are the channels that predict what the theory predicts.

The methodology used was a review of official data on Pronaf, which directed the questions about the volume of funds available for credit, as well as on the distribution of these between groups of beneficiaries and regions in Brazil. As main results, it is highlighted that only the redistribution of resources is not sufficient for the recognition of farmers.
D33|Beyond the austerity dispute: new priorities for fiscal policy|The workshop aimed at moving forward the fiscal policy debate, which in the crisis years was unavoidably focused on how to regain fiscal credibility and to implement sizable and fast consolidation plans. Four main themes have been proposed for the debate during the workshop. First, the two-way link between fiscal consolidation and inequality, with the idea that consolidation efforts cannot be successful in the long run if they entail a socially unsustainable increase in inequality. Second, the importance of preserving, even in contexts in which the fiscal policy stance is necessarily restrictive, growth-enhancing public investments. Third, the challenges posed to fiscal management by a low inflation context, taking into account that a subdued price dynamics not only makes the real burden of debt heavier, but it also has subtle effects, at least in the short term, on several budgetary items. Finally, the need for a simpler and more appropriate set of rules for the governance of the EMU. The latter topic was also the object of the high-level panel at the end of the workshop. While differences in emphasis emerged among the panellists, they agreed that the current framework could be streamlined, and – more importantly – that no set of rules can work if trust and a sense of sharing a common objective is not rebuilt among the Member States.

D33|La carga tributaria sobre los ingresos laborales y de capital en Colombia: el caso del impuesto sobre la renta y el IVA|En este artículo se estima el tamaño y la incidencia de la carga tributaria sobre los trabajadores y los propietarios de capital en Colombia durante el periodo 2000-2014. La carga tributaria se determina mediante tarifas efectivas agregadas, que relacionan el recaudo, en este caso del impuesto sobre la renta y el IVA, con la capacidad de pago de trabajadores y propietarios. Los resultados indican que durante casi todo el periodo de análisis los ingresos laborales soportaron una tarifa efectiva superior a la que recayó sobre los ingresos de capital, aunque la brecha ha tendido a cerrarse. Por lo general, el efecto redistributivo habría sido contraproducente para propósitos de equidad (en una ocasión, nimio). El ejercicio sugiere que para mejorar la distribución de la carga tributaria es más importante prestar atención a la capacidad gravable de los contribuyentes, antes que dar trato desigual a las fuentes factoriales de ingreso. ****** This paper estimates the size and incidence of the tax burden on workers and owners of capital in Colombia during the period 2000-2014. The tax burden is measured by aggregate effective rates, which relate tax revenue, in this case from the income tax and the VAT, to the workers’ and owners’ ability to pay. The results indicate that, for most of the period of analysis, labor income bore a higher effective rate than capital income, although the gap has tended to close. Generally, the redistributive effect would have been counterproductive for equity purposes (on one occasion, insignificant). The exercise suggests that in order to improve the distribution of the tax burden, it is more important to pay attention to the taxpayers’ ability to pay, rather than giving unequal treatment to the factorial sources of income.
D33|On the influence of hard leverage in a soft leverage bargaining game: The importance of credible claims|What makes a bargaining proposal credible? We study how hard leverage (binding commitment) influences soft leverage (appealing to a focal point) in a rich-context bargaining game known to exhibit competing claims to focality. In three treatments, our experiment varies one bargainer's ability to commit, holding the soft leverage condition fixed. As in previous studies, we observe that opening offers are consistent with the available soft leverage. The influence of hard leverage is most evident in the concessionary stage. Hard and soft leverage interact to influence outcomes: Hard leverage advantages its holder, yet settlements largely stay between the two focal points. We posit that focal points induce mutual expectations of bargainer social preferences that, when combined with the Nash bargaining solution, imply the comparative statics concerning the settlements observed. A similarly modified version of the Zeuthen–Harsanyi model of the bargaining process, agrees with the comparative statics on opening offers and concessions.

D33|Financialisation and the financial and economic crises: theoretical framework and empirical analysis for 15 countries|This chapter analyses the long-run effects of financialisation and of the recent financial and economic crises for 15 countries. In order to provide a theoretical framework, we first outline three types of regimes under the conditions of financialisation, namely a debt-led private demand boom, an export-led mercantilist, and a domestic demand-led regime. We then take a look at the sectoral financial balances of the main macroeconomic sectors and at the growth contributions of the demand aggregates for each of the 15 countries, focusing in particular on the trade cycle before the crises. This enables us to cluster these countries according to the typology of regimes and describe the development dynamics among various groups, which were complementary and often mutually reinforcing, in the years leading up to the crises. Subsequently, we focus on the period following the outbreak of the crises and, by considering transmission mechanisms and main obstacles to recovery, analyse how countries in each of these clusters were affected. Finally, we focus on the regime shifts that have taken place in the course of the crises and we discuss the implications of these recent developments for the world economy.
D33|Wage-led versus profit-led demand regimes: the long and the short of it|Empirical studies have found mixed results regarding whether various countries have wage-led or profit-led demand regimes. Most of the previous literature has paid little attention to the time dimension of this distinction, but most of the studies that have found profit-led results have used methodologies that emphasize short-run cyclical relationships. This paper argues that demand is more likely to be profit-led in the short run and more likely to be wage-led in the longer term, because the positive effects of lower labor costs on investment and net exports are likely to be strongest in the short run, while the positive effects of a higher wage share on consumption are likely to be strongest in the longer term, at least in the US case (other countries may differ).
D33|A Confusion of Capital in the United States|Thomas Piketty’s book, Capital in the Twenty-First Century, reopens fundamental questions about the role and rewards of capital that economists have never resolved. It does so by exploring the history of capital and derives much of its credibility from the evidence it marshals in defence of its claims. In this paper, I evaluate the basis for Piketty’s arguments by considering them in light of the history of US capitalism. I argue that it is extremely difficult to make economic sense of Piketty’s historical analysis of capital in the US in the 19th and 20th centuries. That is true, only in part, due to the distinctive choices he makes, compared to mainstream economists, in defining and measuring capital. Much more problematic, in fact, are theoretical commitments he shares with them that preclude an understanding of capital’s historical role and rewards in the US economy. Based on a discussion of several important features of US economic history, I have argued that such an understanding demands an historical analysis of capital, both productive and financial capital, in relation to the evolving social organisation of capitalism in the US.
D33|Generation and distribution of the total factor productivity gains in US industries| This study estimates productivity gains and their distribution among inputs and outputs for 63 American industries over the period 1987–2012. Using the traditional surplus accounting method, the Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth rates are divided into their price change components in order to determine the stakeholders who do or do not receive price advantages.An initial analysis showed that TFP of US industries increased at an average trend of 0.8% and established that remunerations to employees and firms’ profitability constituted 49% and 39%, respectively, of the accumulated economic surplus from the productivity gains. Suppliers of intermediate inputs retained 12.1% of the surplus. Finally, customers, equipment and structure providers were the losers in the distribution of economic surplus via, respectively, a significant growth of relative final demand prices and a substantial price decrease of these assets.A second step analysis underlined that industries with high TFP growth rates mainly benefited customers and firms via output price decreases and profitability improvements while industries with low or negative TFP changes hurt customers through significant output price increases. The sectoral level analysis also showed that employees’ remunerations depend only slightly on productivity gains produced within their industrial sectors.
D33|Correlation Between Tax Culture And College Education Tax: Case State University Of Sonora,Correlacion Entre Cultura Tributaria Y Educacion Tributaria Universitaria: Caso Universidad Estatal De Sonora|This research project was carried out to establish the development of a tax-based culture, where each University student has the opportunity to express the commitment he/she must have to help in the development of their country. The idea is to to correct deep-rooted tax-evasion behaviors that have been continuously present in a great number of individuals to evade their duties with the State. We analyze if tax-based culture is essential in the curricular structure of the educational program of State University of Sonoraâ€™s international trade major. We wish to calcify that there are multiple agents in their campus for the strengthening and growth of a better tax-based culture in the country. It is desired that students understand the existence of a tax-based culture and the existence of multiple agents in their campus to show the importance of taxation. We suggest that the University, should include teaching programs in tax-based culture to enhance the values internal revue in students. The methodology was composed of a questionnaire application descriptive to two hundred and thirty-six students. The conclusions reached were absence of tax-based culture in more than half the University population and no formal education in this matter is given in the school classes
D33|Inequality and the New Deal|There is a large body of literature analyzing the onset of the Great Depression or the factors influencing economic recovery in the 1930s, especially the New Deal. The role of income inequality before and during the Great Depression, however, has almost never been discussed thoroughly. This paper attempts to answer two questions. Firstly, was inequality perceived as a problem by the Roosevelt administration? Secondly, did the New Deal incorporate these concerns such that economic policy design did take seriously the problem of inequality? Using official documents such as transcripts of Roosevelt's inaugural speeches, fireside chats and press conferences, this paper finds that top-end inequality was not recognized as a major political topic. Restoring the purchasing power of workers and farmers, however, appears to have been a political goal of the administration. The impact of New Deal policies on top-end income inequality or the wage share, however, can only be considered as modest. Only World War II and the long-term legislation of the New Deal may be considered successful in reducing top income and wealth shares and raising the wage share.
D33|A New Multidimensional Ranking of Shadow Economy for EU Countries|Shadow economy is a perennial, multifaceted and hard to gauge phenomenon that affects to some degree all countries. Scientific research needs to develop rigorous and internationally comparable metrics of shadow economy in order to avoid possible misunderstanding, exaggeration and sometimes bad intentions concerning the assessment of shadow economy, corruption and fiscal fraud. Considering the limitations of single shadow economy indicators we propose a more comprehensive measurement based on a new synthetic shadow economy index (SSEI). This index encompasses three relevant indicators, namely the size of shadow economy per capita, the shadow economy relative to GDP and the countries’ shares in EU total shadow economy. The analysis covered the period 1999 to 2012 and the results indicated that some of the developed EU countries, rather than the new members, are on top positions of the shadow economy. We also found a sigma convergence trend in shadow economy size and intensity among EU-28 countries over 1999-2012. The main conclusion of our paper is that the analyses of shadow economy should be based on a set of relevant indicators, instead of a single indicator.
D33|Stocks or flows? New thinking about monetary transmission through the lending channel|The lending channel is conventionally understood to transmit monetary policy through the origination of new loans. In this paper, we postulate that the lending channel may also operate via the stock of existing loans. Monetary shocks generate two types of income effects: 1) monthly mortgage payments are impacted when rates are reset; 2) inflation erodes the real value of mortgage payments and increases the disposable income of borrowers. These income effects translate into variations in output due to the heterogeneous propensity to consume of individual economic agents. Three types of factors determine the importance of these income effects for individual households and at macro level: 1) borrowers’ features, such as income distribution, indebtedness and debt burden, 2) loan features, such as the period of rate fixation and 3) price developments. Significant differences in these factors across euro area Member States can distort a homogeneous transmission of the single monetary policy.
D33|Institutional Impact of Brain Drain, Human Capital, and Inequality: A Political Economy Analysis|"This paper uses an ""exit and voice"" political economy model to examine the institutional impact of brain drain, human capital, and inequality. Some of the main findings are: 1) the impact of brain drain m on institutional quality is U-shaped, with a maximum at m = 0; 2) the institutional impact of human capital h is U-shaped; 3) the likelihood that institutions will improve with m (h) is inversely related to international (domestic) inequality. Thus, the prospect that institutions will improve with human capital is likely to be small in SSA and LAC, where income inequality is substantially higher than in East Asia."
D33|Increasing capital income share and its effect on personal income inequality|"Piketty's r>g implies an increase in capital-output ratio and in the share of capital income in net output. But it still does not guarantee the increase in personal income inequality. We derive the conditions for the ""pass-through"" from the rise in the share of capital income to greater personal income inequality. They have to do with the concentration of income from capital and its association with higher overall income. A key way to break the ""pass-through"" is to diversify ownership of capital (""people's capitalism"")."
D33|Inequality, Risk-Sharing and the Crisis: A View From Australia|We document the cross-sectional stylized facts of inequality for Australian households between 2001 and 2012 using the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey. Inequality of individual wages, hours worked and earnings remain flat. Household pre-government income and non-durable consumption inequality decline slightly. Household income inequality exceeds non-durable consumption inequality during the global financial crisis, and over the life-cycle, suggesting households partially insure income shocks. The degree of progressivity and private intermediation of risk are high. Both equivalized net financial wealth and net total wealth inequality remain relatively flat. Taxes and transfers reduce the variance of permanent shocks.
D33|Human Capital Investment, Inequality and Economic Growth|We treat rising inequality is an equilibrium outcome in which human capital investment fails to keep pace with rising demand for skills. Investment affects skill supply and prices on three margins: the type of human capital in which to invest; how much to acquire; and the intensity of use. The latter two represent the intensive margins of human capital acquisition and utilization. These choices are substitutes for the creation of new skilled workers, yet they are complementary with each other, magnifying inequality. When skill-biased technical change drives economic growth, greater inequality reduces growth.
D33|Institutional Reform in the Rural Sector with Labor and Capital Flows: Factor Income Effects, Structural Changes and Misallocations|We analyze the general equilibrium effects of a fundamental property regime transition in the rural sector - agricultural or resource - when both labor and (reproducible) capital are free to move. In contrast to manufacturing, rural production has two characteristic features: it uses a fixed natural asset (land or other natural resources) and operates under one of two property regime types: common property versus exclusive property. Common property is fundamentally characterized with sharing, thus corresponding to such institutions as the family farm (Lewis 1954), free access to resources, and collective use, but adapted for the presence of capital use. We show that labor may actually gain from being effectively forced out of the rural sector. More generally, relative factor intensities determine the factor return effects of the transition, as well as either capital or labor deepening in both sectors. And while the unit cost of effective input efforts decrease, both factors flow out of the rural sector. Under a common property regime, the agricultural productivity gaps for labor and capital are uniquely determined by the output elasticity of land.
D33|Personal income inequality and aggregate demand|This paper presents a theoretical and empirical investigation of how changes in the size distribution of income can affect aggregate demand and the demand regime of an economy. After presenting empirical evidence for the US economy that the propensity to save increases significantly from the bottom to the top quintile of wage earners, we demonstrate that more equal distributions always lead to higher output in the traditional neo-Kaleckian macroeconomic model. We also present conditions under which a reduction of income inequality among workers results in demand becoming more wage led. This view is supported by the results of an econometric study for the USA (1967–2010), which show that the rise after 1980 in income inequality has made the US economy more profit led.
D33|Rent as a share of product and Sraffa’s price equations|The classical economists usually regarded rent in their analyses as a share of the gross product obtained from the use of land or a mine, which was indeed the way rent was treated in bargaining between landowner and tenant. The article revives this view of rent, proceeding from its historical basis through Smith’s analysis to arrive at Sraffa’s equations, and also examines the case of the introduction of a tax conceived as a tithe, to which Sraffa referred very briefly (Sraffa, 1960, p 55).
D33|Inequality, Leverage, and Crises|The paper studies how high household leverage and crises can be caused by changes in the income distribution. Empirically, the periods 1920-1929 and 1983-2008 both exhibited a large increase in the income share of high-income households, a large increase in debt leverage of low- and middle-income households, and an eventual financial and real crisis. The paper presents a theoretical model where higher leverage and crises are the endogenous result of a growing income share of high-income households. The model matches the profiles of the income distribution, the debt-to-income ratio and crisis risk for the three decades preceding the Great Recession. (JEL D14, D31, D33, E32, E44, G01, N22)
D33|Competitività e distribuzione funzionale nell'Eurozona|Nell’ultimo ventennio le economie europee hanno visto cambiare il contesto in cui sono immerse: alla pressione proveniente dalle grandi economie emergenti si è aggiunta quella dovuta alla cancellazione di meccanismi di isolamento nominale dai competitor interni all’Unione. Il CLUP si è così trasformato in un indicatore della rapidità di adattamento al nuovo contesto, diventando una delle metriche essenziali per definire modelli virtuosi e non. Il modello affermatosi come virtuoso è stato quello tedesco, con una riduzione sbalorditiva del CLUP. Per l’Italia, la critica più comune unisce la costatazione di una crescita della produttività anemica ad una crescita dei salari indipendente dalla produttività stessa. Da qui la richiesta di meccanismi di contrattazione decentrata, che consentano di legare i salari alla produttività. In questo lavoro mostriamo come in Italia le due principali componenti del CLUP (produttività e costo del lavoro) non si siano separate significativamente nell’ultimo ventennio. La peculiarità del modello tedesco, quindi, si identifica nel riuscire coniugare una crescita della produttività “francese” con una dinamica salariale “italiana”, con risultati immaginabili dal punto di vista della distribuzione del reddito. L’introduzione dei cambi fissi ha permesso di massimizzare il rendimento di questa strategia competitiva, consentendo incrementi della domanda estera proporzionali alla capacità del sistema di contrattazione di non ridistribuire gli aumenti di produttività. L’evidenza raccolta ma stimola una riflessione su alcuni temi del dibattito attuale. In particolare, va chiarito se è questo il modello di competitività che l’Europa vuole imporre a sé stessa, e se il decentramento della contrattazione salariale deve essere un meccanismo redistributivo strutturalmente penalizzante per il lavoro o, piuttosto, un meccanismo incentivante di condivisione dei risultati economici.
D33|Inequality, Financial Deepening and Current Account Impact|In this paper, we analyze the relationship between inequality and the current account, discussing the role of the financial system in the interaction between these variables. Using panel data of 29 advanced and developing countries for the 1970-2011 period, our results confirm that a higher wage share is associated with a decrease in the current account. This result is robust to different specifications and econometric methodologies. On the other hand, while we found evidence that deterioration in personal income distribution is associated with a lower current account balance, our results shows that the relationship is stronger in emerging economies than in advanced ones, the opposite of what had been suggested by the recent literature, focused on the US. The existence of differences between groups of countries confirms that the relationship between income distribution and external sector is mediated by various structural and idiosyncratic factors. Therefore, we warn about the danger of generalizing results based only on the study of advanced economies.
D33|Thomas Piketty, the Future of Capitalism and the Theory of Distribution: A Review Essay| This essay reviews Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century. The focus is upon the conceptual framework and theoretical interpretation of the empirical findings assembled in the book, rather than those empirical findings themselves (which are, in any case, broadly incontestable). The core theoretical logic of the distributional dynamics is explained and subjected to scrutiny with respect to the theory of distribution in particular, but also the theory of growth.
D33|The “Peter Pan Syndrome” in Emerging Markets: The Productivity-Transparency Tradeoff in IT Adoption|Firms make investments in technology to increase productivity. But in emerging markets, where a culture of informality is widespread, information technology (IT) investments leading to greater transparency can impose a cost through higher taxes and need for regulatory compliance. This tendency of firms to avoid productivity-enhancing technologies and remain small to avoid transparency has been dubbed the “Peter Pan Syndrome.” We examine whether firms make the tradeoff between productivity and transparency by examining IT adoption in the Indian retail sector. We find that computer technology adoption is lower when firms have motivations to avoid transparency. Specifically, technology adoption is lower when there is greater corruption, but higher when there is better enforcement and auditing. So firms have a higher productivity gain threshold to adopt computers in corrupt business environments with patchy and variable enforcement of the tax laws. Not accounting for this motivation to hide from the formal sector underestimates productivity gains from computer adoption. Thus in addition to their direct effects on the economy, enforcement, auditing and corruption can have indirect effects through their negative impact on adoption of productivity enhancing technologies that also increase operational transparency.
D33|The Dynamics of Earnings in Germany: Evidence from Social Security Records|We examine patterns of earnings volatility for male employees who are subject to statutory social security contributions in West Germany over the period 1986 - 2005. For this purpose, we analyse individual records covering highly reliable earnings biographies provided by the German Social Security Administration. We decompose earnings into permanent and transitory components and estimate parameters of the underlying variance-covariance structure of the earnings components model. This provides insights into the mechanics of earnings dynamics of the German labour market. We find evidence for increasing overall volatility which is predominantly driven by the permanent earnings component and therefore indicates increasing earnings inequality.
D33|Does employees’ compensation vary with corporate profit?|We find that from about 1965 to 1983 US employees’ compensation, EC, relative to corporate profit, CP, increases in the long run, and from 1984 to 2013 the compensation decreases relative to profit to about half its 1983 value. The first period includes “US peacetime inflation”, 1970–1978 and the last period includes “The Great Moderation”, 1985–1997. With the exception of a short period 1998–2003, the dominant pattern is that corporate profit and employees’ compensation increase and decrease in concert, but compensation lags profit with about 10 quarters. From 1965 to present, cycle times for the EC–CP pair generally decreases from about 60 quarters to about 40 quarters.
D33|Dealing with cost-push inflation in Latin America: multi-causality in a context of increased openness and commodity price volatility|Despite recognizing the exogenous, cost-push nature of recent inflationary pressures in Latin America, plus the difficulties faced by monetary authorities in dealing, under such circumstances, with internal and external disequilibria simultaneously, intellectual attention in policy circles remains focused on demand-side issues and policy instruments. This paper develops an eclectic model that has the potential to nest demand-side elements, but focuses on cost-push factors â€“ distributional conflict and propagation mechanisms â€“ as typically addressed by the post-Keynesianâ€“structuralist tradition. In addition to shedding some light on the nature of inflationary pressures as experienced in Latin American countries during the recent commodity boom â€“ in particular South American commodity exporting economies â€“ the paper's main goal is to portray the policy and instrumental trade-offs faced by policy-makers themselves. By bringing unconventional policy devices into the model (such as direct interventions in commodity markets), we hope to broaden the scope of the conventional macroeconomic policy instruments.
D33|Distribución del ingreso, impuestos y transferencias en México. Un análisis de equilibrio general aplicado|This article argues that, given the strong income concentration in Mexico, and the narrowness of the income tax base, it is very difficult to realize a tax reform that is redistributive, and increases tax collection. For that purpose, an applied model of general equilibrium was built, which includes, among some other things: a disaggregation of homes in 10 income levels, the tax and transferring structures of the country, and the productive and consumer spheres. The scenario confirms that to achieve a significant addition in tax collection, and, at the same time, to diminish the income inequality (measured by the Gini coefficient), imply increases of rates and bases, which is difficult to achieve in the present conditions.// En este artículo se argumenta que, dada la fuerte concentración del ingreso en México y la estrechez de la base tributaria del ingreso, resulta muy difícil realizar una reforma tributaria que sea recaudatoria y redistributiva. Para ello se construyó un modelo de equilibrio general aplicado que incluye, entre otras cosas, una desagregación de los hogares en 10 niveles de ingreso, la estructura tributaria y de transferencias del país y las esferas productivas y de consumo. Los escenarios confirman que, lograr una recaudación adicional significativa, y mejorar al mismo tiempo la desigualdad del ingreso (medida por el coeficiente de Gini), implica aumentos de tasas o bases difíciles de lograr en las condiciones actuales
D33|Precarious democracies, political negotiation and selective predation|This paper demonstrates that a precarious democracy is harmful to the poor rather than benefiting them as long as the governing party, being a highly informal organization, includes a cartel of political patrons and business people. The mayor is unable to govern freely due to controls or vetoes exercised by those collective actors to which he/she belongs. Not having been elected democratically, the objective of these groups is to co-opt the state at the subnational level by violating civil rights and liberties on election days and committing crimes against the public administration during the term of government.
D33|Wealth Concentration, Income Distribution, and Alternatives for the USA|US household wealth concentration is not likely to decline in response to fiscal interventions alone. Creation of an independent public wealth fund could lead to greater equality. Similarly, once-off tax/transfer packages or wage increases will not reduce income inequality significantly; on-going wage increases in excess of productivity growth would be needed. These results come from the accounting in a simulation model based on national income and financial data. The theory behind the model borrows from ideas that originated in Cambridge UK (especially from Luigi Pasinetti and Richard Goodwin).
D33|Effects of Redistributive Policies on Income Distribution: An Intertemporal CGE Analysis|Despite enormous increase in global financial liquidity from the beginning of 2000s until 2007-8, the income distribution in developing countries did not improve. Moreover, due to the effects of the global financial crisis, the income distribution even get worsened; the income difference between the richest and the poorest households widened within each country. This is also the phenomenon in Turkey: in 2003-14 period the real per capita GDP has increased by 43.4% while the poverty rate (share of population whose income is half of the median income) and the income inequality (Gini coefficient) have experienced limited recoveries. This paper, with the aid of an intertemporal model that reflects the decision making processes of different representative household groups and firms in a small open economy framework, focuses on the effects of re-distributional policies on the income distribution. Segmented labor markets and existence of non-Ricardian type of households who does not have a saving decision are major structural components of the model. In the calibration process, a micro-level non-longitudinal data set, Household Budget Survey (HBS), is utilized to obtain the household level parameters and also to construct the multi-sector production side of the model. This study, to our best knowledge, is the first effort to analyze the income distribution for the Turkish economy by using differentiated household structure in an intertemporal dynamic setting and by focusing on redistribute policies. Moreover, it is also the first study that uses a micro-level data set to calibrate the household level parameters and to construct a production side that is consistent with the private consumption expenditure composition.
D33|The distributional effects of contractual norms: the case of cropshare agreements|"According to principal-agent theory, a share contract strikes an optimal balance between risk-sharing and incentive provision when it is difficult to gauge the agent's contribution. This theory predicts that the size of the share should vary with economic fundamentals. In practice, however, the share divisions that are specified often cluster around ""usual and customary"" levels — even when there is substantial heterogeneity among principal - agent pairs. Using Illinois farm-level data observed between 1980 and 1994 that include soil productivity ratings, tenant net income, and crop yields, the author examines the economic consequences of adhering to established contractual norms. Almost all share agreements in the northern two-thirds of the state specify an equal division of crops between the landowner and tenant farmer, while the majority of share contracts in the southern third allot either three-fifths or two-thirds of all production to the tenant. The paper tests whether existing share arrangements distort the division of surplus between the principal (landowner) and the agent (tenant farmer), or if these potential distortions are somehow preempted by adjustments along other contractual margins. No previous study has attempted to empirically estimate the effect that uniformity in share contracts has on factor returns."
D33|The Decentralization of Minimum Wage Setting in Russia Economies|In this paper, we study the minimum wage reform in Russia, which aimed to decentralize the fixing of the minimum wage and to increase the involvement of social partners in this process. The old system of the minimum wage setting was based on a single nation-wide minimum wage, which was differentiated across regions and occupations via a cumbersome framework of coefficients. The new system is a mixture of a government-legislated minimum wage at the federal level and collective agreements at regional levels. We show that the system of minimum wage setting has become more flexible. The reform succeeded in raising the real value of the minimum wage and increasing earnings of low paid workers without causing considerable negative effects in terms of employment. However, the reform did not lead to greater regional variation of minimum wages. It introduced some new imbalances: an unintended consequence of the reform was the emergence of separate regional wage sub-minima for private and public sector workers in many regions. The major challenge in coming years is to strengthen the institutions of collective bargaining, introduce evidence-based evaluation and boost the capacities of government and non-government monitoring agencies
D33|ヘクシャー=オリーン=サミュエルソン貿易理論と資本理論|本稿は、ヘクシャー=オリーン=サミュエルソンモデル（HOSモデル）の理論的発展をレビューする。ケンブリッジ資本論争における新古典派経済学に対する批判を受けて、HOS貿易理論がどのような反応を示したのかにとりわけ関心を向ける。Samuelson（1953）による一般均衡理論に基づくHOS貿易理論は、費用関数のヤコビアンを用いて要素価格均等化定理の成立条件を明らかにし、その後の研究の方向性に大きな影響を与えた。資本論争での1つの教訓は、資本が複数の再生産可能財から成る場合、限界生産力説が一般的には成立しないことであった。同様に、国際貿易理論の文脈でも、標準的なHOSモデルの様に資本を1つの本源的生産要素と取り扱うのではなく、複数の再生産可能財から成ると見做すならば、資本を複数の再生産可能な財からなるものとしてより適切に定式化された下では、2財の世界であれ、それ以上の財の存在する世界であれ、一般的に要素価格均等化が実現しない事を本稿は示す。資本論争での批判を受けて、Burmeister(1978)は資本が本源的生産要素ではなく再生産可能財から成る場合の要素価格均等化の成立条件の特徴づけを行ったが、彼が提示したモデルは資本論争で提起された問題を回避していることを示す。以上の議論は、既存の標準的なHOS貿易理論とは異なって、要素価格均等化の実現を前提とせずに、資本を複数の再生産可能な財からなるものとしてより適切に定式化された下での国際貿易の基礎理論を新たに再構築する必要性を示唆している。
D33|Recent Declines in Labor's Share in US Income: A Preliminary Neoclassical Account| As shown in the 1930s by Hicks and Robinson the elasticity of substitution (`sigma`) is a key parameter that captures whether capital and labor are gross complements or substitutes. Establishing the magnitude of `sigma` is vital, not only for explaining changes in the distribution of income between factors but also for undertaking policy measures to influence it. Several papers have explained the recent decline in labor's share in income by claiming that `sigma` is greater than one and that there has been capital deepening. This paper presents evidence that refutes these claims. It shows that despite a rise in measured capital-labor ratios, labor-augmenting technical change in the US has been sufficiently rapid that effective capital-labor ratios have actually fallen in the sectors and industries that account for the largest portion of the declining labor share in income since 1980. In combination with estimates that corroborate the consensus in the literature that σ is less than 1, these declines in the effective capital ratio can account for much of the recent fall in labor's share in US income at both the aggregate and industry level. Paradoxically, these results also suggest that increased capital formation would raise labor's share in income.
D33|Relationship between Financial Development and Energy Consumption: The Case of Turkey|This paper examines the relationship between financial development and energy consumption in Turkey over the period 1980-2011 adopting cointegration and causality methodologies. Cointegration results indicate that there is no long run relation among the variables. Causality results, on the other hand, indicate that energy-finance nexus supports neutrality hypothesis in Turkey in the short run. The inconsistency across the papers in the case of Turkey clearly addresses the fact that it does really matter which financial development indicators are proxied.
D33|Income Distribution and the Great Depression|There is a growing literature comparing the current financial crisis or Great Recession to the worst economic crisis of capitalism, the Great Depression. However, the role of rising income inequality, which has risen dramatically before both crises, is rarely discussed. In this paper we discuss the rise of top-end inequality and its effects on household consumption, saving, and debt for the 1920s by applying a non-standard theory of consumption, the relative income hypothesis, to the period of interest. We argue that income inequality is linked to the increase of household consumption and the simultaneous decline of household savings as well as rapidly increasing household debt. Thus, the rise of top-end inequality in connection with a broader institutional change, such as the deregulation of financial markets, has contributed to a build-up of financial and macroeconomic instability, in the period leading to the Great Depression.
D33|Income distribution and current account: A sectoral perspective|We analyse the link between income distribution and the current account through a descriptive analysis for the G7 countries and a series of panel estimations for the G7 countries and a larger sample of 20 countries for the period 1972-2007. We find that, firstly, rising personal inequality leads to a decrease of household net lending and the current account, ceteris paribus. The effect is strong for top household income shares, but much weaker for the Gini coefficient of household income. This finding is consistent with consumption externalities resulting from upward-looking status comparisons. Secondly, an increase in the corporate financial balance leads to an increase in the current account, i.e., consumers do not fully 'pierce the corporate veil'. There is also tentative evidence that the corporate net lending and the current account increase as a result of a decline in the share of wages in value added. The joint effects of changes in personal and functional income distribution contribute to a significant degree to explaining the global current account imbalances prior to the Great Recession.
D33|Trade Liberalisation and Labor Markets in Developing Countries: Theory and Evidence|This paper presents a review of the theoretical and empirical literature on the effects of trade liberalization on the labor markets of developing countries. We discuss models which seek to explain the empirical finding that openness has increased wage inequality in several developing countries.
D33|EU Exports to the World: Effects on Employment and Income|For the European Commission a main priority has been to ensure that comprehensive, reliable and comparable economic information is available to support evidence-based policymaking in this regard. As part of such efforts, the DG Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission has been actively collaborating over the past few years with DG TRADE to construct a series of trade, employment and income indicators based on the World Input-Output Database (WIOD). The main motivation of this report is to provide scientific evidence of the effects of international trade on the EU-27 employment and income. This report is meant to be a valuable statistical tool for DG TRADE to be used in bilateral trade negotiations, European Commission preparatory studies and/or Communications and to show the relevance of international trade in terms of employment and value added creation.
D33|The Role of Trade and Offshoring in the Determination of Child Labour|Incorporating family decisions in a two-period-model of the world economy, we show that trade liberalization may reduce child labour in developing countries where the initial share of skilled workers in the adult workforce – though not as large as in developed countries – is nonetheless large enough to attract skill-intensive FDI from the latter. If the production activities so relocated are more skill-intensive than those carried out in the destination countries before liberalization, that will in fact tend to offset the downwards pressure on the ratio of skilled to unskilled wage rates (Stolper-Samuelson effect), and thus on the incentive for parents to invest in their children's education, associated with international specialization. The hypothesis is not rejected by the data, and thus helps to explain why child labour has not risen in all developing countries, but risen in some and fallen in others.
D33|Top Incomes in Canada: Evidence from the Census|This paper looks at the evolution of incomes at the top of the distribution in Canada. Master files of the Canadian Census are used to study the composition of top income earners between 1981 and 2011. Our main finding is that, as in the United States, executives and individuals working in the financial and business services sectors are the two most important groups driving the growth in top incomes in Canada. A finding more specific to Canada is that the oil and gas sector has also played an important role in income growth at the top, especially in more recent years. Another arguably Canadian-specific finding is that holders of medical degrees have lost ground compared to other top income earners. Finally, despite the IT revolution, scientists, engineers and even computer scientists do not account for much of the growth in top incomes in Canada.
D33|Capital income shares and income inequality in 16 EU member countries|In this paper, we estimate the effect of changes in capital income shares on inequality of gross household income. Using EU-SILC data covering 16 EU countries from 2005 to 2011 we find that the level of capital income shares is positively associated with the concentration of gross household income. Moreover, we show that the transmission of a shift in capital income shares into the personal distribution of income depends on the concentration of capital income in an economy. At the mean of the distribution of capital income a 1 percentage point increase of the capital share is associated with a 0.8 percentage point increase of the Gini coefficient of gross household income. Our findings imply that in many industrialized countries income inequality has by no means evolved independently from the observed structural shift in factor income towards a higher capital income share over the last decades.

D33|Fair Shares between Worker and Investor:Economic Experiments on Functional Income Distribution|Declines in labor wage rate accompanied with increases in dividend or stocks are worldwide tendencies since 1980s that designates significant change in functional income distribution between capital and labor. Whereas some empirical studies in macro-level analyzes these changes are caused by institutional changes in recent decades such as financialization, studies on micro-level analysis on functional income distributions are few. However, how workers and investors consider distribution justice may have significant importance for explaining recent changes in functional distribution. If both of workers and investors contributed to a production process in different ways, what is ‘fair’ share for each of them? In this paper we have performed economic experiments, consisting of investment stage, production stage and distribution stage and examined fairness ideals in functional income distribution. In our experiment each subject is pair-matched to constitute a two-player’s team consisting of a worker and an investor. After investment stage by an investor and production stage by a worker, each team member was required to give a proposal to separate a team earning with one’s pair. We have performed two different treatments: a) with-labor treatment in which investors are required to work to earn investment funds; b) without-labor treatment in which investment funds are given to investors as their endowments. We have classified each subject’s distribution proposal into three fairness ideals: selfish; libertarian; and radical egalitarian, and examined what factors are significant for subject’s distribution justice. Our findings are threefold. 1) First, few libertarian-marginalist, who believes one should ‘get according to their production by production measurements they own’ was observed. 2) Second, labor value theory seems to have more impact on fairness ideals of individuals: in with-labor treatment investors have to work for their investment funds, both of investors and workers tend to be unselfish, whereas in without-labor treatment investors do not need to work, both of investors and workers tend to be selfish. 3) Third, investors have significant tendencies to commit libertarian egalitarian, that enable them to hold their rest investment funds as their asset, whereas workers have significant tendencies to adhere radical-egalitarian, that enable them to redistribute investor’s assets. These tendencies may be understood from self-serving bias that both of workers and investors have. Although a difference between libertarian-egalitarian and radical-egalitarian distributions seems to be not so serious for finding a compromise, however, in the case investors’ capitals do not based on their labors, a discrepancy in distribution between workers and investors seems to be created. Our experimental results may partly explain recent declines in labor-wage accompanied with institutional changes: financialization tend to make investors to adhere more selfish distribution whereas weakened collective bargaining power by unions promote those tendencies.
D33|Social policy and economic crisis: how progressive are the transfers in Mexico?|In a context of both economic and social crisis, public policies and programs against poverty must be capable to cope it and be oriented to households with more vulnerable and disabled groups in population. Its efficiency is doubtfully for the Mexican case, as long as recent data shows an increase on children’s participation in the labor market. This research contributes with current information about the transfer’s effect of Oportunidades among other cash-benefits which targets directly on those families during the years of the recent economic crisis in 2008-2012. The analysis is implemented for Mexico in both rural and urban zones and it is found that a household with children does not present the best inci¬dence on transfers in comparison to their counterpart. Scholarships and Procampo are the benefits with the least effectiveness in the 2009 crisis; meanwhile, Food Support and Opor¬tunidades Program presents greater progressivity. Oportunidades have lost effectiveness in the 2009 crisis when reducing its progressivity.
D33|Recent Declines in Labor's Share in US Income: A Preliminary Neoclassical Account|As shown in the 1930s by Hicks and Robinson, the elasticity of substitution (s) is a key parameter that captures whether capital and labor are gross complements or substitutes. Establishing the magnitude of s is vital, not only for explaining changes in the distribution of income between factors but also for undertaking policy measures to influence it. Several papers have explained the recent decline in labor's share in income by claiming that σ is greater than 1 and that there has been capital deepening. This paper presents evidence that refutes these claims. It shows that despite a rise in measured capital-labor ratios, labor-augmenting technical change in the United States has been sufficiently rapid that effective capital-labor ratios have actually fallen in the sectors and industries that account for the largest portion of the declining labor share in income since 1980. In combination with estimates that corroborate the consensus in the literature that s is less than 1, these declines in the effective capital-labor ratio can account for much of the recent fall in labor's share in US income at both the aggregate and industry level. Paradoxically, these results also suggest that increased capital formation, ideally achieved through a progressive consumption tax, would raise labor's share in income.
D33|Cooperative organizations as an engine of equitable rural economic development| Cooperatives represent an alternative to large-scale corporate farms and plantations as well as to independent unaffiliated small private farms. This paper presents a comparative modeling narrative on cooperative organizational formsâ€™ potential impact on equitable rural development. This speaks to issues of both increasing the size of the economic pie and how this income is distributed. The case is made the cooperatives can potentially generate higher rates of growth and more equitable growth, even in competitive economic environments. An important type of cooperative that is focused upon is one based on the linking of smaller farms into a cooperative. Economies economics of scale and scope as well in transaction costs can be captured by the cooperatives. Given cooperative governance, one would also expect higher levels of x-efficiency. Overall, cooperatives can generate relative high incomes to cooperative members, whilst remaining competitive with the traditional privately owned large farms. Critical to the success of the cooperative, is a set rules and regulation that place them on a level playing field with the privately owned farm. In addition, the implementation and practice of cooperative principles is key to the success of the cooperative farm and rural cooperatives, more generally speaking.
D33|Finance-dominated capitalism and re-distribution of income: a Kaleckian perspective|In this article a major channel through which financialisation or finance-dominated capitalism affects macroeconomic performance is examined: the distribution channel. Empirical data for the following dimensions of (re-)distribution in the period of finance-dominated capitalism since the early 1980s is provided for 15 advanced capitalist economies: functional distribution, personal/household distribution and the share and the composition of top incomes. Based on the Kaleckian approach to the determination of income shares, the effects of financialisation on functional income distribution are studied in more detail. Some stylised facts of financialisation are integrated into the Kaleckian approach, and by means of reviewing empirical and econometric literature it is found that financialisation and neoliberalism have contributed to the falling labour income share since the early 1980s through three main Kaleckian channels: 1) a shift in the sectoral composition of the economy, 2) an increase in management salaries and rising profit claims of the rentiers and thus in overheads, and 3) weakened trade union bargaining power.
D33|Intensifying Accumulation of Wealth and a Deepening Gap, or the “Teething troubles” of Capitalism|Capital in the Twenty-First Century is an analysis that draws on the synergies arising from the integration of the collected historical data series and the applied economics methods and attempts to best understand the correlations among capital accumulation, economic growth, and increasing income and wealth inequalities, and the underlying drivers determining these. After a review and analysis of the relevant historical data series, Thomas Piketty concludes that what ultimately plays a key role in the growth of wealth inequalities is that in the long run the rate of return on capital is higher than economic growth, hence wealth accumulated in the past grows at a higher pace than the growth of the economy (or the proportional growth of labour incomes). The author suggests the possibility of progressive wealth taxes to be implemented at global level in order to resolve the problems described in the book. Piketty, however, admits that for the time being this is no more than a utopian idea which has little to do with reality. This article sets out to provide a critical overview of Thomas Piketty’s book, as well as some articles and analyses of interest that have been published in this respect, focusing on the study of the problematics of rising wealth inequalities.

D33|A middle-manager model of wage and salary distribution within firms|Management structure affects income distribution within the firm. We construct a model in which the managerial wage bill is determined by the number of direct reports to each manager (the “span of control”) and the increase in pay between levels in the managerial hierarchy. The model explains, in a natural way, one of the best-documented observations in firm compensation: that CEO pay increases with the size of the firm. It also shows that rising span of control will normally lead to a decline in the ratio of the managerial wage bill to that of production workers. As span of control has been rising in recent decades, this appears to be inconsistent with the widely-documented rise in income inequality. The discrepancy is explained by the rapid expansion of equity-based compensation.
D33|Piketty is wrong|Piketty argues that there are long-run fundamental laws in capitalism that will necessarily concentrate the income in favor of the privileged 1 or 10% of the population. Piketty's two fundamental laws are really theoretical propositions that presume relative rigidity in the rate of return of capital and in the net savings rate. We show that such propositions are incompatible with seventy-five years of studies estimating the value of the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor, and with the theoretical models of savings optimizing behavior. We argue that Piketty's laws are wrong and that they contradict the essence of market dynamics. Economic agents optimize and neither the rate of return of capital nor the net savings rate can remain relatively stable as Piketty supposes. Using empirical estimates of the long-run elasticity of substitution between capital and labor, and analyzing the relationship between the net savings rate and the real growth rate of the economy, we show that Piketty's forecast for the second half of the twenty-first century is inadequate. We propose alternative forecasts.
D33|Fort de sa vigueur, qu’en est-il de l’inclusivité de la croissance en RDC?<BR>[Given its strength, does economic growth inclusive in DRC?]|"Referring to an unhappy report, the aim of this paper consists to analyse the quality of the economic growth in DRC. To analyze this problem, two approaches were used like the approach of the pro-poor growth and the inclusive growth. It results from this analysis that the economic growth in DRC is the anti-poor growth and is of type ""impoverishing growth"": the growth has really a positive impact on the reduction of poverty but this effect is destroyed by the great inequalities between the various strata of society which, all things considered, increase poverty. Concerning the inclusive growth, the different curves of social opportunity and the inclusiveness matrix testify to the non-inclusivity of the growth in DRC. It is noted that the average income of the population increases but this income redistribution is very inequitable."
D33|New ways to slice the pie: Span of control and wage and salary distribution within firms|In recent decades, firms have been seen to “delayer” and shrink middle management. We show in this paper that changes in management structure affect income distribution within the firm. The managerial wage bill follows from an accounting relationship that depends on the manager’s span of control and step increases in managerial pay. Holding those factors fixed, CEO pay is found to increase with the size of the firm, thereby reproducing one of the best-documented observations of firm compensation. Also, the contribution of within-firm wage inequality as measured by the Theil index is found to be of the same order of magnitude as between-sector inequality. When the span of control rises, as it has in recent decades, wage and salary inequality declines. We argue that the well-documented rise in income inequality is a result of rapidly expanding equity-based compensation. Following traditions in economics that propose a social basis for income distribution, the paper argues that changing the span of control and step changes in pay between levels in the managerial hierarchy, as well as the profit share, are factors through which upper management, middle management and production workers can negotiate their slice of the pie.
D33|The Impact of the Dividend Tax in South Africa: A Dynamic CGE Model Analysis|This paper analyses the economy-wide impact of the dividend tax (DT) on the South African economy, which was increased from 10% to 15% by the government in 2012. The analysis was conducted using a dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of South Africa, which captured the observed structure of South Africaâ€™s economy. The parameters of the CGE equations were calibrated to observed data from a social accounting matrix (SAM) for 2010. One policy option was considered. Our simulation results show that the impact of increasing the DT will have a minute but positive impact on the reported macro-economic variables in the immediate year of implementing the DT rate increases. GDP increases by 0.0585% and 0.5085% in 2013 and 2018 will be seen respectively. This change was small in 2013 but will be significant in 2018. The key finding is that at the macro level, the implementation of the policy shock on its own had a positive macroeconomic impact.
