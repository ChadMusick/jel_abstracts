A22|A Crash Course on the Euro Crisis|The financial crises of the last twenty years brought new economic concepts into classrooms discussions. This article introduces undergraduate students and teachers to seven of these models: (i) misallocation of capital inflows, (ii) modern and shadow banks, (iii) strategic complementarities and amplification, (iv) debt contracts and the distinction between solvency and liquidity, (v) the diabolic loop, (vi) regional flights to safety, and (vii) unconventional monetary policy. We apply each of them to provide a full account of the euro crisis of 2010-12.
A22|Implementación de una evaluación por competencias académicas en el pregrado de Economía de la Universidad del Magdalena, Colombia|Resumen: El objetivo de este artículo es presentar los resultados de una evaluación piloto en el enfoque de competencias académicas en el pregrado de Economía de la Universidad del Magdalena, aplicada para los cursos de Macroeconomía I, Estadística II, Finanzas Públicas y Economía Regional en el segundo semestre de 2018. Se muestra que una evaluación de este tipo arroja una medida sobre lo que un estudiante puede hacer con lo que aprendió. Así mismo, la metodología que permite definir las competencias de cada curso se establece en coherencia con el perfil profesional del pregrado. Este artículo contribuye a la literatura sobre la renovación de los métodos de evaluación en la educación superior en Colombia. / Abstract : This paper presents the results of an experimental test on proficiency-based assessment in Economics at University of Magdalena (Colombia), in the second half of 2018. The evaluation was carried out for Macroeconomics I, Statistics II and Public Finance and Regional Economics courses. After defining the competencies foreseen for each course based on the undergraduate student’s profile, the paper shows that this type of tests allows determining what a student can do with what they have learned. This paper contributes to the literature regarding the renewal of evaluation methods in higher education in Colombia.
A22|Does Simple Information Provision Lead to More Diverse Classrooms? Evidence from a Field Experiment on Undergraduate Economics|This paper reports the results of a field experiment involving 2,710 students across nine US colleges, in which faculty provided incoming women and URM students with information about economics. We randomly assign students to one of three conditions: a control (no email messaging), a Welcome treatment (two emails encouraging students to consider enrolling in economics courses), and a Welcome+Info treatment (which added information showcasing the diversity of research and researchers within economics). The Welcome+Info treatment increases the likelihood of completing an economics course in the first semester of college by 3.0 percentage points, nearly 20 percent of the base rate.
A22|Enhancing the Resilience of Junior High School Students to Bullying|Objective - Junior high schools have realized the need for resilience to prevent and respond to bullying. Resilience can help students better respond to bullying. Enhancing this construct can support the efforts of schools to create a supportive and safe learning environment. Methodology/Technique - This research examines a regional sample of 404 Indonesian junior high school students located in Central Java between the ages of 13 and 15. The study explores the connection between experiences with bullying and resilience by examining whether resilient students seem to be significantly affected at school. Findings - The findings of the study indicate that resilience has the potential to prevent the instance of bullying. Students with high resilience were identified as being able to mitigate the effect of bullying in school.
A22|Self-Concept and Social Adjustment of First-Year Students|Objective - Students who study in higher education institutions should have a good socialization process since it later influences their happiness and sadness during their first year of university life. They may face some difficulties and problems that may inhibit their academic success if they cannot adjust well. One of the successful social adjustment criteria is self-concept, in which is derived from interactions with others, for example, the environment. For that reason, it is important to investigate the self-concept and social adjustment of Psychology students, at UIN Maulana Malik Ibrahim Malang, during the first semester. This paper therefore aims to a) determine the degree of student social adjustment, b) determine the quality of self-concept, and c) identify the relationship between self-concept and social adjustment among first year students of Psychology, UIN Maulana Malik Ibrahim Malang. Methodology/Technique - The subjects of this study include 134 first year students at the Faculty of Psychology, UIN Maulana Malik Ibrahim Malang, East Java. The data was collected in accordance with the scale of self-concept and social adjustment. Finding and Novelty - The results show that 1) the degree of first students' self-concept is in average scale, 69.4%, 2) the social adjustment of first year students belongs to a moderate category, 71,6%, and 3) self-concept has positive correlation to social adjustment (r = 0,703, p = 0,000). These findings confirm that the higher the self-concept the students poses, the better the social adjustment they perform. This study suggests the need for intervention to escalate self-concept and social adjustment of students by collaborating with some stakeholders, particularly students' parents, universities, government, societies, and religious figures.

A22|Fostering the cooperative learning of mathematics in engineering schools|"In this article, we report on the experience gained and the results obtained from an educational innovation project that has sought to introduce cooperative learning into the mathematics subjects of the first year of the Engineering degrees at the University of Malaga. In particular, we focus on the teamwork-based learning method that we have called the ""Teacher-Apprentice"" dynamics: Groups of 3-5 members are formed in which one of the members takes on the role of the Teacher, while the rest are the Apprentices. We introduce a system of incentives such that the group that progresses adequately in the subject has the right to group bonuses, which count towards the final grade awarded to each of the group members and which are different for the Teacher and for the Apprentices to allow for some level of competitiveness within the group. The selection of the Teacher is reviewed after each scheduled assessment test, where the student in the group who has obtained the highest score from among the group members will become the (possibly new) Teacher. The results collected to date reveal that group dynamics increase the motivation with which students face math learning, while helping them to correct conceptual errors through discussion with their peers."
A22|Individualized exercises for continuous assessment in engineering|This project focuses on the development of a web application that automatically grades the solution to engineering exercises. The input data of each exercise is different for each student in order to reduce plagiarism and increase motivation. Students can access the web app from any device with internet access (computer, laptop, phone, ?) at any time. The fact that the exercises are enunciated and evaluated in an individualized way eliminates the possibility for students to share the solutions and divert the profitable collaboration between students towards the learning of the resolution procedure itself. From the professor?s perspective, this tool allows an efficient and continuous evaluation of students. Besides, the storage of the data (number of attempts, time required, etc.) provides valuable information both for the self-assessment of the professor and for the analysis of the individualized learning process of each student. The web application is coded in Python, which easily allows the incorporation of additional features according to the needs of professors and students. The web application has already been tested during two academic years in two Spanish universities and for several engineering degrees. Ten professor and more than 2000 students have already benefit from this web application.
A22|Un héritage des Annales, la cliométrie à Strasbourg|C’est par sa volonté de combiner la rigueur des modèles théoriques et mathématiques avec la prise en compte, de la façon la plus exhaustive possible, de la complexité de toutes les données (qualitatives et quantitatives) que l’Ecole cliométrique strasbourgeoise reste fidèle à l’esprit des Annales et prolonge le mouvement initié en 1929 par Marc Bloch et Lucien Febvre.
A22|Money Growing on Trees: A Classroom Game about Payments for Ecosystem Services and Tropical Deforestation|Payments for ecosystem service programs use a market-based approach to pursue environmental goals. While they are common policy tools, key concepts that can determine their efficacy are nuanced and hard to grasp. We present a new interactive game that explores the functioning and implications of payments for ecosystem service programs. Participants play the role of rural households in a developing country. They decide individually or as groups whether to enter into contracts to receive payment from the United Nations REDD+ program to refrain from harvesting from a local forest. The game explores topics including: payments for ecosystem services programs; climate change; tropical deforestation; cost-effectiveness; additionality; contract fraud and enforcement; and community resource management. We provide customizable materials, a detailed reading list, and prompts for discussion.
A22|The power of economic textbooks: A discourse analysis|"By conducting a discourse analysis (SKAD) in the field of academic economics textbooks, this paper aims at reconstructing frames and identity options offered to undergraduate students relating to the questions ""Why study economics?""and ""Who do I become by studying economics?"". The analysis showed three major frames and respective identity offerings, all of which are contextualized theoretically, with prominent reference to the Foucauldian reflection of the science of Political Economy. Surprisingly, none of them encourages the student to think critically, as could have been expected in a pedagogical context. Taken together, economics textbooks appear as a ""total structure of actions brought to bear upon possible action"" (Foucault), therefore, as a genuine example of Foucauldian power structures."
A22|Interactive macroeconomics: A pluralist simulator|The aim of our contribution is to present an innovative instrument to teach macroeconomics at the undergraduate and master level. We develop a digital learning platform to present and explore some controversies at the very foundations of macroeconomic theory. For this purpose, we explicitly present two competing paradigms, the new-Keynesian and the post-Keynesian one. Several interactive scenarios are made available where the user can take control over different economic policy instruments and is guided through a set of problems that require appropriate actions in the context of the different approaches.
A22|A Classroom Experiment on the Specific Factors Model|This paper proposes a classroom-experiment approach to interrogate the specific factors model. Its design differs from earlier work in that students can observe both the factor prices in two different sectors, and the society’s welfare. Students participate as factor owners and can produce both of two kinds of goods by allocating their resources to maximise their teams’ welfare. Their resource endowment, relative prices, and trade rules vary round by round. Based on the outcomes, students discuss the impacts of relatively abundant resources, relative prices and trade rules on team welfare, individual income and the gains from trade. This classroom experiment could foster better learner understanding of the specific factors model, both individually and collectively.
A22|Reforming Undergraduate Economics Education in India: A Case for Inter-disciplinarity|Since India is a nation of unique diversity, with its economy and society driven by many agencies, institutions and beliefs, the application of economics as well as other social sciences is required to address the various socio-economic problems in India. This approach of inter-disciplinarity has to be followed in the graduate curriculum of economics which has been severely criticised by the academic community as neither job-oriented nor able to understand the full extent of the nature and problems within the Indian economy. This article tries to initiate discussion in kerala context on various grounds such as pedagogical changes, evaluation of course and curriculum, resource constrains and issues of politics and bureaucracy are all inevitable part of the reformation of graduate curriculum of economics.
A22|Statistical Literacy and Attitudes Towards Statistics of Romanian Undergraduate Students|Statistical literacy is the capacity to challenge statistics encountered in everyday life (Gal, 2002) and has become a key competence for the entire work-force in today’s data-driven society. However, teaching statistics to non-economists has some particularities determined by their anxiety towards the subject. In order to have a better approach in teaching Statistics to this type of audience, the paper provides an analysis regarding students’ initial level of statistical literacy, the attitudes and beliefs towards Statistics, in the case of undergraduate students of the “Applied Modern Language” program under Bucharest University of Economic Studies. Using the models developed by Gal (2002) and Watson (2003), the results prove that basic statistical literacy skills like graph analysis or table reading are sound, while mathematical level is well below average, correlated with a high anxiety regrading mathematics and preconceptions about complexity of statistics.
A22|Challenges To Higher Education In Canada And Australia|This paper provides an overview of the higher education sector in Canada, so it can serve as a comparison to that in Australia. It seeks to identify stresses and challenges to this sector in Canada. The study also seeks to offer possible lessons for the direction of higher education policy in Australia and to raise concerns for the direction in Canada. The focus of the study is on the period since 2000 when consistent data for Canada largely became available. In 2005, the Rae Report Â– the last major overall review of higher education in Canada Â– was published followed by three volumes of evaluative studies of the state of higher education in Canada (Beach, Boadway and McInnis, 2005; Beach, 2005; and Iacobucci and Tuohy, 2005). So earlier and detailed commentaries are readily available from these sources. The present paper includes discussion of both universities as well as colleges that jointly make up the higher education sector in Canada. The perspective of the discussion is largely economic and heavily based on comparative statistics and the incentives they reveal. The paper proceeds as follows. The next section points out the major distinguishing features of the Canadian higher education system. Section 3 identifies a number of challenges and stresses the higher education sector has been facing in Canada. Then Section 4 examines some background influences on the higher education sector in both Australia and Canada. Section 5 then raises concerns about the growing role of metrics in higher education and the incentive issues they raise. And Section 6 concludes with some lessons to be considered in both countriesÂ’ tertiary education sectors.

A22|Is Cash Dead? Using Economic Concepts To Motivate Learning and Economic Thinking|Economics is at its best when used to shed light on questions of interest to students. Even better if the answers are at odds with commonly held but incorrect views. The velocity of circulation is probably the most neglected concept in macroeconomics classes but it can be used to open up a discussion on the behaviour of people and why demand for money may rise or fall. It can be used to address the question “Is Cash Dead?” Despite the rise in the number of ways that people can pay without using cash, there seems to be no drop in the amount of cash people actually wish to hold. This is a puzzle and a good opportunity to get students thinking about why this might be.
A22|Doping to Underperform: The Impact of Coffee Consumption on Test Scores|We report results of an experiment that randomly distributed coffee and an herbal infusion with no caffeine to students before a non-experimental midterm (ie: with real incentives). Coffee consumption decreases test scores. This is driven by students who are not habituated to consume coffee and who self-report feeling nervous in similar tests. Regular coffee drinkers do not seem to benefit or lose from coffee consumption except if they are coffee-deprived the day of the exam (in which case they perform worse, consistent with the withdrawal reversal hypothesis).
A22|Dynamic Macroeconomics: A Didactic Numeric Model|Teaching Dynamic Macroeconomics at undergraduate courses relies exclusively on intuitive prose and graphics depicting behaviours and steady states of the main markets of the economy. But when the case of forward-looking agents and the macroeconomic implications of their actions are discussed, intuitions and graphical representations offered to students may lead to unsupported conclusions. This happens even if the teacher and students use the chapter upon a dynamic macroeconomic model of one of the most didactic and ordered texts ever published: Williamson (2014). In this paper we try to sustain this assertion.
A22|El valor agregado de las universidades públicas en el rendimiento académico: una relación no homogénea|En el presente trabajo se evalúa el valor agregado de la universidad pública respecto al de las universidades privadas en razonamiento cuantitativo y lectura crítica. Para ello, se utiliza la metodología de Propensity Score Matching, la cual permite evaluar el impacto que tiene en los estudiantes estudiar en una universidad pública respecto a una privada. Dadas las diferencias en las universidades colombianas, se efectúa el ejercicio de diferencias en diferencias con distintas clasificaciones de universidades y diversos programas académicos. Los resultados obtenidos muestran que el valor agregado por las universidades públicas es heterogéneo y está en función del enfoque de la universidad. Puntualmente, las universidades públicas con enfoque doctoral generan un mayor valor agregado con respecto a las privadas, sin embargo, en otras categorías el valor agregado por las universidades públicas no es significativo.

A22|The Attractiveness of Schools of Management: The Case of Indonesia|Objective - In recent times, schools of management in Indonesia have experienced rapid rates of growth all over the country in both big cities and small towns. The increase in interest to join schools of management is reflected by the number of schools of management at the undergraduate, master and doctoral levels that exist in almost all universities, particularly at the undergraduate and master levels. This research aims to determine the factors that influence the decision of an undergraduate, master or doctoral student to enroll in a school of management. Methodology/Technique - This study uses factor analysis and in-depth interview. The data is collecting using an online questionnaire distributed through WhatsApp groups and emails to undergraduate, masters and doctoral students throughout Indonesia. 366 questionnaires were distributed in total. Findings - The result of research show that the factors affecting students' decisions to enroll at schools of management are the process, product, and motivation. While the high interest in entering master and doctoral in management with the non-management background is caused by several factors, primarily, due to its relevance to their work, career development, accreditation, and other factors. Novelty - Those students that already occupy key positions in both private and government sectors consider managerial skills are more dominant in schools of management.
A22|Gender differences under test pressure and their impact on academic performance: a quasi-experimental design|Student performance at university is a strong determinant of individual decisions and future outcomes, most notably labour opportunities. Although published studies have found gender differences in student performance in response to pressure, little is known about such differences when university students are exposed to test pressure. Based on field data, this study aims to examine gender differences in student academic performance in response to different levels of pressure when sitting multiple choice tests, a frequently employed exam format at university. To do so, the introduction of continuous assessment in the evaluation system of a university course allows us to exploit a unique quasi-experimental set up in which the same students take similar tests throughout the course but under different levels of pressure. Exploiting two data structures—namely, pooled cross-sections and panel data—we find that male students outperform their female counterparts when under high pressure. However, in low test pressure scenarios the gender gap is narrowed and even reversed in favour of female students. Finally, we analyse the mechanisms responsible for the gender gap by studying how each gender responds to test pressure, and by studying gender differences when omitting test items on multiple choice formats.
A22|"Confidence Intervals for Ratios: Econometric Examples with Stata ""Abstract: Ratios of parameter estimates are often used in econometric applications. However, the test of these ratios when estimated can cause difficulties since the ratio of asymptotically normally distributed random variables have a Cauchy distribution for which there are no finite moments. This paper presents a method for the estimation of confidence intervals based on the Fieller approach that has been shown to be preferable to the usual Delta method. Using example applications, we demonstrate that a few extra steps in the examination of the estimate of the ratio may provide a confidence interval with superior coverage."""|No abstract is available for this item.
A22|What Can UWE Do for Economics?|Men outnumber women as undergraduate economics majors by three to one nationwide. Even at the best research universities and liberal arts colleges men outnumber women by two to one or more. The Undergraduate Women in Economics Challenge began in 2015 as an RCT with 20 treatment schools and at least 30 control schools to evaluate whether better course information, mentoring, encouragement, career counseling, and more relevant instructional content could move the needle. Although the RCT is still in the field, results from several within treatment-school randomized trials demonstrate that uncomplicated and inexpensive interventions can substantially increase women in economics.
A22|Examining the use of group projects in agribusiness courses to enrich overall student learning| A clear majority of agribusiness programs require their graduates to successfully complete relevant coursework in both quantitative and theoretical areas. Instructors often make use of group projects to promote student participation, inculcate team working skills, and to enhance students’ soft skills for service related jobs in the agricultural industry. In these projects, student groups work on project milestones followed by instructor feedback for improvement. Project completion is marked by student teams’ engagement in interactive group activities such as presentations, debates, and sales pitches. The objective of this study is to evaluate the use of group projects for enhancing student learning in various agribusiness courses using an online survey tool. It is observed that students’ performance and the overall learning experience is enhanced using group work in agribusiness courses. Results indicate that students find value in these interactive projects, which facilitates a higher level of learning. Students also feel confident about their soft skills, and can better enunciate and express their viewpoints among an audience.
A22|Teaching microeconomic principles with smartphones – lessons from classroom experiments with classEx|Classroom experiments as a teaching tool increase understanding and especially motivation. Traditionally, experiments have been run using pen-and-paper or in a computer lab. Pen-and-paper is time and resource consuming. Experiments in the lab require appropriate installations and impede the direct interaction among students. During the last two years, we have created fully elaborated packages to run a complete course in microeconomics principles using face-to-face experiments with mobile devices. The experiments are based on Bergstrom-Miller (2000), and we used classEx, a free online tool, to run them in the classroom.The packages were used at Universitat Pompeu Fabra with over 500 undergraduate students in the fall 2016. This paper presents our experience on classEx and the Bergstrom-Miller approach working in combination, and the lessons learned.
A22|Notas de historia de pensamiento económico para no economistas|La historia del pensamiento económico es moneda corriente en los programas de economía. Este documento tiene como objetivo hacer una presentación muy breve, y resumida, de los principales aportes teóricos de la economía, a partir del último cuarto del siglo XIX, con el fin último de motivar al alumno o al lector occasional, en la iniciación del estudio de temas del Pensamiento económico.
A22|La Macroeconomi?a dina?mica: un modelo nume?rico dida?ctico|Es usual que la ensen?anza de la Macroeconomi?a dina?mica en los cursos universitarios de pregrado se apoye exclusivamente en exposiciones en prosa supuestamente intuitivas y en gra?ficos que representan comportamientos de estados estables de los principales mercados de la economi?a. Pero cuando se discuten los casos de agentes que “miran hacia adelante”, las intuiciones a priori y sus representaciones gra?ficas ofrecidas a los estudiantes pueden generar conclusiones confusas o carentes de respaldo lo?gico. Esto sucede incluso si el profesor y sus estudiantes recurren al capi?tulo de Macroeconomi?a dina?mica de uno de los textos ma?s dida?cticos y ordenados: el de Williamson (2014). En este documento intento demostrar esto.
A22|La influencia del manual en el pensamiento económico colombiano durante el siglo XX|El uso de los manuales en economía ha sido masivo en su profesionalización y ha repercutido en las ideas económicas colombianas. Durante el siglo XX se presentaron cuatro etapas; la primera de ellas se dio a inicios del siglo, cuando predominó el autodidactismo en los manuales franceses, entre profesores, políticos y hombres de empresa de Bogotá y Medellín. La segunda etapa se caracterizó por el contacto de algunos protoeconomistas con el pensamiento económico original en el exterior, lo que ocasionó el inicio de la crítica a la utilización de manuales. La tercera surgió con las primeras facultades de Economía, en los años 40, época en que se reemplazó el manual francés por el anglosajón neoclásico; y la última etapa se inicia desde 1980, cuando se hace una crítica coherente al manual y comienza la producción de textos “criollos”, que ofrecen facilidades pedagógicas con pensamiento teórico de vanguardia.
A22|Survivor: Three Principles of Economics Lessons as Taught by a Reality Television Show|The reality television show Survivor has been a ratings success on CBS for over 16 years. In the show, 16 strangers are marooned in a remote location, required to compete in physical and mental challenges, and periodically vote to eliminate players from the game. The last person remaining wins one million dollars. I use this popular television show to demonstrate three important lessons from principles of microeconomics: (a) for individual decision-making, concepts like pride and honor may belong in the utility function, alongside more classical components such as consumption of goods and services, (b) thinking through how others will respond to your action is critical for good economic and strategic thinking, and (c) repeated interaction can help collusive behavior hold.
A22|The impact of grade ceilings on student grades and course evaluations: Evidence from a policy change|This paper analyzes the effects of a grade ceiling policy on grade distributions and course evaluations. Results show that the effects vary based upon the level of the grade ceiling. A ceiling set at 2.8 decreased overall grade point average (GPA) by reducing the number of As and Bs and increasing the number of lower grades given. This low ceiling also increased the number of withdrawals and significantly lowered course evaluations. A ceiling set at 3.2 decreased overall GPA by reducing the number of As and increasing the number of Bs given, but the effects on course evaluations were smaller in magnitude and insignificant.
A22|An introductory microeconomics in-class experiment to reinforce the marginal utility/price maximization rule and the integration of modern theory|This paper presents an in-class experiment used as a teaching tool in an introductory microeconomics class at the undergraduate college level. It is directed at a critical but challenging concept for principles students—constrained utility maximization and a methodology to intuit preferences. The experimental project is nested in the literature pertaining to the current transition in microeconomic theory motivated by contributions from behavioral economics and transactions-cost economics, among other elements; modern pedagogical models; experimental economics; and experiments as in-classroom teaching tools. While not dispositive as to the general efficacy of in-class experiments, the paper provides an example of an alternative instructional approach which is helpful to principles students under strictly defined protocols. The benefits to students include heightened understanding of the core subject topic, greater interest in the subject matter, a closer connection to real-world economics, and enhanced critical thinking capabilities.
A22|Learning by doing: Do economics students self-evaluation skills improve?|This paper attempts to (1) measure the students’ ability to accurately self-evaluate the quality of their own work, (2) see if this level of accuracy changes when students evaluate a second year essay, having evaluated a similar piece of work in the first year, (3) Investigate whether there is any significant variation in any of the observed changes and (4) identify any factors that might explain any of the observed variation. The data is generated from one cohort of students who were studying for an economics degree at a UK university. The self-evaluation exercise was introduced on two out-of-class essay assessments – one in the first year and one in the second year. Statistical analysis revealed that, on average, the students were significantly more accurate at self-evaluating the quality of their work in the second year than they had been in the first year. However there was considerable variation in this improvement. Those students who demonstrated the greatest improvement were firstly those who were awarded higher marks by the tutor for their second year essay and secondly, those who had been the least accurate at judging the quality of their first year essay. Other student characteristics such as different measures of student ability and gender had no significant impact on the changes in accuracy. However, there is no clear picture about what exactly is driving the improvement.
A22|Undergraduate Econometrics Instruction: Through Our Classes, Darkly|"The past half-century has seen economic research become increasingly empirical, while the nature of empirical economic research has also changed. In the 1960s and 1970s, an empirical economist's typical mission was to ""explain"" economic variables like wages or GDP growth. Applied econometrics has since evolved to prioritize the estimation of specific causal effects and empirical policy analysis over general models of outcome determination. Yet econometric instruction remains mostly abstract, focusing on the search for ""true models"" and technical concerns associated with classical regression assumptions. Questions of research design and causality still take a back seat in the classroom, in spite of having risen to the top of the modern empirical agenda. This essay traces the divergent development of econometric teaching and empirical practice, arguing for a pedagogical paradigm shift."
A22|Testing the Effectiveness of Online Assignments in Theory of Finance|We investigate the effectiveness of online versus paper assignments using final examination scores in three cohorts of Theory of Finance. In particular, two cohorts were exposed to online assignments while another cohort was exposed to traditional assignments. Our central result is that exposure to online assignments robustly leads to higher final exam scores, all else being equal. We also find a lower level of engagement as shown by low assignment completion rates for students exposed to online assignments.
A22|Mentoring To Mentor: Evidence From Facultad De Contaduria Publica, Mentoring Para Mentor Par, Facultad De Contaduria Publica|This paper evaluates the Mentoring Program for students of the three offered modalities (full school attendance, part time school and on line school) in the Accounting Faculty of the Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla (BUAP). We examine three educational programs: Bachelor in Public Accounting, Finances Direction focus on International Finances and Bachelor in Administration and Direction on Middle and Small Businesses. The research reports attrition rates in Professional Careers immersed in a public university. At the university students compromised their time on labor activities, familiar and economics with methodological study limitations and self-management of their time. These modalities are based on different student characteristics. We further report on the Institutional Mentoring program which was implemented for new students from 2014-2015. We expect a decrease in the attrition rate due to this program. Some seventy-five mentor peers, 826 mentees, a coordinator, and administrator, two certificated mentors and twelve trained mentors participated in the study
A22|Study Habits And Graduates. Evidence From An Institution Of Higher Education, Egresados De Licenciatura Y Habitos De Estudio: Evidencia De Una Institucion De Educacion Superior|"problems of backlog and poor performance are multifactorial; This paper agrees with those who say that in higher education, inadequate study habits are a leading cause of school failure. Therefore, diagnosing study habits should be an important component of the educational agenda of decision-makers. This research identifies study habits of professional graduates in six disciplines observed in the Unit for Higher Education Management and Accounting Sciences. This Unit is made up of three faculties and three schools belonging to the Autonomous University of Chiapas. We consider 39 reactions with dichotomous responses. We measure eight variables, and three cohorts of six degree programs, totaling 1,970 graduates. The results show that only 7% of graduates report acceptable levels in four or more variables. The variables ""application of study techniques"" being the best weighted, followed by ""physiological state"" while ""attitude towards study"" and ""time distribution"" are poorly evaluated. This finding stresses the need to incorporate these indicators in the curriculum development processes, so that the areas of opportunity are identified"
A22|Diagnosis Training From The Perspective Of The Tutor In A Public University, Diagnostico De Capacitacion Desde La Perspectiva Del Tutor En Una Universidad Publica|In Mexican universities, the mentoring program is a tool that has worked with vague results. Although there are many success stories, there are still reforms and adjustments to be made. One of these is to review the training that teachers, who carry out this work, are provided. These teachers sometimes rely on outdated skills. In this research we consider an instrument to meet the training needs that require teachers to better perform. The method was quantitative and the sample was selected at random. We focused on knowing if teachers received training and had knowledge about university services to guide their students and the topics on which they would like to receive instruction
A22|Areas Of Opportunity Based On Graduate Satisfaction. Case Of Administrative Sciences And Accountancy, Areas De Oportunidad A Partir De Satisfaccion De Egresados: Caso Ciencias Administrativas Y Contables|The evaluation of educational quality is multidimensional. Student satisfaction with services received is a (non-exclusive) indicator to detect areas of opportunity and to plan actions for improvement in educational organizations. In this paper, the results of research related to levels of satisfaction are expressed by graduates of six degree programs across three faculties and three schools that make up the Unit for Higher Education Management and Accounting Sciences at the Autonomous University of Chiapas. An Likert scale instrument was used consisting of 88 positive assessments. We analyze ten sub dimensions to quantify student satisfaction with educational services received. The examination was applied to a group composed of 1,969 graduates of three cohorts. Results show that in general there are high levels of satisfaction when graduates complete their studies. However, there are important areas of opportunity for continuous improvement processes. These improvement areas are in terms of the subdomains related to fulfilling basic needs; supporting services; vital security; socio-economic security and work systems
A22|Do Higher Achievers Cheat Less? An Experiment of Self-Revealing Individual Cheating|The extensive body of survey-based research correlating between students' cheating and their academic grade point average (GPA) consistently finds a significant negative relationship between cheating and the GPA. The present paper reports the results of a two-round experiment designed to expose student cheating at the individual level and correlate it with three intellectual achievement measures: the GPA, the high-school matriculation average grade (MAG) and the psychometric exam score (PES). The experiment involved two classes of third-year economics students incentivized by a competitive reward to answer a multiple-choice trivia quiz without consulting their electronic devices. While this forbiddance was deliberately overlooked in the first round, providing an opportunity to cheat, it was strictly enforced in the second, conducted two months later in the same classes with the same quiz. A comparison of subjects' performance in the two rounds, self-revealed a considerable extent of cheating in the first one. Regressing the individual cheating levels on subjects' gender and their intellectual achievement measures exhibited no significant differences in cheating between males and females. However, cheating of both genders was found to significantly increase with each achievement measure, implying, in sharp contrast with the direct-question surveys, that higher achievers are bigger cheaters.
A22|Institutional statements and individual perceptions of sustainability in Mexican business schools|The objective of this paper is to analyze how business schools of Mexican universities deal with the concept of sustainability as part of their educational task. In order to achieve a comprehensive vision, this study considers the environmental, the social, and the economic components of sustainability. After discussing the conceptual dimensions of education for sustainability, the empirical part of the paper consists of two sections: a content analysis of how official university documents handle the concept of sustainability and a survey of professors’ and students’ perceptions of sustainability. The analysis shows that both professors and students in the Management and Accounting disciplines need to extend their understanding about the economic and environmental aspects of sustainability. The results of this study provide information that can guide the efforts made by institutions of higher learning for training their professors and offering a comprehensive education for their students in all three components of sustainability.
A22|Improvement of the Instruments for Studentsï¿½ Performance and Assessment in the Field of International Finance and International Politics|Students' assessment represents an integral part of the education process. It can be defined as processes and practices, applied by the academic staff with the purpose of obtainï¿½ing the most objective assessment of the stuï¿½dentsï¿½ achievements. The methods of teaching, the forms of studentsï¿½ performance and the inï¿½struments for assessment are highly diverse but there are certain practices that can make the assessment and the education process more effective. The article presents in a synthesized manner the results of a team research, which aims to explore the good practices in the field that are applied in leading European and American universities. It also includes proposals for improvement of the instruments for assessment of the students mainly in the field of international finance and international politics.
A22|Background and Factors of Origin of Economic Knowledge in Western Ukraine in the second half of XIX – first half of XX centuries|"The scientific article is devoted to research of features of economic knowledge in Western Ukraine during the second half of the XIX – first half of the XX century, also summarizes the essence of economic knowledge and the high importance which affects the activity level of investment, entrepreneurial activity, employment, governance, and efficiency etc. The article noted that economic knowledge affects the possibility of personal fulfilment as the economically active member of society. Particular attention is given to determine the characteristics and transformation processes in the second half of the XIX – early XX century in Western Ukraine in the formation, development, and dissemination of economic knowledge among the population. Particular attention is paid to the identification of economic knowledge of business culture, which in turn includes to its structure the need to consider the public interest. Significant values of the revitalization process of the cooperative movement in the territories, forced by the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, including in western Ukraine. The analysis of the institutional framework of economic knowledge in the population allowed to mark a key role in these processes of self-organization of institutions, including the society ""Prosvita"" and others. Attention is paid to the peculiarities of the functioning of societies and the basic aspects of their activities. It is stated that the main purpose of the society were educational and economic spheres. The paper describes the key achievements of societies in terms of establishment and the commencement of the different organizations as associations and in order to do businesses, cooperatives, educational institutions, professional courses, publishing, the organization of specialized events and more. The results of other institutions, with the specification of their main activities for the development and dissemination of economic knowledge among the population of Western Ukraine, were studied. To form the contemporary economic knowledge to the population some economists, thinkers and their achievements on the benefits of cooperative forms of economic activity were mentioned. Features of economic knowledge in Western Ukraine in the second half of the XIX – early XX century with a focus on national values, self-organization, dissemination of professional schooling which stimulated the development of economic knowledge in Ukraine were proved."
A22|A Segmented Markets Model to Teach Analysis of Monetary Policy Shocks in Developing Economies|The standard undergraduate textbook models in macroeconomics like the IS-LM/AD-AS model are not disaggregated enough to understand the effects of monetary policy shocks in developing economies typically characterized by substantial informality, and goods and financial markets segmentation. In this paper, I present a version of a segmented markets model based on Williamson (2009, 2011) that could be used as an effective alternative. I demonstrate the use of the framework by analyzing the effects of demonetization- a substantial reduction in the availability of outside money- in a developing country setting.
A22|Yes we can! Teaching DSGE models to undergraduate students|Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models have become the workhorse of modern macroeconomics and the standard way to communicate ideas among applied macroeconomists. Undergraduate students, however, often remain unaware of their existence. The lack of specialized knowledge can hurt them if they decide to attend graduate school. Indeed, many first-year PhD students discover that the material they are currently learning differs significantly from what they mastered in college. But this can change. In this essay, I describe how to teach a full-fledged macroeconomics course where DSGE models take center stage. I discuss how to arrange such a course within a one-semester time frame, detail the main components of instruction, and finish with some thoughts based on my teaching experience at Macalester College.
A22|La economía como argumento político: evidencia de estudiantes de economía en Chile|En este documento reportamos los resultados de una encuesta a estudiantes de pregrado y posgrado de economía de cinco universidades de Chile, en materia de pensamiento económico. A través de un modelo econométrico de variable dependiente discreta ordenada, encontramos que la única variable que explica consistentemente las diferencias en pensamiento y opinión económica entre estudiantes es la preferencia política, incluso tras controlar por características personales y universidad de origen. La preferencia política influye en cuestiones normativas y positivas, apoyando la visión de que la economía es, en cierto grado, un argumento político. Finalmente, dado que estos resultados sugieren que en sus opiniones sobre política económica, los estudiantes de economía están expresando indirectamente sus preferencias políticas y normativas, sería recomendable incluir en la formación de los estudiantes tópicos que contribuyan a un buen razonamiento político. In this paper we report the results of a survey of undergraduate and graduate students of economics from five universities of Chile, on issues of economic thought. Through an econometric model of discrete and ordered dependent variable, we find that the only variable that consistently explains the differences of thought and opinion on economic issues among students is the political preference, even controlling for personal characteristics and university of origin. Political preference influences both normative and positive questions, supporting the view that economics is to some extent a political argument. Finally, these results suggest that, as in economic policy opinions, students of economics are indirectly expressing political and normative preferences, would be advisable to include topics in the training of students of economics that also contribute to a good political reasoning.
A22|Economic Education Retrospective|The American Economist has a long and significant history of publishing research in the field of economic education. This article provides a review and synthesis of the 70 economic education articles published by the journal between spring 1990 and spring 2015. The authors discuss The American Economist â€™s contribution to the field of economic education according to four primary themes: program design, instructional and assessment methodology, instructional materials, and student outcomes.
A22|Undergraduate Mathematics Courses Required and Recommended for Admission to Economics PhD Programs in the United States|This note presents a list of mathematics courses, normally taken at the undergraduate level, which are required or recommended as part of the admissions criteria for all economics PhD programs in the United States. The data in this note were gathered through a survey of PhD program directors, retrieval of data from PhD program websites, and personal conversations with PhD program directors in the United States. All of the data were collected during the spring and summer of 2016.
A22|Bringing Institutions into Economics when Teaching Economics as a Minor Subject|Developments in economic policy since the 1980s have shown a general trend towards a single type of institutional arrangement, following short-term, immediately applicable efficiency criteria. This was supported through the teaching by putting particular weight on the corresponding analytical instruments. The thesis presented here observes a systematic bias in this. It does so by evaluating institutional trends in the various sectors of the economy, and by discussing institutional arrangements of selected areas in detail. Furthermore, it reviews contributions by representatives of New Institutional Economics for a more comprehensive approach. Based on this, institutions themselves are conceptualised as public or club goods. As such they are applied to the policy areas selected. It can thereby be shown that microeconomic theory can find an appropriate place in this extended economic approach, along with concepts like common-pool resource management. In conclusion, this thesis proposes giving considerably more space to institutions in economics curricula, to their evolution and implications for economic outcomes. Particularly for economics as a minor subject, more emphasis should be placed on institutional arrangements.
A22|Increasing Student Improvement: Giving autonomy to students of International College at Rajamangala University of Technology Krungthep in Thailand the complete Peer Teaching Method to their peers in c|This research assessed the students? improvement of their learning outcomes toward business subjects, specifically in the class of Production & Operation Management, after having peer teaching method by group with complete autonomy. The before and After period of study was implemented in order to compare the expected improvement between the selected groups of students who are assigned to participate in complete peer teaching activity as a group in front of class. To challenge all levels of students in this project, six to seven students are randomly selected into groups in their 3rd year with different rank of GPAs from highest to lowest at International College of Rajamangala University of Technology Krungthep (ICUTK) in Thailand. They are assigned to read the chapter and prepared the presentation to educate their classes in each chapters by using the peer teaching method. Questionnaires were given to 46 students in order to collect useful data. The results indicated the positiveness toward the introduction and implementation of the peer teaching method and showed many improvements in different areas within the semester.
A22|Gender differences in the choice of major: The importance of female role models|Women have been traditionally underrepresented in several fields of study, notably those with the highest returns. While in the last two decades many disciplines, including mathematics and physical sciences, have made significant progress in attracting and retaining women, there has been little improvement in the field of economics, which remains heavily male-dominated. We report results from a field experiment aimed at increasing the percentage of women majoring in economics through exposure to carefully chosen female role models. We randomly selected a subset of Principles of Economics classes to be assigned to our role model treatment. Since the same classes were also offered and taught by the same instructors the previous year, we are able to employ a difference-in-differences estimation strategy to test whether the role model intervention increased the percentage of women planning to major in economics (survey-based) and enrolling in intermediate economics classes (administrative data) the semester and year following the intervention. Our results suggest that, while the role model intervention had no impact on male students, it significantly increased female students' likelihood of expressing interest in the economics major and enrolling in further economics classes.
A22|Teaching microeconomic principles with smartphones – lessons from classroom experiments with classEx|Classroom experiments as a teaching tool increase understanding and especially motivation. Traditionally, experiments have been run using pen-and-paper or in a computer lab. Pen-and-paper is time and resource consuming. Experiments in the lab require appropriate installations and impede the direct interaction among students. During the last two years, we have created fully elaborated packages to run a complete course in microeconomics principles using face-to-face experiments with mobile devices. The experiments are based on Bergstrom-Miller (2000), and we used classEx, a free online tool, to run them in the classroom.The packages were used at Universitat Pompeu Fabra with over 500 undergraduate students in the fall 2016. This paper presents our experience on classEx and the Bergstrom-Miller approach working in combination, and the lessons learned.

A22|Economía pluralista para enfrentar la crisis contemporánea|A pesar del profundo impacto de la Gran Recesión del 2008, en los Departamentos de Economía del mundo, se sigue enseñando el paradigma neoclásico como si nada hubiese ocurrido. La enseñanza de la economía, especialmente en los programas de pregrado, no deja espacio para una formación plural, aunque algo similar ocurre en los postgrados. La dominancia global de los enfoques orientados hacia el mercado, basados en una ontología individualista, un deductivismo metodológico y el uso masivo de modelos matemáticos de las tres ultimas décadas, ha ido cerrando las posibilidades de nuevos enfoques. En este ensayo, se exploran las posibles causas del fenómeno, y se presentan propuestas sobre cómo debería enseñarse una Microeconomía más integral, más pluralista, una Macro más aterrizada en los problemas contemporáneos y una teoría del Desarrollo que no renuncie a la riqueza de nuestro pasado latinoamericano, bajo el criterio de dotar a nuestros profesionales de una visión mas polifacética del pensamiento económico y la teoría económica, con miras a abrir nuevas miradas a enfoques creativos en las políticas publicas que puedan resolver nuestros problemas de fondo. Se ofrecen sugerencias concretas en materia de enfoques de currículos y de textos, así como de mecanismos para superar el terrible lecho de Procusto que implica la enseñanza única de la corriente principal. Al final, tendríamos profesionales más creativos y conscientes de la variedad de posibilidades que ofrece un enfoque más pluralista de la ciencia económica y se abrirían avenidas de ideas creativas para la implementación de políticas. Lo anterior implica mayor audacia en términos curriculares y menos timidez hacia la crítica de las teorías de la catedral dominante.
A22|Неформальные Институты Трансакционного Сектора Региона: Агроэкономический Аспект<BR>[Informal institutions transaction sector of the region: the agro-economic aspect]|"Abstract.Examines the mechanism of management of transaction expenses in the context of the management of cultural codes of the economy, formation of a stable vector of their development. Based on the analysis of the empirical material revealed trends regarding the ratios in the dynamics of the share of transaction sector and the qualitative development of the regional economy, the dynamics of the share of internal transaction costs, changes in the level of uncertainty in the external environment. The monograph is addressed to employees of regional administrations, experts in market research, researchers, teachers and students of agricultural universities. Аннотация. В монографии исследуются неформальные институты трансакционного сектора региона. Проведен анализ основных форм взаимодействия формальных и не¬формальных институтов, особенностей их функционирования, влияния институтов на поведенческие установки. Рассмотрены неформальные институты с позиции социокультурных характеристик, определены параметры культурных кодов экономики с учетом специфики сельскохозяйственной отрасли, выявлены предпосылки, формирующие основной массив трансакционных издержек. Рассматривается механизм управления трансакционными издержками в контексте регулирования культурных кодов экономики, формирования устойчивого вектора их развития. На основе анализа эмпирического материала выявлены тренды, касающиеся соотношений в динамике доли трансакционного сектора и качественного развития экономики региона, динамике доли внутренних трансакционных издержек, изменения уровня неопределенности внешней среды. Монография адресована работникам региональных органов управления, специалистам по изучению рынка, научным работникам, преподавателям и студентам аграрных вузов. Резюме Направления регулирования трансакционного сектора экономики состоят в следующем: •преодоление «проблемы колеи» в развитии (path- dependence problem); •преодоление дисбаланса развития трансакционного и трансформационного секторов экономики; •противодействие неформальной экономике; •развитие культурных характеристик, способствующих снятию институциональных ограничений. Повышение качества информации, противодействие нерегистрируемой статистике, лоббированию интересов отдельных групп, преодоление порядка ограниченного доступа обеспечат снижение трансакционных издержек в форме недополученной выручки, приведут к укреплению доверия к институтам информационной инфраструктуры и др. Опыт проведения аграрных преобразований показал, что сельскохозяйственные организации не могут успешно конкурировать вне системы управления затратами. Чем эффективнее используются в хозяйственных процессах ресурсы, в том числе управленческие, тем выше возможность успешно конкурировать на рынке. Чем выше внешние трансакционные издержки, тем больше вероятность, что фирма будет искать возможность заменить рыночные трансакции на внутренние. Стимулом является снижение неопределенности, что, в свою очередь, снижает издержки, связанные с оппортунистическим поведением, несбалансированной работой системы в целом. Таким образом, на уровне внутрифирменного управления регулирование величины и структуры трансакционных издержек достигается формированием рациональных масштабов рыночной деятельности, преодолением неформализованного управления. На уровне организации это осуществляется разработкой внутрифирменной трансакционной политики с применением специально разработанных инструментов: регистра учета трансакционных издержек, алгоритма расчета внутренних, внешних и издержек в форме недополученной выручки. Целью учета затрат по центрам ответственности является анализ и контроль затрат, оценка результатов деятельности центров. Такой подход обеспечивается закреплением ответственности в соответствии с организационно-функциональной структурой предприятия. Для каждого из центров ответственности определяются статьи расходов, регламент бюджетирования, бизнес-процессы. Внутрифирменная трансакционная политика обеспечивает: • определение границ рыночной деятельности; •повышение управляемости величиной и структурой трансакционных издержек. Изложенное позволяет заключить, что в результате применения указанного механизма обеспечиваются: преодоление дисбаланса развития трансакционного и трансформационного секторов экономики; преодоление неформальных институциональных ограничений; развитие и накопление социального капитала, закрепление положительных неформальных практик; снижение риска оппортунистического поведения; повышение качества функционирования трансакционного сектора экономики в целом; снижение издержек в форме недополученной выручки организаций.. Conclusion Areas of control transaction sector of the economy are as follows: • overcome the ""problem tracks"" in the development of (path- dependence problem); • overcoming the imbalance of transactional and transformational sectors of the economy; • combating the informal economy; • development of cultural characteristics that contribute to the removal of institutional constraints. Improving the quality of information, countering unregistered statistics, lobby for the interests of individual groups, overcoming the restricted procedure will ensure reduction of transaction costs in the form of foregone revenue, lead to a strengthening of confidence in the institutions of the information infrastructure, and others. Experience of carrying out agrarian reform has shown that agricultural companies can not compete successfully is cost management system. The more effective use in business processes resources, including the management, the greater the opportunity to successfully compete in the market. The higher the external transaction costs, the greater the likelihood that the firm will seek to replace market transactions in the domestic. The incentive is to reduce uncertainty, which in turn reduces the costs associated with opportunistic behavior, unbalanced operation of the system as a whole. Thus, at the level of in-house management regulation size and structure of the transaction costs is achieved by the formation of rational scale of market activity, overcoming the non-formal control. At the level of the organization is carried out in-house development of the transactional policy using specially designed tools: Register account transaction costs, the algorithm of calculation of internal, external and costs in the form of foregone revenue. The purpose of the account of expenses on the responsibility centers is to analyze and control costs, evaluation of the centers. This approach secures justice in accordance with the organizational and functional structure of the enterprise. For each of the centers of responsibility defined expenditure, budgeting regulations, business processes. Intercompany transactional policy provides: • definition of the boundaries of market activity; • increase the manageability and value structure of transaction costs. The foregoing leads to the conclusion that the application of the mechanism provided by: overcoming the unbalance development of transactional and transformational sectors of the economy; overcoming informal institutional constraints; development and accumulation of social capital, strengthening the positive informal practices; reducing the risk of opportunistic behavior; improving the quality of functioning of the transaction sector of the economy as a whole; reduction of costs in the form of foregone revenue organizations."
A22|The Balanced Scorecard and Beyond – Applying Theories of Performance Measurement, Employment and Rewards in Management Accounting Education|This study applies the prevailing scholarly theories of strategic management, employment decisions, cost accounting and share reward schemes to a panel of questions raised by Colin Drury (2012) in the case study of the fictitious company Integrated Technology Services (UK) Ltd., ITS (UK). The paper provides model answers which can be used when working with the case study at institutions of higher education. The merit of the work lies in three areas. First, it provides an overview of theories accepted by the academia that can be utilized for further research. Second, it contrasts pro and contra arguments. Thus it shows the limitations of the very theories when applied to scenarios inspired by practical problems. Third, it develops an innovative Balanced Scorecard for ITS (UK). The scorecard can be used as an example when working with Drury’s case study. But it is also suitable for real life situations of business entities faced with oppressive overheads and deteriorating net margins, building on highly skilled workforce and trying to preserve its differentiated profile.
A22|Freshmen teachers and college major choice: Evidence from a random assignment in Chile|"We exploit the exogenous characteristic of random freshmen course assignment in a large Chilean university to identify the causal effect of teachers and their qualitative characteristics over students' major choice. Using administrative records, we establish what makes students from the ""Commercial Engineering"" career chose between an ""Economics"" major or a ""Business"" major. We find that first-economic-course teachers may account for 15-22% of the probability of choosing Economics as a major. We also identify which characteristics of these teachers make students more prone to choosing this particular major. These results are robust to the inclusion of different covariates and specifications. Placebo-type falsification tests are performed, confirming our findings."
A22|Plurality in Teaching Macroeconomics|The current Great Recession, the worst crisis that capitalism has faced since the Great Depression, has failed, at least so far, to generate a change in the teaching and practice of Macroeconomics. This seems bizarre as if nothing has happened and the economists are just going about doing business as usual. In light of this, the current paper attempts to address how Macroeconomics ought to be taught to students at the advanced intermediate level, which gives them an overall perspective on the subject.
A22|Finance Behind the Veil of Money, A Rejoinder To Dr. Braun|In Finance Behind the Veil of Money, Eduard Braun (2014: 30-36) takes the minority view that opportunity costs are not only unnecessary but even unhelpful to understanding choice. In doing so he follows George Reisman (1996: 460) who also views the “doctrine of opportunity cost” as not only unnecessary to ascertain how one makes better decisions, but that its “sole contribution is obfuscation, not perception.” Both Braun and Reisman believe that it is unnecessary to include foregone alternatives in the calculus of cost since it implies that “one must suffer by virtue of possessing the very qualities that create one’s success [i.e., better opportunities]” (Reisman 1996: 460). Such a view errs by overlooking the difference between the actor’s ex-ante expectations of an action with the ex-post results. More importantly, it mistakes what role costs in general, and opportunity costs by extension, serve in economic theory.
A22|Measuring College Learning in Economics|This contribution presents a framework of essential learning outcomes and a vision for the future of assessment for undergraduate-level education in economics. The framework includes a set of essential concepts (individual decision making, markets and other interactions, the aggregate economy, and the role of government and other institutions) and essential competencies (apply the scientific process to economic phenomena, analyze and evaluate behavior and outcomes using economic concepts and models, use quantitative approaches in economics, think critically about economic methods and their application, and communicate economic ideas in diverse collaborations). With regard to assessment, the authors argue that future assessments should go beyond measuring content mastery and should include open-ended tasks that allow students to demonstrate higher order skills, such as formulating questions, interpreting data, and constructing and deconstructing arguments.
A22|Estimate And Analysis Of Vocational Training School (Iek) Students’ Satisfaction Regarding The Quality Of Studies Provided By These Schools|Measuring students’ satisfaction renders great service to the post-secondary educational institutions, since it offers the possibility to detect the strengths and weaknesses of these institutions and determine the areas that should be improved. Students’ satisfaction goes beyond teachers’ evaluation, which is a short sighted perspective, and includes wider concepts of students’ learning experience. In this context, knowing the degree of satisfaction is not enough. What is rather important is to comprehend the factors contributing to this satisfaction. The present survey aims at revealing the causes leading to IEK students’ satisfaction or obstructing it. The research was carried out at IEK of West Macedonia, Greece and the research tool used was SEVQUAL. Moreover, Analyse des Correspondences was used for data analysis. Results relating to students’ satisfaction and quality of studies were not encouraging. Finally, problems affecting the quality of studies came forward.

We present our findings by means of a systemic analysis.
A22|Paulo Freire and the methodology of thematic investigation for permanent teacher education|This text presents the principles which were the basis of permanent teacher education, as it was constructed and applied in the city of São Paulo’s public school system, during the period in which Paulo Freire was the Municipal Secretary of Education. The article also highlights the method-ology of thematic investigation (Freire, 1987), within the paradigm of Action Research, as it brings a new perspective to teacher education, under-stood as a path to help teachers gain a deeper understanding, and to critically evaluate their own practices. The research on the relevance of Paulo Freire’s thought nowadays is presented, in this text, as part of the work that has been developed at the Paulo Freire Cathedra at the Pontifical Catholic University of São Paulo (PUC-SP), in Brazil. Amongst the em-pirical works, within the ambit of this research, emphasis will be given to a doctoral thesis which adopts Freire’s concept of permanent teacher education and, at the same time, applies the methodology of thematic investigation as the principal methodological process, recreating this proposal in the context of teacher education-research.
A22|The Visual Decoding of the ¡°Wheel of Duality¡± in Consumer Theory in Modern Microeconomics: An Instructional Tool Usable in Advanced Microeconomics to Turn ¡°Pain¡± into ¡°Joy¡±|Duality is the heart of advanced microeconomics. It exists everywhere throughout advanced microeconomics, from the beginning of consumer theory to the end of production theory. The complex, circular relationships among various theoretical microeconomic concepts involved in the setting of duality theory have led it to be called the ¡°wheel of pain¡± by many graduate economics students. Put simply, the main aim of this paper is to turn this ¡°wheel of pain¡± into a ¡°wheel of joy¡±. To be more specific, the primary purpose of this paper is to graphically decode the logical, complex relationships among a quartet of dual functions which present preferences as well as a quartet of demand-related functions in a visual manner.
A22|Clarifying Theoretical Intricacies through the Use of Conceptual Visualization: Case of Production Theory in Advanced Microeconomics|Production theory, defined as the study of the economic process of transforming inputs into outputs, consists of two simultaneous economic forces: cost minimization and profit maximization. The cost minimization problem involves deriving conditional factor demand functions and the cost function. The profit maximization problem involves deriving the output supply function, the profit function, and unconditional factor demand functions. Nested within the process are Shephard¡¯s lemma, Hotelling¡¯s lemmas, direct and indirect mathematical relations, and other elements contributing to the dynamics of the process. The intricacies and hidden underlying influences pose difficulties in presenting the material for an instructor, and inhibit learning by students. Simply put, the primary aim of this paper is to facilitate the teaching and learning of the production theory realm of Economics through the use of a conceptual visual model. This paper proposes a pedagogical tool in the form of a detailed graphic illustrating the relationship between profit-maximization and cost-minimization under technical constraints, with an emphasis on the similarities and differences between the perfect-competition and monopoly cases. The potential that such a visual has to enhance learning when supplementing traditional context is discussed under the context of contemporary learning literature. Embedded in the discussion is an example of how we believe our model could be conceptualized and utilized in a real-world setting to evaluate an industrial project with an economic point of view.
A22|Do secrets come out? Statistical evaluation of student cheating|We suggest an original method of student cheating evaluation based on the comparison of students’ grades in exams in class, home assignments and experimental homework. The data for the study is collected from the survey of 2012–2013 sophomores of the International College of Economics and Finance at the National Research University Higher School of Economics in Moscow, Russia. At the end of the course in Statistics in addition to standard assignments (homework and exams) students were given experimental homework with a ban on cooperation among them. The violation of this rule was qualified as cheating. The scale of cooperation is measured and then tested through the stochastic frontier technique; it reveals connection with the GPA level, students’ expectations of the cheaters’ share and students’ moral norms. We also find different behavioral patterns for high and low performing students as well as country specific context of student cheating behavior.
A22|The Greatest Externality Story (N)ever Told|This article critiques current undergraduate economics textbooksâ€™ treatment of externalities. Despite a tremendous scholarly pushback since 1920 to Pigouâ€™s path-breaking writings, modern textbook authors fail to synthesize important critiques and extensions of externality theory and policy. The typical textbook treatment (a) does not distinguish pecuniary from technological externalities, (b) is silent about the invisible handâ€™s unintended and emergent consequences as a positive externality, (c) emphasizes negative relative to positive externalities, (d) ignores Coaseâ€™s critique of Pigouvian tax â€œsolutions,â€ and (e) presents policy â€œsolutionsâ€ to negative externalities that ignore inframarginal external benefits that may render â€œsolutionsâ€ harmful to social welfare. Aside from attention to â€œThe Coase Theoremâ€ (excerpted from only about four pages of Coaseâ€™s voluminous writings), the typical textbook today discusses little of the scholarly critique that emerged in response to Pigouâ€™s anti-market polemic. Imparting economics students with Pigouvian biases is potentially harmful to both them and society because it leaves them ill-prepared to critically assess policy proposals that are alleged to solve externality problems.
A22|Laissez-Colbert|The Colbert Report combines comedic entertainment and current events, two pedagogical sources that have the potential to increase student interest in classes and improve student learning. This article offers suggestions on the use of segments from The Colbert Report to teach introductory macroeconomics.

This academic year a new elective course for the students of the Economics Department of NSU has been conducted by Sberbank. It has some specificity in organizing the course and preparing the theoretical and practical issues of banking in the Russian Federation in case of Sberbank.
A22|Targeting Teaching Lecture Capture Learning: Do Students Perform Better Compared to Face-to-Face Classes?|Online learning has become more prevalent in colleges and universities as new technology is introduced. One such technology is lecture capture, which allows a live lecture to be recorded and packaged with classroom media and delivered online to many more students than a traditional face-to-face class. This article studies the selection process and educational outcome differences between students enrolled in a lecture capture and a face-to-face course in economic principles. Students could select either course format, both with the same instructor and course requirements, without capacity restrictions. We find that studentsâ€™ attitudes toward online learning are the chief determinant of their choice of class over demographics, opportunity cost measures, or past online experiences. Additionally, our findings suggest that lecture capture students perform as well as those who take a face-to-face course when not accounting for self-selection. When selection is taken into account, lecture capture is not significantly worse than face-to-face.
A22|Teaching Macroeconomics after the Financial Crisis|There is considerable dissatisfaction in the profession regarding the teaching of macroeconomics after the financial crisis. The ?Great Recession? highlighted the inadequacy of traditional macroeconomic modelling, based on real business cycle theory and rational expectations, to appropriately explain why the contraction world-wide was so widespread and why it has been so persistent. Textbooks have been slow to respond to these concerns, possibly because it was believed that this recession would be temporary. In addition, new policy measures such as quantitative easing and the possibility of the zero lower bound in interest rates required a re-orientation of macroeconomics pedagogy. The purpose of this paper is three-fold. First, we sketch and highlight how some of these policy issues could be explained within a traditional Keynesian macromodel. However, such formal presentation to students quickly becomes arid, so to sustain interest we need to supplement the core analytical material with innovative pedagogic strategies which needs interactive student participation. The second purpose of the paper is to give examples of such teaching methods that we have used: the use of video material; utilization of websites from news media; film screening and in-class discussion (Inside the Meltdown); flipping the classroom; playing monetary policy games; as well as, organizing a debate between the proponents of Keynesian ideas and neoclassical models in solving the long recession. Our approach is a synthesis of traditional teaching of economic models with blended learning methods. The third purpose of the paper is to evaluate an early presentation of this method and content to students and how they responded to such an approach. Our pedagogic approach is not vastly different from what policy institutions such as Central Banks are thinking. Consider the following quote from a highly rated British macroeconomist, Professor Wilhem Buiter, on the applications of monetary policy by the Bank of England: ?The Bank of England in 2007 faced the onset of the credit crunch with too much Robert Lucas, Michael Woodford and Robert Merton in its intellectual cupboard. A drastic but chaotic re-education took place and is continuing. I believe that the Bank has by now shed the conventional wisdom of the typical macroeconomics training of the past few decades. In its place is an intellectual potpourri of factoids, partial theories, empirical regularities without firm theoretical foundations, hunches, intuitions and half-developed insights. It is not much, but knowing that you know nothing is the beginning of wisdom?.
A22|Teaching Introductory Economics: application of the cost - benefit principle to the optimal allocation of resources|The current way of teaching Introductory Economics in many universities in different parts of the world does the emphasis on technique. As you flip through the pages of the classic textbooks written by G.Mankiv, P.Krugman, R.Lipsey, M.Parkin you will see graphs or mathematical formulas practically on every page. At the end of such a course the students learn how to calculate equilibrium prices and quantities, different types of elasticities and multipliers, how to draw indifference curves. But they have no idea how to apply any of these tools to real world problems.One of the most fundamental concepts that many of us want our beginning students to master is the cost-benefit principle. Perhaps, only few who teach Introductory Economics would disagree that the cost-benefit principle is the pillar of Microeconomics. But, surprisingly, the classic textbooks do not discuss this fundamental concept at all. As far as my teaching experience goes, the only textbook that dedicates the whole chapter to the cost-benefit principle is Frank/ Bernanke?s ? Principle of Microeconomics ?. I have been using this textbook for many years and I really appreciated the way how this concept was presented to the students.Due to my personal persuasion about the value of the cost-benefit principle to the beginning economics students I have made a genuine contribution to the methodology of teaching it. I was able to design a general algorithm of how to apply the cost-benefit principle to the problem of optimal allocation of resources. Typically, I use this algorithm in two chapters of my Introductory Economics course ? ? Basics of the Cost ? Benefit principle? and ?Demand : The Benefit Side of the Market?.In my presentation at the conference which I am planning to attend I will demonstrate how to apply the general algorithm to two problems on optimal allocation of resources.
A22|Experiential Learning: Looking At Country Manager Simulation For Teaching International Business Courses|The use of simulations in business education started in 1957, since then, hundreds of simulations have been developed. In this paper, we present a literature review of the impact that business simulations have in developing decision-making skills, integrative, experiential learning, and team work skills. Building on the generative learning theory, experiential learning theory and bloom?s taxonomy, we tested the simulation Country Manager with a number of students divided in 4 groups. The objective was to obtain feedback of the applicability and benefit of using this software to teach decision-making in international business courses. Results showed Country Manager being applicable to senior level or capstone international business strategy courses and appropriate as an experiential learning tool. However, a series of difficulties and software inflexibilities were noted. We found supporting evidence for implementing a simulation into the international business curricula to represent an experiential learning prong, even if Country Manager was not the most pertinent match.
A22|Policies with varying costs and benefits: A land conservation classroom game| Some policies try to maximize net benefits by targeting different individuals to participate. This is difficult when costs and benefits of participation vary independently, such as in land conservation. The authors share a classroom game that explores cases in which minimizing costs may not maximize benefits and vice versa. The game is a contextually rich pedagogical tool, putting students in the role of landowners who must decide whether to conserve land in different policy environments: flat conservation payments, agglomeration bonuses, and a conservation auction. Students learn about specific issues in land conservation, ecosystem services, preferences for nonmoney outcomes, and general issues in policymaking. The game is suited to classes in environmental, resource, agricultural, and policy economics, and more general classes in microeconomics and public policy.
A22|The Relevance Of Teaching Economics: The Experience Of Post-Communist Bulgaria|The paper deals with the relevance of teaching economics in post-communist Bulgaria. The period of development of Bulgaria since 1990 is divided by the author into two sub periods. The author argues that during the first one – the transition from plan to market, the teaching of economics in Bulgaria lacked relevance, because the transition economy is different from the market economy. During the second period – the post transition, the problem about the relevance of university economics courses appears again, as a result of some short-comings of modern economics. The criticism of economics and of teaching economics in the light of the last global crisis is revealed. A conclusion is made, that at present a process of re form of the economics curriculum has started worldwide and Bulgarian teachers need to be an active part of it.
A22|Cultivating the Liberally Education Mind Through A Signature Program|In this paper we describe the Miller Upton Programs, launched by the Department of Economics at Beloit College in 2008. The Miller Upton Programs aim to advance student understanding of the nature and causes of wealth and well-being. After describing core elements of the program, we discuss the ways in which they leverage economic discourse as a means to advance liberal learning. We argue that programs of this kind advance liberal learning by cultivating the skills required to engage the great questions of human flourishing, by fostering the development of a studentsâ€™ economic imagination, and by enhancing studentsâ€™ ability to engage in genuine intellectual discovery. So that readers can identify specific elements of the program that may be appropriate to replicate at their home institutions, we provide details on the history and resource commitments associated with various aspects of the program.
A22|Bringing Active Learning into High School Economics: Some Examples from The Simpsons|In this brief educational note, we provide several examples of directed classroom activities for the high school economics classroom using the long-running television show The Simpsons. In doing so, we provide an overview of the scholarly literature on using popular culture to teach economics. Our examples highlight how popular culture can be successfully employed at the secondary level to engage and teach students through active learning. We conclude with some thoughts for secondary social studies teachers looking to enhance economic instruction.
A22|Class attendance and university performance|Using survey data collected at Göttingen University, Germany, this paper evaluates the effect of attending the lecture and/or tutorial on the grade achieved in two basic courses in business administration and economics. The analysis shows that going to class has no significant impact on student performance in most specifications. Although the identification of a causal effect may not be possible with the data at hand, the results suggest that, in the given framework, attending class and studying on one´s own may be substitutes.
A22|Using Computer Simulators for Teaching Macroeconomics at the Undergraduate Level|The integration of technology in the educational process is becoming increasingly important for improving the 21st century student s understanding and retention of academic material Being able to readily apply the theory covered in class and to automatically receive immediate feedback is invaluable And with gamification now permeating into nearly every area of our lives computer games are proving to be an effective way to successfully engage any audience Presently there are only a few freely available macroeconomic simulators on the Internet which are suitable for undergraduate students The two most prominent ones are the European Central Bank s conomia and the Chair the Fed game But both of them focus solely on monetary policy Thus there is no educational simulator that allows students to examine the effects of fiscal policy This is particularly problematic since Bulgaria and several other countries in the region which are not part of the Eurozone operate under a currency board meaning that they do not have much control over their monetary policy so the emphasis there is mainly on conducting fiscal policy Hence prof Vasilev and I developed the Keynesian Macroeconomic Simulator of Fiscal Policy
A22|Using Computer Simulators for Teaching Macroeconomics at the Undergraduate Level|The integration of technology in the educational process is becoming increasingly important for improving the 21st century student’s understanding and retention of academic material. Being able to readily apply the theory covered in class and to automatically receive immediate feedback is invaluable. And with gamification now permeating into nearly every area of our lives, computer games are proving to be an effective way to successfully engage any audience. Presently, there are only a few freely available macroeconomic simulators on the Internet which are suitable for undergraduate students. The two most prominent ones are the European Central Bank’s €conomia and the Chair the Fed game. But both of them focus solely on monetary policy. Thus, there is no educational simulator that allows students to examine the effects of fiscal policy. This is particularly problematic since Bulgaria and several other countries in the region, which are not part of the Eurozone, operate under a currency board, meaning that they do not have much control over their monetary policy, so the emphasis there is mainly on conducting fiscal policy. Hence, we developed the “Keynesian Macroeconomic Simulator of Fiscal Policy”.
A22|Crucial skills for the entrepreneurial success of fine artists|"This article aims to define crucial skills for the entrepreneurial success of working fine artists as these skills have not yet been clearly identified for this professional group. The identification could be beneficial for artists' entrepreneurship education at higher education institutions (HEIs) in order to prepare them for their careers as effectively as possible. In order to achieve this aim, the paper is first focused on the entrepreneurship literature to identify the skills that are, in general, important for the entrepreneurial success and failure of entrepreneurs. In a second step, a survey was distributed to lecturers in Fine Art at HEIs in the UK and Germany, all of whom were simultaneously working artists, to determine the crucial skills for fine artists based on their professional experience. Both survey and literature findings show evidence that in particular seven skills, the ""five plus two"" skills, are crucial for the entrepreneurial success of professional fine artists."
A22|Fine artists' entrepreneurial business environment|This paper aims to illustrate the working and business environment of professional fine artists and to identify the factors to successfully make a living in the arts as both market challenges and success factors have not yet been clearly identified in literature. The identification of artists' business environment and success factors could be particularly beneficial for practising fine artists, prospective fine art students, and higher education institutions (HEIs) in order to provide them with a deeper market insight and knowledge for an effective professional education and preparation. In order to achieve this aim, the paper is first focused on the literature to identify working fine artists' business environment including the different art market segments, entry barriers, and challenges. In a second step, interviews with professional fine artists were conducted as well as surveys distributed to lecturers and students in Fine Art at HEIs and to galleries to determine the challenges and success factors in the art market from their professional experience. The literature and survey findings clearly show that the art market is characterised by different segments of varying market attention and visibility, whose access is controlled by informal market barriers consisting of powerful networks. The vast majority of fine artists are practising in segments excluded from buyers' awareness.
A22|Classroom Games: Trading in a Pit Market 2.0|We have developed a computerized version of Charles Holt’s classical market game that can be used even in classes with a large audience. The Pit market game gives students intuitive access to the interaction of supply and demand in real-world markets. Even though trade can take place at non-uniform prices in the classroom game, the average price and the quantity traded are usually very close to the equilibrium values predicted by supply and demand curves. The classroom game can also be used for a lively discussion about the efficiency of markets or to show the consequences of taxes and regulatory interventions.
A22|Classroom Experiments: Is More More?|Studies have demonstrated that classroom experiments have a positive effect on student achievement in economics courses. Questions remain regarding the appropriate number of experiments. In the current study we attempt to determine whether more intensive use of classroom experiments is associated with greater student achievement. Our data contains variation in the number of experiments administered in a principles of microeconomics course. We find that participation in classroom experiments has a positive, but diminishing, marginal benefit on students' final course scores. We also find that classroom experiments can bridge some achievement gaps (between older and younger students, between whites and minorities).
A22|Measuring the Effect of Blended Learning: Evidence from a Selective Liberal Arts College|We compare introductory microeconomics courses that employ a blended learning approach to more traditional control courses at a selective liberal arts college. The blended learning courses required students to complete online homework and watch video lectures before problem-based class sessions, while the control courses used paper homework and primarily traditional lecturing. We use the Test of Understanding in College Economics to measure improvement and use the Student Opinion Survey to control for students' self-reported effort and amount of importance placed on the test. We find that students in the blended courses improve more than those in traditional courses.
A22|The Impact of Challenge Quizzes on Student Knowledge|"We evaluate the efficacy of a blended formative/summative assessment tool developed to support mastery learning by students without placing undue burden on instructors. Our innovation provides students with an opportunity to take a more difficult ""challenge"" quiz to demonstrate their command of the material and improve their grade on regular in-class quizzes. The structure of these quizzes motivates students to modify study behaviors (formative component) and take responsibility for knowledge acquisition (summative component). This mastery-based testing approach serves to bring the student's objective of a quality grade in line with the instructor's objective of quality learning."
A22|A Randomized Assessment of Online Learning|A microeconomics principles course employing random assignment across three sections with different teaching models is used to explore learning outcomes as measured by a cumulative final exam for students who participate in traditional face-to-face classroom instruction, blended face-to-face and online instruction with reduced instructor contact time, and a purely online instructional format. Evidence indicates learning outcomes were reduced for students in the purely online section relative to those in the face-to-face format by 5 to 10 points on a cumulative final exam. No statistically significant differences in outcomes are observed for students in the blended relative to the face-to-face section.
A22|Immigration Economics by George J. Borjas: A Review Essay|We review Immigration Economics by George J. Borjas, published in 2014 by Harvard University Press. The book is written as a graduate-level textbook, and summarizes and updates many of Borjas's important contributions to the field over the past thirty years. A key message of the book is that immigration poses significant costs to many members of the host-country labor market. Though the theoretical and econometric approaches presented in the book will be very useful for students and specialists in the field, we argue that the book presents a one-sided view of immigration, with little or no attention to the growing body of work that offers a more nuanced picture of how immigrants fit into the host-country market and affect native workers.
A22|Analysing the determinants of students’ loyalty in the higher education context: The Catalan University system case|The aim of this paper is twofold: (i) identify the determinants of students’ loyalty, and ii) characterise the profile of the recently graduate students within the Catalan University system. The empirical evidence is collected through the Satisfaction Graduate Survey promoted by the Catalan University Quality Assurance Agency. The analysis presented corresponds to the 2013 edition. Concretely, the survey was launched in October of 2013, and 2,557 questionnaires were collected, from which 2,337 were fully completed. The sample is mainly composed by women (62,9%) between 21 and 24 years old born in Catalonia. The main reason for choosing their studies are the preference for the study (62,3%) and job opportunities (15,1%). Moreover, most of the graduates combined learning and work (57,8%) and only 20,7% joined a mobility program during their studies. In terms of loyalty, 68,8% of the students would chose the same degree again, and 77,7% of them would remain at the same university. In fact, 62,3% of the sample are satisfied or very satisfied with the studied degree. Related to the determinants of students’ loyalty, our results show that higher is the loyalty of the student as higher is his/her satisfaction with the degree and the better the previous academic records of the student. However, results are inconclusive in terms of balancing study and work, engaging in mobility programs or getting involved in university associations. Female students are also shown to display higher levels of loyalty. As for the second research objective, students are grouped into three main groups: loyal and satisfied but not first choice of studies (cluster 1); unsatisfied (cluster 2); and loyal and satisfied (cluster 3).
A22|España como destino de estudiantes universitarios internacionales|Se analiza la actividad de España como destino de estudiantes universitarios internacionales. Se constata que el volumen de estudiantes internacionales en España está creciendo con gran intensidad y de manera continuada. Una proporción muy importante de los estudiantes provienen de los países de América Latina y el Caribe. Aun con diferencias entre países, España figura como uno de los países de elección para los estudios en el extranjero en toda el área. El número de estudiantes del resto del mundo es creciente. La presencia de estudiantes internacionales es un fenómeno amplio que se extiende a todo el territorio de España, aunque con una intensidad desigual. Destacan cinco comunidades: Castilla y León, Cataluña, Madrid, Navarra y Valencia. Como universidades más activas, destacan las universidades privadas IE University, Universidad de Navarra y Universitat Ramon Llull, así como el conjunto de las universidades públicas de Barcelona.
A22|Reshaped for Higher Order Learning: Student Outcomes in the Redesign of an Undergraduate Macroeconomics Course| We consider the impact on student learning outcomes of a re-design of an undergraduate macroeconomics course. Changes were made to move from lower- to higher-order taxonomic dimensions, with emphasis on application and analysis. We use 13 questions which appeared on final exams before and after the re-design to evaluate changes in student learning outcomes. The analysis shows that after the re-design students improved performance on questions classified as higher-order, while performance suffered on questions classified as lower-order. These results suggest that the re-design was a shift of teaching and learning resources, not an overall improvement that impacted equally all taxonomic dimensions. The course before the re-design may have used its resources well, but in pursuit of improving application and analysis over memorization and understanding.
A22|Shaping Future Agriculturalists: Does Agricultural Literacy and Demographic Background Influence Student Views about Farm Policy?| US food and agricultural policy can be a sensitive subject among numerous constituencies. Since university agricultural students may eventually become a part of these groups, does the level of agricultural literacy and personal backgrounds influence students’ views of agricultural policy? The Food and Fiber System Literacy instrument and the Consumer Preferences for Farm Policy and the USDA Budget survey were administered to students enrolled in Introduction to Professional Leadership Skills (Intro) and in Agriculture and Government Programs (Policy) at Sam Houston State University (SHSU). A student’s one-tailed t-test variances compared agricultural literacy between students in the two courses. Results indicated students enrolled in Policy were significantly more agriculturally literate than students enrolled in Intro (p<0.001). Subsequently, students’ level of agricultural literacy and demographic background were regressed on a series of seven Likert-type scale questions related to farm policy. Select demographic characteristics were significantly different on three of the seven questions. Based on the findings from the policy questions posed, students’ academic experience, enrolled course, level of agricultural literacy, age, political affiliation and being raised around a family farm influenced their views regarding programs to ensure food supply, programs to preserve rural landscape and government interference in markets.
A22|Scrambled questions penalty in multiple choice tests: New evidence from French undergraduate students|This note evaluates the scrambled questions penalty using multiple choice tests taken by first-year undergraduate students who follow a microeconomics introductory course. We provide new evidence that students perform worse at scrambled questionnaires than at logically ordered ones. We improve on previous studies by explicitly modeling students individual skills thanks to a fixed effects regression. We further show that the scrambled questions penalty does not differ along gender but varies along the distribution of students' skills and mostly affects students with lower-intermediate skills.
A22|Teaching Economics and Providing Visual “Big Pictures”|The goal of this paper is to investigate the importance of providing visual “big pictures” in the teaching of economics. The plurality and variety of concepts, variables, diagrams, and models involved in economics can be a source of confusion for many economics students. However, reviewing the existing literature on the importance of providing visual “big pictures” in the process of learning suggests that furnishing students with a visual “big picture” that illustrates the ways through which those numerous, diverse concepts are connected to each other could be an effective solution to clear up the mentioned mental chaos. As a practical example, this paper introduces a “big picture” that can be used as a good resource in intermediate macroeconomics classes. This figure presents twenty-seven commonly-discussed macroeconomic diagrams in the intermediate macroeconomics course, and gives little detail on some of these diagrams, aiming at helping students to get the whole picture at once on a single piece of paper. This macroeconomics big picture mostly focuses on the routes through which common diagrams in macroeconomics are connected to each other, and finally introduces the general macroeconomic equilibrium that is graphically derived through those connections.
A22|Estimating the Effect of Attending a Public versus a Private University in Colombia on Academic Achievement **** Una Estimación del Efecto sobre el Rendimiento Académico de Asistir a una Universidad Pública o privada en Colombia|We evaluate the impacts of attending a public university in Colombia on the academic achievement of graduates from higher education. Our measurement of academic achievement represents the progress made between the college entrance and graduation standardized test scores. We find that public Higher Education Institutions (HEI) improve student test scores in 11 of the 12 programs analyzed. The superiority of public HEIs relative to private ones suggests the need to promote greater regulation of the latter, and a review their current standards to help bridge the gap that currently exists in terms of the value added public HEIs have in comparison to the private ones. It also suggests that, at least in the short run, it could be socially beneficial to expand the public provision of some of the higher education public programs that added more value. **** Se evalúa el impacto de asistir a una universidad pública sobre el rendimiento académico de los egresados de la educación superior en Colombia. El rendimiento académico se define como el progreso entre el examen de entrada a la universidad y los resultados de las pruebas estandarizadas justo antes de la graduación. Se encuentra que los programas de Instituciones de Educación Superior (IES) públicas mejoran los resultados de los estudiantes en 11 de los 12 programas analizados. La mayoría de los resultados son robustos una vez la muestra se condiciona a programas de mayor calidad (por ejemplo, programas acreditados o las mejores universidades del país). La superioridad de las IES públicas en relación con las privadas sugiere la necesidad de promover una mayor regulación de estas últimas y una revisión de sus estándares actuales para ayudar a superar la brecha existente en términos de valor agregado de las IES públicas en comparación con las privadas. También sugiere que, al menos en el corto plazo, podría ser socialmente beneficioso ampliar la provisión pública en algunos de los programas públicos de educación superior que agregaban más valor.
A22|Maybe the Boys Just Like Economics More - The Gender Gap and the Role of Personality Type in Economics Education|Do females achieve lower grades in economics than males? What role does personality type play in any difference if one exists? This study examines a cohort of first year students who all took Principles of Economics courses and completed the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator questionnaire at a large publically funded New Zealand university. I find that males do enjoy a comparative advantage in economics (or females a comparative disadvantage). This does not disappear when personality type is controlled for but does persist. Some personality types also achieve higher grades in their study than others. Most studies in the literature have tended to focus on economics but I am able to conduct the same analysis on the other first year courses that these students take. This enables a point of comparison allowing me to examine if gender and personality type effects are unique to economics or whether economics is actually no different to other disciplines.
A22|Algunas consideraciones sobre la estructura curricular de los programas de Economía en Colombia|Este artículo expone algunas particularidades de las estructuras curriculares de los programas de Economía a partir del análisis cuantitativo de una muestra seleccionada con criterios de región y rendimiento en los exámenes de estado para los estudiantes de Economía. De acuerdo con los resultados de los análisis de la estructura curricular de los programas de Economía, se observan convergencias entre las estructuras curriculares con unas pequeñas diferencias regionales. Esta creciente homogeneización de currículos puede sugerir la existencia de una estrategia de líder-seguidor dentro de los programas de Economía. Los programas tienden a imitar la estandarización de unos programas líderes nacionales para ofrecer currículos modernos, competentes, prestigiosos o de renombre, flexibles e integrales sin tener en cuenta sus propias especificidades o sellos diferenciadores.
A22|Economia Pluralista para Enfrentar Crisis Contemporanea<BR>[Pluralist Economics to Confront Recent Crisis]|Despite the deep impact of the 2008s Great Recession, Department of Economics around the world keep teaching the neoclassical paradigm as it nothing happened. Economics´ teaching, especially at the undergraduate level, does not leave room for a pluralist background, although somewhat similar process happens at the graduate level. Global dominance of approaches market oriented, based on an individualistic ontology, a methodological deductivism and the massive use of mathematical models since the last three decades, have been closing the possibilities of different approaches. In this essay, possible causes behind this phenomenon are explored, and several proposals are presented about how a more integral and plural Microeconomics could be taught, and a more grounded Macroeconomics involved with today´s problems, and a development theory that does not give up with the theoretical richness of the Latin American traditions, could be also presented to students. The main criteria would be to endow our graduates with a more versatile vision about economic thought and economic theory, aiming toward the opening of new and creative approaches about public policies that would be able to solve our structural problems. Several concrete suggestions are offered regarding curriculums and books, and mechanism to overcome the Procrustean bed that incorporates the teaching of the dominant approach only. At the end, we would have creative professionals and conscious about the myriad of possibilities that a pluralist approach of economics science brings about, and new avenues of creative ideas will be opened to implement such policies. This proposal implies a more audacious curriculum and less timid toward the critique of the dominant cathedral of the main current of thought in Economics.
A22|Higher education value added using multiple outcomes|We build a multidimensional value added model to analyze jointly the test scores on several outcomes. Using a unique Colombian data set on higher education within a seemingly unrelated regression equations (SURE) framework we estimate school outcome specific value added indicators. These are used to measure the relative contribution of the school on a certain outcome, which may serve as an internal accountability measure. Apart from the evident estimation efficiency gains, a joint value added analysis is preferable to the unidimensional one. First, unless modeled in a multidimensional framework, the comparison of value added estimates for different outcomes within a school is not well defined; our model circumvents this issue. Second, even in the case of a separate major field of study analysis there still exists unobserved heterogeneity due to institutional diversity. This makes it more compelling to employ a rich set of outcomes in computing value added indicators. In the end, we aggregate the outcome-specific value added estimates to produce a composite value added index that reflects the combined value added contribution of all the subjects for each school.
A22|Does early bird catch the worm or a lower GPA? Evidence from a liberal arts college| Research in psychology has shown that early morning classes are not conducive to learning because of the peculiar sleep cycles of adolescents and young adults that cause them to be especially groggy in the morning. Our study examines the relationship between the times that classes are offered and the grades that students in these classes earn at a highly selective liberal arts college. Our main findings are that morning classes are harmful for student achievement. Grades are especially lower for classes that were scheduled at 8 am and 9 am. Moreover, while students of both genders are adversely affected by early morning courses, the effects are particularly pronounced for male students. This institution assigns students randomly to different sections of the same course, thus creating a quasi-natural experiment and enabling us to control for unobserved characteristics of students. In addition, we include student and faculty fixed effects.
A22|Longer Classes Versus More Frequent Classes: Which Wins? Evidence from a Liberal Arts College|Colleges and universities have to stagger their classes across different times and days to make the best use of their existing buildings. Some of these class meetings are for different lengths of time and meet a different number of days per week. In addition, students and faculty have increased demand for courses that meet fewer days per week. There is some concern that classes that meet more often are better suited for student learning than others. However, this paper finds that, after controlling for the class time and course fixed effects as well as faculty and student fixed effects, there is no statistical difference between student learning in two days and three days classes. Thus, for colleges similar to the one in this study there does not appear to be a trade-off between the frequency of course meetings and student achievement as measured by grades.
A22|Features of Structural and Functional Model of Students’ Professional Mobility Formation|The relevance of the study to these problems reasoned by the fact that in economic crisis and social dynamism times the problem of professional self-determination of the individuals considered from a different point of view, because people can repeatedly change their occupational status, qualifications and enterprise team during their whole lives. In this regard, this article is dedicated tithe development of structural-functional model of students’ professional mobility formation in modern conditions. The article presents the features of the regional structural and functional model of students’ professional mobility formation developed by the authors, comprising the following relationship of its components: The regional social order for human resources’ training, target, content-procedural, technological, monitoring and assessment-productive ones. This models based on social partnership and coordination of students’ vocational training with an innovative educational environment of the region. Pedagogical conditions of students’ professional mobility formation are proposed, the practical implementation of which in a particular individual institution of higher educationist related to the need to take into account regional factors: The possibilities of the institutions, the availability of companies and organizations in which the students can have practice, geographical location and regional affiliation of the city where the high school is located.
A22|Management System of Information Technology Studies for the Students of Professional Development Courses|The relevance of the present research is explained by the need in such a management system of information technology studies for the students of professional development courses that will allow the teachers to boost the process of students’ developing necessary skills and make it in a way that is found comfortable for the latter and takes into consideration their individual characteristics. The research aims at determining peculiarities of management systems of information technology studies for the students of professional development courses, the leading method of the research being the learner centered approach that focuses on the ways of teacher-student cooperation in the learning process. The research encompasses the key components of the information technology studies management as in the case of the Tochka Dostupa system (Transl.: Access point) which now sees the implementation of an information system “AIS Nalog-3” (Transl.: Information system Tax-3). The use of the said components of the Tochka Dostupa system helps to form students’ professional skills necessary for fulfilment of various professional tasks. The materials can be used not only in the management of information technology studies for the students of professional development courses but also for the university and vocational courses students.
A22|Teachers Professional Competence Assessment Technology in Qualification Improvement Process|Scientific and methodological validity of diagnostic procedures and techniques for the study of teachers’ professional competence is designed to ensure the efficiency and dynamism of education management, early detection of possible professional deformations and its correction in the qualification improvement training and in the process of personal and professional self-development. In this regard, this article is focused on the development of technologies to assess the teachers’ professional competence in the process of their qualification’s improvement process. The leading method in the development of this technology are the analysis of the scientific and methodological literature and practical experience which allow reveal its core elements: The tasks of diagnosis, the entities of diagnosis, a set of procedures based on the principles of system-structured pedagogical diagnostics, means and diagnostic tools. In the article the main components and their qualitative indicators to assess the development of teachers’ professional competence in the process of qualification improvement process are proposed. Article submissions are of practical value for managers of teachers’ qualification improvement training courses when evaluating their professional competence.
A22|The Model of Self-realization Readiness Formation of Research Universities Students in the Process of Civic Education|The relevance of the study is reasoned by the demand for professionals who are not only competitive in the labor market, but also possess civil position, ready for self-realization and construction of their own life in the flow of social transformation. The purpose of the article is to develop a knowledgeactivities-model of readiness formation to self-realization of research universities students in the process of civic education. The leading method is the method of modeling, allowing consider the problem of research as a purposeful process of students’ focus formation to choose the social role and civic position in the social and economic relations on the basis of understanding of their goals in life. The structure of the developed model includes a target (goal, objectives), methodological (the principles of integration, a participatory, continuity, multiculturalism), content (cognitive-oriented, project-case, civil-activities methods), organizational and procedural (including in educational content of educational material on the theory and practice of civil society; formation of information-event-learning environment; the development of teachers’ methodological culture) and result (search activity, commitment and perseverance in achieving objectives, industriousness, readiness for independent decisions in a situation of choice, the responsibility for the choice of means to achieve the goal, awareness of their rights and obligations, duty and civic reliability) components. The model suggests the development of students’ moral, legal and political focus based on personal-significant actions and it is also of practical value for teachers of research universities.
A22|The Real and the Ideal Engineer-technologist in the View of Employers and Educators|In accordance with the tendencies of socio-economic development and a high need for competitive engineers-technologists in contemporary society, Russia needs such a modernization of higher professional technical education system that takes into account the requirements of modern manufacture. Therefore, this article is aimed at expert research by employers and university teachers of professional and personal qualities of a competitive engineer-technologist. The leading methods in the study of this problem are the observation, conversation, expert interviews, questionnaires and testing allowing reveal an assessment by employers and teachers of most important professional competence and personal qualities of engineers-technologists. The paper finds that the most important professional competences, communication skills and moral qualities of the ideal and the real engineer - technologist, allocated by business leaders and teachers of the university, in fact are the same. Also it reveals discrepancies in the evaluation by employers and educators of engineers’-technologists’ personal qualities. The materials of this article may be useful in the selection and structuring of the content of engineers-technologists’ training, and may be taken into account in the implementation of students’ training and industrial practice.
A22|The impacts of Hosting Major Sporting Events: Resident’s Perceptions of the Mediterranean Games 2013 in Mersin|This study investigates the residents’ perceptions of the Mediterranean games (MG) 2013. Data was collected by questionnaire survey of 1700 residents of Mersin by applying quota sampling. A structural model to assess the factors on residents’ perceptions of the impacts of the 2013 MG and how these perceptions affect their support is tested. The findings confirmed the five factor model that is consisted of economic benefits, economic costs, social benefits, social costs and image enhancement and revealed that there is a strong support for 17th MG. Image enhancement and economic benefits are the main factors that determine the residents’ support.
A22|Student Enthusiasm as a Key Determinant of their Performance|This paper investigates students’ enthusiasm and their performance over the programme they were given using 400 observations of new students from faculty of management and social sciences. Using ordinary least square motivation, the results indicate that number of peers positively influence their performance, while change of student programme by university management negatively affect their performance. We therefore recommend a free will option to be given to students to choose any programme of their choice and as well move with peers that will positively impact on their performance.

A22|The better blend? Flipping the principles of microeconomics classroom|This study provides a comprehensive analysis of an experiment that attempts to cut costs and improve learning outcomes through a “flipped-blended” class. We discern effects of this pedagogy on learning outcomes in principles of microeconomics courses. We control for key background variables and use differences-in-differences with a matching estimator to test whether students in the flipped-blended classes learn economic concepts and tools better than students in classes with interactive lectures and online homework, but no online lectures. Findings suggest that average student improvement is significantly higher in flipped classes than in non-flipped classes, though the difference in improvement is modest.
A22|A lottery on the first day of classes! An innovative structured steps assignment on a partially randomly selected topic|In this paper we present an innovative in-depth writing assignment with structured steps in an undergraduate economic development course, where we bring two developing countries, randomly selected and represented by two students in class to write about, and later discuss, a certain development problem existing in the two countries, and to prove which country was more successful in overcoming its problem. The assignment started with its most exciting part – the lottery – which was used to assign countries for the students. The guideline, which comprised a detailed outline, important websites and how to use them, and a detailed rubric, provided students with the necessary answers to their inquiries. The feedback on the first part of the projects indicated not only the depth and width required but the degree of accuracy as well. The results were magnificent compared to traditional projects where students were only required to write on a topic of their choice with no accompanying clarifying material on the amount of depth and width required and with no feedback.
A22|Second-order accelerator of investment: The case of discrete time|This paper presents a discrete time version of Hillinger’s (1992,2005) second order accelerator model that investigates the dynamic behavior of capital, for pedagogical purposes. Such a version is put forward as a means of improving student acquaintance with the analysis of investment cycles -defined as quasi-periodic cyclic movements of capital- and with the convergence towards the steady-state when capital is subjected to trigonometric oscillations. In addition, we extend the analysis, introducing the exogenous interest rate on loans in the behavioral equation of investors. It is inferred that the introduction of this credit term results in a lower equilibrium level of capital.
A22|Putting yourself in the picture with an ‘ECONSelfie’: Using student-generated photos to enhance introductory economics courses|Students in economics classrooms are increasingly digital natives, raised in a culture of engagement, expression and learning through online interactions using technological devices. We have turned the concept of a ‘selfie’ into an instructional tool for students to demonstrate their understanding of economic concepts, as well as to engage personally with those concepts. A student self-assessment survey supports the expectations of the literature that our ECONSelfie assignment leverages the power of visuals and narratives to help students link themselves with introductory economics material for improved learning outcomes.
A22|Teaching comparative economic systems 25 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union|Twenty-five years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, we reflect on contemporary teaching of undergraduate comparative economic systems (CES). Using qualitative and quantitative measures, we consider how the field responded to the collapse by examining CES textbooks from the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. We also consider how the dissolution of the Soviet Union affected economics course offerings at the undergraduate level. Based on our findings, we suggest two strategies for reimagining CES for the 21st century by: (1) changing textbook organization and content, and (2) incorporating more comparative economic concepts throughout the undergraduate curriculum.
A22|Understanding strategic competition using numerical simulations and dynamic diagrams in Mathematica|The paper shows how to use Mathematica to study the properties of strategic competition models. The advantage of this software is that students can see, modify and solve the algebra behind the models. In addition the paper shows how to use the command Manipulate to produce dynamic diagrams and animations. Dynamic diagrams are extremely useful to help students understanding diagrammatic shifts related to comparative statics analysis. Two examples are discussed: the Cournot duopoly and the Hotelling (1929) linear city model.
A22|The value of a redesigned program and capstone course in economics|This paper describes an undergraduate program in economics which redesigned its curriculum to include a required capstone research course. The outcomes of this program are noteworthy for several reasons. To assess the impact of the high-stakes capstone research course and the redesigned program, the authors provide evidence of labor market outcomes of its graduates. Further, student learning and program outcomes are measured using direct, objective, and indirect measures, among them the ETS MFT Economics scores, awards and recognitions in undergraduate research competitions, and Senior Exit Surveys. The overall evidence suggests the redesigned economics program improved research quality among its best students, and raised median hourly wages of its graduates within two to four years of graduation.
A22|A role-play to explain cartel behavior: Discussing the oligopolistic market|The objective of this article is to provide an innovative and dynamic technique to teach strategic behavior in one of the most characteristic traits of the oligopolistic market: the cartel, in particular the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) cartel. We propose a classroom game consisting of a role playing game with 12–48 students who act as if they were a member country of OPEC. The students have to decide petroleum production in barrels to achieve the maximum benefit, taking into account price changes depending on their behavior. The classroom game (40–45min to run) can be extended to include different treatments for use in basic economics, intermediate or advanced microeconomics or other courses that examine strategic behavior and the importance of institutions in economic performance.
A22|Economics: An elite subject soon only available in elite universities?|There are some alarming stories coming out of the UK about the state of academic economics there. It appears that “economics” is becoming an elite subject for elite UK universities. This paper examines the Australian situation to see if similar patterns exist. This paper considers the trends in the availability of economics degrees across the nations and looks at the implications of these trends in Australia in terms of research outcomes, teaching and learning and the impacts on socio-economic opportunity. The similarities between the UK and Australian situation are disturbing and present a challenge to economists, and to the economics community and society as a whole.
A22|A simple climate-Solow model for introducing the economics of climate change to undergraduate students|In this paper the simplest integrated assessment model is developed in order to illustrate to undergraduate students the economic issues associated with climate change. The growth model developed in this paper is an extension of the basic Solow model and includes a simple climate model. Even though the model is very simple it is very powerful in its predictions. Students use the model to explore various scenarios illustrating how economic activity today will inflict damages from higher temperatures on future generations. But students also observe that future generations will be richer than today’s generation due to productivity growth and population stabilization. Hence, the richer future generations will not be as rich as they would be without climate change. Since the cost of action is absorbed by the current generation and the benefits of action accrue to future generations students can conduct a cost-benefit analysis and explore the importance of the discount rate. The appendix provides step-by-step instructions for students to setup the model in MS Excel and to conduct simulations.
A22|University Differences in the Graduation of Minorities in STEM Fields: Evidence from California|We examine differences in minority science graduation rates among University of California campuses when racial preferences were in place. Less prepared minorities at higher ranked campuses had lower persistence rates in science and took longer to graduate. We estimate a model of students' college major choice where net returns of a science major differ across campuses and student preparation. We find less prepared minority students at top ranked campuses would have higher science graduation rates had they attended lower ranked campuses. Better matching of science students to universities by preparation and providing information about students' prospects in different major-university combinations could increase minority science graduation. (JEL D14, E23, E32, E43, E52, E61, E62)
A22|Does Relative Grading help Male Students? Evidence from a Field Experiment in the Classroom|To read the most recent version of the discussion paper click here . The provision of non-pecuniary incentives in education is a topic that has received much scholarly attention lately. Our paper contributes to this discussion by investigating the effectiveness of grade incentives in increasing student performance. We perform a direct comparison of the two most commonly used grading practices: the absolute (i.e., criterion-referenced) and the relative (i.e., norm-referenced) grading schemes in a large-scale field experiment at a university. We hypothesize that relative grading, by creating a rank-order tournament in the classroom, provides stronger incentives for male students than absolute grading. In the full sample, we find weak support for our hypothesis. Among the more motivated students we find evidence that men indeed score significantly higher on the test when graded on a curve. Female students, irrespective of their motivation, do not increase their scores under relative grading. Since women slightly outperform men under absolute grading, grading on a curve actually narrows the gender gap in performance.
A22|Surge Pricing and Price Gouging: Public Misunderstanding as a Market Imperfection|This paper evaluates the economic and ethical effects of sudden excess demand for goods or services. The normal market response of â€œsurge pricesâ€ or â€œprice gougingâ€ invokes sharp negative reactions by consumers who consider the profit seeking market response to be unethical. Public condemnation often prevents merchants from following market signals, or induces governments to intervene by implementing price ceilings. This paper argues that public misunderstanding preventing efficient and fair outcomes is the true market imperfection in these cases. The paper provides reasons for the public misunderstanding and suggests that demonstration effects would be the most effective way to induce more favorable market outcomes.
A22|Study Habits From Administration Graduates Of Chiapas University, Habitos De Estudio En Egresados De Administracion De La Universidad Autonoma De Chiapas|Problems of desertion and backlog of students enrolled in higher education are multifactorial. Several studies agree that problems affecting school performance, primarily have to do with inadequate income profiles and lack of study habits. These studies recognize the latter as important components of academic and professional success. This research explores the study habits of graduating university students of the Bachelor of Administration. By a self-administered test, consisting of 39 reagents with dichotomous responses we seek to measure eight variables. The results indicate that in five of six schools that comprise the Higher Education Unit of Administrative and Accounting Sciences, the attitude towards study is the highest weighted by the graduates; followed by the physiological state. In all faculties, deficiencies arise related to time distribution. This reading was flawed in at least seven of every ten graduates. We concluded the results generated provide elements to be considered in the curriculum redesign process to improve opportunities in vocational training
A22|Labor Insertion Of Administration Students From Chiapas University, Insercion Laboral De Estudiantes De Administracion De La Universidad Autonoma De Chiapas|Under the premise that emphasizes the importance of employability of young professionals, we characterized the job placement process of graduates. To assess the quality of training; we conduct a survey that includes follow-up graduates model. The survey includes ten questions on the experience gained on entry into the labor market during their studies. The results show the universe of graduates; only 35% worked during their studies, of these 31% worked throughout their studies and 40% in the intermediate stage of the degree. At the conclusion of the studies only 23% were working. Some 18% worked in their own businesses and the majority (69%) were employees in the private sector. The medium method used to identify employment opportunities are recommendations (62%). Only 7% indicated they used school job boards. We conclude that the university should strengthen the entrepreneurial spirit of students, as well as the inclusion of professional practice and formalization of linking spaces to facilitate the detection of employment opportunities for students
A22|Eficiencia Del Plan De Marketing Como Técnica De Aprendizaje Cooperativo / Effectiveness Of Marketing Plan As Cooperative Learning Technique|Es innegable la importancia que el trabajo en equipo tiene como capacidad transversal en los nuevos planes de estudio universitarios. Por ello, es importante conocer qué es el aprendizaje cooperativo y su eficiencia sobre los equipos de estudiantes que lo utilizan. El objetivo de este artículo consiste en operacionalizar el concepto de aprendizaje cooperativo y estudiar sus consecuencias sobre el aprendizaje individual de los miembros de un equipo y el rendimiento global obtenido por el mismo. Se utilizan los modelos de ecuaciones estructurales sobre una muestra de 319 alumnos en una asignatura de marketing en una universidad pública española. Los resultados obtenidos señalan que el aprendizaje cooperativo mejora el aprendizaje de la asignatura en la que se aplica y el rendimiento del equipo, por lo que abogamos por que se favorezca su uso en las aulas y proponemos nuevas líneas de investigación para completar nuestro conocimiento sobre el aprendizaje cooperativo. / The importance of teamwork as a core capacity in the new university curricula is beyond all doubt. It is therefore crucial to know what cooperative learning is and how efficient it is for teams of students that use it. Thus, the aim of this paper is to operationalise the concept of cooperative learning and to study its consequences on both the individual learning of the members of a team and on the overall performance achieved by the team as a whole. Structural equation models were used on a sample of 319 students in a marketing subject at a Spanish public university. The results obtained show that students learn better in subjects in which cooperative learning is applied, and the team’s performance also improves. We therefore fully endorse fostering its use in the classroom. Lastly, several new lines of research are proposed to complete current knowledge about cooperative learning
A22|Impacto de la eficiencia terminal de la educación superior en México en la economía educativa|En los últimos años en México se han presentado incrementos importantes en el gasto de educación superior y en los servicios educativos, pero no se han reflejado en una mejora de la eficiencia terminal ni de la deserción escolar. Recientemente la Economía de la Educación ha tomado fuerza, ya que la educación ha pasado a ocupar un lugar destacado en la discusión pública en la mayoría de los países y, especialmente, debido a la potencial vinculación entre educación y desarrollo económico. A partir de los datos gubernamentales, en este artículo se pretende responder a la interrogante de si existe una correlación entre la eficiencia terminal y el gasto en la educación superior. Se encontró una clara correlación entre las dos variables y se estimó que un incremento de 1% en la eficiencia terminal en educación superior para 2017, incrementaría la oferta de lugares en educación superior 74 574. Este tipo de indicadores podía contribuir a elaborar políticas racionales para asignar estímulos y corregir desviaciones en el desarrollo de la educación superior en México./ In recent years in Mexico, there have been significant increases in spending on higher education and educational services, but have not been reflected in improved terminal efficiency or scholar dropouts. Recently the Economics of Education has taken recognition, since education has assumed a prominent role in public debate in most countries, and especially because of the potential link between education and economic development. From government data, this article tries to answer the question if there is a correlation between the terminal efficiency and spending on higher education. A clear correlation between the two variables was found and it was estimated that an increase of 1% in the terminal efficiency in higher education for 2017, increase the students places in higher education in 74 574. Such indicators could help develop rational policies to assign stimuli and correct deviations in the development of higher education in Mexico.
A22|“Retaking a course in Economics: Innovative methodologies to simulate academic performance in large groups”|Students who have to retake courses at university are often not only low-achieving, but also unmotivated and lacking self-confidence. These problems may be accentuated in large groups of repeater students. In this context, the implementation of new teaching approaches to cater for their needs is a priority. This paper reports the experience of a teaching strategy based on the implementation of flipped classroom, team-based learning, and frequent testing methodologies in large groups of students retaking a subject. The study was carried out during the academic years 2013/14 and 2014/15 at the Faculty of Economy and Business, University of Barcelona (Spain). The results reflect a significant increase in the motivation and academic performance of these students, and validate the application of this strategy in large groups.
A22|Policies and practices for entrepreneurial education: The Malaysian experience|Entrepreneurship education is considered one of the key instruments that increases the entrepreneurial attitudes of potential entrepreneurs. The Malaysian government has made tremendous efforts in promoting entrepreneurship education by improving the current policy on entrepreneurship education, providing various entrepreneurship programs to increase the number of young entrepreneurs, and highlighting the need to empower entrepreneurship education among graduates of Higher Education Institutes (HEIs). However, despite the policies implemented by the Malaysian government, studies done on the effectiveness of policy implementation are still lacking. This paper therefore aims to examine the achievements of the Strategic Plan on Entrepreneurship Development in Higher Education (2013-2015) on promoting entrepreneurial education in Malaysian HEIs. The achievements were measured through Key Performance Indicators that were developed by the Ministry of Education. A set of questionnaires has been adapted and modified from the list of Key Performance Indicators. The questionnaire consists of 6 sections that represent the six thrusts in the Strategic Plan on Entrepreneurship Development in Higher Education (2013-2015). 20 set of questionnaires were distributed to the respondents from the Entrepreneurship Centers in 20 public Malaysian HEIs via emails. Completed data was collected from 10 respondents who represent 10 public HEIs in Malaysia. Some data was also retrieved from the Ministry of Education’s database to provide a thorough analysis of the key performance indicators (KPIs). Findings of this study noted that four out of six thrusts, including the first thrust, which is to empower the Entrepreneurship Center in every HEI, the second thrust, which is to provide holistic and well-planned entrepreneurial education and programs, the fourth thrust, which is to enhance the competency of HEIs’ entrepreneurship trainers and facilitators, and the sixth thrust, which is to increase the effect of the implementation of HEIs’ entrepreneurial education and development, have been successfully achieved. Meanwhile, the other two thrusts that include the third thrust, which is to empower entrepreneurial development programs, and the fifth thrust, which is to provide a conducive environment and ecosystem for entrepreneurship development, have failed to be achieved. Overall, it has been shown that the efforts taken by the Malaysian government in promoting entrepreneurship education among HEI graduates still require some improvement. Therefore, it is important for the [End Page 307] Ministry of Education and Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to join hands in making sure that the current policies and programs as well as the curriculum and content on entrepreneurship are improved.
A22|Why do students attend lectures?: Exploring justifications for attendance among undergraduate students from a British university in Asia|A substantial amount of time and resources are invested in the improvement of teaching and learning methods within Higher Education institutions today. These efforts could be undermined by problems of low student attendance however – an issue which has attracted increased attention in 21st century education literature. Moreover, previous studies have found that lecture attendance is a key factor in improving student academic performance. Thus, the main aim of this paper was to gain insight into Undergraduate student perceptions on their lecture attendance. This included identifying student’s perceptions on reasons for both lecture attendance and absenteeism, using data obtained from 162 undergraduate Business students from a British university in Southeast Asia. A purposive sample was selected from three diverse economics modules – classified according to year of study. Ethical guidelines for social research were adopted in this study. The main reasons cited by students as motivations to attend lectures included: acquiring knowledge, gaining exam guidance and collection of lecture notes. On the other hand, students stated that they will not attend lecture if the classes are held during weekend and if they needed time to complete their coursework. Contradict to previous studies, availability of online lecture materials and environmental conditions are not valid reasons for not attending lectures. In the second stage analysis, this study also investigated the association between key reasons for attending and not attending lectures and student characteristics, using Chi-Square test. The findings suggest that female students perceived that attending class would lead to good grades above male students. Interestingly, more male students highlighted that they would be less likely to attend classes if a lecture slot competed with a coursework deadline. It is worth noting that student perceptions on reasons for attending and not attending lectures are not statistically different across year of study. The policy implications for universities with a similar profile are also discussed.

The main purpose of the project is to improve the quality of teaching on subjects in the field of international finance through adjustments in the structure of the courses, modernizing the contents and the methods of teaching in line with the best practices in leading European business schools. This article aims to present the activities undertaken and the results achieved under the project.
A22|The Play of Familiarity and Predictability in English Business Idioms|This study looks at the use of idioms by Romanian business students learning English as asecond language. An experiment has been conducted, in which 119 students of economic scienceswere given the task to match 20 idioms to contexts in which they may be used (short sentences fromwhich the idiom had been removed). The students were explained beforehand that each idiommatches one sentence, that all sentences are taken from business contexts and that none of theidioms is used literally. They were also asked to rate the degree of their familiarity with the idiom(1 â€“ Familiar, 2 â€“ Less familiar, 3 â€“ Unfamiliar). The purpose of the study was to restrict thestudents from reverting to the literal meaning of the idioms and from decomposing them, in orderto determine the play of familiarity and predictability in identifying the meaning of idioms.
A22|â€˜Taking the Bull by the Hornsâ€™ with English Business Idioms|This study looks at the recognition of written idioms by Romanian business students learningEnglish as a second language. An experiment has been conducted, in which 114 students ofeconomic sciences were given definitions of idioms, with the task of finding the idiom that best fitsthe definition. They were also asked to rate the degree of familiarity with the idiom (1 â€“ Familiar, 2â€“ Less familiar, 3 â€“ Unfamiliar). The analysis of the studentsâ€™ matches reveals that less than half of the students involved in thestudy were able to make a clear connection between the idiom and the proposed definition. Uponfurther evaluation, we are confident in our assessment that students in the field of business are inneed of a more detailed course presentation on idioms and colloquial language commonly found ina corporate office building.
A22|Principles of (Behavioral) Economics|Behavioral economics has become an important and integrated component of modern economics. Behavioral economists embrace the core principles of economics—optimization and equilibrium—and seek to develop and extend those ideas to make them more empirically accurate. Behavioral models assume that economic actors try to pick the best feasible option and those actors sometimes make mistakes. Behavioral ideas should be incorporated throughout the first-year undergraduate course. Instructors should also considering allocating a lecture (or more) to a focused discussion of behavioral concepts. We describe our approach to such a lecture, highlighting six modular principles and empirical examples that support them.
A22|Teaching a Behavioral Economics Elective: Highlighting the Science of Economics|In this paper, I provide an overview of how one might teach an advanced undergraduate elective on Behavioral Economics. While I focus on the structure and themes from my own course, I also attempt to highlight ways in which instructors might choose an alternative structure. Throughout, I emphasize how a Behavioral Economics elective is a great vehicle in which to highlight to undergraduates the science of Economics.
A22|Research on Teaching Economics to Undergraduates|This survey summarizes the main research findings about teaching economics to undergraduates. After briefly reviewing the history of research on undergraduate economic education, it discusses the status of the economics major numbers and trends, goals, coursework, outcomes, and the principles courses. Some economic theory is used to explain the likely effects of pedagogical decisions of faculty and the learning choices that students make. Major results from empirical research are reviewed from the professor perspective on such topics as teaching methods, online technology, class size, and textbooks. Studies of student learning are discussed in relation to study time, grades, attendance, math aptitude, and cheating. The last section discusses changes in the composition of faculty who teach undergraduate economics and effects from changes in instructional technology and then presents findings from the research about measuring teaching effectiveness and the value of teacher training.

A22|Revisiting Samuelson's Foundations of Economic Analysis|Paul Samuelson's Foundations of Economic Analysis played a major role in defining how economic theory was undertaken for many years after the Second World War. This paper fills out Samuelson's account of the book's origins and corrects some details, making clear his debt to E. B. Wilson and establishes that turning the thesis into a book was a long process. The contents of the book and its reception are then reviewed. (JEL A22, B20, B31)
A22|The Superiority of Economists|In this essay, we analyze the dominant position of economics within the network of the social sciences in the United States. We begin by documenting the relative insularity of economics, using bibliometric data. Next we analyze the tight management of the field from the top down, which gives economics its characteristic hierarchical structure. Economists also distinguish themselves from other social scientists through their much better material situation (many teach in business schools, have external consulting activities), their more individualist worldviews, and their confidence in their discipline’s ability to fix the world’s problems. Taken together, these traits constitute what we call the superiority of economists, where economists’ objective supremacy is intimately linked with their subjective sense of authority and entitlement. While this superiority has certainly fueled economists’ practical involvement and their considerable influence over the economy, it has also exposed them more to conflicts of interests, political critique, even derision.

A22|How Economics Faculty Can Survive (and Perhaps Thrive) in a Brave New Online World|"The academy in which we toil is moving rapidly towards a greater role for online delivery of higher education, and both fans and skeptics offer strong reasons to believe this technological shock will have substantial disruptive effects on faculty. How can we as economic educators continue to provide sufficient value-added to justify our role in a world where much of what we now do is effectively being automated and commoditized? In this brave new online world, many successful and resilient faculty will add value (and differentiate their product) not by producing costly and elaborate multimedia lectures in which they become a superstar professor-celebrity, but rather through careful, clever, and innovative choices regarding both the adoption of the online content of other providers and the forms of online interactions they integrate into their course designs. Possible forms of faculty-to-student and student-to-student interactions run the digital gamut from discussion boards and electronic testing to peer assessments, games and simulations, and virtual office hours. This article explores basic descriptive and prescriptive questions economic educators and their administrators are likely to face as the online education tide rises. For example, how much does it cost to develop online content and how much time does it take? What are the key ""ingredients"" for a pedagogically sound online course? Throughout, I will draw on both the extant literature as well as my own experience at the University of California, Irvine, where the online evolution is advancing rapidly.

A22|The Case of Strategic Management and Marketing Consulting for ATO: Doing Business in Tajikistan| This case offers students the simulation of providing consulting to a small, newly-formed and struggling dairy processor in the developing country of Tajikistan. The task is to conduct a profitability analysis using data provided by the firm. This can be accomplished by calculating the contribution margin of each product and estimating monthly break-even production levels for various scenarios. The information, combined with the background provided in the case, can be used to develop marketing and production strategies. Completing this analysis requires working with imperfect data and making appropriate assumptions. The case highlights the reality of challenges faced by small-scale agribusinesses in emerging economies.

A22|Normative Stakeholder Management Orientation: Business vs. Non-business Students|Using a sample of Spanish undergraduate students, this research contributes to stakeholder theory by developing empirical testing of normative stakeholder management orientation. It also offers empirical evidence on how the type of higher education received affects how individuals assess stakeholders’ interests. The results show that, in general, business students give less importance to the normative approach and consider it less necessary to take secondary stakeholders into account for a normative reason than their non-business counterparts do. Therefore, this study raises awareness on the influence of business education on individuals’ ethical decision-making process and suggests some possible changes for business teaching.
A22|Trading in Networks: a Classroom Experiment|This paper describes a classroom experiment that demonstrates coordination and competition between traders in a network.

A22|Using authentic materials in second language teaching|In bridging the gap between the classroom and the world outside, the teacher often makes use of authentic materials, which are examples of language that were not originally produced for language learning purposes but which are now being used in that way. The most important thing is not to confine ourselves to passively exploiting the authentic materials, but to integrate them into the various activities that develop the students’ communicative competence.
A22|ESP – Modern theories in management|Contemporary theories of management tend to account for and help interpret the rapidly changing nature of today’s organizational environment. This paper deals with several important modern theories in management. Among them we can mention: the Scientific Management School, the Classical Organizational Theory School, the Behavioural School, the Management Science School, as well as recent developments in management theory comprising works such as: Systems approach, Situational or Contingency theory, Chaos theory, and Team building approach. This discussion will provide a general description of some of the scholars in each of these management theories and the successes that they achieved in this field of activity.
A22|Considerations on English synonyms from a semantic point of view|This paper aims at analyzing the behaviour of semantic relations in context. We started our research considering G. Leech’s definition according to which synonyms are the result of intuition, on the one hand, but also of social, behavioural and psychological context, on the other. Context becomes very important in structuring the types of synonyms and in analyzing them at semantic level. The basic idea is that the synonymic relation cannot be total, but it depends on the context; two lexical items may be in a total synonymic relation in one context or more, but never in all. Differences may be of stylistic, register, emotional, dialectical nature, etc.
A22|The necessity of teaching functions in the foreign language class|The ultimate goal of the teaching-learning process in teaching foreign languages is to acquire that linguistic component, which involves not only the grammatical competence, the cultural competence, but also the communicative competence. Pragmatics is that part of grammar which studies the way language is used, namely the stylistic or rhetoric competence. The paper insists on the necessity of developing functions within the framework of the foreign language class, that is the communicative competence – the kind of accuracy and fluency that a native speaker has in conversation.
A22|Accounting Education and Its Place in the Romanian Economic Education Literature|This article aims to review the economic education literature in Romania for the period 2011-2013, focusing on finding the accounting related topics. For the purpose of the analysis, the 99 articles are categorized in four main sections that are divided by subsections. Over the reviewed period, more than 160 authors contributed to the enrichment of economic education literature in Romania, publishing their papers in journals indexed in databases journals. The analysis revealed a predominance of papers debating the teaching methods, both traditional and modern (including E-learning), Romanian researchers being preoccupied of improving the teaching process in order to achieve the best quality for academic services. However, the research revealed a scarcity of accounting education topics while management information systems education is better represented.
A22|Simple models to understand and teach business cycle macroeconomics for emerging market and developing economies|The canonical neoclassical model is insufficient to understand business cycle fluctuations in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs). I reformulate the models proposed by Aguiar and Gopinath (2007) and Neumeyer and Perri (2005) in simple settings that can be used to do back-of-the-envelope analysis and teach business cycle macroeconomics for EMDEs at the undergraduate level. The simplified models are employed for qualitatively explaining facts such as the countercyclicality of the trade balance and the real interest rate, and the higher volatility of output, consumption, and real wages compared with those observed in advanced countries. Simple extensions can be used to understand other empirical facts such as large capital outflows and output drops, small government spending he cyclical behavior of prices, and the negative association between currency depreciations and output.
A22|Does the Field of Study Influence Students' Political Attitudes?|We investigate whether the field of study influences university students’ political attitudes. To disentangle self-selection from learning effects, we first investigate whether the fields of study chosen by the incoming students correlate with their political attitudes. In a second step we explore how the political attitudes change as the students progress in their studies. Our results are based on a German pseudo-panel survey, the sample size of which exceeds that of comparable student surveys by an order of magnitude. We find systematic differences between the students’ political attitudes across eight fields of study. These differences can in most cases be attributed to self-selection. A notable exception is economics. Even though self-selection is also important, training in economics has an unambiguous influence on the political attitudes: by the time of graduation, economics students are about 6.2 percentage points more likely than they were as freshmen to agree with liberal-democratic policy positions.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
A22|Student evaluation based indicators of teaching excellence from a highly selective liberal arts college|The paper uses individual level data from each student that has enrolled in each class in the department in the last five years. Unlike several past studies that lack data on teaching quality measures Ordered Probit models reveal that the significant determinants of effective teaching, based on student evaluations of teaching (SET) are: organization, clarity of exposition, availability and enthusiasm of the instructor. The gender and race of the instructor is significant with female and non-white instructors being downgraded by students. The usual findings of expected grades inflating teaching evaluations are contested by the empirical evidence from this paper.
A22|Empirical assessment of e-learning on performance in principles of economics|This research assessed the effectiveness of online assignments in principles of macroeconomics classes. Students were divided into two groups where the first was required to submit online assignments (treatment) while the other was not (control). Standardized examinations were used as Pretest and Posttest to quantify the online assignments’ impact on students’ performance. Results showed no significant difference in performance between treatment and control groups. Furthermore, when looking closely at students’ performance within the treatment group, results indicate that neither the use of online assignments, nor the degree or intensity of their use tends to have significant impact on students’ performance.
A22|Numerical simulations of competition in quantities|We present a series of numerical simulation models built in Excel that can be used to explore the properties of various models of strategic competition in quantities and their economic implications. The resources incorporate both tabular and graphical data presentation formats and are built in such a way that they provide instant or ‘live’ feedback on the consequences of changes in the economic system. We discuss the theory behind the models, how they can be implemented as numerical simulations in Excel, and ways in which the simulations can be used to enhance student understanding of the material.
A22|Teaching the economic way of thinking through Op-eds|There are many goals an instructor may wish to accomplish in a course on economic principles. For us one goal should be the education of a generation of sensible and active members of civil society. This is an ambitious goal: it requires that students internalize the economic way of thinking and learn to exercise active citizenry. After experimenting with a variety of methods, we have concluded that requiring students to write an op-ed is the most conducive to the development of the economic way of thinking. Here we share what we have learned in the process, hoping that the pedagogical capability of writing an op-ed will encourage others to adopt the assignment into their classrooms.
A22|Virtual Learning Environments: Linking participation to evaluation|This paper considers the role of online multiple choice revision quizzes within the Virtual Learning Environment as a means of improving learning outcomes. A quiz was offered to 1st year undergraduates. Results were analysed to consider whether student participation improved performance. The analysis reveals little or no direct association between exam performance and participation, both at the mean and throughout the performance distribution, suggesting that the benefits from participation in on-line revision aids are not large. The use of such material needs to be made available judiciously since it may encourage displacement activity and provide little material benefit to the student.
A22|Engaging students using social media: The students’ perspective|Social media access and usage has grown rapidly in the past several years. In academia, social media is a new pedagogical tool that may be used to engage students both inside and outside the economics classroom, and impact their overall success. In this study we examine the students’ view of incorporating social media in the classroom. The survey was administered at three academic institutions. The results are based on a survey administered to students in Principles of Microeconomics and Macroeconomics courses. Students have the strongest presence, in descending order, on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter. However, based on their utilization preferences, these mediums are ranked as follows: Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. The results indicate that students are concerned with privacy but are more willing to connect with faculty if the connection is “one-way” and participate if social media is a voluntary part of class. Therefore Twitter, YouTube and Instagram, or Facebook “like” pages or groups are potentially better mediums for faculty to use in economic classrooms. The survey indicates that students use their social media accounts more frequently than email or Learning Management Systems and, therefore, social media may also be a more effective tool for spontaneous communication for many students.
A22|Reflections on the one-minute paper|This paper captures the perceptions of both a new academic and his students on the use of the one-minute paper (OMP). Much of the originality of this paper derives from the multi-layered qualitative approach which provides a deeper insight into the direct and indirect mechanism through which the OMP is perceived to work. This paper argues that, more than the prevailing literature suggests, in order to increase the benefits of using the OMP then considerable investment in time is required. The findings show that the academic’s cost in terms of time is greatest when asking ‘lecturer effectiveness’ type questions, but the benefits derived are potentially longer term than standard ‘lecture content’ based question. Students value the use of the OMP, principally because it demonstrates respect for them; this helps to create an atmosphere of trust, which can encourage engagement and an active approach to student learning. The research informs a discussion on how practical implementation techniques can be used to maximise the benefits and limit the costs.
A22|Flipping out about the flip: All hype or is there hope?|The flipped classroom was founded on student-centered pedagogy, with the idea that students retain more information by using active learning techniques during class compared to sitting in a lecture-based course. We implement a randomized experiment to quantify the effect of flipping on the learning outcomes of economics students. We compare standardized exam scores of students who experienced a flipped classroom to those who experienced a traditional classroom in principles of microeconomics courses. OLS regression results show that, following a negative adjustment period, students who experienced the flipped classroom scored significantly higher on midterm and final exams than did the control group. The magnitude of these effects suggests improvements in the students’ scores of a lower bound of two-thirds to an entire a letter grade.
A22|The impact of classroom demonstrations and online discussions on student achievement|While researchers have documented many benefits of various active learning activities, the relative effectiveness of such techniques is still up for debate in the literature. This paper analyses the results of a two-year study involving ten sections of microeconomics principles classes in which face-to-face lectures are supplemented with in-class pen-and-paper practice problems (the control group), in-class demonstrations, or online discussions. The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is used to measure learning outcomes. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) in-class demonstrations have a positive effect on student learning, with the exception of African–American students; (2) female students perform better having participated in online discussions; and (3) traditional pen-and-paper recitation questions “teach to the test” but do not impart as much economic intuition as the two alternative pedagogical methods.
A22|Gender Biases in Student Evaluations of Teachers|This paper uses a unique database from a French university to analyze gender biases in student evaluations of teachers (SETs). The results of generalized ordered logit regressions and fixed-effects models suggest that male teachers tend to receive higher SET scores because of students' gender biases. Male students in particular express a strong bias in their favor: male students are approximately 30% more likely to give an excellent overall satisfaction score to male teachers compared to female teachers. The different teaching dimensions that students value in men and women tend to correspond to gender stereotypes. The teaching dimensions for which students perceive a comparative advantage for women (such as course preparation and organization) tend to be more time-consuming for the teacher, compared to the teaching dimensions that students value more in men (such as class leadership skills). Men are perceived as being more knowledgeable (male gender stereotype) and obtain higher SET scores than women, but students appear to learn as much from women as from men, suggesting that female teachers are as knowledgeable as men. Finally, I find that if women increased students' continuous assessment grades by 7.5% compared to the grades given by their male colleagues, they could obtain similar overall satisfaction scores as men. Yet, women do not act on this incentive (men and women give similar continuous assessment grades), suggesting that female teachers are unaware of students' gender biases. These biases have strong negative consequences for female academics, who may spend more time on teaching to try to obtain high SET scores, reducing time available for research. The results suggest that better teaching is not necessarily measured by SETs.

A22|The Effect Of Personality On Academic Performance: Evidence From Two University Majors|Our study focuses on the effect of personality type and personality preferences measured by the Myersâ€“ Briggs typology, on higher education studentsâ€™ choice of profession and on their academic performance. We statistically analyzed a sample from two slightly similar bachelor majors studied at the University of Debrecen, Hungary, to reveal both the general and major-specific effects of personality. We have found that the most frequent types in both majors were ENFJ and ESFJ; however, differences were revealed in the relative frequencies in the ESTJ, ISTJ and ENFJ types. We identified significant differences between the majors in the average preferences along the introversion-extraversion scale and in the sensingintuition dichotomies (the latter was significant only for female students). We also found differences in the explanatory power of personality for the two majors and also in the types and preferences which contribute positively or negatively to academic success
A22|Can Assessment Improve How Personal Finance Is Taught?|This research finds the delivery of personal finance education varies. Often national and local providers carry out this education by using providers ranging from salespeople to not-for-profits. Each entity brings its own motivation and objective. As a result, the delivery model for financial education varies and lacks coordination leading it to be ineffective and inefficient. By understanding the motivators and goals of both providers and learners this study recommends a collaboration of efforts. This collaboration encourages national providers to focus less on curriculum development and more on improving the educational practices. Local providers are then able to provide education based on client needs. At the national and local level providers should engage in more assessment. This research contributes to current literature by reinforcing that planning and coordination of personal finance curriculum is important. It finds the need to value and respect each stakeholder is key to long-term success. It also encourages all parties to improve their efforts by managing change
A22|Graduated Students Labor Incursion: As An Element To Assess The Educational Relevance Incursion Laboral De Egresados: Como Elemento Para Evaluar La Pertinencia|This paper provides a longitudinal follow-up of graduates, in management and accounting. This report shows the main indicators related to labor trajectories and position in the labor market for students of the generation 2007-2011. Students were interviewed two years after discharge (2013), to assess the relevance of educational programs. The results indicate that before the end of the studies, two thirds of those studying management, have been incorporated in to the labor market in positions with medium or total coincidence with studies. Later, when they conclude their studies, about 75% get a job in less than a year. Regarding accounting graduates, before completing school, 80% have been incorporated in to the labor market, in positions with medium or total coincidence with the subject studied (77%). When they conclude their studies, 87% got a job in less than a year and the requirement that most influenced hiring was a formal interview (67%).
A22|Studentâ´S Satisfaction With Services Received In A University. Graduates Perceptions, Satisfaccion Estudiantil Sobre Servicios Recibidos En La Universidad: Percepcion De Egresados|Three generations of graduates of the Bachelorâ€™s degree were examined using in the Instrument for the satisfaction of college students with their education. Satisfaction levels are identified with educational services received during the process of formation. The results indicate that even if high levels of satisfaction are present, important areas of opportunity for the improvement processes in five of the ten subdimensiones explored exist.
A22|Actividad de patentamiento en el sector educativo superior en México, 1940-1970|México registró un crecimiento económico e industrial muy importante entre 1940 y 1970. Esta experiencia estuvo acompañada de un proceso interesante de creación y difusión de tecnologías como muestra la actividad de patentamiento nacional. Las organizaciones de educación superior establecidas en el país probablemente participaron de ese proceso, sin embargo, pocos esfuerzos se realizaron para generar y aplicar conocimiento con utilidad comercial como lo refleja su prácticamente nulo registro de patentes. En contraste, un cierto nivel de patentamiento se observó proveniente de universidades extranjeras, las cuales aprovecharon las condiciones económicas existentes. En este artículo presentamos un recuento de la actividad de patentamiento de estas organizaciones educativas, comprendiendo que la ausencia de patentes por las organizaciones de educación superior mexicanas fue el resultado de los incentivos establecidos por la ley de patentes de la época, los cuales obstaculizaron o fomentaron muy débilmente la propensión a patentar de estas organizaciones/ México registered a major economic and industrial expansion between 1940 and 1970. This experience was accompanied by an interesting process of creation and diffusion of technologies as shown national patenting activity. Educational organizations established in the country were probably part of that process, but they made few efforts to generate and apply commercial knowledge, as is shown for their virtually inexistent patent record. In contrast, a certain level of patenting was observed from foreign colleges which took advantage of existing economic conditions. In this paper we present an account of the patenting activity of these educational organizations, realizing that the absence of patents by Mexican schools was a result of the incentives provided by the patent law of the time, incentives that hindered or weakly promoted the propensity to patent of these organizations.

A22|Flipping Out! A Case Study on How to Flip the Principles of Economics Classroom|The benefits of active learning are well established. Nevertheless, many instructors are unable to implement active learning in the classroom due to pressures to cover many core topics in a principles course. This paper discusses a pedagogical tool that addresses this problem: the flipped classroom. In a flipped classroom, students are asked to study classroom material prior to class, allowing more class time to be used for active learning activities such as group discussion, problem solving, and experiments. This paper reports on our experience “flipping” a large enrollment (900+ students) microeconomic principles classroom using a methodology that was enhanced over the course of several years. Students were assigned to watch multimedia pre-lectures which included embedded questions prior to attending each lecture which then focused on active learning activities. Using empirical data collected from our semester-long case study, we provide an argument for best practices aimed at improving the effectiveness of a flipped classroom model to increase student learning outcomes.

A22|Bridging the Classroom Gap between Asset Pricing and Business Cycle Theory|The tools presented in the standard undergraduate economics and finance curricula are insufficient for explaining the complex dynamics of the modern U.S. economy. For instance, students of macroeconomics are not provided with a satisfactory framework for assessing how a financial shock may reverberate through the real economy, as it did during the Great Recession of 2008-2009. Similarly, students of finance are left with little guidance as to the origins of two key inputs into asset pricing models, namely cash flows and discount rates. In this article we present a unified macro-financial model to bridge the gap between the typical undergraduate treatments of asset pricing and business cycle theory. The Dynamic Empirical Macroeconomic (DyEM) model we introduce here offers several innovations, the most important of which is expanding the role of the interest rate to include term and default risk premia. We combine these elements to construct a series of discount rates that are critical for a range of present discounted value calculations. Moreover, we link economic activity to earnings growth in order to facilitate macro-based equity pricing. The paper concludes with an illustration of how the DyEM model may be used in the classroom via a cooperative learning exercise centered on the Great Recession.

A22|Business Education and Idealism as Determinants of Stakeholder Orientation|This paper based on the distinction between the instrumental and normative views of stakeholder management explores how business education and personal moral philosophies may influence the orientation adopted by an individual. A mediated regression analysis using survey information collected from 206 Spanish university students showed that those exposed to management theories were less willing to consider stakeholders when making business decisions if the consequent economic impacts on the firm were omitted. The results also provided support for a negative effect of business education on idealism and a mediating effect of the latter on the relationship between education and stakeholder management orientation. This study thus raises awareness on the influence of business education on individuals’ ethical decision-making processes and suggests some possible changes for business education.

A22|Practical Approach to International Business Studies in English at Polish Universities|The subject of this paper is the presentation of BA and MA International Business (IB) studies in English as a new practice on the Polish educational market. The main objective of this paper is to examine the IB studies programmes in English at the University of Gdansk - (UG) and to present the practical approach of their functioning combined with some recommendations. The results show that the UG has established competitive and attractive programmes, although at lower cost levels compared to universities in other countries where the IB studies have longer tradition and good reputation. It is considered that IB studies cement the international position of UG. This article presents both quantitative and qualitative data.
A22|On Teaching Production Theory: Integrating Short-Run and Long-Run Analysis|The microeconomic theory of production is typically presented to undergraduates in a way that leaves many students with a disjointed view of the subject. The short run is described as one kind of world, in which the firm pursues one set of objectives, commonly identified as “optimal factor employment.” The long run, on the other hand, is depicted as a very different kind of world, in which the firm pursues a different set of objectives, known as “optimal factor combination.” The purpose of this essay is to bring together familiar diagrammatic tools in a way that allows instructors to integrate short-run and long-run principles of factor employment.
A22|Supply Locus: A Note on the Supply Decisions of Monopolistic Firms|This note introduces the concept of the supply locus to describe the systematic supply responses of monopolistic firms to changes in demand. While in general the supply locus is not unique, it is shown that it is unique in the empirically interesting cases of a) a linear demand that shifts in a parallel fashion, and b) a constant elasticity exponential demand that shifts in a way that preserves its elasticity.
A22|The Impact of Question Order on Multiple Choice Exams on Student Performance in an Unconventional Introductory Economics Course|We investigate the effect of question order on multiple-choice exams on students’ performance in an unconventional introductory economics course. The course is an introduction to the global economy and comprises elements of principles of economics, introductory international trade and introductory international finance. The tests in two sections of the course were administered in four versions. On one of the versions, multiple-choice questions are ordered according to the order in which course material was offered, while questions on the other versions are randomly scrambled. Our empirical analysis reveals no statistically significant effect of question order on students’ grades.
A22|A Closer Look at the Relationship between Grades and Teacher Evaluation: The Role of Grade Knowledge|Economic behavior theory was used to frame an investigation of the role of grade knowledge in student ratings of professors. A two-group experiment was conducted in which one group had midterm exams and thus received grade feedback before completing student evaluations of teaching (SET), while the other group did not have a midterm exam and thus had no specific grade knowledge before completing the SET. Both groups had a final exam and received exam feedback after the SET was administered. Results revealed that only in the midterm condition were grades significantly associated with SET. That is, SET is more strongly related to grades when students have had clear grade feedback prior to SET administration, implying that both students and professors engage in economic behavior and that a reciprocal relationship exists between students and professors. Moreover, two implied debatable issues on this topic are briefly discussed in the conclusion.
A22|Popularität Der Erasmus-Stipendien Unter Wirtschaftsstudenten. Vergleichende Studie Großwardein (Rumänien), Debrecen (Ungarn) Und Prešov (Die Slowakei)|Present study is the extension of a former study upon Erasmus programmes and students’ attitude towards opening perspectives at the University of Oradea, Romania (the author’s institution of affiliation) and thus overtakes parts and results of it enriching them with findings and conclusions of an extended research. In a world of intensified cross-cultural relations it would be of great importance that young people ‒ especially those in academic environments ‒ gain some international experience, get to know during their college period other cultures and socio-economic systems than theirs. The Erasmus programmes of the European Committee could give them due to the financial support they suppose the opportunity to live the experience of studying or doing practice in a company abroad and thus to extend their personal and professional horizon. Romania takes part in Erasmus programmes since 1998 and in the last two and a half decades sent more than 38,000 students on Erasmus study or placement mobility. It is a nice number but still too little related to the overall number of Erasmus scholarships academic institutions could dispose of yearly. By conducting a comparative study upon the relation between offer and demand at corresponding faculties of three academic institutions, the above mentioned University of Oradea, University of Debrecen, Hungary and University of Prešov, Slovakia one may realize that the situation is quite similar in all the three academic environments: Erasmus programmes don’t represent in general main attraction for students. The analysed study domains are: technique, economics, medicine/pharmacy/health care, history, political and communication sciences. The most interested in an international experience, in Romania and Hungary at least according to data of some academic years, prove to be medicine students who applied 2013-2014 in Oradea for about 44% and 2011-2012 in Debrecen for 80% of the scholarships offered. Slovakian students studying health care at the University of Prešov are leading in this respect, as the number of applications exceeded in the period 2011-2014 that of the places available. Why economic students at all the three institutions show in general little or moderate interest for Erasmus programmes, we have tried to find out by means of a questionnaire pointing to the main causes for applying/not applying for an Erasmus scholarship. The answers given by the over 120 students questioned at each institution correspond partially with the author’s initial suppositions and show main directions for counterbalancing and actions to be taken to increase visibility, feasibility and popularity of Erasmus programmes among students.

A22|From Solow to Romer: Teaching endogenous technological change in undergraduate economics|Undergraduate students learn economic growth theory through the seminal Solow model, which takes the growth rate of technology as given. To understand the origin of technological progress, we need a model of endogenous technological change. The Romer model fills this important gap in the literature. However, given its complexity, undergraduate students often find the Romer model difficult. This paper proposes a simple method of teaching the Romer model. We add three layers of structure (one at a time) to extend the familiar Solow model into the less familiar Romer model. First, we incorporate a competitive market structure into the Solow model. Then, we modify the competitive market structure into a monopolistic market structure. Finally, we introduce an R&D sector that invents new products.
A22|Assessing the impact of just-in-time methodology, in-lecture activities, and tutor-assisted post-lecture activities in the course experience of first year students in Economics at the University of Pretoria|This paper focuses on the introduction of blended-learning as applied to lectures in a large first year economics course at the University of Pretoria. The blended learning methodology was aligned with the flipped-classroom approach where the traditional classroom is overturned via interactive student engagement activities. Lectures take place partially or fully outside the classroom via pre-lecture videos, reading assignments and/or podcasts. Lecture time is utilized to assist students in deep learning by doing exercises, peer evaluations and encouraging class discussions. Post-lecture activities consist of consolidation quizzes, assignments and peer networking through social media.Blended-learning was introduced in the principles of economics course at the Department of Economics in the University of Pretoria in 2012; this paper reports the results for the second semester in 2013 and the first semester in 2014. It was found that students experienced the blended-learning methodology as beneficial in helping them understand basic concepts in economics.
A22|Reforma curricular de Ingeniería Comercial en la U. de Chile: ¿Abrimos o no abrimos la mirada?|Un primer balance descriptivo y dinámico de las mallas curriculares para la Mención Economía de Ingeniería Comercial permite comparar los avances de las distintas universidades que la imparten. Con la Reforma Curricular (RC) implementada el 2012, la U. de Chile (UCH) acortó la carrera, fortaleció la formación en métodos cuantitativos, amplió el espacio electivo y la formación integral, reduciendo la cantidad de horas destinadas a teoría económica. De esta manera, la RC de la UCH refleja un interés genuino por orientar dicha mención en dirección al pluralismo, lo que se entiende por “abrir la mirada”. Igualmente resulta fundamental comenzar a pensar en instancias de largo plazo para la elaboración de una malla curricular verdaderamente pluralista y democrática.
A22|Enseñanza de la economía en la Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile: Un análisis comparativo|El presente artíceulo busca responder cómo son formados los estudiantes de economía en la Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. A través del análisis de la malla curricular, se realizan comparaciones con respecto a otras universidades en Chile que se dedican a la enseñanza de la economía. Los resultados reflejan un alto porcentaje de esfuerzos dedicados a la formación en administración, en contraste a otras universidades, y un bajo porcentaje de cursos que abordan humanidades y ciencias sociales. Destaca la amplia cantidad de optativos de profundización y el debate en torno a la ética. Se sugiere como medida principal adelantar y potenciar la mención para agregar amplitud y profundidad de contenidos a los alumnos del área de economía.
A22|La formación académica de la economía en Chile: Experiencia de la Universidad de Santiago de Chile|Entendiendo la relevancia de reflexionar sobre la formación de los economistas, el presente artículo analiza la malla curricular vigente de Ingeniería Comercial mención Economía en la Universidad de Santiago, comparándola con su versión anterior y con las homólogas de las universidades del país que imparten la carrera. Se observa un énfasis en Matemáticas y Ciencias Sociales, mientras que las áreas Electivos de Especialidad y Administración quedan relegadas. Se anota la ausencia de ramos de Realidad Nacional, Historia del Pensamiento Económico, Filosofía Política y Epistemología, teniendo en consideración que otras universidades sí poseen estos ramos. Como recomendación, se propone aprovechar los Electivos de especialidad para suplir esas carencias.
A22|La no-reforma curricular en Ingeniería Comercial, Universidad de Concepción|Este artículo busca conocer cómo está compuesta la enseñanza de Ingeniería Comercial con Licenciatura en Ciencias Económicas de la Universidad de Concepción, analizando su plan curricular y el proceso de cambio de malla ocurrido recientemente con el objetivo de observar el nivel de pluralismo existente en su malla curricular y también comparar éste con otras universidades de Chile. En los resultados se observa que el cambio curricular realizado, esperado por más de una década, no fue el que se esperaba. Persiste la predominancia de Administración en la Licenciatura en Ciencias Económicas y en comparación con otras universidades la Universidad de Concepción es una de las que tiene mayor presencia en esta área. Una propuesta interesante de cambio estructural es que entre docentes y estudiantes se decida incorporar diferentes áreas de humanidades y ciencias sociales relacionadas a la economía en los planes curriculares, en miras de una formación económica más completa.
A22|La enseñanza de economía en una Universidad Jesuita: Un análisis comparativo|El objetivo es analizar la formación de los estudiantes de economía de la Universidad Alberto Hurtado. Dentro de la malla curricular existen vacíos con respecto a áreas como Filosofía, Ciencias Sociales o Realidad Nacional, en comparación con otras universidades donde se imparte la línea de economía dentro de la carrera de Ingeniería Comercial. A pesar de este déficit humanista, la carrera está muy bien posicionada con respecto a la formación ética. Se concluye que existe una necesidad de realizar cambios en la malla curricular que permitan una mayor interacción con otras disciplinas y corrientes de pensamiento. Si estos hechos motivan una reflexión seria, es importante que los diversos actores tengan una participación activa y cooperativa en el proceso.
A22|La UDP con nueva malla curricular, ¿Nueva economía o más de lo mismo?|El presente trabajo nos muestra la distribución de la nueva mención de la UDP con dirección a economía, permitiendo al lector comprender si realmente en Chile las universidades están respondiendo a un nuevo enfoque de enseñanza o si por el contrario los cambios no están respondiendo en la dirección apropiada. A grandes rasgos y como veremos se aprecia la inclusión de ramos en las categorías de micro y macroeconomía, pero se sigue manteniendo una fuerte cantidad de ramos administrativos para los estudiantes que egresan de la línea de economía. Se considera muy positivo la inclusión de cursos de la línea Cultura y Entorno. Se plantea finalmente la posibilidad de incluir ramos en áreas inexistentes en la malla como son Historia Económica, Ética y Epistemología, y que sí se encuentran presentes en otras universidades que ofrecen la mención economía dentro de Ingeniería Comercial.
