D11|Income Effects and Rationalizability in Multinomial Choice Models|In multinomial choice settings, Daly-Zachary (1978) and Armstrong-Vickers (2015) provided closedform conditions, under which choice probability functions can be rationalized via random utility models. A key condition is Slutsky symmetry. We first show that in the multinomial context, Daly-Zachary’s Slutsky symmetry is equivalent to absence of income-effects. Next, for general multinomial choice that allows for income-effects, we provide global shape restrictions on choice probability functions, which are shown to be sufficient for rationalizability. Finally, we outline nonparametric identification of preference distributions using these results. The theory of linear partial differential equations plays a key role in our analysis.
D11|Consumer Privacy and Serial Monopoly|We examine the implications of consumer privacy when preferences today depend upon past consumption choices, and consumers shop from different sellers in each period. Although consumers are ex ante identical, their initial consumption choices cannot be deterministic. Thus ex post heterogeneity in preferences arises endogenously. Consumer privacy improves social welfare, consumer surplus and the profits of the second-period seller, while reducing the profits of the first period seller, relative to the situation where consumption choices are observed by the later seller.
D11|Optimal monetary policy under bounded rationality|Optimal monetary policy under discretion, commitment, and optimal simple rules regimes is analyzed through a behavioral New Keynesian model. Flexible price level targeting dominates under discretion; flexible inflation targeting dominates under commitment; and strict price level targeting dominates when using optimal simple rules. The optimality of a particular regime is found to be independent of bounded rationality and only regime 's stabilizing properties condition its hierarchy. For every targeting regime, the policymaker 's knowledge of agents' myopia is decisive in terms of policy reactions. Welfare evaluation of different targeting regimes reveals that bounded rationality is not necessarily associated with decreased welfare. Several forms of economic inattention can increase welfare.
D11|Optimal Non-Linear Pricing Scheme when Consumers are Habit Forming|This article analyses how consumers' habit formation affects firms' pricing policies. We consider both sophisticated consumers, who realize that their current consumption will affect future consumption, and naive consumers, who do not. The optimal contract for sophisticated consumers is a two-part tariff. The main result is that under naive habit formation, the optimal pricing pattern is a three-part tariff; namely a fixed fee, with some units priced below cost --- and after their end --- pricing above marginal cost. This holds both under symmetric and asymmetric information.
D11|Blurred Boundaries: A Flexible Approach for Segmentation Applied to the Car Market|Prominent features of differentiated product markets are segmentation and product proliferation that blurs the boundaries between segments. I develop a tractable demand model, the Ordered Nested Logit, which allows for asymmetric substitution between segments. I apply the model to the automobile market where segments are ordered from small to luxury. I find that consumers, when substituting outside their vehicle segment, are more likely to switch to a neighboring segment. Accounting for such asymmetric substitution matters when evaluating the impact of new product introduction or the effect of subsidies on fuel-efficient cars.
D11|Dynamic Rationally Inattentive Discrete Choice: A Posterior-Based Approach|We adopt the posterior-based approach to study dynamic discrete choice problems with rational inattention. We show that the optimal solution for the Shannon entropy case is characterized by a system of equations that resembles the dynamic logit rule. We propose an efficient algorithm to solve this system and apply our model to explain phenomena such as status quo bias, confirmation bias, and belief polarization. We also study the dynamics of consideration sets. Unlike the choice-based approach, our approach applies to general uniformly posteriorseparable information cost functions. A key condition for our approach to work in dynamic models is the convexity of the difference between the discounted generalized entropy of the prior beliefs about the future states and the generalized entropy of the current posterior.
D11|Demand Cycles and Heterogeneous Conformity Preferences|The paper analyzes the dynamics of demand for three options when agents differ in their preferences for conformity. Each agent seeks to imitate others who are more individualistic and to distinguish herself from others who are more conformist, relative to herself. In each period, every agent chooses her utility-maximizing option given each agent's demand in the previous period. It is shown that for a large class of initial demand distributions, demand dynamics resemble fashion cycles: Total demand for each option over time is wave-like, and, when positively demanded, an option trickles through the entire population, from individualistic towards conformist agents.
D11|Nonhomothetic preferences and rent sharing in an open economy|We develop a framework for studying how differences in the level and/or dispersion of per-capita income affect trade structure and welfare in a two-country model. Thereby, we embed nonhomothetic preferences into a home-market model with two sectors of production and one input factor. We associate the outside good with a necessity and the differentiated good with a luxury, and we assume that heterogeneity of income arises due to heterogeneity of households in their effective labor supply. We then show that in line with the home-market effect countries have a trade surplus in the good for which they have relatively higher domestic demand, making the country with a higher level and/or dispersion of per-capita income a net-exporter of luxuries. The structure of trade is irrelevant for welfare in the open economy if both sectors pay the same wage. If, however, the sector producing luxuries pays a wage premium due to rent sharing, there are feedback effects of trade on the level and dispersion of per-capita income, which can lead to losses from trade in the country net-exporting necessities. In an extension of our model, we show that our results remain intact when we allow for positive assortative matching of workers featuring high effective labor supply with jobs offering high wages in the sector of luxuries. In a second extension, we show that the assumption of nonhomothetic preferences seems less important when supply-side differences are the main motive for inter-industry trade.
D11|Taxes on Unhealthy Food and Externalities in the Parental Choice of Children's Diet|This paper addresses the question whether taxes on unhealthy food are suitable for internalizing intergenerational externalities inflicted by parents when they decide on their children’s diet. Within an OLG model with an imperfectly altruistic parent, the optimal steady state tax rate on unhealthy food is strictly positive. However, it is only second best since it not only reduces food consumption of the child but also distorts the parent's food consumption. Surprisingly, the optimal tax may under- or overinternalize the marginal damage.
D11|A Note on Moral Licensing and Foot-In-The-Door Effect|Literature in economics and psychology on moral behaviour explores the contexts in which people act in ways that are consistent or inconsistent with their past actions. Such inconsistencies appear to violate economists' assumption of rational consumer behaviour. In this note we show that a simple model of rational (utility-maximising) consumer behaviour, in both static and dynamic forms, can explain both consistent and inconsistent behaviour.
D11|Mutually Consistent Revealed Preference Demand Predictions|Revealed preference restrictions are increasingly used to predict demand behaviour at new budgets of interest and as shape restrictions in nonparametric estimation exercises. However, the restrictions imposed are not sufficient for rationality when predictions are made at multiple budgets. I highlight the nonconvexities in the set of predictions that arise when making multiple predictions. I develop a mixed integer programming characterisation of the problem that can be used to impose rationality on multiple predictions. The approach is applied to the UK Family Expenditure Survey to recover rational demand predictions with substantially reduced computational resources compared to known alternatives.
D11|Consumer Privacy and Serial Monopoly|We examine the implications of consumer privacy when preferences today depend upon past consumption choices, and consumers shop from different sellers in each period. Although consumers are ex ante identical, their initial consumption choices cannot be deterministic. Thus ex post heterogeneity in preferences arises endogenously. Consumer privacy improves social welfare, consumer surplus and the profits of the second-period seller, while reducing the profits of the first period seller, relative to the situation where consumption choices are observed by the later seller.
D11|Intersectoral linkages: Good shocks, bad outcomes?|We analyze multisector models with endogenous product variety and derive general results on the magnitude of welfare changes due to sector-specific price shocks. Intersectoral linkages magnify or dampen these shocks, depending on complementarity or substitutability in consumers' preferences. Under the widely used combination of Cobb-Douglas-CES utilities and monopolistic competition, intersectoral linkages disappear. This does not hold with more general preferences or market structures, where sector-specific price shocks that are a priori welfare improving can turn out to be welfare worsening economy-wide. We illustrate this result with several examples, in particular where one sector is 'granular' and the other is monopolistically competitive.
D11|Keynes's Investment Theory as a Micro-foundation for his Grandchildren|In contrast with the ‘missing micro-foundations’ argument against Keynes’s macroeconomics, the paper argues that it is the present state of microeconomics that needs more solid ‘Keynesian foundations’. It is in particular Keynes’s understanding of investors’ behaviour that can be fruitfully extended to consumption theory, in a context in which consumers are considered as entrepreneurs, buying goods and services to engage in time-consuming activities. The paper emphasizes that the outcome in terms of enjoyment is particularly uncertain for those innovative and path-breaking activities, which Keynes discussed in his 1930 prophetic essay about us, the grandchildren of his contemporaries. Moreover, the Keynes-inspired microeconomics suggested in the paper provides an explanation of why Keynes’s prophecy about his grandchildren possibly expanding leisure did not materialize yet. The paper finally points at the need for appropriate economic policies supporting consumers’ propensity to enforce innovative forms of time use.
D11|Escalation and Well-being|Escalation is a key characteristic of many consumption behaviors that has not received the theoretical attention it deserves. The aim of this paper is to propose both a definition and a theoretical treatment of escalation in consumption. We shall define escalation as the attempt to engage in consumption acts that are “more intense” on a measurable quantitative or qualitative, objective or subjective, scale (more difficult ski slopes, stronger drugs, harder sex, better restaurants, riskier games, etc.), even if, previously, the subject preferred less intense consumption behaviors. Further, this evolution in preferences also occurs if the budget constraint does not change. We will find endogenous and exogenous theoretical microfoundations for escalation in models of hedonic adaptation, desire for novelty, acquisition of consumption skills, rising aspirations, positional effects, and envy. However, we will also discuss the possibility that the tendency to escalate is a specific innate behavior inherent to human nature. Finally, we will propose a preliminary theoretical formalization of such behavior and indicate the possible implications of taking escalation into adequate consideration.
D11|Can the environment be an inferior good? A theory with context-dependent substitutability and needs|Theoretical models often assume the environment to be a normal good, irrespective of one’s income. However, a priori, nothing prohibits an environmental good from being normal for some individuals and inferior for others. We develop a conceptual framework in which private consumption and an environmental public good act as substitutes or com-plements for satisfying different needs. Subsequently, the environment can switch between normal and inferior depending on one’s income and environment. If the environment is in-ferior for some range of income, then the willingness to pay for environmental preservation becomes non-monotonic, thereby having implications for benefit transfers.
D11|Estimating the Benefits of New Products|A major challenge facing statistical agencies is the problem of adjusting price and quantity indexes for changes in the availability of commodities. This problem arises in the scanner data context as products in a commodity stratum appear and disappear in retail outlets. Hicks suggested a reservation price methodology for dealing with this problem in the context of the economic approach to index number theory. Feenstra and Hausman suggested specific methods for implementing the Hicksian approach. The present paper evaluates these approaches and suggests some alternative approaches to the estimation of reservation prices. The various approaches are implemented using some scanner data on frozen juice products that are available online.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D11|Income Growth and the Distributional Effects of Urban Spatial Sorting|We explore the impact of rising incomes at the top of the distribution on spatial sorting patterns within large U.S. cities. We develop and quantify a spatial model of a city with heterogeneous agents and nonhomothetic preferences for locations with different amenities of endogenous quality. As the rich get richer, their increased demand for luxury amenities available downtown drives housing prices up in downtown areas. The poor are made worse off, either being displaced or paying higher rents for amenities that they do not value as much. Endogenous provision of private amenities amplifies the mechanism, while public provision of other amenities in part curbs it. We quantify the corresponding impact on well-being inequality. Through the lens of the quantified model, the change in the income distribution between 1990 and 2014 led to neighborhood change and spatial resorting within urban areas that increased the welfare of richer households relative to that of poorer households by an additional 1.7 percentage points on top of their differential income growth.
D11|Toward a Framework for Time Use, Welfare, and Household Centric Economic Measurement|What is meant by economic progress, and how should it be measured? The conventional answer is growth in real GDP over time or compared across countries, a monetary measure adjusted for the general rate of increase in prices. However, there is increasing interest in developing an alternative understanding of economic progress, particularly in the context of digitalization of the economy and the consequent significant changes Internet use is bringing about in production and household activity. This paper discusses one alternative approach, combining an extended utility framework considering time allocation over paid work, household work, leisure, and consumption with measures of objective or subjective well-being while engaging in different activities. Developing this wider economic welfare measure would require the collection of time use statistics as well as well-being data and direct survey evidence, such as the willingness to pay for leisure time. We advocate an experimental set of time and well-being accounts, with a particular focus on the digitally driven shifts in behavior.
D11|Lost in translation: What do Engel curves tell us about the cost of living?| The Hamilton method for estimating CPI bias is simple, intuitive, and has been widely adopted. We show that the method conflates CPI bias with variation in cost-of-living across income levels. Assuming a single price index across the income distribution is inconsistent with the downward sloping Engel curves that are necessary to implement the method. We develop and implement the Translated Engel curve (TEC) method that disentangles genuine CPI bias from differences caused by comparing changes in the cost of living across different income levels - non-homotheticity. The TEC method gives substantially different estimates of CPI bias prior to major reforms to the CPI in 1999 (post-Boskin), but both methods suggest very little CPI bias thereafter.
D11|Measuring consumer inflation in a digital economy|The effect on the household consumption price index from possible sources of error in capturing digital products depends on the weight of the affected products. To calculate upper bounds for this effect, we apply weights based on the average structure of household consumption in OECD countries to a maximum plausible overstatement of price change for each affected or potentially affected product. The products account for about 35% of household expenditure in 2005, declining to 32% in 2015. The upper bound simulation effect on the growth rate of the consumption deflator is somewhat less than –0.6 percentage points in 2015 – large enough to improve the picture of GDP and productivity growth in advanced economies. However, this would not overturn the conclusion that productivity growth has slowed substantially compared over the past decades.
D11|Why Is Executive Compensation So High? A Model of Executive Compensation|In this paper, I examine the mechanism of extremely high executive compensation based on the concept of ranking value and preference, and show that the origin of such extremely high compensation is economic rents. Ranking value and preference provide monopoly powers, profits, and rents to producers and generate “superstars” who are not only absolutely but, more importantly, are relatively superior to other executives. Furthermore, ranking value and preference enable a firm’s product to be differentiated and provide the firm monopoly rents (profits). Executives who contribute to differentiating the product can obtain economic rents and be compensated similar to superstars on professional sports teams. The monopoly rents owing to ranking values can be socially justified, but they may not be socially justifiable if they are solely distributed to executives.
D11|Role of product promotion on consumers buying behaviors|The present research is focusing on the impact of product promotion on consumer’s buying behaviors. Brand image, persuasiveness and celebrity endorsement in the Promotion are the key factors, which raise the consumers’ intentions towards the product and buying behaviors. The buying behavior is strongly influenced by image of the product, which is built by the advertisers. The primary data of the study is collected through questionnaires and secondary data was collected through internet, journals and business magazines. A sample of 80 respondents was taken. The study explores that a creative and well-executed advertisement has always a great impact on the buying trends or purchasing behaviors of the consumers. At the same time quality of the product and price are also included with their strong impact on buying behavior of consumer. Likewise, to some extent the celebrity endorsement also matters in the buying behavior. Therefore, the study concludes that the positive impact of all these factors, on the buying behavior of the consumer proves the loyalty of consumer towards brand which helps in promotion of the advertised product and changes the buying behavior towards buying intentions.
D11|Demand and equilibrium with inferior and Giffen behaviors|We introduce a class of differentiable, strictly increasing, strictly concave utility functions exhibiting an explicit demand of a good which may have Giffen behavior. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition (bases on prices and consumers’ preferences and income) under which this good is normal, inferior or Giffen good. Interestingly, with this utility, the equilibrium price of a good may increase in the aggregate supply for this good.
D11|Consumption-leisure complementarity versus income elasticity of demand under equilibrium price dispersion|If the time horizon for consumption is divided between labor, search, and leisure, the search represents any activity, which decreases labor costs of the purchase price. The search costs are allocated between pre-purchase search and after-purchase treatment of the bought item, including shopping and home production. While these activities reduce leisure time and might be pleasurable, the search does not enter directly into the consumption-leisure utility function. The search determines the equilibrium price reduction, which creates marginal savings on purchase and serves as the part of the budget constraint to the optimal consumption-leisure choice under the equilibrium price dispersion. In this way the search provides both the consumption-leisure substitutability and complementarity. The income elasticity of demand produces the trade-off between efficiency and pleasure for both pre-purchase search and after-purchase treatment. The search for inelastic demand is very efficient in malls while the search for elastic demand is more pleasurable either like the habit of leisurely shopping in boutiques or in the form of the willingness to take care of purchased big-ticket items. The trade-off between efficiency and pleasure of the after-purchase treatment including home production becomes clear on the analytical level of the attributes of the purchased item when the demand for cars is analyzed as the demand for mileage, the demand for trees in gardening is observed like the demand for fruits, and the demand for vinyl disks depends on number of records of songs and symphonies. The income elastic demand of attributes hides the shift from the “common model” of behavior to the “leisure model” when consumers purchase excessive and unnecessary quantity of attributes that gets the negative marginal utility of consumption.
D11|Saving and dissaving under Ramsey - Rawls criterion|This article studies an inter-temporal optimization problem using a criterion which is a combination between Ramsey and Rawls criteria. A detailed description of the saving behaviour through time is provided. The optimization problem under $\alpha-$\emph{maximin} criterion is also considered with optimal solution characterized.
D11|Persamaan Dan Perbedaan Perilaku Konsumen Dalam Ekonomi Konvensional Dan Hukum Ekonomi Islam|The equation between consumer behavior in carrying out consumption activities in conventional economics and Islamic economics is three. Among them in terms of understanding, philosophical foundation, motives and purpose of consumption, and the theory of consumer behavior. Meanwhile, differences in consumer behavior in conventional economics and Islamic economics, first, lie in the foundation of consumer behavior philosophy. Conventional economics views that world life is an absolute right for humans while Islamic economics teaches that world life is based on the principle of accountability to the Creator. Second, lies in the principle of consumption. There are three principles of consumption in a conventional economy, namely freedom, self-interest, and material. Islamic economic perspective, consumer behavior is based on the philosophy of divinity so that in each of its activities meeting the needs of consumers is required to always be guided by the principles of tawhid and also justice. The principle teaches individuals the moral awareness to live in obedience by worshiping Allah, and is responsible for everything he does, especially in terms of consumption

D11|Social Loss with Respect to the Core of an Economy with Externalities|We consider a pure exchange economy with externalities. We adopt a cooperative approach to equilibrium analysis, allowing each individual to cooperate with others and to form coalitions. Individual preferences are affected by the consumption of all other agents in the economy, and the consumption set of each agent is affected by the coalition to which he/she belongs. Following Montesano (2002), we introduce a measure of social loss with respect to the gamma-core and alpha-core of the economy which completely characterizes the corresponding core allocations.

D11|In-kind transfers in Brazil: household consumption and welfare effects|Programa de AlimentaÃ§Ã£o dos Trabalhadores (PAT) creates tax incentives for firms to provide 20 million workers with in-kind transfers in Brazil. Economic theory supports they are distortive when compared to cash transfers but this is not clear when the latter are subject to payroll taxes. Using a propensity score analysis we find evidence that PAT increases poor households food consumption between 15.7% and 25.0% and deadweight loss associated with distortions reach US$63.1 (R$150.1) million. Overconsumption, however, may not be increasing workerâ€™s nutrition, as aimed by the program.
D11|Just-noticeable difference as a behavioural foundation of the critical cost-efficiency index|Critical cost-efficiency index (or CCEI), proposed in Afriat (1973) and Varian (1990), is one of the most commonly used measures of departures from rationality. We show that this index is equivalent to a particular notion of the just-noticeable difference, that is, a measure of dissimilarity between alternatives that is sufficient for the agent to tell them apart. Therefore, we show that CCEI evaluates the consumer's cognitive inability to discriminate among options.

Hicks suggested a reservation price methodology for dealing with this problem in the context of the economic approach to index number theory.

D11|Experimental Economics and the New Commodities Problem|Brynjolfsson, Collis, Diewert, Eggers and Fox (2018) have used experimental economics to measure the welfare benefits of free commodities. In this paper, their methodological approach is adapted to measuring the benefits of new commodities which may or may not be free. Their approach leads to a new method for estimating Hicksian reservation prices. The new methodology in the present paper requires experimental estimates for household willingness to pay for new commodities or estimates for the compensation required for households to give up their use of a new commodity.
D11|Price Discrimination and Salient Thinking|This paper generalizes the price discrimination framework of Mussa and Rosen (1978) by considering salience-driven consumer preferences in the sense of Bordalo et al. (2013b). Consumers with salience-driven preferences give a higher weight to attributes that vary more. This reduces the monopolist's propensity to treat different types of consumers differently. The paper's main result characterizes the conditions under which the monopolist induces consumers to focus on price rather than on quality.
D11|Adoption of e-commerce by individuals and digital divide: Evidence from Spain|E-commerce penetration rates are distant among those groups of individuals with the lowest and the highest levels of online shopping adoption. This is an indicator of digital divide, having negative effects in terms of untapped opportunities for people, companies and the whole economy. Key socioeconomic and demographic determinants of adoption of ecommerce are explored, analyzing a dataset of 174,776 observations for the period 2008-2017 in Spain. The empirical analysis is based on a standard neoclassical utility maximization framework. Linear probability model, logistic regression, and Heckman’s sample selection correction model have been used. The results suggest that e-commerce adoption is positively related with being male, having higher levels of education, income and digital skills, being Spanish, and being employed; while being female, older and belonging to a household of two or more members have negative effects. An interaction between digital skills and age has been introduced in the model, where high digital skills seem to have a positive influence, partly counteracting the lower odds for some age groups. Policy recommendations related to demand and supply measures are suggested to foster the adoption of e-commerce.
D11|Anticipation of deteriorating health and information avoidance|The anticipation of bad future events reduces currently experienced happiness and it may through this channel elicit detrimental behavioral responses. We explore this idea in the context of endogenous health and aging. We integrate physiological aging into a life-cycle model, calibrate it with data from gerontology, and analyze how the anticipation of a deteriorating state of health affects health spending, life expectancy, and the value of life. In counterfactual computational experiments we compare behavior and outcomes of anticipating and non-anticipating individuals and find that anticipation decreases lifetime utility, health investments, and longevity. We then use the model to contribute to the literature on information avoidance. We find that anticipation provides a strong motive to avoid medical testing even when the likelihood of developing a certain disease is high and the cost for the test is low.
D11|Time-inconsistent health behavior and its impact on aging and longevity|We integrate time-inconsistent decision making due to hyperbolic discounting into a gerontologically founded life cycle model with endogenous aging and longevity. Individuals can slow down aging and postpone death by health investments and by reducing unhealthy consumption, conceptualized as smoking. We show that individuals continuously revise their original plans to smoke less and invest more in their health. Consequently, they accumulate health deficits faster and die earlier than originally planned. This fundamental health consequence of time-inconsistency has not been addressed in the literature so far. Because death is endogenous, any attempt to establish the time-consistent first-best solution by manipulating the first order conditions through (sin-) taxes and subsidies is bound to fail. We calibrate the model with U.S. data for an average American in the year 2010 and estimate that time-inconsistent health behavior causes a loss of about 5 years of life. We show how price policy can nudge individuals to behave more healthy such that they actually realize the longevity and value of life planned at age 20.
D11|Financial literacy and precautionary insurance|This paper studies insurance demand for individuals with limited financial literacy. We propose uncertainty about insurance payouts, resulting from contract complexity, as a novel channel that affects decision-making of financially illiterate individuals. Then, a trade-off between second-order (risk aversion) and third-order (prudence) risk preferences drives insurance demand. Sufficiently prudent individuals raise insurance demand upon an increase in contract complexity, while the effect is reversed for less prudent individuals. We characterize competitive market equilibria that feature complex contracts since firms face costs to reduce complexity. Based on the equilibrium analysis, we propose a monetary measure for the welfare cost of financial illiteracy and show that it is mainly driven by individuals' risk aversion. Finally, we discuss implications for regulation and consumer protection.
D11|Toward a cognitive science of markets: Economic agents as sense-makers|Behavioral economics characterizes decision-makers using psychologically-informed models. Cognitive science produces psychologically-informed models. Why don't these disciplines talk more? Here, the author presents several arguments for why cognitive science should inform behavioral economics - it characterizes internal psychological states, builds a richer conception of human nature, pays equal attention to cognition's successes and failures, embraces multidisciplinary insights, and avoids blind spots produced by behavioral economics' intellectual lineage. The author illustrates these principles using the cognitive science of sense-making - how humans understand information - including mental tools such as heuristics, stories, and theories. The science of mind can produce new insights to enrich economics.

D11|Medical and nursery care with endogenous health and longevity|For the population over 65, nursery care expenditures constitute on average the largest share in total health expenditures. In this paper, we distinguish between medical care, intended to improve one›s state of health, and personal care required for daily routine. Personal care can be either carried out autonomously or by a third party. In the course of aging, autonomous personal care is eventually substituted by nursery care. We set up a life-cycle model in which individuals are subject to physiological aging, calibrate it with data from gerontology, and analyze the interplay between medical and nursery care. We replicate health behavior and life expectancy of individuals and in particular the empirically observed patterns of medical and nursery care expenditure. We then analyze the impact of better health and rising life expectancy, triggered by rising income and medical progress, on the expected cost of nursery care in the future. We predict an elasticity of nursery care expenditure with respect to life expectancy of 1/3. In terms of present value at age 20, life-time nursery care expenditure is predicted to decline with rising life expectancy.
D11|Consumer Attitude and Reaction towards Personalised Pricing in the E-Commerce Sector|Objective - This study examines consumer attitudes and reactions towards personalised pricing strategies in a negative and positive hypothetical purchase context. Methodology/Technique - The data was collected from 250 respondents from India through a set of two structured questionnaires, each one comprising either a positive or negative purchase scenario. Partial Least Square based Structural Equation Modelling (PLS SEM) was used to analyse the data. Findings - The results of the study imply that the consumers are concerned about the usage of their personal data for price customisation which reduces their repurchase intentions and increases the reprisal intention. The results also depict that a loyal customer base reacts positively to some extent to the personalised pricing strategy. Novelty - This study considers the impact of personalised pricing on the fair price perceptions, privacy concerns and customer loyalty in both positive and negative purchase contexts which is a novel in this research area.
D11|The love for children hypothesis and the multiplicity of fertility rates|As illustrated by some French departments, how can we explain the existence of equilibria with different fertility and growth rates in economies with the same fundamentals, preferences, technologies and initial conditions? To answer this question we develop an endogenous growth model with altruism and love for children. We show that independently from the type of altruism, a multiplicity of equilibria might emerge if the degree of love for children is high enough. We refer to this condition as the love for children hypothesis. Then, the fertility rate is determined by expectations on the future growth rate and the dynamics are not path-dependent. Our model is able to reproduce different fertility behaviours in a context of completed demographic transition independently from fundamentals, preferences, technologies and initial conditions.
D11|Beyond Truth-Telling: Preference Estimation with Centralized School Choice and College Admissions|We propose novel approaches to estimating student preferences with data from matching mechanisms, especially the Gale-Shapley deferred acceptance. Even if the mechanism is strategy-proof, assuming that students truthfully rank schools in applications may be restrictive. We show that when students are ranked strictly by some ex ante known priority index (e.g., test scores), stability is a plausible and weaker assumption, implying that every student is matched with her favorite school/college among those she qualifies for ex post. The methods are illustrated in simulations and applied to school choice in Paris. We discuss when each approach is more appropriate in real-life settings.
D11|A theoretical framework explaining the mechanisms of nudging|In this paper we develop a theoretical model to clarify the underlying mechanisms that drive individual decision making and responses to behavioral interventions, such as nudges. The contribution of the paper is three-fold: First, the model provides a theoretical framework that comprehensively structures the individual decision-making process applicable to a wide range of choice situations. Second, we reduce the confusion regarding what should be called a nudge by oﬀering a clear classiﬁcation of behavioral interventions. We distinguish among what we label as pure nudges, preference nudges, and other behavioral interventions. Third, we identify the mechanisms behind the eﬀectiveness of behavioral interventions based on the structured decision-making process. Hence, the model can be used to predict under which circumstances, and in which choice situations, a nudge is likely to be eﬀective.
D11|Can the environment be an inferior good ? A theory with context-dependent substitutability and needs|Empirical evidence and theoretical frameworks mostly suggest normality of public environmental goods. In this paper, we argue there is no reason an environmental good should be categorized as inferior, normal or luxury in all decision contexts. We develop a model that allows public environmental goods to switch from one category to another, depending on individual income and environmental quality levels (i.e., the context). Our model is based on needs within which private consumption and environmental goods may interact differently (substitutes/complements). We formalize utility functional forms that comply with our framework. We finally derive some policy implications for environmental benefit transfers.
D11|Samuelson's Approach to Revealed Preference Theory: Some Recent Advances|Since Paul Samuelson introduced the theory of revealed preference, it has become one of the most important concepts in economics. This chapter surveys some recent contributions in the revealed preference literature. We depart from Afriat's theorem, which provides the conditions for a data set to be consistent with the utility maximization hypothesis. We provide and motivate a new condition, which we call the Varian inequalities. The advantage of the Varian inequalities is that they can be formulated as a set of mixed integer linear inequalities, which are linear in the quantity and price data. We show how the Varian inequalities can be used to derive revealed preference tests for weak separability, and show how it can be used to formulate tests of the collective household model. Finally, we discuss measurement errors in the observed data and measures of goodness-of-fit, power and predictive success.
D11|The Effect of the Source of Inheritance on Bequest Attitudes: Evidence from Japan|A better understanding of the reasons for bequests can be pivotal for the effectiveness of fiscal policy and wealth inequality management as the different bequest motives underlying bequest behavior have different implications. This study examines community-based indirect reciprocity in bequest attitudes over three generations. The theoretical model, called community-based family tradition, suggests that the source of the inheritance impacts the amount of the bequest left to one's children or one's spouse. The study empirically analyzes survey data from the 2009 wave of the Preference Parameters Study for Japan. The results suggest that with some socio-economics characteristics controlled, those who have received an inheritance from their parents are more likely to intend to bequest as much as possible to their children, while those who have received an inheritance from their spouse's parents are more likely to intend to bequest as much as possible to both their children and their spouse. Hence, the source of inheritance does affect bequest attitudes, which suggests that there is community-based indirect reciprocity in bequest attitudes. The empirical results from gender comparison suggest that the taxation on inheritance is less functional for females than for males.
D11|Social division in the market: conspicuous consumption with nationalist feelings|In this paper, we explore the effects of conspicuous goods as means of social division between native citizens and migrants. We push forward the hypothesis that choosing a particular good can confer a sense of place. We introduce this idea in an international vertical differentiation market with two variants and two social groups: migrants and natives. Natives are narrow- minded since they attribute a positive social value to the variant that complies with their own consumption culture. Migrants are open-minded. When consumers belonging to different groups meet, they exchange information about their consumption habits and consumption well-being that reveals their consumption culture: narrow-minded versus open-minded. Consequently, after meeting, some consumers may change beliefs (narrow-minded to open-minded or vice versa) and consumption choices. Using a dynamic model, we fully elucidate the steady state equilibrium and highlight the impact of nationalism on migrant integration.
D11|A general equilibrium evolutionary model with generic utility functions and generic bell-shaped attractiveness maps, generating fashion cycle dynamics|We propose a discrete-time exchange economy evolutionary model, in which two groups of agents are possibly characterized by heterogeneous preference structures. With respect to the classical Walrasian framework, in our setting the definition of equilibrium, in addition to utility functions and endowments, depends also on population shares, which affect the market clearing conditions. We prove that, despite such difference with the standard framework, for every economy and for each population shares there exists at least one equilibrium and we show that, for all population shares, generically in the set of the economies, equilibria are finite and regular. We then introduce the dynamic law governing the evolution of the population shares, and we investigate the existence and the stability of the resulting stationary equilibria. More precisely, we assume that the reproduction level of a group is related to its attractiveness degree, which depends on the social visibility level, determined by the consumption choices of the agents in that group. The attractiveness of a group is described via a generic bell-shaped map, increasing for low visibility levels, but decreasing when the visibility of the group exceeds a given threshold value, due to a congestion effect. Thanks to the combined action of the price mechanism and of the share updating rule, the model may reproduce the recurrent dynamic behavior typical of the fashion cycle, presenting booms and busts in the agents’ consumption choices, and in the groups’ attractiveness and population shares. We illustrate the emergence of fashion cycle dynamics in the case of Stone-Geary utility functions, which generalize the Cobb-Douglas utility functions, and for different formulations of the attractiveness maps, already considered in the literature.
D11|Strategic Ignorance of Health Risk: Its Causes and Policy Consequences|We examine the causes and policy consequences of strategic (willful) ignorance of risk as an excuse to overengage in risky health behavior. In an experiment on Copenhagen adults, we allow subjects to choose whether to learn the calorie content of a meal before consuming it, and measure their subsequent calorie intake. We find strong evidence of strategic ignorance: 46% of subjects choose to ignore calorie information, and these subjects subsequently consume more calories on average than they would have had they been informed. We find that strategically ignorant subjects downplay the health risk of their preferred meal being high-calorie, which we formally show is consistent with the theory of optimal expectations about risk. Further, we find that the prevalence of strategic ignorance largely negates the effectiveness of calorie information provision: on average, subjects who have the option to ignore calorie information consume about the same number of calories as subjects who are provided no information.
D11|Monopolistic Competition, As You Like It| We study imperfect and monopolistic competition with asymmetric preferences over a variety of goods provided by heterogeneous firms. We show how to compute equilibria through the Morishima elasticities of substitution. Simple pricing rules and closed-form solutions emerge under monopolistic competition when demands depend on common aggregators. This is the case for Generalized Additively Separable preferences (encompassing additive preferences and their Gorman-Pollak extensions), implicitly additive preferences and others. For applications to trade, with markups variable across goods of different quality, and to macroeconomics, with markups depending on aggregate variables, we propose specifications of indirectly additive, self-dual addilog and implicit CES preferences.
D11|Sequential Common Consequence Effect and Incentives|Economics calls for monetary incentives to induce participants to exhibit truthful behaviour. This experiment investigates the effect of reducing incentives on dynamic choices, which encompass the individual and chance in a sequence of decisions. This experiment compares choices with the commonly used random lottery incentive system (RLIS) to hypothetical choices in the dynamic choice setting surrounding the common consequence effect (CCE), both horizontal and vertical. In addition, the RLIS is partially controlled for by eliciting with single choice individual preferences over the two horizontal CCE static choice problems. Results suggest that lessening incentives do not induce a systematic shift in preferences when emotional responses are not at stake.
D11|We Are What We Eat: Obesity, Income, and Social Comparisons| The empirical evidence of a non-monotone relation between income and obesity is not well explained. We build a theoretical model combining income inequality and social comparisons to explain the link between income and obesity and study tax policy implications for fighting obesity. We assume that differences in food consumption patterns between poor and wealthy households partly reflect positionality, which is the concern for social status. Our key assumption is that positionality for low-calorie food consumption is positively related to a country’s wealth. In this framework, body weight outcomes reflect competing income and positionality effects, yielding the following results. We explain the link between average obesity rates, and standards of living and suggest the existence of a Kuznets curve for obesity. For cross sections of the population, we explain the observed correlation between income and obesity, which is positive in poor countries, and negative rich countries. We find that increasing the relative cost of high-calorie food is less effective at decreasing the relative weight of poor individuals in rich countries than in poor countries.
D11|Convenience pricing in online retailing: Evidence from Amazon.com|To expedite payments, firms use convenience pricing strategies. A price is considered convenient if it can be paid with few coins. Convenient prices are well understood in offline retailing, but not online. This article fills the gap, examining an original panel dataset more than 2.5 million observations of book prices from Amazon.com. We provide empirical evidence supporting two claims. First in a static setup, more convenient prices are more likely to be set. Second in a dynamic setup, more convenient prices are more rigid. Emphasizing the role of convenience, this work sheds new light on price setting in online retailing.
D11|Ambiguous life expectancy and the demand for annuities|Abstract In this paper, ambiguity aversion to uncertain survival probabilities is introduced in a static life-cycle model with a bequest motive to study the optimal demand for annuities. Provided that annuities’ return is sufficiently large, and notably when it is fair, positive annuitization is known to be the optimal strategy of ambiguity neutral individuals. Conversely, we show that the demand for annuities decreases with ambiguity aversion and that there exists a finite degree of aversion above which the demand is non-positive: the optimal strategy is then to either sell annuities short or to hold zero annuities if the former option is not available. To conclude, ambiguity aversion appears to be a relevant candidate for explaining the annuity puzzle.
D11|A not so myopic axiomatization of discounting|This article builds an axiomatization of inter-temporal trade-o)s that makes an explicit account of the distant future and therefore encompasses motives related to sustainability, transmission to o)springs and altruism. The focus is on separable representations and the approach is completed following a decision-theory index based approach that is applied to utility streams. This enlightens the limits of the commonly used tail intensity requesites for the evaluation of utility streams: in this article, these are supersed and replaced by an axiomatic approach to optimal myopia degrees that in its turn precedes the determination of optimal discount. The overall approach is anchored in the new and explicit proof of a temporal decomposition of the preference orders between the distant future and the close future itself directly related to the determination of the optimal myopia degrees. The argument is shown to provide a novel understanding of temporal biases with the scope for a distant future bias when the finite dimensional gets influenced by the infinite dimensional. The reference to robust orders and pessimism-like axioms finally allows for determining tractable representations for the indexes.

D11|Psychophysical foundations of the Cobb–Douglas utility function|Relying on a literal interpretation of Weber’s law in psychophysics, we show that a simple condition of independence across good categories implies the Cobb–Douglas preferences.
D11|Household Fuel Use in Rural China|The household transition from dirty to clean fuels is important because of its economic, health and environment consequences, locally, nationally and globally. In order to study fuel choices, a non-separated farm household model for fuel demands is developed. Then, discrete choice equations of fuel uses, consistent with this theoretical model, are estimated using microeconomic household panel data from rural China.The estimation results support the theoretical approach that implies that the fuel demands depend not only on income, fuel prices, and demand-side socioeconomic factors, as would occur in the standard fuel demand models in the literature, but also on food prices, agricultural assets, and original household and community characteristics that shape the household responses to market failures. Finally, we present a few policy simulations that reveal the complex substitution impact of energy price policies in China.We provide the first evidence on: price sensitivity of fuel stacking, that food prices exert some pressure on the fuel transition, the role of farm work and activity specialization in fuel choices. Policies should incorporate some of the complexity of the non-separated decisions of rural households in this context of market failures. The complex cross-price effects imply that the policy pricing mechanisms should account for all energy types and food prices. Finally, market-based policies should be coupled with policy interventions aimed at increasing the opportunity cost of dirty fuels.
D11|Optimal Investment in Health when Lifetime is Stochastic, or, Rational Agents do not Often Follow Health Agency Recommendations|A health-capital model is contemplated which accounts for the consumption of many goods, a stock of health and investment in it, as well as an agent’s random lifetime and accumulation of wealth. It is shown that if an agent maximizes the expected discounted value of lifetime utility, or if an agent maximizes the expected value of their lifetime, then an agent does not follow the health-investment policy that minimizes the conditional probability of dying at each point in time, in general. What is more, simple and intuitive sufficient, and necessary and sufficient, conditions are identified whereby such agents investment more or less in their health than said policy.
D11|Taxes and Household Labor Supply: Estimating Distributional Effects of Nonlinear Prices on Multidimensional Choice|We develop a method for distributional regression of joint multidimensional choice on nonlinear prices departing from a household model of labor supply that focuses on tax policy effects. Our distribution functions are derived under minimal theoretical assumptions and have a simple structure. We allow distribution-free estimation, collective decisionmaking, and identification based on tax reforms. In our empirical application on U.S. panel data from 1980 to 2006, we provide a deepened understanding of how the configuration of the tax system affects the distribution of transitions between combinations of spouse labor supply. We also quantify biases from commonly imposed restrictions.
D11|Green Growth and Taste Heterogeneity|The recent contributions in directed technological change theory show that technological progress in clean industries (i.e. industries which do no produce CO2 emissions) lead to emission decline only if clean and dirty goods are sufficiently substitutable. The result raises a question whether a government could design a policy which increases this substitutability. In this paper I show that elasticity of substitution between clean and dirty goods increases with the number of varieties of clean good. This is shown in the theoretical model, which combines the insights from the directed technological change literature and discrete choice literature. The policy implications of the finding is that environmental policy which promotes development of clean industries should be supplemented with a policy which ensures the diversity of clean goods. For example a subsidy for R&D in clean transport should support a wide range of alternative technologies rather than selected few.
D11|Lost in Translation: What do Engel Curves Tell us about the Cost of Living?|The Hamilton method for estimating CPI bias is simple, intuitive, and has been widely adopted. We show that the method confiates CPI bias with variation in cost-of-living across income levels. Assuming a single price index across the income distribution is inconsistent with the downward sloping Engel curves that are necessary to implement the method. We develop and implement the Translated Engel curve (TEC) method that disentangles genuine CPI bias from differences caused by comparing changes in the cost of living across different income levels - non-homotheticity. The TEC method gives substantially different estimates of CPI bias prior to major reforms to the CPI in 1999 (post-Boskin), but both methods suggest very little CPI bias thereafter.
D11|A Lattice Test for Additive Separability|We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for a finite data set of price and demand observations to be consistent with an additively separable preference. We do so without imposing concavity on any of the subutility functions or convexity of the budget set a priori, thereby generalizing earlier results. Our simple and intuitive lattice test easily accommodates departures from rationality, or errors, which subsequently facilitates a rich empirical analysis. We apply our econometric techniques to the food consumption of a panel of British households. The primary empirical finding is that additive separability has considerable success in explaining the data.
D11|The Rational Core of Preference Relations|We consider revealed preference relations over risky (or uncertain) prospects, and allow them to be nontransitive and/or fail the classical Independence Axiom. We identify the rational part of any such preference relation as its largest transitive subrelation that satis fies the Independence Axiom and that exhibits some coherence with the original relation. It is shown that this subrelation, which we call the rational core of the given revealed preference, exists in general, and under fairly mild conditions, it is continuous. We obtain various representation theorems for the rational core, and decompose it into other core concepts for preferences. These theoretical results are applied to compute the rational cores of a number of well-known preference models (such as Fishburns SSB model, justi fiable preferences, and variational and multiplier modes of rationalizable preferences). As for applications, we use the rational core operator to develop a theory of risk aversion for nontransitive nonexpected utility modals (which may not even be complete). Finally, we show that, under a basic monotonicity hypothesis, the Preference Reversal Phenomenon cannot arise from the rational core of ones preferences. JEL Classifi cation: D11, D81. Keywords: Transitive core, affine core, nontransitive nonexpected utility, justi fiable preferences, comparative risk aversion, preference reversal phenomenon.
D11|A path out: Prescription drug abuse, treatment, and suicide|In this paper we investigate the dual role of supply restrictions and drug treatment in combating the concurrent rise of opioid abuse and suicide in the United States over the last two decades. We find that supply-side interventions decrease suicides in places with strong addiction-help networks, implying that prescription drug abuse is associated with an inherent risk of suicide. Our findings support an important role for access to treatment services in policies designed to combat the opioid epidemic.
D11|Validating the Collective Model of Household Consumption Using Direct Evidence on Sharing|Recent advances in the collective model literature suggest ways to estimate the complete allocation of resources within households, using assignable goods and assuming adult preference similarity across demographic groups (or across spouses). While it makes welfare analysis at the individual level possible, the predictive power of the model is unknown. We propose the first validation of this approach, exploiting a unique dataset from Bangladesh in which the detailed expenditure on private goods by each family member is collected. Individualized expenditure allows us to test the identifying assumptions and to derive 'observed' resource sharing within families, which can be compared to the resource allocation predicted by the model. Sharing between parents and children is well predicted on average while the model detects key aspects like the extent of pro-boy discrimination. Results overall depend on the identifying good: clothing provides the best fit compared to other goods as it best validates the preference-similarity assumption. The model leads to accurate measures of child and adult poverty, indicating the size and direction of the mistakes made when using the traditional approach based on per adult equivalent expenditure (i.e. ignoring within-household inequality). This assessment of existing approaches to measure individual inequality and poverty is crucial for both academic and policy circles and militates in favor of a systematic use of collective models for welfare analyses.
D11|Time will tell: recovering preferences when choices are noisy|The ability to uncover preferences from choices is fundamental for both positive economics and welfare analysis. Overwhelming evidence shows that choice is stochastic, which has given rise to random utility models as the dominant paradigm in applied microeconomics. However, as is well known, it is not possible to infer the structure of preferences in the absence of assumptions on the structure of noise. This makes it impossible to empirically test the structure of noise independently from the structure of preferences. Here, we show that the difficulty can be bypassed if data sets are enlarged to include response times. A simple condition on response time distributions (a weaker version of first-order stochastic dominance) ensures that choices reveal preferences without assumptions on the structure of utility noise. Sharper results are obtained if the analysis is restricted to specific classes of models. Under symmetric noise, response times allow to uncover preferences for choice pairs outside the data set, and if noise is Fechnerian, even choice probabilities can be forecast out of sample. We conclude by showing that standard random utility models from economics and standard drift-diffusion models from psychology necessarily generate data sets fulfilling our sufficient condition on response time distributions.
D11|Unblurring the Market for Vision Correction: A Willingness to Pay Experiment in Rural Burkina Faso|We assess the willingness to pay (WTP) for eyeglasses in an adult population in rural Burkina Faso using a variant of the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) method. We combine the BDM approach with video and deferred payment options to analyze the role of information and liquidity constraints. Furthermore, we exploit variation in reservation and transaction prices to study potential screening and sunk cost effects. Our main results show that, consistent with the over-exclusion perspective documented for essential health products, the willingness to pay for glasses is low, amounting to 20% of the current market price. Information provided through a video raises the willingness to pay for corrective glasses by 16%. In contrast, deferred payment does not affect the willingness to pay. Finally, we find no evidence of screening or sunk cost effects. Overall our results lend support to subsidization of eyeglasses in a resource poor setting.
D11|Demand Models for Differentiated Goods with Complementarity and Substitutability|We develop a class of demand models for differentiated products. The new models facilitate the BLP method (Berry et al., 1995) while numerical inversion of the demand system is not required. They can accommodate rich patterns of substitution and complementarity while being easily estimated with standard regression techniques and allowing very large choice sets. We use the new models to describe markets for differentiated products that exhibit segmentation according to several dimensions and illustrate their application by estimating demand for cereals in Chicago.
D11|Product Proliferation and Pricing in a Market with Positional Effects|We provide an explanation for product versioning that is not driven by differential costs or consumer preference heterogeneity, and investigate its implications. Consumers care whether a product they own is better than that owned by others, and whether others own a better product than them. These positional effects can induce a firm to offer products of different quality, with the high quality product becoming more exclusive as these effects strengthen. Consumers with no positional preferences become worse off when the broader market acquires them, except following the introduction of the second product, when some such consumers become better off. Positional preference also reduce total consumer surplus holding the number of products fixed; however, they increase consumer surplus if they lead the firm to introduce a second product of sufficiently high quality. We discuss empirical implications of the theory.
D11|On the Relationship between Cognitive Ability and Risk Preference|This paper will focus on the relationship between cognitive ability and decision-making under risk and uncertainty. Taken as a whole, this research indicates that cognitive ability is associated with risk-taking behavior in various contexts and life domains, including incentivized choices between lotteries in controlled environments, behavior in nonexperimental settings, and self-reported tendency to take risks. One pattern that emerges frequently in these studies is that cognitive ability tends to be positively correlated with avoidance of harmful risky situations, but it tends to be negatively correlated with risk aversion in advantageous situations. We conclude by discussing perspectives for future research, in particular the scope for the development of richer sets of elicitation instruments and measurement across a wider range of concepts.
D11|Temptation and commitment in the laboratory|We report data from a novel laboratory experiment on economic decisions under persistent temptations. This type of temptation is ubiquitous, as it refers to any temptation that is present until one either gives in or makes a costly commitment decision to have it removed. Subjects in our experiment are repeatedly offered an option with instantaneous benefit that also entails a substantial reduction to overall earnings. We show that this option is tempting in the sense that a substantial fraction of our subjects incur pecuniary costs to eliminate the choice, and thus commit not to choose this alternative. We find that commitment and giving in to temptation generally occur at the first opportunity, though a non-negligible fraction of subjects delay either making the commitment decision or giving in to temptation. This delay is consistent with the costs of self-control increasing with its use.
D11|Do demographics prevent consumption aggregates from reflecting micro-level preferences?|Most simulated micro-founded macro models use solely consumer-demand aggregates in order to estimate preference parameters of a representative consumer, for use in policy evaluation. Focusing on dynamic models with time-separable preferences, we show that aggregation holds if, and only if, momentary utility functions fall in the Identical-Shape Harmonic Absolute-Risk Aversion (ISHARA) utility class, identifying which parameters of ISHARA utility functions are allowed to vary over time. Given this theoretical result, it should be easy to empirically reject the aggregation properties that the macroeconomic representative-consumer identification approach requires: it suffices to show that permanent incomes guaranteeing the same living standard across households of different size violate an affine relationship. In order to test the validity of this affine equation, we develop a vignette survey that produces appropriate data without demand-estimation restrictions imposed by models. Surprisingly, in six countries, this equation is not rejected, lending support to using consumer-demand aggregates.
D11|Validating the Collective Model of Household Consumption Using Direct Evidence on Sharing|Recent advances in the collective model literature suggest ways to estimate the complete allocation of resources within households, using assignable goods and assuming adult preference similarity across demographic groups (or across spouses).

This assessment of existing approaches to measure individual inequality and poverty is crucial for both academic and policy circles and militates in favor of a systematic use of collective models for welfare analyses.
D11|Dynamic Corrective Taxes with Time-Varying Salience|The intermittency of payment for many goods creates a disconnect between paying and consuming such that the marginal price is not always salient when consumption decisions are made. This paper derives optimal dynamic corrective taxes when there are externalities as well as internalities from inattention and persistence in consumption across periods. Our optimal taxes address dynamic inefficiencies that are not captured in static models of inattention. We also characterize a second-best constant tax and the excess burden associated with time-invariant tax rates. We then calibrate the model to U.S. residential electricity consumption.
D11|When do populations polarize? An explanation|Numerous experiments demonstrate attitude polarization. For instance, Lord, Ross & Lepper presented subjects with the same mixed evidence on the deterrent effect of the death penalty. Both believers and skeptics of its deterrent effect became more convinced of their views; that is, the population polarized. However, not all experiments find this attitude polarization. We propose a theory of rational updating that accounts for both the positive and negative experimental findings. This is in contrast to existing theories, which predict either too much or too little polarization.
D11|A Model of Addiction and Social Interactions|Many consumer behaviors are both addictive and social. Understanding how these two phenomena interact informs basic models of human behavior, and matters for policymakers when the behavior is regulated. I develop a new model of demand that incorporates both addiction and social interactions and show that, under certain conditions, social interactions reinforce the effects of addiction. I also show how the dynamics introduced by addiction can solve the pernicious problem of identifying the causal effects of social interactions. I then use the model to illustrate a new and important identification problem for studies of social interactions: existing estimates cannot be used to draw welfare conclusions or even to deduce whether social interactions increase aggregate demand. Finally, I develop a method that allows researchers to distinguish between two common forms of social interactions and draw welfare conclusions.
D11|Dynamic corrective taxes with time-varying salience|The intermittency of payment for many goods creates a disconnect between paying and consuming such that the marginal price is not always salient when consumption decisions are made.

Our optimal taxes address dynamic inefficiencies that are not captured in static models of inattention. We also characterize a second-best constant tax and the excess burden associated with time-invariant tax rates. We then calibrate the model to U.S. residential electricity consumption.
D11|Integrability and Generalized Separability|This paper examines demand systems where the demand for a good depends only on its own price, consumer income, and a single aggregator synthesizing information on all other prices. This generalizes directly-separable preferences where the Lagrange multiplier provides such an aggregator. As indicated by Gorman (1972), symmetry of the Slutsky substitution terms implies that such demand can take only one of two simple forms. Conversely, here we show that only weak conditions ensure that such demand systems are integrable, i.e. can be derived from the maximization of a well-behaved utility function. This paper further studies useful properties and applications of these demand systems.
D11|Microeconometric Models of Consumer Demand|A long literature has developed econometric methods for estimating individual-consumer-level demand systems that accommodate corner solutions. The increasing access to transaction-level customer purchase histories across a wide array of markets and industries vastly expands the prospect for improved customer insight, more targeted marketing policies and individualized welfare analysis. A descriptive analysis of a broad, CPG database indicates that most consumer brand categories offer a wide variety of differentiated offerings for consumers. However, consumers typically purchase only a limited scope of the available variety, leading to a very high incidence of corner solutions which poses computational challenges for demand modeling. Historically, these computational challenges have limited the applicability of microeconometric models of demand in practice, except for the special case of pure discrete choice (e.g., logit and probit). Recent advances in computing power along with methods for numerical and simulation-based integration have been instrumental in facilitating the broader use of these models in practice. We survey herein the extant literature on the neoclassical derivation of microeconometric demand models that allow for corner solutions and differentiated products. We summarize the key developments in the literature, including the role of consumers’ price expectations, and point towards opportunities for future research.
D11|Rational Inattention, Competitive Supply, and Psychometrics|Costs of attention, while central to choice behavior, have proven hard to measure. We introduce a simple method of recovering them from choice data. Our recovery method rests on the observation that costs of attention play precisely the same role in consumer choice as do a competitive firm's costs of production in its supply decision. This analogy extends to welfare analysis: consumer welfare net of attention costs is measured in precisely the same way as the profits of a competitive firm. We implement our recovery method in a purpose-built experiment. We quantitatively assess the trade-off between reward level and task complexity. Estimated attention costs are highly correlated with decision time, an important common input in process-based models of attention.
D11|The Digital Economy, New Products and Consumer Welfare|Benefits of the Digital Economy are evident in everyday life, but there are significant concerns that these benefits may not be appropriately reflected in official statistics. The measurement of the net benefits of new and disappearing products depends on what type of price index the statistical agency is using to deflate final demand aggregates. We examine this measurement problem when the agency uses any standard price index formula for its deflation of a value aggregate, such as GDP. We also apply the methodology to the problem of measuring the effects of product substitutions for disappearing items. Our exact expressions for biases inherent in different approaches provide a theoretical basis and framework for the emerging empirical literature on new goods and services, and for assessing the quality adjustment methodologies used in practice.
D11|Monopolistic Competition with GAS Preferences|We study monopolistic competition equilibria with free entry under symmetric Generalized Additively Separable preferences, whose demand systems feature a single aggregator of prices or quantities. They include Gorman-Pollak preferences (which nest directly and indirectly additive preferences, a homothetic family and other preferences) and implicit CES preferences. With heterogeneous ?rms our extension of the Melitz model produces a variety of pricing and selection effects, and allows us to solve the social planner problem. We illustrate the inefficiency of the market equilibrium for a new speci?cation of generalized translated power preferences, and show its optimality for the entire class of implicit CES preferences.
D11|La teoría del consumidor: fundamentales y aplicaciones<BR>[The consumer theory: fundamentals and applications]|This document is about the theoretical foundations of neoclassical consumer theory. In the first part, the document makes a presentation of the Arrow-Debreu model and presents the problem of maximization of utility and minimization of expenditure from the real approach (set theory). In the second part, it analyzes the problem of integrability. Then, in the third part, it analyzes the classification of the goods by their elasticities. In the fourth and last part, we made empirical applications of consumer theory.
D11|When do populations polarize? An explanation|Numerous experiments demonstrate attitude polarization. For instance, Lord, Ross & Lepper presented subjects with the same mixed evidence on the deterrent effect of the death penalty.

We propose a theory of rational updating that accounts for both the positive and negative experimental findings. This is in contrast to existing theories, which predict either too much or too little polarization
D11|Propensity to search and income elasticity of demand: does the equilibrium really exist?|The analysis of the propensity to search under price dispersion discovers the identity of the optimal consumption-leisure choices in the model of optimal search and in the classical model of individual labor supply when the propensity to search is unimportant. However, the vigorous propensity to search, that occurs when consumers visit high-price stores, challenges the classical view on the optimal labor-leisure trade-off. The vigorous propensity to search creates the positive consumption-leisure relationship. The willingness to substitute labor by search under price dispersion also changes the understanding of the income elasticity of demand. The modest propensity to search creates normal but inelastic demand. The elastic demand becomes the result of the vigorous propensity to search where consumption-leisure trade-off is positive and either consumption or leisure becomes “bad”. This theoretical assumption proves the occurrence of Veblen effect as well as money illusion and creates doubts in the existence of the general equilibrium.
D11|Reference Dependence and Choice Overload|This paper offers an explanation for choice overload based on reference-dependent preferences. Consumers construct an ideal object that combines the best attributes of all objects in their choice set, and use this as a reference point. When the choice set expands, it is more likely to find a better object, but meanwhile the reference point improves, which makes all existing objects appear worse. We characterize when the latter reference-dependence effect dominates such that choice overload arises. We also show that purchase probability can decrease with object complexity, measured by the number of attributes.
D11|Limits to the «theorem of lemons»: demand for good cars under equilibrium price dispersion|The model of equilibrium price dispersion examines the demand for cars through the optics of the demand for mileage where the asymmetry of information is produced by the odometer fraud. Theoretically, fraudsters can destroy the market as it is described by the “theorem of lemons”. But the market self-deactivation does not take place. The purchase of a car with regard to the demand for mileage represents a form of home production where driving like gardening and pets’ care provide a direct utility but is also something one can purchase on the market. At the margin nobody buys but everybody gets taxi. The increase in taxi price per mile raises the demand for good cars of taxi drivers and it makes rational for potential buyers to pay for taxi drivers expertize fee in order to choose a good car. The demand for good cars is restored at the new price level. The pessimistic scenario, however, doesn’t take place because good cars stay attractive. The equilibrium price of a mile establishes the direct relationship between marginal savings on purchase and the time horizon of the consumption-leisure choice. Great discounts provide potential buyers the additional information about short life cycle of vehicles like unexpected low price for beefsteak tells about its short shelf life. The equilibrium price of a mile describes also the trade-off between the purchase price and the costs of ownership. The marginal approach does not rely on the endowment effect. The choice between a good car and a bad car discovers the willingness to take care of good cars where the after-the-purchase costs of ownership per mile become greater than for a bad car. The willingness to take care of the big-ticket quality items reinforces the willingness to pay of potential buyers, and sellers of good cars do not quit the market.
D11|Estimación de elasticidades de demanda de bienes y servicios en Perú mediante los métodos AIDS y QUAIDS<BR>[Estimating demand elasticities of goods and services in Peru using the AIDS and QUAIDS methods]|The demand behavior of the different goods and services is a key component that shapes the structure of an economy, and its analysis is economic policies, such as taxation and promotion of productive development. Within the many demand systems posed in the theoretical and empirical literature, the almost ideal demand systems (AIDS and QUAIDS) have properties consistent with the maximization of utility according to the consumer's neoclassical theory. In this paper, we estimate price elasticities of demand, cross price and income are estimated for large groups of goods and services in Peru from 2004 to 2014, using AIDS and QUAIDS models, based on data from household surveys, using the AIDS and QUAIDS. It is found that the values of price elasticities of demand are consistent with the literature. Likewise, it is determined that the services of care, health conservation, transportation and communications, leisure, entertainment, cultural services, and education and other services constitute luxury goods, although there is heterogeneity in the results when the analysis is done at a higher level of disaggregation.
D11|Beyond behavioral economics: who is the economic man|There are two reasons to go beyond Behavioral Economics. The first reason is that humans, as presented by this school, do not explain many critical economic problems. Behavioral Economics is not an alternative paradigm to traditional economics. It is only one of the New Schools of thought, that has risen due to the failure of the contemporary Neoclassical School to show that markets have a unique maximum welfare full employment equilibrium. Therefore, in order to delimit Behavioral Economics ́ contributions we need to look at the whole paradigm in economics, which today includes: the contemporary neoclassical paradigm plus all the New Schools of thought. The second reason is that humans, as described by Behavioral Economics, are not a good representation of mans ́ evolutionary characteristics. For Behavioral Economics, humans are emotional beings which often do not know what is best for them, and need the help of the government to make the choices which are truly convenient; and they display altruistic and social cooperative behavior, even in monetary transactions. But evolutionarily we are neither design to be emotional or rational, nor to be selfish or altruistic and socially cooperative. We are design to be flexible for survival purposes, and to display a wide range of behaviors.
D11|Signals Sell: Product Lines when Consumers Differ Both in Taste for Quality and Image Concern|"This paper analyzes optimal product lines when consumers differ both in their taste for quality and in their desire for social image. The market outcome features partial pooling and product differentiation that is not driven by heterogeneous valuations for quality but by image concerns. A typical monopoly outcome is a two-tier product line resembling a \""masstige\"" strategy as observed in luxury goods markets. Products can have identical quality and differ only in price and image, thereby rationalizing quality-equivalent line extensions. Under competition, both average quality and market coverage are (weakly) higher but monopoly can yield higher welfare than competition."
D11|Determinants of livestock keeper's primary animal health care practises: A partial proportional odds model| Key government strategic development plans in South Africa have perpetually identified livestock farming as one of the vital strategies to alleviate poverty, secure livelihoods and improve food security in rural South Africa. However, livestock remains vulnerable to animal disease that threaten productivity and food security of smallholder farmers. Efficient animal production and control of animal diseases are identified as two of the main challenges that need urgent attention. Using data collected on 593 smallholder farmers in five provinces of South Africa, this paper uses partial proportional odds modelling to evaluate the determinants of livestock keeper's choice of primary animal health care practices. The primary animal health practises considered are biosecurity measures, vaccination and supplementary feeding. The analysis revealed that markets, animal handling facilities, contact with animal health practitioner, farmer association, household size, information, household income, number of goats and perceptions about the effectiveness and use of vaccines were the main determinants of farmer's choice of primary anima heath care practises. The study recommends intensification of programmes that seek to promote farmers; capacity development, social capital, improved inclusive facilitated access to markets and animal handling facilities in order to expedite increased farmers uptake of animal health care practises.

D11|The effect of drought on consumer welfare| South Africa is characterised by frequent drought periods with 2015 receiving the lowest annual average rainfall of 403mm since 1904. This has a negative impact on physical agricultural production with maize being the most affected by the recent 2015 drought. The effect of drought on maize production also influences its price formation along the maize marketing chain. This paper with the use of Cointegration and Error Correction Model (ECM) attempts to estimate the effects of drought on price formation in the white maize marketing chain. Maize meal is a staple food for most South Africans and it constitutes a large share of consumer�s expenditure on food, particularly poor consumers. The study found that drought plays a significant role in the price formation of the white maize marketing chain. During a drought period, any price changes from the producers are transmitted faster than a recovery period. However, during the latter period, any cost savings from the producer price are not passed onto the consumers. This results in consumers paying more for maize meal during a recovery period when prices are expected to decline, with poor consumers being affected the most. JEL Classification: D11, Q13, Q54
D11|Household Fuel Use in Rural China|The household transition from dirty to clean fuels is important because of its economic, health and environment consequences, locally, nationally and globally. In order to study fuel choices, a non-separated farm household model for fuel demands is developed. Then, discrete choice equations of fuel uses, consistent with this theoretical model, are estimated using microeconomic household panel data from rural China. The estimation results support the theoretical approach that implies that the fuel demands depend not only on income, fuel prices, and demand-side socioeconomic factors, as would occur in the standard fuel demand models in the literature, but also on food prices, agricultural assets, and original household and community characteristics that shape the household responses to market failures. Finally, we present a few policy simulations that reveal the complex substitution impact of energy price policies in China. We provide the first evidence on: price sensitivity of fuel stacking, that food prices exert some pressure on the fuel transition, the role of farm work and activity specialization in fuel choices. Policies should incorporate some of the complexity of the non-separated decisions of rural households in this context of market failures. The complex cross-price effects imply that the policy pricing mechanisms should account for all energy types and food prices. Finally, market-based policies should be coupled with policy interventions aimed at increasing the opportunity cost of dirty fuels.
D11|Revealed Stochastic Preference: A one-paragraph proof and generalization|McFadden and Richter (1991) and later McFadden (2005) show that the Axiom of Revealed Stochastic Preference characterizes rationalizability of choice probabilities through random utility models on finite universal choice spaces. This note proves the result in one short, elementary paragraph and extends it to set valued choice. The latter requires a different axiom than is reported in McFadden (2005).
D11|Women’s Empowerment and Family Health: Estimating LATE with Mismeasured Treatment|We study the causal effect of women’s empowerment on family health in India. We define treatment as a woman having primary control over household resources and use changes in inheritance laws as an instrument. Due to measurement difficulties and sharing of goods, treatment cannot be directly observed and must be estimated using a structural model. Treatment mismeasurement may therefore arise from model misspecification and estimation errors. We provide a new estimation method, MR-LATE, that can consistently estimate local average treatment effects when treatment is mismeasured. We find that women’s control of substantial household resources improves their and their children’s health.
D11|Optimal Monetary Policy Under Bounded Rationality|Optimal monetary policy under discretion, commitment, and optimal simple rules regimes is analyzed through a behavioral New Keynesian model. Flexible price level targeting dominates under discretion; flexible inflation targeting dominates under commitment; and strict price level targeting dominates when using optimal simple rules. Stabilizing properties and bounded rationality-independence generally affect the regime's optimality. The policymaker's knowledge of an agent's myopia is decisive, whereas bounded rationality is not necessarily associated with decreased welfare. Several forms of economic inattention can be welfare increasing.
D11|Consumer Search with and without Tracking|In this paper, I develop a tractable framework with sequential consumer search to address the effect of tracking on market outcomes. Tracking search histories is informative about consumersâ€™ valuations because different consumer types have different stopping probabilities. With tracking, the unique equilibrium price path is increasing whereas without tracking, an average uniform price prevails. Welfare effects largely depend on how tracking affects consumersâ€™ search persistence. For intermediate search costs, tracking based price discrimination exacerbates the holdup problem and leads to inefficiently low search persistence. For high search costs instead, tracking prevents a market breakdown as low prices conditional on short search histories secure consumers a positive surplus from search. Tracking prevails endogenously when consumers can dynamically opt out from tracking. This holds since disclosing their search history is always individually rational for consumers, irrespective of the overall effect on consumer surplus.
D11|Música digital no Brasil: uma análise do consumo e reproduções no Spotify|Music is one of the cultural segments that most adapts and innovates, as observed in the recent rise of streaming services. The aim of this article is to show trends and tastes of individuals, taking into account musical genres. For such purpose, it uses data from the Spotify platform. The results show that genres such as “sertanejo universitário” and international pop have great national reach. However, other national genres have a relevant and distinct demand in some Brazilian cities. Therefore, a regionalization of the musical taste in Brazil is evidenced, which suggests a potential of musical niches when inserted in the context of the digital market.
D11|Paternalistic Taxation of Unhealthy Food and the Intensive versus Extensive Margin of Obesity|This paper shows that if an individual’s health costs are U-shaped in weight with a minimum at some healthy weight level and if the individual has both self control problems and rational motives for over- or underweight, the optimal paternalistic tax on unhealthy food mitigates the individual’s weight problem (intensive margin), but does not induce the individual to choose healthy weight (extensive margin). Implementing healthy weight requires a further distortion (e.g. subsidy on other goods), which may render the tax on unhealthy food inferior to the option of not taxing the individual at all. In addition, with heterogeneous individuals the optimal uniform paternalistic tax may have the negative side effect of rendering otherwise healthy individuals underweight.
D11|Too Slow a Change? Deep Habits, Consumption Shifts and Transitory Tax Policy|Habits are an important cause of sluggish consumption adjustment in response to price shocks. This paper studies shifts within the consumption bundle under endogenous habit formation. I put forward a model with good-specific, or ’deep’, habits that cause persistence in good-specific consumption. In addition, at the aggregate level, habits act as a benchmark against which consumption is evaluated. I evaluate dynamic consumption choices under the realistic assumption that the consumer imperfectly internalizes the habit formation process. I compare consumption choices to the welfare-maximizing choices, and determine the path of taxes or subsidies that implements first-best consumption, both when goods are produced competitively and when they are produced by monopolists. I establish that a transition to a new consumption bundle is more likely inefficiently sluggish if the persistence effect is relatively strong. Strategic pricing behavior by monopolists leads to inefficiently rapid transitions. To explore the quantitative implications of the model I consider the introduction of a 10 percent charge on a subset of goods. I find that consumption adjusts inefficiently fast; implementing first-best adjustment requires a transitory discount of up to 60 percent of the cost increase.
D11|Consumption response to aggregate shocks and the role of leverage|This paper investigates the relationship between mortgage leverage and consumption around the 2008 financial crisis. Using data from the UK’s Family Expenditure Survey and Wealth and Asset Survey, we first show that high-leveraged households made larger cuts to consumption following the financial crisis, and this was largely driven by young households. Second, using a life-cycle framework, we investigate the channels by which high-leveraged households may have reduced consumption by more than others. Our key finding is that credit supply tightening is the main driver of the empirical co-movement between pre-crisis leverage and consumption growth after 2008.
D11|Integrability and Generalized Separability|This paper examines demand systems where the demand for a good depends only on its own price, consumer income, and a single aggregator synthesizing information on all other prices. This generalizes directly-separable preferences where the Lagrange multiplier provides such an aggregator. As indicated by Gorman (1972), symmetry of the Slutsky substitution terms implies that such demand can take only one of two simple forms. Conversely, here we show that only weak conditions ensure that such demand systems are integrable, i.e. can be derived from the maximization of a well-behaved utility function. This paper further studies useful properties and applications of these demand systems.
D11|Complementarity, Income, and Substitution: A U(C,N) Utility for Macro|"In business-cycle, macro models the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) governs the economy's response to demand shocks and policy changes (""multipliers""). With general non-separable preferences, the EIS is determined by consumption-hours complementarity and the income effect on hours. Complementarity helps generate business-cycle co-movement following demand shocks, fiscal multipliers, and allows reconciling low EIS with low income-wealth effects. Yet existing utility functions restrict either complementarity, or income effects---or both---and artificially imply that EIS is exclusively a function of either. I propose a novel utility function where both complementarity and the income effect are arbitrary and can be calibrated separately."
D11|Innovation and Distribution: A General Equilibrium Model of Manufacturing and Retailing|I propose a general equilibrium model of competition in manufacturing and retailing. Relative to the counterfactual of direct sales by manufacturers, the retail sector increases manufacturing entry and produced variety. Although double marginalization in the sales channel raises prices and hurts consumers in quantity, the retail sector increases variety and convenience, both valued positively. Pricing power in the vertical channel reflects surplus or scarcity of manufactured substitutes relative to retailer store size. Finally, the size of the retail sector is a constant fraction of the total economy across nations of differing size and wealth.
D11|Behavioral Inattention|Inattention is a central, unifying theme for much of behavioral economics. It permeates such disparate fields as microeconomics, macroeconomics, finance, public economics, and industrial organization. It enables us to think in a rather consistent way about behavioral biases, speculate about their origins, and trace out their implications for market outcomes. This survey first discusses the most basic models of attention, using a fairly unified framework. Then, it discusses the methods used to measure attention, which present a number of challenges on which a great deal of progress has been achieved, although much more work needs to be done. It then examines the various theories of attention, both behavioral and more Bayesian. It finally discusses some applications. For instance, inattention offers a way to write a behavioral version of basic microeconomics, as in consumer theory and Arrow-Debreu. A last section is devoted to open questions in the attention literature. This chapter is a pedagogical guide to the literature on attention. Derivations are self-contained.
D11|The Non-Existence of Representative Agents|We characterize environments in which there exists a representative agent: an agent who inherits the structure of preferences of the population that she represents. The existence of such a representative agent imposes strong restrictions on individual utility functions, requiring them to be linear in the allocation and additively separable in any parameter that characterizes agents' preferences (e.g., a risk aversion parameter, a discount factor, etc.). Commonly used classes of utility functions (exponentially discounted utility functions, CRRA or CARA utility functions, logarithmic functions, etc.) do not admit a representative agent.
D11|Preferences Under Ignorance|A decision maker (DM) makes choices from different sets of alternatives. The DM is initially ignorant of the payoff associated with each alternative and learns these payoffs only after a large number of choices have been made. We show that, in the presence of an outside option, once payoffs are learned, the optimal choice rule from sets of alternatives can be rationalized by a DM with strict preferences over all alternatives. Under this model, the DM has preferences for preferences while being ignorant of what preferences are “right.”
D11|Consumption Response to Aggregate Shocks and the Role of Leverage|This paper investigates the relationship between mortgage leverage and consumption around the 2008 financial crisis. Using data from the UK’s Family Expenditure Survey and Wealth and Asset Survey, we first show that high-leveraged households made larger cuts to consumption following the financial crisis, and this was largely driven by young households. Second, using a life-cycle framework, we investigate the channels by which high-leveraged households may have reduced consumption by more than others. Our key finding is that credit supply tightening is the main driver of the empirical co-movement between pre-crisis leverage and consumption growth after 2008.
D11|A Not so Myopic Axiomatization of Discounting|This article builds an axiomatization of inter-temporal trade-offs that makes an explicit account of the distant future and therefore encompasses motives related to sustainability, transmission to offsprings and altruism. The focus is on separable representations and the approach is completed following a decision-theory index based approach that is applied to utility streams. This enlightens the limits of the commonly used tail intensity requesites for the evaluation of utility streams: in this article, these are supersed and replaced by an axiomatic approach to optimal myopia degrees that in its turn precedes the determination of optimal discount. The overall approach is anchored in the new and explicit proof of a temporal decomposition of the preference orders between the distant future and the close future itself directly related to the determination of the optimal myopia degrees. The argument is shown to provide a novel understanding of temporal biases with the scope for a distant future bias when the finite dimensional gets influenced by the infinite dimensional. The reference to robust orders and pessimism-like axioms finally allows for determining tractable representations for the indexes.
D11|Time Rebound Effect in Households’ Energy Use: Theory and Evidence|Time-saving (time-efficient) goods and services are increasingly developed and diffused. Such goods and services increase the disposable time for households, and the time saved may be allocated to other activities consuming energy/electricity. The present study sets a simple theoretical model and shows a mechanism, called the time rebound effect, with which time-saving goods increase energy consumption through household behaviors. Furthermore, we reveal empirical evidence for this model by conducting a Japanese household survey. In particular, our analysis shows that the time rebound effect occurs on using the dishwasher, clothes dryer, or a net ordering/delivery service. However, its impact is very small: the extra electricity usage is about 1.4% of the daily usage at most.
D11|Rationally Inattentive Consumer: An Experiment|This paper presents a laboratory experiment that directly tests the theoretical predictions of consumption choices under rational inattention. Subjects are asked to select consumption when income is random. They can optimally decide to reduce uncertainty about income by acquiring signals about it. The informativeness of the signals directly relates to the cognitive effort required to process the information. We find that subjects’ behavior is largely in line with the predictions of the theory: 1) Subjects optimally make stochastic consumption choices; 2) They respond to incentives and changes in the economic environment by varying their attention and consumption; 3) They respond asymmetrically to positive and negative shocks to income, with negative shocks triggering stronger and faster reactions than positive shocks.
D11|A lattice test for additive separability| We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for a finite data set of price and demand observations to be consistent with an additively separable preference. We do so without imposing concavity on any of the subutility functions or convexity of the budget set a priori, thereby generalizing earlier results. Our simple and intuitive lattice test easily accommodates departures from rationality, or errors, which subsequently facilitates a rich empirical analysis. We apply our econometric techniques to the food consumption of a panel of British households. The primary empirical finding is that additive separability has considerable success in explaining the data.
D11|Economics of obesity ? case studies|"The paper deals with the economics of obesity and consumer decision-making. This paper aims to suggest measures to reduce obesity. The author links economics and some other scientific disciplines, for example, physiology, endocrinology, genetics, etc. Three economic case studies show how all these disciplines play a crucial role in the causes of obesity. Based on the economic case studies, the author suggests the ""treatment"" of obesity. It includes 1) the tax on unhealthy food (artificial sugar or fructose syrup); 2) sports subsidies or support of sport by public health insurance; and 3) restriction on the use of antibiotics. A secondary result of the paper is that individual preferences are not stable due to the changeable set of body and processes inside."
D11|Costly Self-Control and Limited Willpower|In Gul and Pesendorfer (2001), a decision-maker, when facing a choice among menus, evaluates each menu in terms of the maximum value of its normative utility net of self-control costs. This paper extends the model such that this maximum is constrained by the condition that the cost of self-control cannot exceed the decision-makerís stock of willpower w. In our characterization, choices within menus that satisfy the weak axiom of revealed preferences (WARP) reveal a constant trade-off between normative and temptation utilities. However, it is the discontinuity of preferences over menus (along with violations of WARP for choices within menus) that reveals w (measured in units of temptation utility), allowing for a behaviorally meaningful comparative measure of self-control across individuals.
D11|Temptation with uncertain normative preference|We model a decision maker who anticipates being tempted but is also uncertain about what is normatively best. Our model is an extended version of Gul and Pesendorfer's (2001) with three time periods: in the ex ante period the agent chooses a set of menus, in the interim period she chooses a menu from this set, and in the final period she chooses from the menu. We posit axioms from the ex ante perspective. Our main axioms on preference state that the agent prefers flexibility in the ex ante period and the option to commit in the interim period. Our representation is a generalization of Dekel et al.'s (2009)and identifies the agent's multiple normative preferences and multiple temptations. We also characterize the uncertain normative preference analogue to the representation of Stovall (2010). Finally, we characterize the special case where normative preference is not uncertain. This special case allows us to uniquely identify all components of the representations of Dekel et al. (2009) and Stovall (2010).
D11|Measuring tastes for equity and aggregate wealth behind the veil of ignorance|We propose an instrument to measure individuals' social preferences regarding equity and efficiency behind a veil of ignorance. We pair portfolio and wealth distribution choice problems which have a common budget set. For a given bundle, the distribution over an individual's wealth is the same for both problems. The portfolio choice serves as a benchmark to evaluate whether the wealth distribution choice exhibits equity or efficiency preferring tastes. We report experiments using a within-subject design testing the veracity of this instrument. We find clusters of equity preferring, efficiency preferring, and socially agnostic individuals through reduced form, revealed preference, and structural estimation analyses.
D11|Consumers' Privacy Choices in the Era of Big Data|Recent progress in information technologies provides sellers with detailed knowledge about consumers' preferences, approaching perfect price discrimination in the limit. We construct a model where consumers with less strategic sophistication than the seller's pricing algorithm face a trade-off when buying. They choose between a direct, transaction cost-free sales channel and a privacy-protecting, but costly, anonymous channel. We show that the anonymous channel is used even in the absence of an explicit taste for privacy if consumers are not too strategically sophisticated. This provides a micro-foundation for consumers' privacy choices. Some consumers benefit but others suffer from their anonymization.

D11|Demand Shocks, Learning-by-Doing and Exclusion|This note examines how an exogenous industry-wide demand shock, such as the one resulting from the use of governmental subsidies, affects the exclusionary potential of learning-by-doing. We develop a two-period duopoly model in which an increase in a firm's first-period output leads to a decrease in its second-period marginal cost, and apply it to two special scenarios: one in which demand and learning technologies are linear and one in which firms are infinitely impatient. In the first scenario, we establish that a positive demand shock amplifies the exclusionary effect of learning-by-doing if and only if firms are sufficiently asymmetric in their learning abilities. In the second scenario, we emphasize the key role of the demand curvature as a determinant of the effect of a demand shock on the exclusionary potential of learning-by-doing.
D11|Consumer Search and Retail Market Structure|This paper proposes a framework for studying how consumer search frictions affect retail market structure. In our model single-product firms which supply different products can merge to form a multiproduct firm. Consumers wish to buy multiple products and value the one-stop shopping convenience associated with a multiproduct firm. We find that when the search friction is relatively large all firms are multiproduct in equilibrium. However when the search friction is smaller the equilibrium market structure is asymmetric, with single-product and multiproduct firms coexisting. This asymmetric market structure often leads to the weakest price competition, and is the worst for consumers among all possible market structures. Due to the endogeneity of market structure, a reduction in the search friction can increase market prices and decrease consumer welfare.
D11|Estimating the Benefits and Costs of New and Disappearing Products|A major challenge facing statistical agencies is the problem of adjusting price and quantity indexes for changes in the availability of commodities. This problem arises in the scanner data context as products in a commodity stratum appear and disappear in retail outlets. Hicks suggested a reservation price methodology for dealing with this problem in the context of the economic approach to index number theory. Feenstra and Hausman suggested specific methods for implementing the Hicksian approach. The present paper evaluates these approaches and suggests some alternative approaches to the estimation of reservation prices. The various approaches are implemented using some scanner data on frozen juice products that are available online.
D11|Normality of demand in a two-goods setting|We study the testable implications of normal demand in a two-goods setting. For a finite dataset on prices and quantities, we present the revealed preference conditions for normality of one or both goods. Our characterization provides an intuitive extension of the well-known Weak Axiom of Revealed Preference, and is easy to use in practice. We illustrate the empirical relevance of our theoretical results through an application to an experimental dataset. We also briefly discuss extensions of our conditions to a setting with more than two goods.
D11|Transitivity of preferences: when does it matter?|We define necessary and sufficient conditions on prices and incomes under which quantity choices can violate SARP (Strong Axiom of Revealed Preference) but not WARP (Weak Axiom of Revealed Preference). As SARP extends WARP by additionally imposing transitivity on the revealed preference relation, this effectively defines the conditions under which transitivity adds bite to the empirical analysis. For finite datasets, our characterization takes the form of a triangular condition that must hold for all three-element subsets of normalized prices, and which is easy to verify in practice. For infinite datasets, we formally establish an intuitive connection between our characterization and the concept of Hicksian aggregation. We demonstrate the practical use of our conditions through two empirical illustrations.
D11|Clipping Coupons: Redemption of Offers with Forward-Looking Consumers|Consumer redemption behavior pertaining to coupons, gift certificates, product sampling, rebates, and the like, has been the focus of much scholarly inquiry and the extant literature has documented two noteworthy empirical regularities - a bump in redemptions close to offer expiry and greater redemption with shorter redemption windows. In the extant work, these phenomena have been explained by invoking myopic consumers. Against this backdrop, we ask a simple question: can these phenomena survive if we assume rational, forward-looking consumers? Accordingly, we develop a model consisting exclusively of forward-looking consumers and incorporate two constructs highlighted in the literature - forgetting and stochastic redemption costs. We derive consumers' period-by-period redemption rule and subsequently illustrate the emergence of the two aforementioned empirical regularities.
D11|Divisia And Frisch Are Friends|Divisia indexes and the less-well-known Frisch counterparts both involve weighted logarithmic changes of prices/quantities. This paper shows how they can be used in tandem to understand interesting aspects of consumer behaviour. The indexes can be used for measurement of quality and its price; the estimation of the income elasticity of the marginal utility of income, which is related to the overall degree of substitution among goods in the consumer’s basket; and for the analysis of the bias in the consumer price index due to the neglect of substitution effects. In this sense, Divisia and Frisch (indexes) are friends.
D11|Hyperbolic discounting can be good for your health|It has been argued that hyperbolic discounting of future gains and losses leads to time-inconsistent behavior and thereby, in the context of health economics, not enough investment in health and too much indulgence of unhealthy consumption. Here, we challenge this view. We set up a life-cycle model of human aging and longevity in which individuals discount the future hyperbolically and make time-consistent decisions. This allows us to disentangle the role of discounting from the time consistency issue. We show that hyperbolically discounting individuals, under a reasonable normalization, invest more in their health than they would if they had a constant rate of time preference. Using a calibrated life-cycle model of human aging, we predict that the average U.S. American lives about 4 years longer with hyperbolic discounting than he would if he had applied a constant discount rate. The reason is that, under hyperbolic discounting, experiences in old age receive a relatively high weight in life time utility. In an extension we show that the introduction of health-dependent survival probability motivates an increasing discount rate for the elderly and, in the aggregate, a u-shaped pattern of the discount rate with respect to age.
D11|I shouldn't eat this donut: Self-control, body weight, and health in a life cycle model|In this paper I discuss overweight and obesity and their repercussions on health deficit accumulation and longevity in a life cycle model. Individual decisions are conceptualized as the partial control of impulsive desires of a short-run self (the limbic system) by a rationally forward-looking long-run self (the prefrontal cortex). The short-run self-strives for immediate gratification through consumption of food and other goods. The long-run self reflects the consequences of eating behavior on weight gain and health, exercises to lose weight, invests money to improve health and saves for health expenditure in old age. Not conceding to short-run desires, however, entails an idiosyncratic utility cost of self-control. The model is calibrated to match food expenditure, exercise, and other choices of an average U.S. American. The results suggest that imperfect self-control reduces average lifetime by up to five years. I use the model to analyze the role of self-control, income, food prices, energy density, and medical progress in explaining obesity and to develop a test on whether obesity is driven by excessive desire for food or lack of self-control.
D11|Social limits to redistribution and conspicuous norms|In this article the author considers an economy in which individuals are matched into pairs and the desirability of an individual depends on her position on the distribution of wealth. The author assumes that individuals show their relative standing by consuming a conspicuous good and he shows that there exist different social norms supporting different matching arrangements. In addition, individuals have to vote over a redistributive policy and the author shows that, despite the desirability of the full redistributive outcomes, under some economic conditions the medium class is able to match with the higher class in exchange of a minimum level of redistribution of wealth which keeps the lower class far from economic and social opportunities.
D11|A parametric social security system with skills heterogeneous agents|The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of exogenous social security system parameters on welfare. The set up is an overlapping generations economy, with skills heterogeneity, which distinguishes consumers between high and low skilled. The lowskilled receive an extra supplement pension. The social security system has three exogenous parameters: the benefits, the contributions, and the funding parameter. The author examines and compares the effects of these three exogenous social security parameters, first under inelastic and then under elastic labor supply, on individuals welfare. He finds that when labor supply is inelastic, the parameters affect differently the welfare of the high and the low-skilled, since for the latter, we must also take into account the indirect effects through the supplement pension provision. When labor supply is elastic, the effects of changes in the social security parameters on welfare are the same for both the high and the low skilled, as in the case of inelastic labor supply.
D11|Values, attitudes and economic behavior|In this paper, I propose a simple model in which behavior is determined by the individual's attitude towards the behavior and the attitude depends on the individual's values. The model is based on the Schwartz theory of human values, which is very prominent in social psychology. Values are desirable, transsituational, abstract goals. In the model, they fix aspiration levels for specific targets that are related to an object. The distance between the properties of an object and the aspiration levels determines the degree of the agent's satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the properties of the object. Attitude is the importance-weighted sum of the degrees of (dis-)satisfaction. The model highlights the importance of systematic and measurable heterogeneity among individuals and shows how values can predict differences in tastes and sensitivity to income and prices. The model also explains when Veblen effects occur.
D11|Strategic Inattention in Product Search|Online platforms provide search tools that help consumers to get better-fitting product offers. But this technology makes consumer search behavior also easily traceable and allows for real-time price discrimination. Consumers face a trade-off: Search intensely and receive a better fit at a potentially higher price or restrict search behavior – be strategically inattentive – and receive a worse fit, but maybe a better deal. We study the resulting strategic buyer-seller interaction theoretically as well as experimentally. Our experimental results show that it is the sellers and not the buyers who profit from these search tools.
D11|Time will tell - Recovering Preferences when Choices are Noisy|The ability to uncover preferences from choices is fundamental for both positive economics and welfare analysis. Overwhelming evidence shows that choice is stochastic, which has given rise to random utility models as the dominant paradigm in applied microeconomics. However, as is well known, it is not possible to infer the structure of preferences in the absence of assumptions on the structure of noise. This makes it impossible to empirically test the structure of noise independently from the structure of preferences. Here, we show that the difficulty can be bypassed if data sets are enlarged to include response times. A simple condition on response time distributions (a weaker version of first order stochastic dominance) ensures that choices reveal preferences without assumptions on the structure of utility noise. Sharper results are obtained if the analysis is restricted to specific classes of models. Under symmetric noise, response times allow to uncover preferences for choice pairs outside the data set, and if noise is Fechnerian, even choice probabilities can be forecast out of sample. We conclude by showing that standard random utility models from economics and standard drift-diffusion models from psychology necessarily generate data sets fulfilling our sufficient condition on response time distributions.
D11|Does willingness to pay increase with the number and strictness of sustainability labels?|Labels signaling sustainable product attributes are gaining importance, although uncertainty concerning the environmental, microâ€ and macroeconomic benefits of such labels persist. One of the questions still incompletely answered is whether Willingness To Pay (WTP) varies with a gradually increasing number of labels on a food product. In order to answer this question, we conducted a laboratory experiment with 191 student respondents, testing consumer valuations of different labeling strategies. Using the Beckerâ€ DeGrootâ€ Marschak mechanism, WTP for 15 food products was measured. The products were endowed with up to six different sustainability labels, such that each grocery item was available in eight product versions. For perishable, nonperishable, and plantâ€ based products, the results indicate that participants are prone to allocating WTPâ€ premiums to labeled products, more than to unlabeled products. For animal products, however, labels do not influence WTP significantly. Furthermore, the premiums do not vary with an increasing number of labels, irrespective of whether the labels signal substitute or complementary sustainability information. The results are not entirely in line with normative notions of magnitude variation, but rather with the behavioral economic concept of embedding effects.
D11|Coarse Competitive Equilibrium and Extreme Prices|We introduce a notion of coarse competitive equilibrium, to study agents' inability to tailor their consumption to prices. Our goal is to incorporate limited cognitive ability (in particular limited attention, memory, and complexity) into the analysis of competitive equilibrium. Compared to standard competitive equilibrium, our concept yields more extreme prices and, when all agents have the same endowment, riskier allocations. We provide a tractable model suitable for general equilibrium analysis as well as asset pricing.
D11|Unplanned Purchases and Retail Competition|I propose a framework in which asymmetric multiproduct retailers compete for one-stop shoppers who have biased beliefs about their future purchase probabilities (and so make unplanned purchases). One firm carries a full portfolio of products while the other carries an incomplete but endogenous one. Using this framework, I examine the phenomenon of loss leading, the optimal product portfolio of the smaller firm, and the effects of banning loss leading. Among other results, I show that there is a nonpredatory (and possibly procompetitive) justification for the observation that such larger firms may charge below cost on the core product lines of their smaller rivals.
D11|A Comprehensive Approach to Revealed Preference Theory|We develop a version of Afriat's theorem that is applicable in a variety of choice environments beyond the setting of classical consumer theory. This allows us to devise tests for rationalizability in environments where the set of alternatives is not the positive orthant of a Euclidean space and where the rationalizing utility function is required to satisfy properties appropriate to that environment. We show that our results are applicable, amongst others, to choice data on lotteries, contingent consumption, and intertemporal consumption.
D11|Correlation Misperception in Choice|We present a decision-theoretic analysis of an agent's understanding of the interdependencies in her choices. We provide the foundations for a simple and flexible model that allows the misperception of correlated risks. We introduce a framework in which the decision maker chooses a portfolio of assets among which she may misperceive the joint returns, and present simple axioms equivalent to a representation in which she attaches a probability to each possible joint distribution over returns and then maximizes subjective expected utility using her (possibly misspecified) beliefs.
D11|Social Status in Networks|We study social comparisons and status seeking in an interconnected society. Individuals take costly actions that have direct benefits and also confer social status. A new measure of interconnectedness--cohesion--captures the intensity of incentives for seeking status. Equilibria stratify players into social classes, with each class's action pinned down by cohesion. A network decomposition algorithm characterizes the highest (and most inefficient) equilibrium. Members of the largest maximally cohesive set form the highest class. Alternatively, players not belonging to sets more cohesive than the set of all nodes constitute the lowest class. Intermediate classes are identified by iterating a cohesion operator. We also characterize networks that accommodate multiple-class equilibria.
D11|From Peer Pressure to Biased Norms|This paper studies a coordination game between a continuum of players with heterogeneous tastes who perceive peer pressure when behaving differently from each other. It characterizes the conditions under which a social norm--a mode of behavior followed by many--exists in equilibrium and the patterns of norm compliance. The emergent norm may be biased compared to the average taste in society, yet endogenously upheld by the population. Strikingly, a biased norm will, under some circumstances, be more sustainable than a non-biased norm, which may explain the bias of various social and religious norms.
D11|Heterogeneity, Demand for Insurance, and Adverse Selection|Recent evidence underlines the importance of demand frictions distorting insurance choices. Heterogeneous frictions cause the willingness to pay for insurance to be biased upward (relative to value) for those purchasing insurance, but downward for those who remain uninsured. The paper integrates this finding with standard methods for evaluating welfare in insurance markets and demonstrates how welfare conclusions regarding adversely selected markets are affected. The demand frictions framework also makes qualitatively different predictions about the desirability of policies, such as insurance subsidies and mandates, commonly used to tackle adverse selection.
D11|Consumer Demand for Nut Products in the United States: Application of Semi-parametric Estimation of Censored Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System (C-QUAIDS) with Household-Level Micro Data| The United States is a dominant player in the world tree nut production with the value of nuts produced exceeded $10 billion by 2015. Annual per capita consumption of nuts in the United States has been growing during past 25 years due to increase in nutrition and health benefits of nuts. Few studies that looked at the economics of nuts in the United States come short in examining demand interrelationships between various tree nut products and peanuts to uncover complex substitutability/complementarity patterns through derivation of own-price, cross-price and income/expenditure elasticities. Demographic factors affecting the consumer demand for nut products is yet to be investigated as well. Quantity, expenditure and household demographic characteristics with respect to purchase of almonds, pecans, walnuts, pistachios, cashew nuts and peanuts obtained from 2014 Nielsen Homescan scanner panel for 65,000 U.S. households was used in estimating censored quadratic almost ideal demand system using semiparametric estimation procedure suggested by Sam and Zheng (2010). Preliminary results show that the own-price elasticity of demand for almonds, pecans, walnuts, pistachios, cashew nuts and peanuts is -0.75, -0.98, -1.05, -0.53, -0.56, and -0.17. Income, age, region and presence of children are significant drivers of demand for these nut products.
D11|Mind the gap: the economic problem as an interplay among desires, matter, and energy| There is a rich literature on the economic importance of energy. Yet, little has been achieved to harmonize core economic theory with energetic principles. This paper proposes a theoretical framework that might prove valuable to do so, based on a slight conceptual modification of the neoclassical economic problem. By conceiving its necessary condition not as desires but as gaps between desired and spontaneous states of material reality, an extension of economic imperialism towards the realm of energetics is enabled. When the origin of the economic problem is placed on physical divergences, goods are exposed as specific material configurations that close gaps. And as material rearrangements can only be achieved through energy transferred by prime movers (e.g. workers, horses, engines), such transfers are revealed as the essence of economic activity. Thus, whenever energy and power constrained agents are analyzed, the derivation of optimization procedures follows intuitively: consumer’s constraints are energetic, where economic energies play the role of prices, and firm’s profits are energy surpluses, where prime movers play the role of factors of production. This leads to familiar refutable hypothesis expressed in energy terms. Furthermore, equilibrium is characterized by the schedule of energy assignments that lead to utility maximization, for any set of economic energies and energy contents of goods. Although only autarchic and single-period agents are analyzed, the stage is set to analyze exchanging and multi-period agents, which could allow for a general interpretation of economic fundamentals (e.g. prices, capital) as visible social expressions of invisible energetic dynamics.
D11|The Taste for Variety: Demand Analysis for Nut Products in the United States| The purpose of this study is to augment the classical demand model with consumer’s variety-seeking behavior using 2004-2014 weekly Nielsen scanner data for nut products. We introduce an index variable of taste for variety into the Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System model with pre-committed quantities. Results show that consumers do respond to the price of nut products since the pre-committed quantities only account for 10% of total consumptions. Consumers purchase more tree nut products while seeking variety, including pecan, walnut, and pistachio, and demand interrelationships among nut products change after allowing consumers to compensate through income.
D11|Assessing Provincial-Level Demand For Food Quantity And Quality In China: An Easi Demand System Approach| Food consumers in China have undergone significant changes in their food consumption patterns and have become more dependent on animal products for protein, while substituting fine grains for coarse grains. Considerable research effort has been devoted to this topic. A majority of these studies rely on the AIDS model, which has linear Engel and ignores unobserved consumer heterogeneity. We study food demand in China using the Exact Affine Stone Index (EASI) system. The EASI model not only shares all of the desirable properties of the AIDS model but also provides additional benefits. Specifically, it is not subject to the rank three limitation of Gorman (1981) and allows the Engel curves to take arbitrary shapes. Further, the EASI accounts for unobserved consumer heterogeneity. This is especially important in welfare studies conducted on consumer-level since much of the demand variation is left unexplained. Previous studies focus on changes in quantities, however we reveal that quality is also very important. Further, results confirm the prevalence of unobserved heterogeneity in consumer food preferences across provinces in China. By enhancing the findings of previous studies, this study elicits more realistic food preferences in China for agricultural policy, trade, and foreign direct investment decisions.
D11|Household Demand for Meat in Nigeria| This study was an application of the Linear Approximate Almost Ideal Demand System (LA-AIDS) model on household aggregate meat demand in Nigeria. The data used was obtained from the World Bank’s Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) on households in Nigeria. Previous research had studied demand only at a regional level but this study estimates meat demand at a national level. The results showed that beef was a necessity while goat, chicken and mutton were luxuries. The results further revealed that all the meat products considered were normal goods with own-prices that were negative and consistent with demand theory except mutton. Goat meat and mutton were price elastic and as such, price changes for these products will affect their consumers more than consumers of other meat products that were less elastic.
D11|Economic analysis of the link between diet quality and health: Evidence from Kosovo|We analyse the link between diet diversity, (which is a proxy of diet quality) and health outcomes measured by body-mass index (BMI) in a representative sample of Kosovar adults using household expenditure micro-data. Building on a household model of health production we devise a two-stage empirical strategy to estimate the determinants of diet diversity and its effect on BMI. Economic factors and demographic characteristics play an important role in the choice of balanced diets. Results from the BMI analysis support the hypothesis that diet diversity is associated with optimal BMI. One standard deviation increase in diet diversity leads to 2.3% increase in BMI of the underweight individuals and to 1.5% reduction in BMI of the obese individuals. The findings have important implications for food security policies aiming at enhancing the public health in Kosovo.
D11|Price Discrimination and Dispersion under Asymmetric Profiling of Consumers|Two duopolists compete in price on the market for a homogeneous product. They can use a 'profiling technology' that allows them to identify the willingness-to-pay of their consumers with some probability. If both firms have profiling technologies of the exact same precision, or if one firm cannot use any profiling technology, then the Bertrand paradox continues to prevail. Yet, if firms have technologies of different precisions, then the price equilibrium exhibits both price discrimination and price dispersion, with positive expected profits. Increasing the precision of both firms' technologies does not necessarily harm consumers.
D11|Economic rationality under cognitive load|Economic analysis assumes that consumer behavior can be rationalized by a utility function. Previous research has shown that some decision-making quality can be captured by permanent cognitive ability but has not examined how a temporary load in subjects' working memory can affect economic rationality. In a controlled laboratory experiment, we exogenously vary cognitive load by asking subjects to memorize a number while they undertake an induced budget allocation task (Choi et al., 2007a,b). Using a number of manipulation checks, we verify that cognitive load has adverse affects on subjects' performance in reasoning tasks. However, we find no effect in any of the goodness-of-fit measures that measure consistency of subjects' choices with the Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preferences (GARP), despite having a sample size large enough to detect even small differences between treatments with 80% power. Our finding suggests that researchers need not worry about economic rationality breaking down when subjects are placed under temporary working memory load.
D11|Compensating the Compensating Variation|The message of this note is that in a general equilibrium setting the compensating variation is numéraire dependent. In contrast, the equivalent variation is neutral regarding the choice of value units. We illustrate with a simple example and propose an even simpler solution to overcome this bias in the compensating variation; all that is required to have a correct welfare estimate is to compensate the compensating variation by normalization with a price index. This type of correction is necessary to overcome the often blind implementation of welfare measures in numerical general equilibrium.
D11|Identification of Random Resource Shares in Collective Households Without Preference Similarity Restrictions|Resource shares, defined as the fraction of total household spending going to each person in a household, are important for assessing individual material well-being, inequality and poverty. They are difficult to identify because consumption is measured typically at the household level, and many goods are jointly consumed, so that individual-level consumption in multi-person households is not directly observed. We consider random resource shares, which vary across observationally identical households. We provide theorems that identify the distribution of random resource shares across households, including children’s shares. We also provide a new method of identifying the level of fixed or random resource shares that does not require previously needed preference similarity restrictions or marriage market assumptions. Our results can be applied to data with or without price variation. We apply our results to households in Malawi, estimating the distributions of child and female poverty across households.
D11|Collective household welfare and intra-household inequality|We investigate the relationship between the individual and household indirect utility functions in the context of a collective household model. Our analysis produces new results that explain how the rule governing the distribution of resources among household members is related to the measurement of household welfare and intra-household inequality. We show that in a collective model of private consumption, income shares are equal to the product of two weights: the Pareto weight and a distribution weight reflecting income effects across individuals. For a weighted Bergsonian representation of household utility and general assumptions about individual preferences, we derive the associated household welfare functions and intra-household inequality measures belonging to a family of entropy indexes. We illustrate our findings with an empirical application that estimates a collective demand system to recover associated individual and household welfare functions along with the measures of intra-household inequality. This is the first application that estimates the Pareto weight and examines its role within a measure of income dispersion among household members.
D11|Dynamic Pricing with Search Frictions|This paper studies dynamic pricing in markets with search frictions. Sellers have a single unit of a good and post prices in every trading period. Buyers have to incur a search cost to match with a new seller and upon matching they observe the price and the realization of some idiosyncratic match value. There is no discounting but trade ends at an exogenously given deadline. We show that equilibrium involves trading in nitely many trading periods and the volume of trade increases over time. Under mild conditions on the buyerto- seller ratio and the distribution of valuations, prices decrease at increasing rates as the deadline approaches. We derive the gains from trade in equilibrium and their distribution between buyers and sellers. For the case in which the measures of buyers and sellers coincide, we provide a full characterization of the (unique) equilibrium for a class of distribution functions. We nally discuss implications for market design, including the use of platform fees and cancellation policies.
D11|Assisted Self-Persuasion: Advertising with Consumer Adjustment to Choice|I develop a new theory of persuasive advertising in which consumers rationally adjust to (i.e., improve their attitude toward) the products they choose and advertising facilitates adjustment. Advertisings price effects depend on whether marginal or inframarginal consumers are most heavily targeted, consistent with the literature. But they also depend on advertisings role as an overall adjustment intensifier, whence variation in the cost of adjustment with the strength of the consumers initial product preference determines the equilibrium price level. Whether too much or too little advertising is provided in equilibrium depends on the sign and size of advertisings price effect, the relative density of marginal consumers, and the relative extent to which advertisings adjustment cost reductions benefit marginal consumers.
D11|To Glance or to Peruse: Observational and Active Learning from Peer Consumers|This paper examines consumer social learning patterns in decision making. I propose a novel model that decomposes the learning process into two stages: observational learning, where a consumer quickly updates the belief about a product after observing its salient social-based characteristics (such as popularity), and time-consuming active learning through descriptive information content (such as consumer reviews). By demonstrating the interplay between the two stages, the model brings together previous literature that studies these separately. I characterize the optimal learning time, and provide comparative statics which show that an increase in the discount rate or in the product’s economic value drives consumers to rely more on observational learning. I test this model using unique transaction-level data for air purifiers sold on a Chinese online platform from January to March 2014. Exploiting an unexpected air pollution crisis in late February 2014, I find that past sales have greater weight as a reference for comparison among products during the pollution crisis than in regular times. I also document that, after the episode, consumers rely less on observational learning compared to periods before the crisis, which is consistent with the model’s predictions as sales made during the crisis convey less information.
D11|The Cobb-Douglas function for a continuum model|This paper introduces two formal equivalent definitions of the Cobb-Douglas function for a continuum model based on a generalization of the Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) function for a continuum under not necessarily constant returns to scale and based on principles of product calculus. New properties are developed, and to illustrate the potential of using the product integral and its functional derivative, it is shown how the profit maximization problem of a single competitive firm using a continuum of factors of production can be solved in a manner that is completely analogous to the one used in the discrete case. ***** Este artículo introduce dos definiciones formales equivalentes de la función CobbDouglas para un modelo continuo basadas en una generalización de la función de elasticidad de sustitución constante (CES) para un continuo bajo rendimientos a escala no necesariamente constantes y con base en principios del cálculo de producto. Se desarrollan propiedades nuevas; y para ilustrar el potencial de usar la integral producto y su derivada funcional, se muestra cómo el problema de maximización de beneficios de una única empresa competitiva que usa un continuo de factores de producción se puede solucionar de una manera completamente análoga a la utilizada en el caso discreto.
D11|Enlarging the collective model of household behavior: A revealed preference analysis|Abstract We use a comprehensive model of strategic household behavior in which the spouses’ expenditure on each public good is decomposed into autonomous spending and coordinated spending à la Lindahl. We obtain a continuum of semi-cooperative regimes parameterized by the relative weights put on autonomous spending, by each spouse and for each public good, nesting full cooperative and noncooperative regimes as limit cases. Testing is approached through revealed preference analysis, by looking for rationalizability of observed data sets, with the price of each public good lying between the maximum and the sum of the hypothesized marginal willingness to pay of the two spouses. Once rationalized, an observed data set always allows to identify the sharing rule, except when both spouses contribute in full autonomy to some public good (a situation of local income pooling).
D11|Survivor: Three Principles of Economics Lessons as Taught by a Reality Television Show|The reality television show Survivor has been a ratings success on CBS for over 16 years. In the show, 16 strangers are marooned in a remote location, required to compete in physical and mental challenges, and periodically vote to eliminate players from the game. The last person remaining wins one million dollars. I use this popular television show to demonstrate three important lessons from principles of microeconomics: (a) for individual decision-making, concepts like pride and honor may belong in the utility function, alongside more classical components such as consumption of goods and services, (b) thinking through how others will respond to your action is critical for good economic and strategic thinking, and (c) repeated interaction can help collusive behavior hold.
D11|Beyond Ces: Three Alternative Classes of Flexible Homothetic Demand Systems|We characterize three classes of demand systems, all of which are defined non-parametrically: homothetic demand systems with a single aggregator (HSA), those with direct implicit additivity (HDIA), and those with indirect implicit additivity (HIIA). In HSA, all the cross-price effects are captured by one price aggregator, while in HDIA and in HIIA, they are captured by two price aggregators. Each of these three classes contains CES as a special case. Yet, they are pairwise disjoint with the sole exception of CES. Thus, these classes of homothetic demand systems offer us three alternative ways of departing from CES
D11|Attention Manipulation and Information Overload|When a decision-maker’s attention is limited, her decisions depend on what she focuses on. This gives interested parties an incentive to manipulate not only the substance of communication but also the decision-maker’s attention allocation. This paper models such attention manipulation. In its presence, competitive information supply can reduce the decision-maker’s knowledge by causing information overload. Further, a single information provider may deliberately induce information overload to conceal information. These findings, pertinent to consumer protection, suggest a role for rules that restrict communication, mandate not only the content but also the format of disclosure, and regulate product design.
D11|Behavioral Heterogeneity: Pareto Distributions of Homothetic Preference Scales and Aggregate Expenditures Income Elasticities|"We evaluate the income elasticity of the aggregate budget share spent on a sub-group of commodities, in a competitive framework, by a continuum of agents having the same income, but heterogeneous behavior described by an ""homothetic preferences scaling factor"" having a bounded Pareto distribution in the population. If individual budget share increases globally significantly in the limit from low to large incomes, aggregate budget share is locally increasing with medium range incomes when the logarithm of the heterogeneity factor has an increasing (exponential) density with a large support. Aggregate income elasticity converges to that exponential density parameter when its support becomes infinitely large. Symmetric results hold in the decreasing case. Applications are made to market expenditures, wealth effects on portfolio choice with many risky assets, concave expenditures, that are compatible with standard (expected) utility maximization or other ""behavioral"" decision making processes."
D11|Compulsory insurance and voluntary self-insurance: substitutes or complements? A matter of risk attitudes|Based on Ehrlich and Becker’s model (1972) on insurance and self-insurance substitutability, we study the effects of a compulsory partial insurance on self-insurance decisions of both risk-averters and (mixed) risk-lovers. We show that when insurance is compulsory, risk-averters adjust (by substituting) their self-insurance behavior to compensate for the level (too high or too low) of the compulsory coverage level. By contrast, even though they would refuse to invest in any voluntarily hedging scheme, (mixed) risk-lovers freely invest in self-insurance to complete a compulsory partial insurance coverage. Moreover, we prove that for a (mixed) risk-lover, an increase in the partial compulsory insurance coverage induces simultaneously a rise of the self-insurance marginal benefit and a decrease of its marginal cost. Therefore, while compulsory insurance and self-insurance are substitutes for risk-averters, they are complements for (mixed) risk-lovers. This last result brings an unexpected justification for compulsory insurance policies.
D11|Revealed Price Preference: Theory and Stochastic Testing|We develop a model of demand where consumers trade-off the utility of consumption against the disutility of expenditure. This model is appropriate whenever a consumer's demand over a strict subset of all available goods is being analyzed. Data sets consistent with this model are characterized by the absence of revealed preference cycles over prices. The model is readily generalized to the random utility setting, for which we develop nonparametric statistical tests. Our application on national household consumption data provides support for the model.
D11|Naiveté About Temptation and Self-Control: Foundations for Naive Quasi-Hyperbolic Discounting|We introduce and characterize a recursive model of dynamic choice that accommodates naivete about present bias. While recursive representations are important for tractable analysis of in nite-horizon problems, the commonly-used Strotz model of time inconsistency presents well-known technical difficulties in extensions to dynamic environments. Our model incorporates costly self-control in the sense of Gul and Pesendorfer (2001) to overcome these hurdles. The important novel condition is an axiom for naivete. We first introduce appropriate definitions of absolute and comparative naivete for a simple two-period model, and explore their implications for the costly self-control model. We then develop suitable extensions of these definitions to in nite-horizon environments. Incorporating the definition of absolute naivete as an axiom, we characterize a recursive representation of naive quasi-hyperbolic discounting with self-control for an individual who is jointly overoptimistic about her present-bias factor and her ability to resist instant gratification. We also study the implications of our proposed comparison of naivete for this recursive representation and uncover new restrictions on the present-bias and self-control parameters that characterize comparative naivete. Finally, we discuss the subtleties that preclude more general notions of naivete, and illuminate the impossibility of a definition that simultaneously accommodates both random choice and costly self-control.
D11|Naiveté About Temptation and Self-Control: Foundations for Naive Quasi-Hyperbolic Discounting|We introduce and characterize a recursive model of dynamic choice that accommodates naiveté about present bias. The model incorporates costly self-control in the sense of Gul and Pesendorfer (2001) to overcome the technical hurdles of the Strotz representation. The important novel condition is an axiom for naiveté. We first introduce appropriate definitions of absolute and comparative naiveté for a simple two-period model, and explore their implications for the costly self-control model. We then extend this definition for infinite-horizon environments, and discuss some of the subtleties involved with the extension. Incorporating the definition of absolute naiveté as an axiom, we characterize a recursive representation of naive quasi-hyperbolic discounting with self-control for an individual who is jointly overoptimistic about her present-bias factor and her ability to resist instant gratification. We study the implications of our proposed comparison of naiveté for the parameters of the recursive representation. Finally, we discuss the obstacles that preclude more general notions of naiveté, and illuminate the impossibility of a definition that simultaneously incorporates both random choice and costly self-control. devices.
D11|Continuous Workout Mortgages: Efficient pricing and systemic implications|This paper studies the Continuous Workout Mortgage (CWM), a two in one product: a fixed rate home loan coupled with negative equity insurance, to advocate its viability in mitigating financial fragility. In order to tackle the many issues that CWMs embrace, we perform a range of tasks. We optimally price CWMs and take a systemic market-based approach, stipulating that mortgage values and payments should be linked to housing prices and adjusted downward to prevent negative equity. We illustrate that amortizing CWMs can be the efficient home financing choice for many households. We price CWMs as American option style, defaulting debt in conjunction with prepayment within a continuous time, analytic framework. We introduce random prepayments via the intensity approach of Jarrow and Turnbull (1995). We also model the optimal embedded option to default whose exercise is motivated by decreasing random house prices. We adapt the Barone-Adesi and Whaley (1987) (BAW) approach to work within amortizing mortgage context. We derive new closed-form and new analytical approximation methodologies which apply both for pricing CWMs, as well as for pricing the standard US 30-year Fixed Rate Mortgage (FRM).
D11|Individual Dynamic Choice Behaviour and the Common Consequence Effect|What should you do when confronting a sequence of decisions such that you make some choices and chance makes some others, i.e., a dynamic decision making problem under risk? Standard economic rationality requires you to look at the final choices, determine the preferred options, choose the sequence of decisions that lead to those and follow that sequence through to the end. That behaviour is implied by the conjunction of the principles of separability, dynamic consistency and reduction of compound lotteries. Experimental research on these dynamic choice principles has been developed within the common ratio effect theoretical framework. This paper experimentally investigates what subjects do when confronting such a problem within a new theoretical framework provided by the common consequence effect that manipulates the value of the foregone-consequence in the prior risks.Results suggest that reduction of compound lotteries holds throughout, whilst dynamic consistency and separability do not and theirfailure is related to the foregone-consequence.
D11|Random Lottery Incentive Mechanism in Dynamic Choice Experiments|Cubitt, Starmer and Sugden [TheEconomic Journal, 108, 1362-80, (1998)] pose a dynamic choice argument against the random lottery incentive (RLIS) mechanism. To wit, the RLIS relies on principles of dynamic choice. Thus, experimental research on the dynamic choice principles should be conducted ina single choice design. This study attempts to evaluate the empirical validity of their argument by quasi-replicating their single choice experiment in a RLIS design. Results suggest that one may use the RLISin dynamic choice experiments.
D11|What do people ‘learn by looking’ at direct feedback on their energy consumption? Results of a field study in Southern France|The abundant literature on consumer feedback shows that it is an efficient instrument for reducing household energy consumption. However, the reported reductions are strongly dependent on contextual factors and on the type of feedback provided. Given the importance of learning to this respect, this dimension constitutes the core focus of the present study which reports the findings of the TICELEC (i.e. French acronym for information technologies for responsible electricity consumption) project in France. The experiment included a control group (G1: the self-monitoring group) and one equipped group (G2). All participants reduced their consumption and learnt either directly from feedback or indirectly through self-monitoring. The amount of energy savings, which is larger than in similar experiments, can be explained by two factors. First, the specificity of our sample (i.e. high income, high consumption) which allows for potentially large energy savings. Second, high involvement of participants and the building of trust. The quantitative and qualitative dimensions of learning are then discussed. Additionally, we focus on peak-load shifting in G2 with 2 subgroups (G21 and G22). The higher proportion of shifters in G22 and the higher ‘quality’ of their shifting suggest a higher level of learning enabled by the more sophisticated feedback. Although this translated into only a moderately higher rate of energy savings, the higher degree of absorbed knowledge (i.e. through ‘learning by looking through connecting’) might lead to a qualitatively distinctive type of energy saving.

D11|Demanda de energía eléctrica en Bolivia: un modelo SARIMA-GARCH & ARN. Demand of electric energy in Bolivia: a model SARIMA-GARCH & ARN|The forecast of demand for electric power for the National Interconnected System (SIN), is highly relevant for the planning of electric power generation and thus to be able to anticipate in an efficient and anticipated way the projects for the future generation of electric power so Of avoiding imbalances in the Wholesale Energy Market (MEM), it is also a priority of the State to know the demand for electric energy, which is set out in Agenda 2025. In this document, the monthly electricity demand of the SIN is modeled. The SARIMA model is defined, verifying that the model is correct. And to control the variation of the conditional dispersion, an ARCH model is also proposed. In order to compare the prognosis, a model of Artificial Neural Networks (ARN) is elaborated. Finally, to see the FIR of the electric energy demand against a shick in the index of conomica IGAE activity, a model of Self-Regressive Vectors is elaborated.
D11|Dynamic Status Effects, Savings, and Income Inequality|This paper advances the hypothesis that the intensity of status preferences depends negatively on the average wealth of society (endogenous dynamic status effect), in accordance with empirical evidence. Our theory replicates the contradictory historical facts of an increasing saving rate along with declining returns to capital over time. By affecting the dynamics of the saving rate, the dynamic status effect raises inequality, thereby providing a behavioural mechanism for the observed diverse dynamics of income inequality across countries. In countries in which the dynamic status effect is strong (weak) inequality rises (declines) over time in response to a positive productivity shock.

D11|Greenwashing and Its Impact on Consumer Confidence – Case Study of Slovak Republic|"""Objective – This paper is focused on the topic of greenwashing and its impact on consumer confidence in specific conditions of Slovak republic. Nowadays, consumer confidence is mainly recognized as economic indicator measuring the interpretation of the current economic environment by consumers and their expectations for the future. In presented paper, we analyse greenwashing as a possible source of discontent. Greenwashing is a negative phenomenon of green marketing activities realised in the scope of corporate social responsibility. Methodology/Technique – First, green characteristics of Slovak consumers are analysed in context of Hofstede cultural dimensions of Slovak republic. Subsequently, there is evaluated realised questionnaire survey dedicated to the analysis of greenwashing impact on consumer confidence. Then, the relationship between greenwashing and consumer confidence in Slovak market, is detected. Findings – Results showed that attitude of authority has an impact on consumer confidence and the greenwashing has not got an impact on buying behavior of Slovak consumers. Novelty – It has a vital importance to analyze socio-cultural profile of the nation and in accordance with obtained results highlight the importance of environmental education of the society. """

D11|Mediating Effect of Attitude on Awareness toward the Addiction Behaviour of Pokémon Go Players in Malaysia|"""Objective – This study looks at the addiction behaviour of Pokémon Go players in Malaysia. Its purpose is to identify the addiction behaviour of Pokémon Go players in terms of their awareness and attitude. Using the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), the objectives of the study are (1) to identify the level of awareness, attitude and addiction behaviour of Pokémon Go players in Malaysia; (2) to determine the relationships among addiction behaviour, awareness, and attitude of Pokémon Go players; and (3) to investigate the mediating effect of attitude on awareness toward the addiction behaviour of Pokémon Go players. Methodology – This study employs the quantitative research design using a self-administered survey questionnaire for data collection. A total of 270 respondents are identified from selected places in the Klang Valley. Findings – The study finds that the addiction behaviour of Pokémon Go players are significantly related to awareness and attitude. In addition, attitude partially mediates the relationship between awareness and addiction behaviour on Pokémon Go players. Novelty – The level of Pokémon Go addiction behaviour is low. Therefore, it posits that the addiction behaviour of Pokémon Go is neither chronic nor a threatening phenomenon in Malaysia. """
D11|Factors Determining Pokémon Go Addiction in Malaysia |"""Objective – This study focuses on factors determining Pokémon Go addiction behaviour among players in Malaysia. Using the Personal Construct Theory (PCT), the relationship between perception of Pokémon Go players and their addiction behaviour toward the game is examined. The objectives of this study are (1) to identify the levels of perception and addiction behaviour of the Pokémon Go players in Malaysia; (2) to determine the relationship between perception and addiction behaviour of the Pokémon Go players; and (3) to investigate the moderating effects of age, gender and ethnicity on the relationship between perception and addiction behaviour of the Pokémon Go players. Methodology/Technique – The study employs the quantitative research design. The data are collected from 270 respondents using a self-administered questionnaire. Findings – The results show that even though the addiction behaviour of Pokémon Go players is low, the perception of Pokémon Go players towards the game is positive. Therefore, both addiction behaviour and perception are positively related. Age and gender are found to be moderate in the relationship between perception and addiction behaviour. With these results, the assumptions of PCT hold true. Novelty – The present study examines the relationship between perception of Pokémon Go players and their addiction behaviour toward the game. This research can provide insights regarding mobile gaming having similar features as the Pokémon Go"""
D11|Illiquid life annuities|In this paper, we consider illiquid life annuity contracts and show that they may be preferred to those illustrated by Yaari. In an overlapping generations economy, liquid life annuities are demanded only if the equilibrium is dynamically inefficient. However, an equilibrium displaying a positive demand for illiquid life annuities is indeed efficient. In this latter case, the welfare at steady state is larger if illiquid life annuity contracts are available.
D11|The General Nesting Logit (GNL) Model using Aggregate Data|We study the general nesting logit (GNL) model for differentiated products proposed by Fosgerau and de Palma (2016) as a member of the family of generalized entropies built by Fosgerau, Melo, de Palma and Shum (2017), to estimate demand when using aggregate data. We show that the GNL model allows products to be independent, substitutable, or complementary. While Fosgerau and de Palma (2016) show that it can be transformed into a linear regression, we show that this linear regression is very similar to that of Berry (1994) for the nested logit in that it is just a regression of market shares on product characteristics and terms related to its nesting structure. We then use the Dominick's database for estimating the demand for cereals in Chicago in 1991-1992.
D11|Price Discrimination and Dispersion under Asymmetric Profiling of Consumers|Two duopolists compete in price on the market for a homogeneous product. They can use a 'profiling technology' that allows them to identify the willingness-to-pay of their consumers with some probability. If both firms have profiling technologies of the exact same precision, or if one firm cannot use any profiling technology, then the Bertrand paradox continues to prevail. Yet, if firms have technologies of different precisions, then the price equilibrium exhibits both price discrimination and price dispersion, with positive expected profits. Increasing the precision of both firms’ technologies does not necessarily harm consumers.
D11|Too slow a change? Deep habits, consumption shifts and transitory tax|This paper studies shifts in the consumption bundle when consumption is subject to habit formation, and consumers do not internalize this habit formation process. Habits are goodspecific, or ’deep’, and cause persistence in good-specific consumption. In addition, at the aggregate level, habits act as benchmark against which consumption is evaluated. I establish that a rapid transition is optimal if the persistence effect is relatively strong, and determine the path of taxes or subsidies that implements this transition, both when goods are produced competitively and when they are produced by monopolists. To explore the quantitative implications of the model I consider the introduction of a 10 percent charge on a subset of goods. I find that consumption adjusts inefficiently fast; implementing first-best adjustment requires a transitory discount of up to 60 percent of the cost increase.
D11|Consumption and Investment Demand when Health Evolves Stochastically|The health capital model of Grossman (1972) is extended to account for uncertainty in the rate at which a stock of health depreciates. Two versions of the model are contemplated, one with a fully functioning financial market and the other in its absence. The comparative dynamics of the consumption and health-investment demand functions are studied in both models in a general setting, where it is shown that the key to deriving refutable results is to determine how a parameter or state variable affects the lifetime marginal utilities of health and wealth. To add further bite to the results, a stochastic control problem is solved for its feedback consumption and health-investment demand functions, thereby yielding estimable structural demand functions.
D11|Homothetic Preferences Revealed|We propose a method to recover homothetic preferences from choice data with minor optimization or measurement errors. Our method allows for a more detailed graphical analysis to reveal subjects' preferences and to choose appropriate functional forms for parametric analysis. It can also be used to extend applications of the money metric function, such as parametric recoverability as introduced by Halevy et al. (2017). It can also improve nonparametric comparison of preferences as suggested by Heufer (2014).
D11|Revisiting, from a Frischian point of view, the relationship between elasticities of intratemporal and intertemporal substitution|How are substitution in the spatial and in the temporal sense connected? Can estimates based on data with spatial variation be transmitted into values appropriate for exploring temporal variation, and vice versa? This paper, building on, inter alia, Frisch (1959), attempts to give some clarifications and provides elements of a synthesis. The income elasticity of the marginal utility of income, whose inverse is often called the ‘Frisch parameter’, and its multi-period counterpart, the wealth elasticity of the marginal utility of wealth, are key concepts. Three cases with additive preferences are discussed, and in that context the role of the (generalized) ‘Frisch parameter’ as an overall measure of substitution across commodities and over time is reconsidered.
D11|Estimating Taxable Income Responses with Elasticity Heterogeneity|We extend a standard taxable income model with its typical functional-form assumptions to account for nonlinear budget sets. We propose a new method to estimate taxable income elasticity that is more policy relevant than the typically estimated elasticity based on linearized budget sets. Using U.S. data from the NBER tax panel for 1979-1990 and differencing methods, we estimate an elasticity of 0.75 for taxable income and 0.20 for broad income. These estimates are higher than those obtained by specifications based on linearization. Our approach offers a new way to address the problem of endogenous observed marginal tax rates.
D11|Beyond CES: Three Alternative Classes of Flexible Homothetic Demand Systems|We characterize three classes of demand systems, all of which are defined non-parametrically: homothetic demand systems with a single aggregator (HSA), those with direct implicit additivity (HDIA), and those with indirect implicit additivity (HIIA). In HSA, all the cross-price effects are captured by one price aggregator, while in HDIA and in HIIA, they are captured by two price aggregators. Each of these three classes contains CES as a special case. Yet, they are pairwise disjoint with the sole exception of CES. Thus, these classes of homothetic demand systems offer us three alternative ways of departing from CES.
D11|Patterns, Trends and Policy Implications of Private Spending on Skills Development in Mexico and the United States|This paper explores families' investment in skills development through education in a high-inequality, low-education quality country such as Mexico, comparing it to a lower-inequality, higher-quality education country such as the United States. The paper uses a series of high-quality Household Income and Expenditure Surveys for both countries spanning around 20 years and different methodological approaches. Of particular interest is the analysis of education expenditure patterns along the income distribution. Policy implications for both cases are discussed. While in Mexico stimulating private spending in education through public resources might be regressive, the opposite might be the case in the United States.
D11|Healer or Gatekeeper? Physicians' Role Conflict When Symptoms Are Non-Verifiable|Although physicians are often expected to be gatekeepers to health insurance benefits such as paid sick leave, research indicates a substantial reluctance to reject patient requests for sickness certificates. We show that private information on the patient's part creates a conflict between the healer and gatekeeper roles: if a patient reports subjective symptoms indicating a need for sick leave, the physician is unable to tell if the patient is truly sick or a shirker. We show that even if most physicians prefer to be good gatekeepers, all of them may trust their patients in Nash equilibrium. These ideas are illustrated using results from focus group interviews with Norwegian primary care physicians.
D11|Financial and Housing Wealth, Expenditures and the Dividend to Ownership|Abstract For a household, home ownership provides necessary shelter, potential investment returns associated with property appreciation and a hedge against increased housing related cash outlays. In addition to potential appreciation, individual households benefit over time from a housing dividend defined as the difference between the market rent for the individual household’s housing unit and the household’s actual house ownership costs. The purchase of a house can substantially fix a household’s recurring housing related expenditures and generates a hedge (implied housing dividend) that increases with ownership tenure. This expenditure hedge (dividend) to home ownership is documented using pooled, cross-year samples from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX). The housing dividend delivers a non-trivial effect on household non-housing expenditures after controlling for housing value, housing equity, financial assets and income.
D11|Behavioral Heterogeneity : Pareto Distributions of Homothetic Preference Scales and Aggregate Expenditures Income Elasticities|"We evaluate the income elasticity of the aggregate budget share spent on a sub-group of commodities, in a competitive framework, by a continuum of agents having the same income, but heterogeneous behavior described by an ""homothetic preferences scaling factor"" having a bounded Pareto distribution in the population. If individual budget share increases globally significantly in the limit from low to large incomes, aggregate budget share is locally increasing with medium range incomes when the logarithm of the heterogeneity factor has an increasing (exponential) density with a large support. Aggregate income elasticity converges to that exponential density parameter when its support becomes infinitely large. Symmetric results hold in the decreasing case. Applications are made to market expenditures, wealth effects on portfolio choice with many risky assets, concave expenditures, that are compatible with standard (expected) utility maximization or other ""behavioral"" decision making processes."
