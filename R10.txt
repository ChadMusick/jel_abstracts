R10|Sustaining cultural tourism through higher female participation in Nigeria: the role of corporate social responsibility in oil host communities|This paper adds to the gender discourse in sustainable African tourism development from the corporate social responsibility (CSR) perspective. Specifically, we examine the impact of CSR on the development of rural women in cultural tourism. A total of 600 rural women were sampled across the Niger Delta. Results from the use of a logit model indicate a significant relationship between CSR and cultural tourism development in oil host communities in Nigeria. This implies that CSR of a multinational oil company (MOC) is a critical factor for sustaining cultural tourism. The findings suggest increased female participation in General Memorandum of Understanding (GMoU) interventions of MOC and the need to pay close attention to which extent the participation of rural women in the GMoU projects may be limited by cultural and traditional obstacles.
R10|“Technological cooperation and R&D outsourcing at the rm level: The role of the regional context”|Much has been said about the role that technological networking activities play on the innovative performance of rms, but little is known about the relevance of the context where the rm is locate shaping the eciency of such networking activities. In this article we hypothesize that the transformation of rms' networking activities into innovation may vary depending on the regional environment in which the rm is located. For Spanish manufactures in the period 2000-12 and through the use of a multilevel framework, we obtain that after controlling for the rm's characteristics, the regional context has not only a direct eect on rms' innovation performance, but it also conditions the returns to rms' networking activities, although dierently in the case of cooperation and outsourcing. Cooperating in innovation activities is more benecial for those rms located in a knowledge intensive region, whereas R&D outsourcing seems to be more protable for rms in regions with a low knowledge pool.
R10|Local Development, Urban Economies and Aggregate Growth|Abstract The aim of this paper is to present an overview of the results of a recent research project by the Bank of Italy. The paper analyses the interplay between historical origins, congestion costs, and agglomeration benefits in shaping the Italian urban system. It shows that urban agglomeration externalities (on wages, productivity, or innovation) tend to be smaller in Italy than in other developed countries; it also shows that the costs of congestion are relatively high and that high housing cost—explained by both physical constraints and public administration inefficiencies—discourage mobility. These features have a relevant impact on the development of an advanced urban system with possible negative consequences on the country’s ability to grow.
R10|The geography of Italian income inequality: recent trends and the role of employment|We reassess the role of regional imbalances in explaining the high household income inequality in Italy. In the first part of the work we use the Survey of Household Income and Wealth (SHIW) to describe the trends in income inequality between and within areas since the early 2000s. We illustrate that the between-area inequality has been relatively stable, while the within-area component increased significantly after the recession and during the recovery. In 2016, the large geographical divide and the higher inequality within the South contributed to almost one fifth of national inequality. In the second part we show that the distribution of employment is key in explaining the regional differences in both average income and its dispersion. By means of simulations based on matching and reweighting, we estimate that national inequality would be reduced by 15 per cent if the distribution of work hours across southern households was similar to the one in the more developed Centre-North. Regional employment differentials are so important in determining overall inequality that income dispersion would decline substantially even if this increase in employment was associated with a drop in southern regions’ average wages.
R10|Global bifurcation mechanism and local stability of identical and equidistant regions|We provide an analytical description of possible spatial patterns in economic geography models with three identical and equidistant regions by applying results from General Bifurcation mechanisms. We then use Pflüger's (2004, Reg Sci Urb Econ) model to show what spatial patterns can be uncovered analytically. As the freeness of trade increases, a uniform distribution undergoes a direct bifurcation that leads to a state with two identical large regions and one small region. Before this bifurcation, the model encounters a minimum point above which a curve of dual equilibria with two small identical regions and one small region emerges. From further bifurcations, the equilibrium with one large region encounters agglomeration in a single region, while the equilibrium with one small region encounters a state with two evenly populated regions and one empty region. A secondary bifurcation then leads to partial agglomeration with one small region and one large region. We show that an asymmetric equilibrium with populated regions cannot be connected with other types of equilibria. Therefore, an initially asymmetric state will remain so and preserve the ordering between region sizes.
R10|Tales of the City: What Do Agglomeration Cases Tell Us About Agglomeration in General?|This paper considers the heterogeneous microfoundations of agglomeration economies. It studies the co-location of industries to look for evidence of labor pooling, input sharing, and knowledge spillovers. The novel contribution of the paper is that it estimates single-industry models using a common empirical framework that exploits the cross-sectional variation in how one industry co-locates with the other industries in the economy. This unified approach yields evidence on the relative importance of the Marshallian microfoundations at the single-industry level, allowing for like-for-like cross-industry comparisons on the determinants of agglomeration. Using UK data, we estimate such microfoundations models for 97 manufacturing sectors, including the classic agglomeration cases of automobiles, computers, cutlery, and textiles. These four cases – as with all of the individual industry models we estimate – clearly show the importance of the Marshallian forces. However, they also highlight how the importance of these forces varies across industries – implying that extrapolation from cases should be viewed with caution. The paper concludes with an investigation of the pattern of heterogeneity. The degree of an industry’s clustering (localization), dynamism, incumbent firm size, and worker education are shown to contribute to the pattern of heterogeneous microfoundations.
R10|Residential Mobility and Unemployment in the UK|The UK has suffered from persistent spatial differences in unemployment rates for many decades. A low responsiveness of internal migration to unemployment is often argued to be an important cause of this problem. This paper uses UK census data to investigate how unemployment affects residential mobility using very small areas as potential destinations and origins and four decades of data. It finds that both in- and out-migration are affected by unemployment, although the effect on in-migration appears to be stronger - but also that there is a very high 'cost of distance' so most moves are very local. Using individual longitudinal data we show that the young and the better educated have a lower cost of distance but that sensitivity to unemployment shows much less variability across groups.
R10|Higher Education Supply, Neighbourhood effects and Economic Welfare|This paper estimates neighbourhood effects in the local provision of higher education, and incorporates them in a welfare analysis of higher education supply. We use an own built dataset on the history of higher education institutions in Italy during 1861-2010 to implement an instrumental variables approach that exploits initial conditions in the pre-unitarian Italian states, interacted with post-unification comprehensive reforms of the university system. We provide robust evidence of local displacement between higher education supply in neighbouring provinces. These effects are mostly concentrated within the same field of study, the same region, and a spatial reach of 90 Km. We show that accounting for these displacement forces is important to evaluate the local economic returns of higher education supply. On average, higher education returns explain more than 4% of local value added per capita. Returns are very localised, and larger in provinces that host university hubs.
R10|Kalòs kai agathòs? Government quality and cultural heritage in the regions of Europe|This paper uses panel data on over 200 regions of Europe to study the spatial distribution of UNESCO sites and the capacity of regional governments to conserve heritage, using new designations in the World Heritage List as a proxy. We test whether the location of a region matters by controlling for the stock of World Heritage in the surrounding regions, and if low regional government quality is an obstacle to inclusion of sites into the List. We find some evidence of within-country regional competition for inscription, and of a positive impact of government quality on the chances of having a UNESCO designation.
R10|Do Immigrants Affect Crime? Evidence from Panel Data for Germany|The paper analyses the empirical relationship between immigrants and crime using panel data for 391 German administrative districts between 2003 and 2016. Employing different standard panel estimation methods, we show that there is no positive association between the immigrant rate and the crime rate. We assess the robustness of this result by considering the heterogeneity of immigrant groups with respect to gender, age, country of origin and – if applicable – refugee status, and study naturalized immigrants. We also take into account possible spillover effects of immigrants on criminal activities by Germans, omitted variables and spatial correlation. Furthermore, taking advantage of the panel-structure of the data set we employ an instrumental variable approach that deals with the possibly endogenous allocation of immigrants and allows for causal interpretation of the estimates. There is no evidence that immigrants increase crime.
R10|Impacto de la homologación del IVA en el consumo de los hogares de Baja California, Baja California Sur y Quintana Roo, México|En este estudio es evaluado el impacto de la reforma a la ley del IVA de 2013 en el consumo de los hogares fronterizos, el caso de los estados mexicanos de Baja California, Baja California Sur y Quintana Roo. Para hacer esta evaluación es utilizada la metodología de diferencia en diferencias a través de modelos Tobit sobre 25 bienes que componen el consumo de los hogares. Las estimaciones son llevadas a cabo con datos de la Encuesta Nacional de Ingreso y Gastos de los Hogares (ENIGH) 2012 y 2014. Los resultados revelan un impacto negativo de 11.4% sobre el consumo de los hogares una vez entrada en vigor la nueva ley del IVA, a su vez, los tres componentes del consumo más afectados con esta reforma son: combustible, mantenimiento de vehículo y comunicaciones.
R10|Las remesas internacionales del PTAT y su impacto en el capital humano en México|Este ensayo tiene como propósitos construir un indicador de formación de capital humano a partir de una base de datos propia generada por una encuesta a jornaleros mexicanos que trabajan en Canadá, quienes se encuentran inscritos en el Programa de Trabajadores Agrícolas Temporales (PTAT), y desarrollar un modelo LOGIT para detectar factores independientes a los expuestos en las teorías sobre capital humano que tengan intervención positiva o negativa. Conforme a los resultados del modelo se concluye que las remesas que llegan a México por parte de los migrantes inscritos en el PTAT son efectivamente generadoras de capital humano a partir del efecto que tienen los factores exógenos regionales, sociales, económicos y demográficos que fueron considerados.
R10|Affordable Housing and City Welfare|Housing affordability has become one of the main policy challenges for the major cities of the world. Two key policy levers are zoning and rent control policies. We build a new dynamic equilibrium asset pricing model to evaluate the implications of such policies for house prices, rents, production and income, residential construction, income and wealth inequality, as well as the spatial distribution of households within the city. We calibrate the model to New York City, incorporating current zoning and rent control systems. Our model suggests large welfare gains from relaxing zoning regulations in Manhattan, and more modest gains from reducing the size of the rent control program. The former policy is progressive and a Pareto improvement, while rent control reform is regressive in nature and hurts the current beneficiaries.
R10|Creativity over Time and Space|Creativity is often highly concentrated in time and space, and across different domains. What explains the formation and decay of clusters of creativity? In this paper we match data on thousands of notable individuals born in Europe between the XIth and the XIXth century with historical data on city institutions and population. After documenting several stylized facts, we show that the formation of creative clusters is not preceded by increases in city size. Instead, the emergence of city institutions protecting economic and political freedoms facilitates the attraction and production of creative talent. Keywords: innovation, agglomeration, political institutions, immigration, gravity. JEL: R10, O10, J61, N13

R10|Macroeconomic Implications of Uniform Pricing|We compile a new database of grocery prices in Argentina, with over 9 million observations per day. We find uniform pricing both within and across regions—i.e., product prices almost do not vary within stores of a chain. Uniform pricing implies that prices would not change with regional conditions or shocks, particularly so if chains operate in several regions. We confirm this hypothesis using employment data. While prices in stores of chains operating almost exclusively in one region do react to changes in regional employment, stores of chains that operate in many regions do not seem to react to local labor market conditions. We study the impact of uniform pricing on estimates of local and aggregate consumption elasticities in a tractable two-region model in which firms have to set the same price in all regions. The estimated model predicts an almost one-third larger elasticity of consumption to a regional than an aggregate income shock because prices adjust more in response to aggregate shocks. This result highlights that some caution may be necessary when using regional shocks to estimate aggregate elasticities, particularly when the relevant prices are set uniformly across regions.
R10|Cities of Workers, Children or Seniors? Age Structure and Economic Growth in a Global Cross-Section of Cities|A large literature documents the positive influence of a cityâ€™s skill structure on its rate of economic growth. By contrast, the effect of a cityâ€™s age structure on its economic growth has been a hitherto largely neglected area of research. We hypothesize that cities with more working-age adults are likely to grow faster than cities with more children or seniors and set-out the potential channels through which such differential growth may occur. Using data from a variety of historical and contemporary sources, we show that there exists marked variation in the age structure of the worldâ€™s largest cities, both across cities and over time. We then study how age structure affects economic growth for a global cross-section of mega-cities. Using various identification strategies, we find that mega-cities with higher dependency ratios - i.e. with more children and/or seniors per working-age adult - grow significantly slower. Such effects are particularly pronounced for cities with high shares of children. This result appears to be mainly driven by the direct negative effects of a higher dependency ratio on the size of the working-age population and the indirect effects on work hours and productivity for working age adults within a city.
R10|The visible hand of cluster policy makers: An analysis of Aerospace Valley (2006-2015) using a place-based network methodology|The paper focuses on cluster policies with particular attention to the role of R&D collaborative incentives in the structuring of knowledge networks in clusters. We disentangle the main network failures in regional innovation systems, and discuss the selection procedures designed by policy makers to foster knowledge collaborations. We draw evidence from the French Aerospace Valley cluster from 2006 to 2015. The case study is based on a dataset of 248 granted research consortia, from which we build 4-cohort knowledge networks that enable us evidencing the evolving structural properties of the cluster over time. We suggest avoiding the bias and limitations of 1 and 2-mode network analysis by developing an original place-based network methodology that emphasizes on structural equivalence and groups’ behaviors. We discuss the results focusing on the convergence degree between the structural properties of the cluster selected by the Program and the policy makers’ objectives. Finally, the methodology allows us to identify the agents of the structural and technological changes observed throughout the period.
R10|Geographic environmental Kuznets curves: The optimal growth linear-quadratic case|We solve a linear-quadratic model of a spatio-temporal economy using a polluting one-input technology. Space is continuous and heterogenous: locations di er in productivity, nature self-cleaning technology and environmental awareness. The unique link between locations is transboundary pollution which is modelled as a PDE di usion equation. The spatio-temporal functional is quadratic in local consumption and linear in pollution. Using a dynamic programming method adapted to our in nite dimensional setting, we solve the associated optimal pollution. We show that optimal emissions will decrease at given location if and only if local productivity is larger than a threshold which depends both on the local pollution absorption capacity and environmental awareness. Furthermore, we numerically explore the relationship between the spatial optimal distributions of production and (asymptotic) pollution in order to uncover possible (geographic) Environmental Kuznets Curve cases.
R10|Are Estimates of Early Education Programs Too Pessimistic? Evidence from a Large-Scale Field Experiment that Causally Measures Neighbor Effects|We estimate the direct and spillover effects of a large-scale early childhood intervention on the educational attainment of over 2,000 disadvantaged children in the United States. We show that failing to account for spillover effects results in a severe underestimation of the impact. The intervention induced positive direct effects on test scores of children assigned to the treatment groups. We document large spillover effects on both treatment and control children who live near treated children. On average, spillover effects increase a child's non-cognitive (cognitive) scores by about 1.2 (0.6 to 0.7) standard deviations. The spillover effects are localized, decreasing with the spatial distance to treated neighbors. Our evidence suggests the spillover effect on non-cognitive scores are likely to operate through the child's social network. Alternatively, parental investment is an important channel through which cognitive spillover effects operate. We view our results as speaking to several literatures, perhaps most importantly the role of public programs and neighborhoods on human capital formation at an early age.
R10|Why bother about region-specific growth patterns and how to identify them?|Understanding the causes of regional growth has been of key concern for policy makers and scholars in economic geography and regional science. Regional growth models estimate the effect of various regional factors on the growth of an average region. However, these models leave a large share of regional growth unexplained. This is to be expected, as the embeddedness of regions at various spatial scales from the local to the global invariably leads to growth that is highly region-specific. However, existing quantitative approaches to regional growth are not able to cope with this, treating outliers in growth models as stochastic noise rather than as cases of empirical interest. The paper proposes a method to carve out the region-specific growth component in regional growth models and illustrates this empirically using data for Sweden from 1990-2016. We find robust patterns of periodic region-specific growth outweighing the effect of generic structural factors. This has important implications for how we should think about and empirically address regional growth.
R10|Trinity of Change Agency: Connecting Agency and Structure in Studies of Regional Development|The promise of connecting agency and structure in studies of regional development is to disentangle causal effects and to better understand to what extent and how individuals, groups of individuals, and organisations can shape regional trajectories. This is not without challenges because agency and structure are deep theoretical constructs, which are not easily translated into empirical research. We have devoted a research project to study how agency and structure are connected in the context of regional development and have faced many difficulties on the way. Here, we would like to share our experiences and proposed solutions grouped into six challenges, which were present in all of the 12 comparative case studies in Finland, Norway and Sweden. The challenges refer to the ontology of agency and structure, the research design, the time period of study, the spatial scale, the research instrument, and the data collection.
R10|The Origins of Creativity: The Case of the Arts in the United States since 1850|This research illuminates the historical development of creative activity in the United States. Census data is used to identify creative occupations (i.e., artists, musicians, authors, actors) and data on prominent creatives, as listed in a comprehensive biographical compendium. The analysis first sheds light on the socio-economic background of creative people and how it has changed since 1850. The results indicate that the proportion of female creatives is relatively high, time constraints can be a hindrance for taking up a creative occupation, racial inequality is present and tends to change only slowly, and education plays a significant role for taking up a creative occupation. Second, the study systematically documents and quantifies the geography of creative clusters in the United States and explains how these have evolved over time and across creative domains. Third, it investigates the importance of outstanding talent in a discipline for the local growth of an artistic cluster.
R10|「人口減少局面における経済的な安心・安全の確保」について|我が国経済では、人手不足が顕著になっており、法人の休廃業・解散も増加している。その背景には人口高齢化と人口減少が存在する。低い出生率を踏まえると、この傾向は続く。今後は、東京でも生産年齢人口が減少に転じ、一気に高齢化が進むことになる。人口高齢化や人口減少は経済を悪くするという見方もあるが、人口高齢化そのものが悪影響を及ぼすのか、それとも、年齢に依存する社会的な制度や慣行が悪影響を及ぼすのかの識別は難しい。また、人口高齢化や人口減少に伴い、イノベーションの加速や実装（ロボット化等）が促されているという指摘もある。何れにしても、人口変動は、年齢構成に依存した仕組み（年金、医療、介護などの社会保険）を通じて経済活動に影響する。高齢化という年齢構成の変化の場合、給付と負担のバランスが崩れ、若年層の負担率が上昇する。また、人口減少や人口密度の低下は、規模の経済性の喪失要因となり、公共サービス等の一人当たり費用が高まる。こうした動きに対し、地域（自治体）レベルにおいては、１）保有資産の稼働率を高めるように削減、集約化・複合化を急ぐ、２）コストを抑える方法でサービスを提供する（民間施設利用、ネット利用促進・標準化・紙の廃止等々）、といったことが課題となる。また、住民レベルでも、３）集住・生活サービス拠点の集約を通じて暮らしの質を維持しつつ、生活費用の上昇を抑えることが肝要となる。一国レベルでは、４）社会的なコンセンサスである高齢者の定義は実態に合わせて見直し、年齢中立的な仕組に変えていくことや、５）イノベーションの社会実装を促進するように、規制や制度を見直していく、ことが重要となっている。

R10|Do short-term rental platforms affect housing markets? Evidence from Airbnb in Barcelona|In this paper, we assess the impact of the arrival and expansion of Airbnb on housing rents and prices in the city of Barcelona. Examining highly detailed data on rents and both transaction and posted prices, we use several econometric approaches that exploit the exact timing and geography of Airbnb activity in the city. These include i) panel fixed-effects models with neighborhood-specific time trends, ii) an instrumental variable shift-share approach in which tourist amenities predict where Airbnb listings will locate and Google searches predict when listings appear, and iii) event-study designs. For the average neighborhood in terms of Airbnb activity, our preferred results imply that rents have increased by 1.9%, while transaction (posted) prices have increased by 5.3% (3.7%). The estimated impact in neighborhoods with high Airbnb activity is substantial. For neighborhoods in the top decile of Airbnb activity distribution, rents are estimated to have increased by 7%, while increases in transaction (posted) prices are estimated at 19% (14%).

In this article we hypothesize that the transformation of firms' networking activities into innovation may vary depending on the regional environment in which the firm is located. For Spanish manufactures in the period 2000-12 and through the use of a multilevel framework, we obtain that after controlling for the firm's characteristics, the regional context has not only a direct effect on firms' innovation performance, but it also conditions the returns to firms' networking activities, although differently in the case of cooperation and outsourcing. Cooperating in innovation activities is more beneficial for those firms located in a knowledge intensive region, whereas R&D outsourcing seems to be more profitable for firms in regions with a low knowledge pool.
R10|Who Benefits from Local Oil and Gas Employment? Labor Market Composition in the Oil and Gas Industry in Texas|This paper examines local labor market outcomes from an oil and gas boom. We examine two main outcomes across gender, race, and ethnicity: the probability of employment in the oil and gas industry and the log wages of workers employed outside the oil and gas industry. We find that men and women both gain employment in the oil and gas industry during booms, but such gains are much larger for men and are largest for black and Hispanic men. We also find positive income spillovers for workers in other industries that are similar in magnitude across demographic groups.
R10|The Political Economy of a Northern Ireland Border Poll|Given the increased prominence of a border poll in Ireland, particularly following the outcome of the Brexit referendum, this paper provides an initial assessment of some of the issues that are likely to become central in any debate on this issue. We examine the relative income and growth position of Northern Ireland within a UK and Irish regional framework over time. We further compare, and contrast, in detail aspects of the structure of both economies on the island of Ireland in the areas of educational attainment, trade orientation and the role of FDI. The paper goes on to analyse other relevant issues, such as the relative strength and weaknesses of the healthcare systems and the factors determining the potential economic cost of Irish unification. The objective of the research is to initiate an evidence-based approach to the question of a border poll and to provide an initial indication of the breadth of detail and analysis required for any debate to proceed in a meaningful manner.
R10|Industry Fluctuations and College Major Choices: Evidence from an Energy Boom and Bust|This paper examines how college students in the United States altered their college major decisions during the energy boom and bust of the 1970s and 1980s. We focus on petroleum engineering and geology, two majors closely related to the energy industry. We find strong evidence that the energy boom increased the prevalence of these two energy-related majors and the energy bust lowered the prevalence of these majors. Effects are particularly strong for young people born in energy intensive states. Thus, college major decisions responded to industry fluctuations with important location-specific effects consistent with frictions to migration and information flows.
R10|Do Workers Benefit from Resource Booms in Their Home State? Evidence from the Fracking Era|Fracking innovations revolutionized the United States oil and gas industry and facilitated a boom in energy production in states with oil and gas resources. This paper examines effects of oil and gas booms within a state on individual employment and earnings. To account for endogenous migration decisions, we instrument for oil and gas production in workers’ state of residence via the predicted percent of oil and gas employment in their state of birth. We find statistically significant and economically meaningful positive effects. The bulk of the effects accrue to workers employed outside the oil and gas industry indicating sizable spillovers.
R10|The Northern Ireland Economy: Problems and Prospects|This paper examines the performance of the Northern Ireland economy in recent decades and shows that it has suffered from very low productivity growth. This has meant that the regional economy has grown very slowly and this performance compares badly with that of other regional economies, such as Scotland and East Germany. The key factor behind the poor productivity performance in Northern Ireland has been the low investment in physical and human capital. The failure to reform the education system to reduce the number of early school leavers and increase the numbers of graduates is the single most important factor in the low growth. Large transfers from central government have ensured that the standard of living in Northern Ireland is close to the UK average and above that of Ireland. However, the dependence of Northern Ireland on these transfers leaves it very vulnerable to shocks. Brexit will, undoubtedly, have serious negative consequences for the Northern Ireland economy. Possibly more serious for Northern Ireland are the changes taking place in the politics of the UK which could see a reduction in transfers in the future. The best economic outcome for Northern Ireland is one where future UK governments commit to providing continuing large transfers to Northern Ireland for at least a further decade in return for a change in regional economic policy aimed at promoting economic growth. Public expenditure needs to be reallocated from sustaining consumption, especially public services, to investing in education and infrastructure. While painful initially, it would move the Northern Ireland economy onto a sustainable growth path. Another option, Irish unity, if it involved ending transfers to Northern Ireland, would produce a dramatic fall in the standard of living there. Alternatively, unification, where Ireland took over responsibility for the transfers to Northern Ireland, would necessitate a major cut in the standard of living in Ireland of 5% to 10% in order to allow Northern Ireland to maintain a standard of living between 10% and 20% above the Irish standard of living. Whatever form Irish unity took there would be a heavy economic cost for both Northern Ireland and Ireland.
R10|Anatomy of Regional Price Differentials: Evidence From Micro Price Data|Our paper uses micro price data collected from Germany’s Consumer Price Index to compile a highly disaggregated regional price index for the 402 counties and cities of Germany. We introduce a multi-stage version of the weighted Country-Product-Dummy method. The unique quality of our price data allows us to depart from previous spatial price comparisons and to compare only exactly identical products. We find that the price levels are spatially autocorrelated and largely driven by the cost of housing. The price level in the most expensive region is about 27 percent higher than in the cheapest region.
R10|House Price Dispersion in Boom-Bust Cycles: Evidence from Tokyo|We investigate the cross-sectional distribution of house prices in the Greater Tokyo Area for the period 1986 to 2009. We find that size-adjusted house prices follow a lognormal distribution except for the period of the housing bubble and its collapse in Tokyo, for which the price distribution has a substantially heavier upper tail than that of a lognormal distribution. We also find that, during the bubble era, sharp price movements were concentrated in particular areas, and this spatial heterogeneity is the source of the fat upper tail. These findings suggest that, during a bubble, prices increase markedly for certain properties but to a much lesser extent for other properties, leading to an increase in price inequality across properties. In other words, the defining property of real estate bubbles is not the rapid price hike itself but an increase in price dispersion. We argue that the shape of cross-sectional house price distributions may contain information useful for the detection of housing bubbles.
R10|Relatedness, economic complexity and convergence across European regions|The aim of this paper is to analyze how the heterogeneous structure of the European regions has affected their patterns of convergence or divergence. We analyse data collected by Eurostat, from a balanced panel of 191 regions and 55 economic branches over the period 2003-2015. In this way, we are able to describe and capture technological proximity across the regions and analyse how it has evolved over space and time. Limiting the analysis to the manufacturing activities, we are also able to measure the degree of economic complexity of the regional production systems and assess how this affects their patterns of growth. Our findings suggest that there are pushing (enhancing convergence) and pulling (exacerbating economic gaps) forces to economic convergence. Spatial effects tend to push towards convergence, with the Eastern regions that started from relatively low levels of GDP per capita and experienced higher growth rates. Nevertheless, the different level of economic complexity tends to widen the gaps between territories: for example, the German regions, whose economic structures are more complex, have kept on widening the gap between themselves and the other European regions. The two different forces are also interconnected as the Eastern regions combine a relatively low level of GDP per capita with a significant level of economic complexity. During the period considered, the improvement in living standards has corresponded to the upgrade of their manufacturing production structures.
R10|Anatomy of regional price differentials: Evidence from micro price data|Over the last three decades the supply of economic statistics has vastly improved. Unfortunately, statistics on regional price levels (sub-national purchasing power parities) have been exempt from this positive trend, even though they are indispensable for meaningful spatial comparisons of regional output, income, wages, productivity, standards of living, and poverty. To improve the situation, our paper demonstrates that a highly disaggregated and reliable regional price index can be compiled from data that already exist. We use the micro price data that have been collected for Germany's Consumer Price Index in May 2016. For the computation we introduce a multi-stage version of the Country-Product-Dummy method. The unique quality of our price data set allows us to depart from previous spatial price comparisons and to compare only exactly identical products. We find that the price levels of the 402 counties and cities of Germany are largely driven by the cost of housing and to a much lesser degree by the prices of goods and services. The overall price level in the most expensive region, Munich, is about 27 percent higher than in the cheapest region. Our results also reveal strong spatial autocorrelation.
R10|Do Workers Benefit from Resource Booms in Their Home State? Evidence from the Fracking Era|Fracking innovations revolutionized the United States oil and gas industry and facilitated a boom in energy production in states with oil and gas resources. This paper examines effects of oil and gas booms within a state on individual employment and earnings. To account for endogenous migration decisions, we instrument for oil and gas production in workers' state of residence via the predicted percent of oil and gas employment in their state of birth. We find statistically significant and economically meaningful positive effects. The bulk of the effects accrue to workers employed outside the oil and gas industry indicating sizable spillovers.
R10|Environmental Efficiency and Regional Convergence Clusters in Japan: A Nonparametric Density Approach|This paper studies environmental efficiency convergence across the prefectures of Japan over the 1992-2008 period. Using a novel nonparametric density estimation clustering framework, two alternative indicators of environmental efficiency are contrasted: a conventional indicator, based on the ratio of gross regional product to CO2 emissions, and a more comprehensive indicator, based on the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model. Results show, on the one hand, a lack of intra-distributional mobility and potentially a unique convergence cluster when using the more conventional indicator. On the other hand, large backward mobility and at least two convergence clusters are identified when using the DEA-based indicator of environmental efficiency. The paper concludes arguing the importance of accounting for production inputs, as they appear to be driving the formation of regional convergence clusters in Japan.
R10|Concentration of income inequality on the basis of Palma ratio and income deciles of Turkey on national and regional level|This paper aims to focus on income inequality concentration based on Palma ratio as an income inequality metrics and in this regard change in income deciles of Turkey both on national ( for period 2002-2017) and NUTS-1 level for period of 2006-2017 would be investigated. In this context cons and pros of metrics would be considered hence this study would not suggest that Palma ratio is the best inequality metrics that explains inequalities. However analytical framework of the Palma ratio would be taken into consideration in order to focus on concentration of income inequality. So that possibility of exploring dimensions of hidden inequality that could not be asserted by Gini coefficient, in case of Turkey would be investigated. Given that, primarily the Gini coefficient series based on Turkstat and Povcal data would be compared for period 2002-2017 for Turkey. Following this path, the Palma ratio; the ratio of the share of top 10 percent income to the bottom 40 percent income (D10/D1-D4) would be investigated both on national and regional level. First of all based on studies that refers to Palma ratio descriptive and explanatory statistics would be utilized. For analyzing robustness of Palma ratio and investigating importance of change in relevant income deciles, mean and percentage shares’ would be considered. Within this context rather than analyzing absolute improvement, proportional change in income deciles, Gini coefficient and Palma ratio with respect to total mean income and GDP per capita income(Turkstat 2004-2016)would be estimated. While analyzing descriptive statistics for both income deciles and mean income data, existence of “outliers” would be investigated. For this purpose in order to examine regional disparities,on the basis of income deciles’ percentage share of relevant deciles would be estimated by Mahalanobis distance calculation. Furthermore in order to analyze concentration of income inequality, decomposition of Gini coefficient values based on sub-population grouping (regions) would be evaluated. In doing so between(Bahattacharya and Mahalanobis,1976, Giorgi,2011) and within group decomposition (Bellu and Liberati, 2006) analysis would be considered for mean incomes and Gini coefficient values’. Based on these results, it would be suggested that investigation based on Palma ratio and income deciles would permit more detailed analysis of concentration of income inequality. Opposite tails ( the richest D10 and the poorest D1-D4) of Turkey’s provide us to explain asymmetries in income distribution dynamics. Robustness of Palma ratio would be evaluated while it would be underlined that apart from overlapping trend between Palma ratio and Gini coefficient, D10 income deciles and Gini coefficient has strong correlation that determines concentration of income inequality.
R10|Global bifurcation mechanism and local stability of identical and equidistant regions|We provide an analytical description of possible spatial patterns in economic geography models with three identical and equidistant regions by applying results from General Bifurcation mechanisms. We then use Pflüger’s (2004, Reg Sci UrbEcon) model to show what spatial patterns can be uncovered analytically. As the freeness of trade increases, a uniform distribution undergoes a direct bifurcation that leads to a state with two identical large regions and one small region. Before this bifurcation, the model encounters a minimum point above which a curve of dual equilibria with two small identical regions and one small region emerges. From further bifurcations, the equilibrium with one large region encounters agglomeration in a single region, while the equilibrium with one small region encounters a state with two evenly populated regions and one empty region. A secondary bifurcation then leads to partial agglomeration with one small region and one large region. We show that an asymmetric equilibrium h populated regions cannot be connected with other types of equilibria. Therefore, an initially asymmetric state will remain so and preserve the ordering between region sizes.
R10|Uniform Pricing Within and Across Regions: New Evidence from Argentina|We compile a new database of grocery prices in Argentina, with over 9 million observations per day. Our main novel inding is that product prices almost do not vary within stores of a chain (i.e., uniform pricing). We also find that prices do not change significantly with regional conditions or shocks, particularly so for chains that operate in many regions. To study the impact of uniform pricing on both consumers and firms, this paper uses a tractable model based on the trade literature. Motivated by our empirical findings, each firm has to set the same price in both regions. Relative to a counterfactual in which firms can set different prices across regions (i.e., flexible pricing), uniform pricing reduces firms’ profits by 0.4%. Consumers, however, prefer uniform pricing and are willing to give up 6.7% of their income to avoid flexible pricing in the baseline model. The effect on consumers, however, depends on how much uniform pricing limits firms’ power to extract consumer surplus and how heterogeneous the regions are.
R10|Anatomy of Regional Price Differentials: Evidence From Micro Price Data|Over the last three decades the supply of economic statistics has vastly improved. Unfortunately, statistics on regional price levels (sub- national purchasing power parities) have been exempt from this positive trend, even though they are indispensable for meaningful spatial comparisons of regional output, income, wages, productivity, standards of living, and poverty. To improve the situation, our paper demonstrates that a highly disaggregated and reliable regional price index can be compiled from data that already exist.

R10|The Influence Of Short-Term Rental On Rental Housing Prices In Prague|"Prague has for a long time been struggling with the problem of constantly increasing housing prices and their lack. Offer available apartments is extremely low and is manifested by significant price growth and also the limited supply of apartments for sale and rent. One of the factors influencing the price of flats in Prague may be short-term rentals. Today there is an increasing number of flats in the total offer of short-term rentals and the number of hosts with more than one offer is also rising. Airbnb will deviate from its original idea of sharing ""extra beds""."
R10|Understanding Discrimination against Same-Sex Couples in the United States: Evidence from an Email Correspondence Audit|As of 2017, no federal law protected Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ) individuals from housing discrimination. However, 22 U.S. states and over 200 municipalities have passed laws prohibiting housing discrimination based on sexual orientation. In this paper, I present the results of a randomized pair-email correspondence audit of 6,490 property owners in 94 U.S. cities. I provide a nationally-representative estimate of the level of discrimination same-sex couples experience when inquiring about rental housing. I find that same-sex male couples, especially Black same-sex male couples, are less likely to receive a response to inquiries about rental units. Same-sex female couples receive preferential treatment compared to heterosexual couples. I then examine how state and local anti-discrimination laws covary with rates of housing discrimination against same-sex couples. Compare to localities without any housing protections, I find that response rates covary positively with statelevel protections but negatively with local-level protections. I conclude by testing several hypotheses about the causes of this discrimination. This preliminary evidence suggests that property owners are willfully discriminating against same-sex male couples.
R10|Contagious exporting and foreign ownership: Evidence from firms in Shanghai using a Bayesian spatial bivariate probit model|Whether a firm is able to attract foreign capital and whether it may participate at the export market depends on whether the fixed costs associated with doing so are at least covered by the incremental operating profits. This paper provides evidence that success for some firms in attracting foreign investors and in exporting appears to reduce the associated fixed costs with exporting or foreign ownership in other firms. Using data on 8,959 firms located in Shanghai, we find that contagion and spillovers in exporting and in foreign ownership decisions within an area of 10 miles in the city of Shanghai amplify fixed-cost reductions for both exporting as well as foreign ownership of neighboring firms. Contagion among exporters and among foreign-owned firms, respectively, amplify shocks to the profitability of these activities to a large extent. These findings are established through the estimation of a spatial bivariate probit model.
R10|European Funds and Firm Dynamics: Estimating Spillovers from Increased Access|We take advantage of a quasi-natural experiment to assess the impact of European funds on firm dynamics in regions that, while not having their status changed, saw their neighbours increased access to European funds. Causality is established in a difference-in-differences intention to treat setting, using a rich dataset that considers the universe of Portuguese mainland municipalities from 2003 to 2010, and controlling for socio-economic, political and demographic variables. Our findings suggest a causal impact of between 1 and 2 percent in private sector firmsÂ´ entry and net entry rates, while we find no impact on firm exit rates. We consider time and space placebos to assure the reliability of our estimates. Our findings suggest that EU regional funds have a greater impact in times of distress, such as the world economic crisis, as far as entry rates are concerned. The analysis of the cross-section of firm demonstrates it is domestic owned micro firms in the primary and tertiary sectors that are most impacted by regional funds.
R10|Is there hysteresis in South African unemployment? Evidence from the post-recessionary period|High unemployment in South Africa possess as the country’s most problematic economic issue faced by South African policymakers and hence is considered an overriding priority within the design of large scale government expenditure programmes. In this study, we investigate the hysteresis hypothesis for 8 categories of unemployment in South Africa using a battery of individual and panel unit root testing procedures applied to quarterly data collected in the post-recession period of 2008:q1 to 2017:q2. Indeed our empirical results confirm the hysteresis hypothesis for a majority of unemployment classifications with the exception of unemployment associated with persons aged 55 to 64 years old. Overall, our obtained empirical results hold far reaching ramifications towards domestic policymakers
R10|Foreign Direct Investment and Knowledge Diffusion in Poor Locations: Evidence from Ethiopia|We quantify foreign direct investment (FDI) spillovers by comparing changes in total factor productivity (TFP) among domestic plants in districts that attracted a large greenfield foreign plant and districts where greenfield FDI was licensed but not yet operational. Treated and untreated districts have similar trends in TFP prior to the opening of the large greenfield foreign plant. Over the four years starting with the year of the opening, TFP of domestic plants is 8% higher in treated districts. Using an alternative identification strategy that exploits the assignment of land for FDI by the Ethiopian Government, we obtain similar results. Foreign plants also attract new economic activity to treated districts. Exposure to foreign firms enhances domestic firms’: (i) production processes; (ii) managerial and organizational practices; (iii) logistics and; (iv) knowledge about exporting. Knowledge transfer is more likely among labor or vertically linked firms but also occurs outside these channels.
R10|Firm Sorting and Agglomeration|The distribution of firms in space is far from uniform. Some locations host the most productive large firms, while others barely attract any. In this paper, I study the sorting of heterogeneous firms across locations and analyze policies designed to attract firms to particular regions (place-based policies). I first propose a theory of the distribution of heterogeneous firms in a variety of sectors across cities. Aggregate TFP and welfare depend on the extent of agglomeration externalities produced in cities and on how heterogeneous firms sort across them. The distribution of city sizes and the sorting patterns of firms are uniquely determined in equilibrium. This allows me to structurally estimate the model, using French firm-level data. I find that nearly half of the observed productivity advantage of large cities is due to firm sorting. I use the estimated model to quantify the general equilibrium effects of place-based policies. I find that policies that decrease local congestion lead to a new spatial equilibrium with higher aggregate TFP and welfare. In contrast, policies that subsidize under-developed areas have negative aggregate effects.
R10|Place-Based Policies for Development|"Many development policies, such as placement of infrastructure or local economic development schemes, are ""place-based."" Such policies are generally intended to stimulate private sector investment and economic growth in the treated place, and as such they are difficult to appraise and evaluate. This paper sets out a framework for analyzing the effects of such policies and assessing their social value. It then reviews the literature on place-based policies in the contexts of transport improvements, economic corridors, special economic zones, lagging regions, and urban policies."
R10|The integration of migrants in OECD regions: A first assessment|This paper provides an assessment of the presence of migrants, their characteristics and integration outcomes across OECD regions, based on a new OECD database on immigrant integration at the regional level. It reveals the wide diversity of the presence of migrants within countries, as well as the specific patterns observed in the way migrants locate and integrate in society across regions. For example, migrants tend to be more spatially concentrated in capital-city and metropolitan regions than the native-born population. What is more, highly-educated migrants are more likely to locate in the same regions where the highly-educated natives concentrate, a trend that is not observed for the low-educated foreign-born. Integration outcomes of migrants, relative to the native-born, are measured through a variety of labour market and housing indicators. The paper also provides preliminary findings on public attitudes towards migrants across regions, which suggest that attitudes tend to be more positive in regions with larger shares of foreign-born population.
R10|The Rise of Megaregions: Delineating a new scale of economic geography|The concept of megaregions is increasingly put forward among academics and policy makers as a new scale of economic co-ordination and social organisation. A megaregion is most commonly understood as an economic unit that comprises an agglomeration of cities and its less dense hinterlands, which are linked through infrastructure, economic connections, settlement patterns and land use, topography, an environmental system or a shared culture and history that together shape a common interest for the wider region. While there is an extensive literature on the potential benefits of a megaregion, work has been more limited in terms of identifying megaregions in an international context. This paper introduces an approach to delineate potential megaregions in the OECD.
R10|A dynamic spatial model of global governance structures|This paper presents a novel understanding of the changing governance structures in global supply chains. Motivated by the global garment sector, we develop a geographical political economy dynamic model which reflects the interaction between bargaining power and distribution of value among buyer and producer firms. We find that the interplay between these two forces, in combination with the spatial specificities of global production, are necessary and sufficient to drive governance structures towards an intermediate position regarding their level of explicit coordination and power asymmetry.
R10|A biography of Paul Krugman: contributions to Geography and Trade|This work consists of a short biographical survey on the academic life and work of the American economist Paul Robin Krugman. It seeks to shed light on his mains contributions to economic theory, mainly those due to which he was awarded with the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2008. His legacy in academia can be assessed through the recognition of his work in the identification of international trade patterns and the explanation on why spatial imbalances in the distribution of economic activities arise in an increasingly globalized economy. Through these contributions to trade theory and economic geography, Krugman is often credited as being one of the pioneering researchers in the New Trade Theory and the founding father of the New Economic Geography.
R10|A prospective review on New Economic Geography|Abstract This paper serves as an orientation towards the understanding of some of the contributions and theoretical limitations in New Economic Geography and seeks to provide a prospective assessment of new avenues of research along which the field could improve and develop. We identify many of the persistent features and assumptions which have thwarted the evolution of New Economic Geography and led to a sprawl of criticism within the field. This criticism has opened a discussion towards the identification of new possible directions, some of which are being progressively undertaken, while others raise issues that are difficult to overcome both analytically and empirically.
R10|Do short-term rent platforms affect rents? Evidence from Airbnb in Barcelona|Peer-to-peer platforms such as airbnb have recently entered the market thanks to the development of new technologies and their influence on traditional markets remains still understudied. Similarly, the multiplicity of local regulations adopted by big touristic cities in developed countries shows a lack of consensus both on the consequences and on the role of regulation. However, the actual impact of airbnb’s market entry on rents remains still unknown. I assess the causal impact of the beginning of airbnb’s economic activity on housing rents for the city of Barcelona using a Bartiklike instrumental strategy. Results suggest that airbnb is responsible for a 4% increase in rents.
R10|Factor Returns and Circular Causality|The presence of circular causality in a region through factor returns is studied in a general equilibrium model in which firms producing final products engage in oligopolistic competition. The intermediate input is produced by capital and labor with a constant returns to scale technology. If the degree of increasing returns in the production of final products is sufficiently high, the return to a factor can increase with the amount of this factor. Thus a higher amount of a factor in a region leads to a higher return to this factor and attracts additional amount of this factor to move in. Capital movement and labor movement can be reinforcing. This type of circular causality means that unbalanced regional development can persist over time.
R10|Do Economic Reforms Promote Urbanization in India?|We assess the impact of economic reforms on urbanization in India for the period of 1991 to 2016. It is found that economic reform variables (except import of goods and services as % of GDP) have a positive effect on urbanization. The vector error correction model shows that economic reforms have influenced only on total urban population with a very slower rate with the speed of adjustment of 0.003. The short run effect is also negligible. Granger causality test shows that there is no causal relationship between them. Therefore, we conclude that economic reforms do not promote urbanization in India. Economic reforms for urbanization are required though promotion of small and medium cities, human capital, cultural mobility and formulating proper plans for new green cities.
R10|Oligopolistic Competition And Economic Geography|ABSTRACT This paper studies a general equilibrium model of economic geography in which firms engage in oligopolistic competition. This framework is conducive to analytic results. With increasing returns, oligopolistic competition leads to interindustry trade between regions rather than intraindustry trade. The choice of appropriate technology is a channel of concentration of industries.
R10|Пољопривреда Краснодарске Покрајине И Агрохолдинг Кубањ<BR>[Agriculture of Krasnodar Krai and Agroholding Kuban]|Serbian. У раду се анализира пољопривреда Краснодарске покрајине, једног од мањих, али економски развијенијих субјеката сложено уређене Руске Федерације (РФ). Најпре је дат географски и друштвеноекономски приказ Краснодарске покрајине. По величини територије и броју становника упоредив с мањим европским земљама, попут Аустрије, Чешке или Републике Ирске, односно Данске, Финске и Словачке, овај регион је нешто мањи и слабије насељен од Србије. Разноврсност рељефа, климатских услова и велика природна богатства чине повољне услове за његов економски и друштвени развој. Посебно су развијени агроиндустријски комплекс и туризам, што и представља знак распознавања региона не само у оквирима Русије, већ и ван њених граница. У производњи низа пољопривредних култура Краснодарска покрајина заузима водеће, или једно од водећих места у оквирима Руске Федерације. Дат је кратак приказ Агрохолдинга Кубањ, највећег и најзначајнијег пољопривредно-прехрамбеног предузећа у Покрајини и једног од највећих у РФ, чије је седиште у г. Уст-Лабинск, и који има активе у више од 20 агропредузећа у неколико рејона Краснодарске покрајине. Земљишни фонд АгроХолдинга чини 112 хиљада ха, број запослених је око 5 хиљада људи. Привредна сарадња Србије с Русијом у целини знатно заостаје за оном из времена СФРЈ и СССР, али ће у будућности свакако бити повећана, а у оквиру тога и сарадња с Краснодарском покрајином, која се неће заснивати само на трговинским односима. English. This article analyzes the agriculture of the Krasnodar Krai, one of the smallest but economicaly most developed subjects of complexly organized Russian Federation. At the beginning it was provided a geographic and socio-economic description of Krasnodar Krai. Its size and population are comparable to the ones of smaller European countries, such as Austria, Czech Republic, Republic of Ireland or Denmark, Finland and Slovakia. In comparison to Serbia, this region is somewhat smaller and less densely populated. Its landscape and climate diversity, as well as an abundance of natural resources make a good starting point for a further economic and social development of the region. The agro-industrial complex and tourism are especially developed in this region and are considered its strong points both within Russia and outside its borders. In the production of many agrarian products Krasnodar Krai is leader, or at the top in the Russian Federation. It is also given the short survey of the AgroHolding Kuban, greatest and most important agriculture and food enteprises in the Krasnodar Krai, and one of the greatest in Russia. The level of industrial cooperation between Serbia and Russia is considerably lower than in the times of SFRY and USSR. However, it will certainly increase in the future, leading to an intensification of cooperation with Krasnodar region which will not only be based on trade relations.

R10|Federal Regulation, Job Creation, and the Moderating Effect of State Economic Freedom|Regulation is commonly viewed as a hindrance to entrepreneurship, but heterogeneity in the effects of regulation is rarely explored. We focus on regional variation in the effects of national-level regulations by developing a theory of hierarchical institutional interdependence. Using the political science theory of market-preserving federalism, we argue that regional economic freedom attenuates the negative influence of national regulation on net job creation. Using U.S. data, we find that regulation destroys jobs on net, but regional economic freedom moderates this effect. In regions with average economic freedom, a one percent increase in regulation results in 14 fewer jobs created on net. However, a standard deviation increase in economic freedom attenuates this relationship by four fewer jobs. Interestingly, this moderation accrues strictly to older firms; regulation usually harms young firm job creation, and economic freedom does not attenuate this relationship.
R10|Locational (In-)Efficiency of Renewable Power Generation Feeding in the Electricity Grid: A Spatial Regression Analysis|This paper analyzes the negative external effects caused by the introduction of variable renewable energy sources into an inflexible power system. We investigate the costs that arise due to the need for temporarily reducing their output to relief grid overstress in the case of high electricity feed-in. The responsible system operator has to remunerate the power plant operator for this lost output. The resulting costs for the system operator, the so-called feed-in management costs, are passed on to the end-consumers in the respective region via the grid use tariff scheme. In this paper, we develop a two-part regression model that explains (i) the occurrence of feed-in management and (ii) the regional variation of feed-in management costs. In the first part, we use a logit model to explain why some regions experienced feed-in management in recent years and others did not. The second part covers an augmented spatial econometric model that investigates the interregional variability of feed-in management costs. The estimates of both models show that especially the installed capacity of wind energy connected to the medium and high voltage level have a negative impact on feed-in management and that high load in a region reduces the need for feed-in management measures. The augmented spatial model indicates for the case of four major DSOs in Germany that an increase by 1 MW of wind energy capacity at the medium and high voltage level lead to an increase in feed-in management costs by 1.9% and 0.9% in regions that already experienced feed-in management, respectively. The policy implication of this finding is that price signals for the reinforcement of the grid infrastructure or for the siting of VRES should be given.

It uses two types of data; the first is project data provided by NNE and processed using a Cost Estimation Tool developed by the authors, and second is worker survey data collected during the drilling phase.
R10|Heterogeneity, Frictional Assignment And Home-ownership|A model of frictional assignment is developed to study the composition of housing units and households across city-level ownership and rental markets. Heterogeneous houses are built by a competitive development industry and either rented competitively or sold through directed search to households which differ in wealth and sort over housing types. Even in the absence of financial restrictions and constraints on house characteristics, higher income households are more likely to own and lower quality housing is more likely to be rented. When calibrated to match average features of housing markets within U.S. cities, the model is qualitatively consistent with U.S. data on the relationships between observed differences in median income, inequality, median household age, and construction/land costs across cities and both home-ownership and the average cost of owning vs. renting. Policies designed to improve housing affordability raise both housing quality and ownership for lower income households while lowering housing quality (but not ownership) for high income ones.
R10|Comparison of economic development and banking loan activities on a case of Croatian counties|Banking credit policy is an important pillar of the economic development of a country as well as countries narrower territorial units. Regional development is often based on comprehensive government and municipal policy, geographical and demographic characteristics, statistical classification, a role of different government agencies but also of a financial institutions business policy. The goal of this paper is to compare level of economic development with a banking loan activities in case of Croatian counties. The paper is analysing banking loan activities based on loan to deposit ratio, relative size of banking loan activities on a county level as well as currency and type of a loan structure of banking loan portfolio. Indicators of banking loan activities are compared with counties economic development using non-hierarchical k-means cluster analysis. Research in a paper is looking for an answer to what extent are seen similarities of economic development of Croatian counties and total banking loan activities. In this sense paper is comparing two methodologies, regional development measurement and characteristics of banking loan business.
R10|What Drives the Geography of Jobs in the US? Unpacking Relatedness|There is ample evidence of regions diversifying in new occupations that are related to pre- existing activities in the region. However, it is still poorly understood through which mechanisms related diversification operates. To unpack relatedness, we distinguish between three mechanisms: complementarity (interdependent tasks), similarity (sharing similar skills) and local synergy (based on pure co-location). We propose a measure for each of these relatedness dimensions and assess their impact on the evolution of the occupational structure of 389 US Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA) for the period 2005-2016. Our findings show that new jobs appearing in MSA?s are related to existing ones, while those more likely to disappear are more unrelated to a city?s jobs' portfolio. We found that all three relatedness dimensions matter, but local synergy shows the largest impact on entry and exit of jobs in US cities.
R10|Ageing labour: How does demographic change affect regional human capital?|Human capital investments are frequently suggested as policy measure to cope with smaller and older labour forces caused by demographic change across Europe. However, the availability and composition of human capital is fundamentally intertwined with demographic structures, especially at a regional level. This paper analyses how ageing is related to the regional composition of human capital for 332 German regions between 1996 and 2010. The findings show that labour force ageing is associated with lower educational attainment, and that older labour forces have higher shares of traditional vocational degrees. On a national level, education expansion still sufficiently compensates for the effects of population ageing, but regional human capital composition shows distinct trends.
R10|An Evolutionary Perspective on the British Banking Crisis|Developing an evolutionary perspective towards the changing anatomy of the banking sector reveals the enduring tensions and contradictions between spatial centralisation and the possibilities for decentralisation before, during and after the British banking crisis. The shift from banking boom to crisis in 2007 is conceptualised as a significant and on-going moment in the long-term evolution of the historical institutional-spatial dominance of London over other city-regions in Britain. The analysis demonstrates the importance of the institutional and geographical legacies of the British national political economy and variegation of capitalism established in the later nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in shaping contemporary geographical outcomes. Regulatory changes combined with financial innovation in the latter years of the twentieth century to create an opportunity for English regional and Scottish banks excluded from previous institutional-spatial centralisation to expand excessively and consequently several failed in the banking crisis. The paper considers the future trajectory of institutional-spatial centralisation in the banking sector amidst the continued spatial restructuring of the banking crisis, involving a re-drawing of organisational boundaries, overlapping institutional and technological changes and unprecedented uncertainty about the impact of Brexit on Britain?s wider political and economic landscape.
R10|Are local public services better delivered in more autonomous regions? Evidence from European regions using a dose‐response approach|"Does regional autonomy lead to better local public services? We investigate this issue using measures of public service performance and autonomy at the region level in 171 European regions. We introduce a novel dose‐response approach which identifies the pattern of the effect of regional autonomy on the performance of public services. The relationship between the level of regional autonomy and the provision of local public services exhibits a u‐shape: both low and high autonomy lead to better local public services. This speaks against the presence of one optimal level of autonomy and policy recommendations based on the view that more decentralisation is always desirable. It shows that different institutional settings can be economically viable and efficient. ¿Conduce la autonomía regional a mejores servicios públicos locales? Este artículo investiga este tema utilizando medidas de desempeño y autonomía del servicio público a nivel regional en 171 regiones europeas. Se introduce un nuevo enfoque de dosis‐respuesta que identifica el patrón del efecto de la autonomía regional en el desempeño de los servicios públicos. La relación entre el nivel de autonomía regional y la prestación de servicios públicos locales presenta una forma de""u"": tanto la baja como la alta autonomía conducen a mejores servicios públicos locales. Esto contradice la presencia de un nivel óptimo de autonomía y de recomendaciones políticas basadas en la opinión de que siempre es deseable una mayor descentralización. Se demuestra que diferentes marcos institucionales pueden ser económicamente viables y eficientes. 地域の自主性は、地域の公共サービスの改善を導くだろうか? 本稿では、ヨーロッパの171の地域における、地域レベルでの公共サービス実施と自主性を測定して、この問題を検討する。新しい用量反応アプローチを導入し、これにより公共サービスの実施に対する地域の自主性の効果のパターンを確認する。地域の自主性のレベルと地域の公共サービスの実施との関連性はU字型曲線を示し、自主性が高いレベルでも低いレベルでも、いずれも結果的に公共サービスは改善されている。これは、最適な自主性のレベルは一つであることや、自律分散を進めることが絶対的に好ましいという見方に基づいた政策勧告に異を唱えるものである。背景にある制度上の違いは、経済的に実行可能であり、効果的であることを示している。"
R10|Rural Affordable Rental Housing : Quantifying Need, Reviewing Recent Federal Support, and Assessing the Use of Low Income Housing Tax Credits in Rural Areas|Recently, there has been significant interest in the high levels of rental cost burden being experienced across the United States. Much of this scholarship has focused on rental cost burdens in larger urban areas, or at the national level, and has not explored differences in the prevalence of rental cost burden in urban versus rural communities. In this paper, I find that rental cost burdens are a challenge facing both urban and rural communities. However, despite the need for affordable rental housing in rural communities identified, I find the amount of resources made available by the federal government to address this challenge are at a low point relative to recent history. My analysis of federal resource availability also finds one program has been an important and resilient tool for the development and preservation of affordable housing in urban and rural communities: the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program. Congress delegated much of the LIHTC program’s implementation to the states, whereby states choose many of the factors to prioritize when allocating LIHTCs to specific projects. Therefore, I explored each state’s qualified allocation plan to identify whether specific factors make it more or less likely rural areas will receive a “fair share” of LIHTC allocations based on their need relative to non-rural areas. My analysis did not identify a specific factor or set of factors that systematically increased or decreased the likelihood of allocations being proportionate to the relative needs of a state’s rural communities. However, I did identify a number of factors that by their very design appeared to affect positively or negatively the likelihood that specific types of projects or project locations would receive allocations. Interviews with industry stakeholders confirmed that many of these factors are affecting developer decisions and may be unintentionally disadvantaging smaller, more remote rural projects.
R10|Geographic Environmental Kuznets Curves: The Optimal Growth Linear-Quadratic Case|We solve a linear-quadratic model of a spatio-temporal economy using a polluting one-input technology. Space is continuous and heterogenous: locations differ in productivity, nature self-cleaning technology and environmental awareness. The unique link between locations is transboundary pollution which is modelled as a PDE diffusion equation. The spatio-temporal functional is quadratic in local consumption and linear in pollution. Using a dynamic programming method adapted to our infinite dimensional setting, we solve the associated optimal control problem in closed-form and identify the asymptotic (optimal) spatial distribution of pollution. We show that optimal emissions will decrease at given location if and only if local productivity is larger than a threshold which depends both on the local pollution absorption capacity and environmental awareness. Furthermore, we numerically explore the relationship between the spatial optimal distributions of production and (asymptotic) pollution in order to uncover possible (geographic) Environmental Kuznets Curve cases.
R10|Évolutions démographiques et marché de l’immobilier neuf|Using household survey data from the ?Enqu?tes Logement? collected from 1973 to 2013, this article studies the effects of demography on the new-build housing market dynamics in France, as well as in the Paris Region, Provence-Alpes-C?te d?Azur, and in coastal regions and in landlocked regions. After computing how frequently individuals buy a new-build house for their primary residence by age, the effects of behavioral changes and demographic changes (population size and age structure) on the market dynamics are evaluated. The article analyzes the impact of population ageing and provides projections on the needs for home construction by 2060. Results suggest that while the changes in population size are in favor of acquisitions all the period long, the age structure becomes an adverse factor from the beginning of the nineties onwards. The decomposition shows that these effects are region-specific.
R10|Tentatives de réhabilitation de la théorie de la base : à la recherche des origines|L'objectif de ce papier est double. D'une part, il cherche à établir la cohérence des travaux actuels qui mobilisent les éléments clés de la théorie de la base pour déterminer les ressorts du développement économique local en Europe et outre-Atlantique (Farness, 1989 ; Markusen, 2006 ; Rutland & O'Hagan, 2007, Davezies, 2001, 2009, 2012, ...). D'autre part, il doit permettre de remettre au goût du jour une question qui nous semble aujourd'hui négligée et qui mérite d'être approfondie tant elle cristallise des enjeux importants : à quelle(s) échelle(s) d'organisation territoriale mobiliser la théorie de la base ? Sur le premier point, nous montrons que les deux tentatives actuelles de réhabilitation de la théorie de la base semblent privilégier, sans se concerter, une lecture particulière des ascendants intellectuels de ce paradigme (Blumenfeld, 1955 ; Tiebout, 1962) au détriment d'un autre héritage possible (North, 1955). Sur le second point, nous montrons comment le questionnement sur l'échelle de l'analyse économique débouche sur la prise en compte de fractales territoriaux. Mots clés : Base économique, développement territorial, multiplicateur keynésien, économie résidentielle Codes JEL: B29, O18, R10 2
R10|Socially optimal fares and frequencies for urban bus services in small cities|This paper evaluates welfare effects of optimization of fares and frequencies for bus services in small cities. The model used takes into account both congestion on streets and crowding in public transport vehicles, and is calibrated with data for the Swedish city of Uppsala. Four policies are evaluated: optimal fares with unchanged baseline frequencies, optimal frequencies with unchanged baseline fares, simultaneous optimization of fares and frequencies, and finally a so-called Pareto scenario where frequencies and fares are optimized subject to the condition that no consumer group (defined by zone, time period, and origin-destination pair) should be worse off in terms of generalized cost of each trip. The results indicate that there would be large, robust welfare gains from reducing public transport supply in Uppsala, especially in the outer zone of the city where reductions of supply compared with the current situation are large. The welfare gains from adjusting fares would be smaller. The large reductions in consumer welfare in the welfare optimum, however, are likely to be controversial. In the Pareto scenario, almost all potential social welfare gains from the welfare optimal scenario are achieved with no consumer in any zone or time period being worse off compared with the baseline policy. In this scenario, the total number of public transport passengers is increased and emissions are reduced compared with the current situation.
R10|The efficient use of infrastructure – is Sweden pricing traffic on its roads, railways, waters and airways at marginal costs?|This review summarizes recent information about the marginal costs for using Sweden’s infrastructure and the relationship between the sum of marginal costs and charges for each mode. It is demonstrated that the tax on petrol used by private cars is higher than the marginal costs for emissions, accident risk and road wear and tear. The diesel tax is, on the other hand, not sufficient for internalization of heavy vehicles’ externalities. Neither trains nor aircraft or ships pay for their marginal costs. For railways, this confirms previous observations that Swedish track user charges are low in an international context. Except for a low level of charges, several examples are given of the strong motives for differentiation of charges in time and geography. The rapid technical development makes the cost motive for not differentiating the charges increasingly irrelevant.
R10|Distributional effects of fares and frequencies for public transport in small cities|This paper evaluates the impacts of different social welfare weights on fares and frequencies, optimized to maximize welfare for bus services in the small Swedish city of Uppsala, handling both congestion in streets and crowding in public transport. It represents choice between three modes; public transport, car and a combination of walking and cycling, two periods; peak and off-peak, two zones and three origin-destination combinations. Six scenarios are evaluated; the base year (2014), a welfare optimal combination without distributional concerns and welfare optimal policies for four different sets of welfare weights with various degrees of progressivity. The main results are that, compared to the welfare optimal scenario without distributional weights, increasing the welfare weights of the low-income group increases frequencies and reduces fares successively. Comparing the simulation results to the fares and frequencies in Uppsala in 2014, optimal frequencies with even the most far reaching distributional objectives are lower.
R10|Regional Growth Paths: From Structure to Agency and Back|The study of regional growth paths is a key theme in economic geography and of elemental interest for policy makers concerned with regional development. Evolutionary theory explains the path-dependent nature of regional development, and points to its open-ended nature. This paper addresses the interplay between path-dependent, structural forces and the construction and utilization of opportunities through agentic processes. Extending to the evolutionary framework, it is argued that not only history but also perceived future opportunities influence agentic processes in the present and thus shape regional growth paths. Building on recent work about foresightful, strategic and distributed agency, this paper identifies three forms of agency, Schumpeterian innovative entrepreneurship, institutional entrepreneurship and place leadership, that call for and necessitate each other in the process of shaping regional growth paths. It is argued that such a holistic view is essential to understand regional development processes and in particular structural change as manifested in economic diversification and new industrial path development.
R10|Place-based entrepreneurship and innovation policy for industrial diversification|This paper proposes a conceptual and analytical framework for the development of place-based entrepreneurship and innovation policies aiming at industrial diversification. The starting point for this paper is the entrepreneurial ecosystem concept, which is frequently used to inform such policies. However, this concept does not specify the causal mechanisms driving industrial diversification. Furthermore, it remains questionable to what extent the concept can be applied to different regional contexts. In order to address these shortfalls, this paper i) discusses the barriers and opportunities for industrial diversification in different regional contexts, and ii) introduces a place-based policy framework for new industrial path development through entrepreneurship and innovation policies.
R10|Green industrial path development in different types of regions|As response to environmental challenges such as global warming and the extinction of species sustainable regional development has become a key policy objective. Regions, however, vary in their preconditions for green industrial path development. Taking existing regional industrial specialization patterns as a starting point, this paper develops a new typology linking regional preconditions to various pathways for green industrial path development. This provides the foundation for identifying place-based policy implications for growing clean industries in different types of regions, grounded in the emerging perspective in innovation studies on policies for transformative change. The paper thereby helps to understand the pathways for greening the economy in different regional contexts and how such green pathways can be promoted through policy.
R10|EU regions and the upgrading for the digital age|In this work we use patent data from the European patent office (EPO) to assess the capabilities of EU regions in developing digital technologies especially focusing on those that are more closely related to the digital transformation. More specifically, we measure ICT patents by considering those containing digital codes, as defined by the OECD. The penetration of digital technologies in the development of innovative products is instead captured by the co-occurrence of digital and non-digital codes within patent documents; we call these patents ICT-combining patents.
R10|Immigrant entrepreneurs, diasporas and exports|In this paper we highlight a new complementary channel to the business and social network effect Ã la Rauch (2001) through which immigrants generate increased export flows from the regions in which they settle to their countries of origin: they can become entrepreneurs. Using very small-scale (NUTS-3) administrative data on immigrants' location in Italy, the local presence of immigrant entrepreneurs (i.e. firms owned by foreign-born entrepreneurs) in the manufacturing sector, and on trade flows in manufacturing between Italian provinces and more than 200 foreign countries, we assess the causal relationship going from diasporas and immigrant entrepreneurs towards export flows. Both the size of the diaspora and the number of immigrant entrepreneurs have a positive, significant and economically meaningful effect on exports. In particular, we find that increasing the stock of (non-entrepreneur) immigrants by 10% would lead to a 1.7% increase in exports in manufacturing, while increasing the number of immigrant entrepreneurs in manufacturing by 10% would raise exports by about 0.6%.
R10|The effect of the H-1B quota on the employment and selection of foreign-born labor|The H-1B program allows skilled foreign-born individuals to work in the United States. The annual quota on new issuances of H-1B status fell from 195,000 to 65,000 in fiscal year 2004. This cap did not apply to new employees of colleges, universities, and non-profit research institutions. Existing H-1B holders seeking to renew their status were also exempt from the quota. Using a triple difference approach, this paper demonstrates that cap restrictions significantly reduced the hiring of new H-1B workers in for-profit firms relative to what would have occurred in an unconstrained environment. Declines were most pronounced at the top and bottom quintiles of the wage distribution. Restrictions did not reduce hiring of new H-1B workers from India, in computer-related occupations, or at firms using the H-1B program intensively.
R10|One billion Euro program for early childcare services in Italy|In 2007 the Italian central government started a program by transferring funds to regional governments to develop both private and public early childcare services. Exploiting the different timing of program implementation across regions, we evaluate its effectiveness in boosting the public supply of early childhood educational services. We find that the ratio between the available slots in public early childhood education and the population of those aged 0-2 increased by 18.1% three years after the start of the program, with respect to the pre-program level. The program impact was however nil in the South and totally driven by the Center-North.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

Both the size of the diaspora and the number of immigrant entrepreneurs have a positive, significant and economically meaningful effect on exports. We find that increasing the stock of (non-entrepreneur) immigrants by 10% would lead to a 1.7% increase in exports in manufacturing towards immigrants' countries of origin, while increasing the number of immigrant entrepreneurs in manufacturing by 10% would raise exports by about 0.6%. We also show that, besides these bilateral effects, the population of immigrant entrepreneurs raises a province's overall competitiveness and export flows towards all potential destinations.
R10|Inequality, Frictional Assignment and Home-ownership|Cross-city variation in the rate of home-ownership and the relative costs of renting and owning are studied using a model of frictional assignment. Houses of different types are built by a competitive construction industry and either rented in Walrasian markets or sold through a process of competitive search to households. Households differ with regard to their permanent income and sort over house types and housing tenure at each point in time. Along a balanced growth path, both the composition of the city's housing stock and the rate of home-ownership depend on the distributions of income, construction costs, and housing amenities. In the absence of either financial frictions or minimum house size requirements, higher income households live in better houses and are more likely on average to be homeowners than lower income ones. A calibrated version illustrates the extent to which income/wealth inequality alone can ac- count for variation in home-ownership and the price-rent ratio both within and across cities.

R10|House prices in local markets in Italy: dynamics, levels and the role of urban agglomerations|The national pattern of house price dynamics masks considerable heterogeneity across local areas and markets; disparities are even higher looking at house price levels. In this paper we describe these structural differences across Italy, with particular focus on the role of metropolitan areas over the last 50 years. Our analysis shows that housing cycles differ across geographical areas and urban agglomerations both in depth and length. Cycles reflect metropolises’ price dynamics in all the macro-areas except the South, where the biggest cities and the other towns exhibit similar dynamics. Geographical disparities are even stronger if we turn to price levels: following a period of relative convergence in the second half of the 1990s, the gap between areas widened again. Finally, using data covering the last decade, we analyse house price heterogeneity across areas, including the hinterland of metropolises, taking into account the contribution of a set of relevant socio-economic characteristics, the first one being income, to the distribution of house prices.
R10|¿Quiénes son los docentes en Colombia? Características generales y brechas regionales|Este documento presenta una descripción detallada de los docentes del sector oficial en Colombia, haciendo especial énfasis en las marcadas brechas regionales. El análisis se basa en registros oficiales del Ministerio de Educación Nacional, que incluyen información detallada de todos los docentes oficiales del país. Además, se miden las habilidades académicas de los docentes a través de los puntajes que estos obtuvieron en las pruebas SABER 11, cuando eran estudiantes de bachillerato. Los resultados indican que, así como hay importantes diferencias entre instituciones educativas urbanas y rurales, aquellas ubicadas en municipios pequeños (no certificados) y regiones periféricas también enfrentan grandes dificultades para atraer y retener buenos docentes. Esto se ve reflejado tanto en la menor formación y las bajas habilidades académicas de los docentes como en la alta provisionalidad de la planta. Estas características están, a su vez, fuertemente correlacionadas con el desempeño de los alumnos en todos los niveles. **** ABSTRACT: This paper presents a comprehensive description of public school teachers in Colombia, with a particular emphasis on regional gaps. Our analysis is based on administrative records from the Ministry of Education, which contain detailed information on all public school teachers in the country. Additionally, we match teachers' records to the high school national exit exam (SABER 11) to obtain a measure of their academic skills. Results indicate that, while urbanrural gaps are important, they are not the only sources of regional inequality. Schools located in small (uncertified) municipalities and peripheral regions also face great difficulties to attract and retain highly skilled teachers. This is reflected in the teachers' educational attainment and test scores, and also in the share of provisional appointments. These characteristics are, in turn, strongly correlated with students' performance at all levels.
R10|Regional economic development in Europe, 1900-2010: a description of the patterns|We provide the first long-run dataset of regional employment structures and regional GDP and GDP per capita in 1990 international dollars, stretching over more than 100 years. These data allow us to compare regions over time, among each other, and to other parts of the world. After some brief notes on methodology we describe the basic patterns in the data in terms of some key dimensions: variation in the density of population and economic activity, the spread of industry and services and the declining role of agriculture, and changes in the levels of GDP and GDP per capita. We next discuss patterns of convergence and divergence over time and their explanations in terms of short-run adjustment and long-run fundamentals. Also, we document for the first time a secular decrease in spatial coherence from 1900 to 2010. We find a U-shaped development in geographic concentration and regional income inequality, similar to the finding of a U-shaped pattern of personal income inequality.
R10|Future European Alliance - Europe as a Flexible Democracy|A reasonable future for Europe can only be achieved if two essential elements are fulfilled: Firstly, newly established institutions must be democratic and have strong support from citizens rather than from national governments. Secondly, the large number of different ethnic, cultural, religious, and regional units existing on the European continent must be able to maintain their identity. This diversity must be institutionally supported rather than be undermined by standardization and centralization. We suggest political institutions, which are formed to meet these goals, following the example of Functional, Overlapping, Competing Jurisdictions (FOCJ). If these two goals are adequately reached, a future alliance raises the identification with the European project, and induces citizens to exhibit civic virtue in strengthening these goals.
R10|Transferencias condicionadas y sus impactos sobre el desempeño económico local: Evidencia para Colombia|Este artículo examina el efecto del programa de transferencias monetarias condicionadas (CCT) Familias en Acción (FA) sobre el desarrollo económico local. Utilizando el impuesto municipal de industria y comercio como proxy de la actividad económica local mediante el uso de datos panel complementados con las técnicas de Soporte Común se obtienen resultados que sugieren que el programa está asociado negativamente con el desempeño económico de los municipios en el largo plazo. El aumento de una desviación estándar en el stock de las transferencias de FA, genera una disminución de 0,13 desviaciones estándar en este impuesto. Además se encuentra que mayores transferencias acumuladas per cápita de FA están asociadas a menores niveles de impuesto predial –siendo este último proxy de capital físico- el cual es un canal a través del que se explica la relación negativa entre las transferencias de FA y el desempeño económico. En complemento se evidencio que el programa FA ha contribuido a aumentar el capital humano en los municipios con hogares beneficiarios. Sin embargo, particularmente su efecto global en el desarrollo económico no es necesariamente positivo.

R10|Place-Based Policies for Development|Many development policies, such as placement of infrastructure or local economic development schemes, are “place-based.” Such policies are generally intended to stimulate private sector investment and economic growth in the treated place, and as such they are difficult to appraise and evaluate. This paper sets out a framework for analyzing the effects of such policies and assessing their social value. It then reviews the literature on place-based policies in the contexts of transport improvements, economic corridors, special economic zones, lagging regions, and urban policies.
R10|European Funds and Firm Dynamics: Estimating Spillovers from Increased Access|We take advantage of a quasi-natural experiment to assess the impact of European funds on firm dynamics in regions that, while not having their status changed, saw their neighbours increased access to European funds. Causality is established in a difference-in-differences intention to treat setting, using a rich dataset that considers the universe of Portuguese mainland municipalities from 2003 to 2010, and controlling for socio-economic, political and demographic variables. Our findings suggest a causal impact of between 1 and 2 percent in private sector firms´ entry and net entry rates, while we find no impact on firm exit rates. We consider time and space placebos to assure the reliability of our estimates. Our findings suggest that EU regional funds have a greater impact in times of distress, such as the world economic crisis, as far as entry rates are concerned. The analysis of the cross-section of firm demonstrates it is domestic owned micro firms in the primary and tertiary sectors that are most impacted by regional funds.
R10|The Effect of Changes in Border Regimes on Border Regions Crime Rates: Evidence from the Schengen Treaty|In recent years, many countries have increased border controls, partly in response to public concerns that open borders favor cross‐border crime. Despite these widespread concerns, empirical research on whether public fears are justified is still scarce. This article evaluates whether the abolition of border controls at the eastern German and Austrian borders accompanying the implementation of the Schengen Treaty in December 2007 increased crime rates in the border areas of these countries. Based on official crime statistics, conditional difference‐in‐differences estimation allows the evaluation of border controls in a causal way. Results show that in Germany and Austria, a significant positive effect can only be observed for burglaries, suggesting that public concerns proved to be justified for this type of criminal offense. In contrast, no significant effect can be observed for overall crime rates or for other common types of crime against property, indicating that there is little empirical evidence for the widespread concerns about public security.
R10|Revisiting the finance-inequality nexus in a panel of African countries|The study assesses the role of financial development on income inequality in a panel of 48 African countries for the period 1996–2014. Financial development is defined in terms of depth (money supply and liquid liabilities), efficiency (from banking and financial system perspectives), activity (at banking and financial system levels) and stability while, three indicators of inequality are used, namely, the: Gini coefficient, Atkinson index and Palma ratio. The empirical evidence is based on Generalised Method of Moments. When financial sector development indicators are used exclusively as strictly exogenous variables in the identification process, it is broadly established that with the exception of financial stability, access to credit (or financial activity) and intermediation efficiency have favourable income redistributive effects. The findings are robust to the: control for unobserved heterogeneity in terms of time effects and inclusion of time invariant variables as strictly exogenous variables in the identification process. The findings are also robust to the Kuznets hypothesis: an inverted humped shaped nexus between increasing GDP per capita and inequality. Policy implications are discussed.
R10|Testing the Quiet Life Hypothesis in the African Banking Industry|Abstract The Quiet Life Hypothesis (QLH) is the pursuit of less efficiency by firms. In this study, we assess if powerful banks in the African banking industry are increasing financial access. The QLH is therefore consistent with the pursuit of financial intermediation inefficiency by large banks. To investigate the hypothesis, we first estimate the Lerner index. Then, using Two Stage Least Squares, we assess the effect of the Lerner index on financial access proxied by loan price and loan quantity. The empirical evidence is based on a panel of 162 banks from 42 countries for the period 2001–2011. The findings support the QLH, although quiet life is driven by the below-median Lerner index sub-sample. Policy implications are discussed.
R10|Information asymmetry, financialization, and financial access|This study investigates whether information sharing channels that are meant to reduce information asymmetry have led to an increase in financial access. The study employs a Generalized Method of Moments technique using data from 53 African countries during the period from 2004 to 2011 to examine this linkage. Information sharing channels are theoretically designed to promote the formal financial sector and discourage the informal financial sector. The study uses two information sharing channels: private credit bureaus and public credit registries. The study found that both information sharing channels have a positive and significant impact on financial access. The study also found that public credit registries complement the formal financial sector to promote financial access. Policy implications are discussed.
R10|The Effectiveness of Development Aid for Agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa|Purpose: Agriculture is the major source of livelihood for the majority population in Sub-Saharan Africa but its productivity is not only low it has started showing signs of decline since 2012. The paper seeks to find out whether official development assistance for agriculture is effective. Design/Methodology/Approach: The data for development assistance for agriculture are broken down into the major agricultural sectors in receiving countries. The empirical evidence is based on the two-step system Generalized Method of Moments to assess the degree of responsiveness of agricultural productivity to development assistance. Findings: There is a positive relationship between development assistance and agricultural productivity in general. However, when broken down into the major agricultural recipient sectors, there is a substitution effect between food crop production and industrial crop production. Better institutions and economic freedom are found to enable agricultural productivity growth, and to increase the effectiveness of development assistance. The structural economic transformation associated with agricultural development assistance is also found to be weak. Practical Implications: Allocation of development assistance for agriculture is primarily determined by need, although expected effectiveness also increases the assistance receipts. Agricultural assistance policies could focus more on building productive capacity to reduce the need while boosting effectiveness. Originality: Breaking down data into agricultural recipient sectors, and controlling for the potential spurious correlation under the assumption that more development assistance could be allocated where agricultural productivity is already increasing due to some other factors.
R10|Environmental degradation and inclusive human development in sub‐Saharan Africa|In the light of challenges to sustainable development in the post‐2015 development agenda, this paper assesses how increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions affect inclusive human development in 44 countries in sub‐Saharan Africa for the period 2000–2012. The following findings are established from Fixed Effects and Tobit regressions: first, unconditional effects and conditional impacts are respectively positive and negative from CO2 emissions per capita, CO2 emissions from liquid fuel consumption, and CO2 intensity. This implies a Kuznets‐shaped curve because of consistent decreasing returns; and second, the corresponding net effects are consistently positive. The following findings are apparent from Generalized Method of Moments regressions: first, unconditional effects and conditional impacts are respectively negative and positive from CO2 emissions per capita, CO2 emissions from liquid fuel consumption, and CO2 intensity. This implies a U‐shaped curve because of consistent increasing returns; and second, the corresponding net effects are overwhelmingly negative. Based on the robust findings and choice of best estimator, the net effect of increasing CO2 emissions on inclusive human development is negative. Policy implications are discussed.
R10|“This One Is 400 Libyan Dinars, This One Is 500”: Insights from Cognitive Human Capital and Slave Trade| One of the most disturbing contemporary episodes in human history that has been decried globally is the recent Libyan experience of slave trade, where migrants captured end-up being sold as slaves. We contribute to the understanding of this phenomenon by investigating the role of cognitive human capital on slave trade. To this end, we use the historic intelligence and slave trade variables, respectively, as the independent and outcome variables of interest. Our findings show a negative relationship between slave trade and cognitive human capital. Hence, the slave trade is more apparent when cognitive human capital is low. The Ordinary Least Squares findings are robust to the control for outliers, uncertainty about the model and Tobit regressions. We substantiate why from the perspective of massive sensitization and education, the non-contemporary relationship between cognitive ability and slave trade established in this study has contemporary practical policy relevance in efforts to stem the tide of clandestine travel to Europe through countries in which clandestine migrants are captured and sold as slaves.
R10|Sustaining Economic Development|This paper astutely argues the importance of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in the growth of economies globally. Specifically, in the United States, according to the Small Business Administration (SBA), small businesses make around 53% of United States employer firms, 63% of net new private-sector jobs, 48.5% of private-sector employment.
R10|Small And Medium Entreprise Policy Reforms And Formalization Performance In Nigeria|In this study we employ the “Difference Principle” approach to evaluate the costs and benefits of firms transiting from an informal to formal sector (Formalization). We focus on both the differential impacts and effectiveness of policy reforms such as microfinance policy and other related micro-enterprise policies aimed at attracting informal firms into the formal sector. Introduction of Institutional reforms presupposes that firms in the informal sector maximizes a given welfare condition which acts as an incentive to formalize.
R10|Does CSR contribute to the development of rural young people in cultural tourism of sub-Saharan Africa? Evidence from the Niger Delta in Nigeria|Handicrafts are key cultural products consumed in the Nigeriaâ€™s tourism industry. Owing to low entry barriers, as handicrafts require a low level of capital investment, there is potential to develop viable linkages between tourism and local handicrafts sectors that create economic opportunities for local artisans. Thus, we assess the impact of a new corporate social responsibility (CSR) model of multinational oil companies on the development of rural young people (RYP) in cultural tourism in the Niger Delta of Nigeria. Six hundred RYP were sampled across the rural Niger Delta region. Using the logit model, results indicate that RYP have remained widely excluded from the General Memorandum of Understandings (GMoUs) interventions in cultural tourism projects due to the traditional beliefs that cultural affairs are prerogatives of elders, a caveat to the youths. This implies that if the traditions of the communities continue to hinder direct participation of the RYP from the GMoUs cultural tourism project interventions, achieving equality and cultural change would be limited in the region. The findings suggest that since handicrafts are key cultural products consumed in the tourism industry, GMoUs can play a role in helping to create an appropriate intervention structure that will be targeted towards youth empowerment in the area of traditional handicraft. This can be achieved if the Cluster Development Boards (CDBs) would focus on integrating rural young artisans into local tourism value chains and ensuring that they benefit economically from the sector. The CDBs should aim at creating space for the views of rural young indigenous peopleâ€™s handicrafts; emphasizing the value of indigenous knowledge, particularly on arts and crafts for tourists and expatriate in multinational corporations in Nigeria.
R10|Doing Business and Inclusive Human Development in Sub-Saharan Africa|Purpose- This study examines how doing business affects inclusive human development in 48 sub-Saharan Africa for the period 2000-2012. Design/methodology/approach- The measurement of inclusive human development encompasses both absolute pro-poor and relative pro-poor concepts of inclusive development. Three doing business variables are used, namely: the number of start-up procedures required to register a business; time required to start a business; and time to prepare and pay taxes. The empirical evidence is based on Fixed Effects and Generalised Method of Moments regressions. Findings- The findings show that increasing constraints to the doing of business have a negative effect on inclusive human development. Originality/value- The study is timely and very relevant to the post-2015 Sustainable Development agenda for two fundamental reasons: (i) Exclusive development is a critical policy syndrome in Africa because about 50% of countries in the continent did not attain the MDG extreme poverty target despite enjoying more than two decades of growth resurgence. (ii) Growth in Africa is primarily driven by large extractive industries and with the population of the continent expected to double in about 30 years, scholarship on entrepreneurship for inclusive development is very welcome. This is essentially because studies have shown that the increase in unemployment (resulting from the underlying demographic change) would be accommodated by the private sector, not the public sector.
R10|The Mobile Phone as an Argument for Good Governance in Sub-Saharan Africa|Purpose- This study presents theoretical and empirical arguments for the role of mobile telephony in promoting good governance in 47 sub-Saharan African countries for the period 2000-2012. Design/methodology/approach- The empirical inquiry uses an endogeneity-robust GMM approach with forward orthogonal deviations to analyse the linkage between mobile phone usage and the variation in three broad governance categories — political, economic and institutional. Findings- Three key findings are established: First, in terms of individual governance indicators, mobile phones consistently stimulated good governance by the same magnitude, with the exception of the effect on the regulation component of economic governance. Second, when indicators are combined, the effect of mobile phones on general governance is three times higher than that on the institutional governance category. Third, countries with lower levels of governance indicators are catching-up with their counterparts with more advanced dynamics. Originality/value- The study makes both theoretical and empirical contributions by highlighting the importance of various combinations of governance indicators and their responsiveness to mobile phone usage.
R10|The role of inclusive development and military expenditure in modulating the effect of terrorism on governance|Purpose- The study investigates the role of inclusive human development and military expenditure in modulating the effect of terrorism on governance. Design/methodology/approach- It is based on 53 African countries for the period 1998-2012 and interactive Generalised Method of Moments is employed. Six governance indicators from the World Bank and two terrorism variables are used, namely: domestic and transnational terrorism dynamics. Findings- The following main findings are established. There is a negative net effect on governance (regulation quality and corruption-control) when inclusive human development is used to reduce terrorism. There is a positive net impact on governance (“voice and accountability” and rule of law) when military expenditure is used to reduce domestic terrorism. Originality/value- We have complemented the sparse literature on the use of policy variables to mitigate the effect of policy syndromes on macroeconomic outcomes.
R10|Inequality, ICT and financial access in Africa|This study investigates the role of information and communication technology (ICT) on income inequality through financial development dynamics of depth (money supply and liquid liabilities), efficiency (at banking and financial system levels), activity (from banking and financial system perspectives) and size, in 48 African countries for the period 1996 to 2014. The empirical evidence is based on Generalised Method of Moments. While both financial depth and size are established to reduce inequality contingent on ICT, only the effect of financial depth in reducing inequality is robust to the inclusion of time invariant variables to the set of strictly exogenous variables. We extend the analysis by decomposing financial depth into its components, namely: formal, informal, semi-formal and non-formal financial sectors. The findings based on this extension show that ICT reduces income inequality through formal financial sector development and financial sector formalization as opposed to informal financial sector development and financial sector informalization. The study contributes at the same time to the macroeconomic literature on measuring financial development and responds to the growing field of addressing post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) inequality challenges by means of ICT and financial access.
R10|Investigating the relevance of mobile technology adoption on inclusive growth in West Africa|This paper empirically investigates the role of mobile technology adoption on inclusive growth in 15 West African countries with a view to ascertaining if the positive role of mobile technology adoption on human development as established in other regions holds in West Africa. It used data from World Development Indicators for the period 2004 to 2014, which was estimated with system generalised method of moments (SGMM). The SGMM results show that mobile cell subscription has a statistically insignificant effect on inclusive growth in West Africa which refutes the positive and significant role of mobile technology adoption on inclusive growth. The possible reasons for the results and recommendations are documented in the study.
R10|Knowledge-Driven Economic Growth: The Case of Sub-Saharan Africa|The experience of South Korea, India, China and Singapore reveals that developing economies can fast track development, leapfrog the stage of development and catch up with advanced economies by putting knowledge capital as the driver of development. If the knowledge economy is therefore an accelerant of development for both advanced and developing econmies, it is possible for Sub-Saharan African (SSA) economies to also catch up with advanced economies.
R10|Recent Financial Advances in Information Technology For Inclusive Development: A Systematic Review|The overarching question tackled in this paper is: to what degree has financial development contributed to providing opportunities of human development for those on low-incomes and by what information technology mechanism? We systematically review about 180 recently published paper to provide recent information technology advances in finance for inclusive development.
R10|Entrepreneurship and MSME Development in Nigeria|The paper explores entrepreneurship and MSME Development as a veritable platform for the transformaation of the Nigeria economy. The small enterprises are viewed as the oil required for lubricating the wheel of socio-economic re-engineering of the economy.
R10|Dollarization and the “unbundling” of globalization in sub-Saharan Africa|This study contributes to the dollarization literature by expanding its determinants to account for different dimensions of globalization, using the widely employed KOF index of globalization. Specifically, globalization is “unbundled” into three different layers namely: economic, social and political dimensions. The study focuses on 25 sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries for the period 2001–2012. Using the Tobit regression approach, the following findings are established. First, from both economic and statistical relevance, the social and political dimensions of globalization constitute the key dollarization amplifiers, while the explanatory power of the economic component is weaker on dollarization. Second, consistent with the theoretical underpinnings, macroeconomic instabilities (such as inflation and exchange rate volatilities) have the positive expected signs. Third, the positive association between the accumulation of international reserves and dollarization is also apparent. Policy implications are discussed.
R10|The Comparative Economics of ICT, Environmental Degradation and Inclusive Human Development in Sub-Saharan Africa|Abstract This study examines how information and communication technology (ICT) could be employed to dampen the potentially damaging effects of environmental degradation in order to promote inclusive human development in a panel of 44 Sub-Saharan African countries. ICT is captured with internet and mobile phone penetration rates whereas environmental degradation is measured in terms of CO2 emissions per capita and CO2 intensity. The empirical evidence is based on fixed effects and Tobit regressions using data from 2000 to 2012. In order to increase the policy relevance of this study, the dataset is decomposed into fundamental characteristics of inclusive development and environmental degradation based on income levels (low income vs. middle income); legal origins (English Common law vs. French Civil law); religious domination (Christianity vs. Islam); openness to sea (landlocked vs. coastal); resource-wealth (oil-rich vs. oil-poor) and political stability (stable vs. unstable). Baseline findings broadly show that improvement in both of measures of ICT would significantly diminish the possibly harmful effect of CO2 emissions on inclusive human development. When the analysis is extended with the above mentioned fundamental characteristics, we observe that the moderating influence of both our ICT variables on CO2 emissions is higher in the group of English Common law, middle income and oil-wealthy countries than in the French Civil law, low income countries and oil-poor countries respectively. Theoretical and practical policy implications are discussed.
R10|Responsible use of crop protection products and Nigeria’s growth enhancement support scheme|We examine the impact of the federal government of Nigeria’s (FGN) growth enhancement support scheme (GESS) on responsible use of crop protection products (CPPs) in rural Nigeria. Results from the use of logistic regressions show that GESS significantly impact on farmers’ access to CPPs, but does not significantly impact on farmers’ knowledge and skill of CPP application, and in several cases the misuse has led to deterioration of soil fertility. Findings suggests that embracing information on recommended CPPs, dose rates, dilutions, timing, frequency of applications and precautions should form the foundation of GESS activity attributable to CPPs in sub-Saharan Africa.
R10|Living Apart Together: The Economic Value of Ethnic Diversity in Cities|In consumer cities, the presence and location of immigrants impacts house prices through two channels, which both can be valued positively as well as negatively: (i) their presence and contribution to population diversity and (ii) the creation of immigrant-induced consumer amenities like those associated with ethnic restaurants in terms of both quantity as well as diversity. We hypothesize that these two mechanisms create a trade-off in which city dwellers want to live apart yet consume together. We derive a simple intra-city residential location model in which distance to immigrant amenities and the immigrant population in neighborhoods contribute to the explanation of differences in house prices. We use unique micro data of house prices and ethnic restaurants in the city of Amsterdam over the 1996-2011 period to estimate the trade-off between consumers' love for ethnic goods and its variety on the one hand, and ethnic residential composition on the other hand. Our results show the existence of a trade-off in which access to ethnic restaurants compensates for the negative effect of the presence of immigrants on house prices. Diversity of immigrant-induced amenities has an additional positive effect on house prices.
R10|Innovation and geographical spillovers: new approaches and empirical evidence| Innovation and geographical spillovers: new approaches and empirical evidence. Regional Studies. This special issue concerns the generation of knowledge and geographical spillovers, and it includes a selection of papers that cover existent research gaps with respect to the role of space in the promotion of knowledge spillovers and innovation. These papers analyse different typologies of innovation processes carried out in several geographical areas and highlight heterogeneities of these processes, after focusing on several determinants in innovation. Empirical results indicate the positive role of geographical spillovers and the importance of accurate matching among firms, in industry and with regard to regional characteristics, in order to ensure the generation of knowledge and innovation.
R10|Structural change and convergence across European regions|The aim of our paper is to analyze the structural diversity of the European regions assuming the complexity of production spaces approach (Hidalgo C.A., B. Klinger, A.L. Barabási, R. Hausmann 2007). This stream of economic literature is the natural companion of the evolutionary theory of economics, where development is seen as the endogenous learning process led by the initial knowledge basis, which tends to expand in its proximity (Boschma 2005). The first step of our analysis is to map the EU regions according to their economic structure. We exploit information conveyed by Eurostat data, which are available for a balanced panel of 241 regions and 86 economic branches in 2010 and 2015. In this way we are able to construct a space characterized by technological proximity of regions. The underlying assumption is that territories with similar production structures display similar production knowledge. The second step is the construction of the network space based on the correlation matrix. In order to obtain the clusters of regions based on the similarity of their economic structure, we apply a modularity algorithm to the network. Such measures define groups based on the degree of connectedness of the observations between them and allows to measure how such groups explain the network connections using as benchmark a case in which edges where assigned randomly. Our findings suggest that regions, which are more dynamic in terms of structural change, are those with manufacturing capabilities located in Eastern European countries. Such regions were able to upgrade their competences towards more complex productions and this resulted also in a fast catch-up of their GDP per capita level with respect to other mid income regions in Western Europe. Most prosperous regions are found to be urban areas with developed creative service activities and in regions with advanced manufactures (machinery, automotive, electronics, etc.); whereas backwardness is detected in regions with a cumbersome weight of tourism related activities.
R10|A socio-political analysis of obstacles to inclusive regional development: The case of Marseille metropolitan area|After a long and heated debate, and outright opposition from many mayors ofÂ Bouches-du-RhÃ´ne towns, the creation of Aix-Marseille Provence MÃ©tropole wasÂ passed in 2013. In January 2016, the Marseille metropolitan area expanded toÂ include surrounding areas, where nearly two million people live. It will equal, orÂ exceed in size, other French metropolitan areas, and it will lead to coordinatedÂ policies in terms of urban planning, transportation and economic development.Â Finally, a more cohesive territory between the metropolis (Marseille) and itsÂ periphery is expected to carry out joint projects more efficiently. By adopting aÂ socio-political understanding of the Marseille metropolitan area, the article pointsÂ out that territorial fragmentation and widening social inequalities betweenÂ different towns are a real threat to the complete success of the project. SinceÂ World War II, the Marseille city has not built strong ties with its close neighbors,Â trying to find the sources of its future development in a European hinterland, theÂ port of Fos-sur-Mer being the entry point.

R10|The impact of employment on housing prices: Detailed evidence from FDI in Ireland|Access to employment is one of the most valuable amenities offered by cities. In urban economics, this is the principal driver of the bid-rent gradient and is a key determinant of housing prices and land values. However, little is known about the causal effect of employment on housing prices, due to the problem of identification. This study presents the first causal estimates of employment changes on housing prices, both sales and rental. It does this by using a purpose-built spatially granular dataset of 1.4 million housing prices and FDI employment, covering Ireland 2007–2013. Identification rests on a combination of rich spatio-temporal variation due to the abundance of FDI in Ireland, a rich set of location controls and an inelastic housing supply in the period covered. The main results show that 1–2 years after 1000 extra jobs have been created, monthly rents in nearby properties will be between 0.5% and 1% higher. The effect on prices is at least 2% but less consistent across specifications. On average, net job creation in export-oriented FDI firms 2009–2013 added roughly €48 million to the stock of wealth of owner occupied real estate and €8 million to the stock of wealth of the rental sector. We also estimate that the aggregate effect of the stock of FDI jobs in 2013 on Irish housing prices is €440 million, or just over 1%.
R10|On the optimal design of place-based policies: A structural evaluation of EU regional transfers|We quantify general equilibrium effects of place-based policies in a multiregion framework with mobility, trade and agglomeration economies. Using detailed data on EU transfers, we infer the local effects of different transfer types on productivity, income and transportation cost. Based on these estimates and the general equilibrium model we derive the spatial distribution of economic activity and the resulting aggregate welfare effects if (i) no transfers were paid and taxes set to zero, (ii) transfers were distributed uniformly, (iii) transfers were welfare-optimally distributed. Characterizing the optimal distributions, we reveal complementarities between transfer types and between transfers and local endowments.
R10|Approaching regional openness through measures of specialization and spatial market shares: experimentations with micro-data on enterprises|In this paper, I present the results of ongoing experimentations with micro-data data of firms in order to develop better insights into the economic specialization and openness to trade of regions. Using newly developed indicators, one based on Huff-like models and another on Marcon and Puech's M function, I explore the possibilities offered by building analyses on the basis of point data instead of the classic regional aggregations.
R10|Regional analysis of sanitation performance in India|India bears a disproportionate burden of open defecation in spite of investing more and more funds and ushering in several institutional efforts including the Swachh Bharat Mission in the recent past. A large share of rural households still lack basic sanitation facilities in India and members practice open defecation. Thia study endeavours to examine the existing anomaly between meagre sanitation productivity and enhanced resource allocation in rural sanitation in India. The study attempts to develop an instrument to monitor the differential regional performances across India.
R10|Sanitation challenges of the poor in urban and rural settings: Case studies of Bengaluru City and rural North Karnataka|Bengaluru city faces severe challenges in providing sanitation infrastructure for the urban poor. Similarly, we have villages in North Karnataka that encounter problems of toilet access and related challenges. This paper addresses concerns both in city and rural contexts. We surveyed 400 respondents across 20 slums and 500 respondents in six districts of North Karnataka through survey instruments and focus group discussions (FGDs) to understand the problems with respect to toilet access and usage. Open defecation (OD) prevails in spite of several interventions made. In the urban contexts, lack of usage was largely due to technical discrepancies, behavioural concerns, space issue, water scarcity and poor maintenance of toilets. In the rural contexts, apart from water scarcity, restricted space, poor maintenance, cultural habits and financial constraints dominated non-usage of toilets. This paper captures these issues in-depth and provides some options in technologies and improved governance based on study findings and review of case studies. In the urban areas too, the topography of the slum location, operation and maintenance and apt technology plays an important role while in the rural areas, promoting education and awareness creates a positive impact on usage of toilets. Also, institutionalising the process of construction with transparency and accountability at various stages matters to ensure proper construction of toilets.
R10|Dynamic responses to labor demand shocks: Evidence from the financial industry in Delaware|This paper analyzes an important shock to local labor demand in financial services: firm relocation to Delaware following a Supreme Court ruling and state legislation in the 1980s. Using synthetic controls and bordering states, I find large effects on employment, unemployment, and participation in the first decade. Wage effects, and in many cases employment spillovers to the nontradable sector, appear larger than estimates from shocks to the tradable sector. Effects persist for ten to twenty years after Delaware loses its original policy-induced advantage. The shift towards a low unemployment sector explains this persistence, rather than direct productivity effects or agglomeration.
R10|Determinants of Urban Sprawl: A Panel Data Approach|This paper applies fixed effects (within-groups) and between-groups estimations to panel data to test hypotheses of the monocentric urban model with urbanized area data for the period 1990–2010. The paper examines the impact of population, household income, transportation cost, and land rent at the urban fringe on urbanized area spatial size. The fixed effects regression finds that a 1- percent increase in population and a 1- percent decrease in travel cost causes an urbanized area to expand by 1.087 percent and 0.127 percent, respectively. The impact of household income is non-linear. The regression results from the between-groups estimation indicate that geographic and political factors help explain the spatial size differences across urbanized areas. The spatial size of an urbanized area is larger with a higher percentage of the urban fringe overlying aquifers, a higher percentage of local revenues from intergovernmental transfers, a higher percentage of urban fringe incorporated in 1980, and a lower elevation range in the urban fringe.
R10|Immigration and Trade: The Case Study of Veneto Region in Italy|This paper investigates the relation between immigration and trade by focusing on Veneto region in Italy. The reference period is 2008-2015, interfering with the economic crisis, thus the results obtained can be time specific. The presence of immigrants in Veneto was constantly on the rise, also during the crisis, although at a lower pace compared to pre-crisis years. The question is which role could this play in ascertaining the stability, if not expansion, of trade relations between the region and the countries of immigrants' origin. The estimates of gravity model suggest a non-linear relationship between the number of immigrants and total exports from (imports to) the host-province to (from) the country of origin, the type of this relation moreover differs by sector of origin of trade. Higher presence of immigrants can potentially induce shifts in the structure of local economy, especially if it is highly dependent on international trade like in the case of Veneto
R10|Socio-Economic Determinants of Student Mobility and Inequality of Access to Higher Education in Italy|This paper introduces a modified version of the Hansen-gravity model as a framework to estimate the accessibility of higher education (HE) institutions in Italy from equal opportunities perspective. The key assumption underlying gravity models is that accessibility decreases with spatial distance from opportunities. The paper extends the gravity equation to allow for the inclusion of socio-economic factors influencing the access to HE. The findings reveal differences in response to quality and to other institutional characteristics by parental background and gender. Finally, decomposition of overall inequality into spatial and aspatial components reveals both the physical and social distance between groups of students seeking higher education opportunities in the country.
R10|Economic Challenges of Lagging Regions IV: Case Studies|This report presents the findings of three case studies of lagging regions in the EU to deepen the findings of wiiw Research Reports 421 to 423. The three (NUTS 2) case study regions are the Italian Campania, the Portuguese Norte and the Romanian Nord-Est region. While each of these regions faces specific challenges due to their economic, social and geographic characteristics, they are at the same time to some extent representative of other EU regions that share similar characteristics and/or challenges. Each case study covers the economic development in the respective region, highlighting the main strengths and weaknesses in the region’s performance. Furthermore, each case study identifies the major, region-specific, causes of the observed developments. By focusing on those causes, each analysis develops a region-specific storyline on the success and failures in the regions’ economic development. Finally, each case study derives conclusions based on the above analysis. These conclusions should be indicative of potential development opportunities for each region and the necessary policy measures to overcome existing challenges in order to exploit these opportunities.
R10|Transport Infrastructure, City Productivity Growth and Sectoral Reallocation: Evidence from China|This paper examines the impact of highway expansion on aggregate productivity growth and sectoral reallocation between cities in China. To do so, I construct a unique dataset of bilateral transportation costs between Chinese cities, digitized highway network maps, and firm-level census. I first derive and estimate a market access measure for cities in China from 1995 to 2005. I then examine the channels through which the highway infrastructure affected economic outcomes. The results suggest that highways promoted aggregate productivity growth by facilitating the entry of new firms and reallocation among existing firms. I estimate the aggregate economic impact of China's national highway system and find that eliminating all highways in China would decrease aggregate productivity by 3.2%. There is also evidence that the national highway system led to a sectoral reallocation between cities in China.
R10|Quantifying the effect of labor market size on learning externalities|This paper provides empirical evidence that individual labor productivity significantly depends on the size of the local labor market in which a worker previously acquired work experience. The analysis uses German micro data from the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) on transitions to employment within the period 2005 to 2011 and individual employment biographies from 1975 onwards. Analyzing the wages associated with the newly established employment relationships, suggests that dynamic agglomeration economies in general, and learning externalities in particular, play an important role in explaining individual labor productivity. Workers receive a significantly higher wage after acquiring experience in urban than in non-urban labor markets. Doubling local employment in all labor markets where experience was acquired, increases the productivity of a worker with two years of work experience by more than 0.7 percent. After 10 years of experience the corresponding gain amounts to about three percent, after 30 years to about four to five percent. A key factor seems to be an above average share of high-skilled labor within large urban labor markets which is supposed to enhance local learning opportunities.
R10|What drives spatial clusters of entrepreneurship in China? Evidence from economic census data|Since Chinese government initiated economic reform in the late 1970s, entrepreneurship and private sectors have emerged gradually and played an increasingly important role in promoting economic growth. However, entrepreneurship is distributed unevenly in China. Using micro data from 2008 economic census and 2005 population census, this paper explains spatial clusters of entrepreneurship for both manufacturing and services. For both sectors, entrepreneurship (measured by new private firms) tends to emerge in places with more relevant upstream and downstream firms. Moreover, Chinitz's (1961) theories are also supported for manufacturing: small upstream and downstream firms seem to be more important for manufacturing entrepreneurship. For both sectors, entrepreneurship is positively related to city size, the share of young adults and the elderly population, and foreign direct investment. More migrants are also found to promote service entrepreneurship. Our paper is the first to consider both manufacturing and service entrepreneurship in China and should be of interest to both local and national policymakers who plan to encourage entrepreneurship.
R10|Strategien kleiner und mittlerer Betriebe in angespannten Arbeitsmarktlagen: Eine Untersuchung am Beispiel der niedersächsischen Ernährungswirtschaft|"Im vorliegenden Bericht werden die Ergebnisse des Teilprojektes ""Lokale Strategien für die wirtschaftliche Entwicklung"" des europäischen Forschungsprojekts TRUSTEE (""Towards RUral Synergies and Trade-offs between Economic development and Ecosystem services') beschrieben. Vor dem Hintergrund der erwarteten Fachkräfteknappheit wurde am Beispiel der niedersächsischen Ernährungswirtschaft zwischen 2014 und 2016 untersucht, (1) wie sich lokale Arbeitsmärkte auf Strategien und Entwicklung der überwiegend kleinen und mittleren Betriebe des Sektors auswirken, (2) in wie fern die Betriebe Unabhängigkeit vom lokalen Arbeitsmarkt erlangen können und (3) wie die Unternehmen ihrerseits die lokalen Arbeitsmärkte beeinflussen. Die Untersuchung fand in drei Schritten statt. Im Sommer 2015 wurde eine standardisierte Befragung der Ernährungswirtschaft in Niedersachsen mit 200 antwortenden Betrieben durchgeführt, die den Hauptteil der Studie bildet. Zweitens wurden im Herbst 2015 bzw. Winter 2015/16 Workshops zum Thema Fachkräftebedarf ('Fachkräfteworkshops') in einer ländlichen und in einer eher urbanen Region Niedersachsens organisiert, dokumentiert und im Nachgang ausgewertet.

R10|Regional inequality, convergence, and its determinants – A view from outer space|This paper provides a new dataset of regional income inequalities within countries based on satellite nighttime light data. First, we empirically study the relationship between luminosity data and regional incomes for those countries for which regional income data are available. Second, we use our estimation results for an out-of-sample prediction of regional incomes based on the luminosity data. These results enable us to investigate regional income differentials in developing countries that lack official income data. Third, we calculate commonly used measures of regional inequality within countries based on predicted incomes. An investigation of changes in the dispersion of regional incomes over time reveals that approximately 67–70% of all countries experience sigma-convergence. Forth, we study different major determinants of within-country changes in inequality, i.e., the determinants of the convergence process. We find evidence for an N-shaped relationship between development and regional inequality. Resources, mobility, trade openness, aid, federalism and human capital are also very important.
R10|Immigration, regional conditions, and crime: Evidence from an allocation policy in Germany|After the collapse of the Soviet Union, more than 3 million people with German ancestors immigrated to Germany under a special law granting immediate citizenship. Despite their German ancestry, they are similar to other migrants in terms of low German-language proficiency, low education levels, and low labor market attachment. Exploiting the exogenous allocation of ethnic German immigrants by German authorities across regions upon arrival, we find that immigration significantly increases crime. The crime impact depends on regional conditions, with larger effects in regions with high preexisting crime levels, large shares of foreigners, and high population densities. We also find evidence for stronger impacts in regions with high unemployment.
R10|City seeds: Geography and the origins of the European city system|Cities are the focal points of the world economy. This paper sheds new empirical light on their origins. Using a new dataset covering over 250,000 randomly selected potential city locations, and all actual cities during the period 800–1800, we disentangle the different roles of geography in shaping today’s European city system. We find that a location’s physical geography characteristics are the dominant determinants of its urban chances. Preferential location for water- or land-based transportation is a particularly important city seed. In addition, a location’s position relative to already-existing cities matters for its urban chances. Interestingly, it does so in a way corresponding to predictions from economic geography theory.
R10|Critical links in knowledge networks. What about proximities and gatekeeper organizations?|The paper analyzes links in knowledge networks that are essential for the integration and knowledge diffusion properties of the entire network. By focusing on critical links, as defined in network science, we evaluate these linksÕ properties from the perspective of the proximity and regional gatekeeper literature. We thereby gain insights into likely conditions of their emergence and functions. Moreover, we extend the dyadic perspective on regional gatekeeper organizations and link it more strongly to the network science and proximity framework literature. An empirical study applies these arguments and investigates the proximity characteristics of critical links in 132 technology-specific subsidized knowledge networks in Germany. The results show that critical links tend be formed between regional gatekeepers that offer related knowledge resources. The links bridge institutional distances by utilizing the benefits of geographic and social proximity.
R10|Academic inventors: collaboration and proximity with industry|Abstract This paper addresses a number of fundamental research questions on university–industry (U–I) collaborations. Are U–I collaborations intrinsically different from other forms of collaboration, such as inter-firm or inter-university collaborations? Are they more difficult to form? Is their output qualitatively different? What factors facilitate their development? By looking at the collaborative behavior of all Italian inventors over the 1978–2007 period, the empirical analysis shows that U–I collaborations are less likely to happen when compared to collaborations involving exclusively university partners of business partners, and suggests that they tend to generate patents of more general applicability in subsequent inventions—measured by forward-citations. As emphasized by the literature, geographical proximity plays an important role in facilitating all forms of collaboration. At the same time, it works as a possible substitute for institutional proximity, facilitating U–I collaborations. However, the involvement of ‘star inventors’ on both sides of the collaboration can play an equally important role in ‘bridging’ universities and industry.
R10|Preferences for living in homogenous communities and cooperation: a new methodological approach combining the hedonic price model and a field experiment|The literature on the hedonic price approach applied to housing highlights the existence of nativesâ€™ preferences against living in high-dense immigrant urban areas. At the same time, empirical and experimental evidence show that ethnic fragmentation reduces cooperation at the community level. Mainly because of the difficulty to measure cooperation at the level of neighborhood, the correlation between these two phenomena is still largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose to investigate this issue by combining the hedonic price approach and a framed field experiment that allows us to collect a measure of cooperation at the neighborhood level. We show how this methodology may be implemented by carrying out a pilot study for the city of Milan. The purpose is to pave the way for further research aiming at disentangling between alternative explanations of nativesâ€™ preferences for living in homogeneous communities.
R10|An Assessment of the National Establishment Time Series (NETS) Database|The National Establishment Time Series (NETS) is a private sector source of U.S. business microdata. Researchers have used state-specific NETS extracts for many years, but relatively little is known about the accuracy and representativeness of the nationwide NETS sample. We explore the properties of NETS as compared to official U.S. data on business activity: The Census Bureau's County Business Patterns (CBP) and Nonemployer Statistics (NES) and the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW). We find that the NETS universe does not cover the entirety of the Census-based employer and nonemployer universes, but given certain restrictions NETS can be made to mimic official employer datasets with reasonable precision. The largest differences between NETS employer data and official sources are among small establishments, where imputation is prevalent in NETS. The most stringent of our proposed sample restrictions still allows scope that cover s about three quarters of U.S. private sector employment. We conclude that NETS microdata can be useful and convenient for studying static business activity in high detail.
R10|An ecosystem in the air? The instance of start-ups and the arrival of the LGV SEA in Bordeaux|"According to the economic, institutional and political agents, the arrival of the High Speed Line South Europe Atlantic LGV SEA in Bordeaux would trigger or boost a \""Bordeaux regional entrepreneurial ecosystem\"". This present paper examines this concept of ecosystem and offers to show its main characteristics, stressing the part played by start-ups, and assessing the economic and spatial logics involved. In a first part, the point is to understand to what extend the start-ups that politicians claim to be the spear-heads of those ecosystems, would constitute new stakes of operating in ecosystems. The survey enables to re-examine the concepts of ecosystem and of entrepreneurial system, to place them into prospect in the frame of regional science and of models of regional development. In a second part, we highlight the characteristic elements of this bordelais ecosystem, using what we call its fundamental DNA: the bordelais entrepreneurial ecosystem is grounded on numerous start-ups whose nature as well as personal and spatial components put into question the emergence of new forms of organization and relationships with the major companies and research laboratories."
R10|Tolerance, agglomeration, and enterprise innovation performance: a multilevel analysis of Latin American regions|In this article we examine the effect regional tolerance has on the innovation performance of firms in regions of seven Latin American countries. We hypothesize that tolerance positively influences the innovation performance of firms by attracting human talent and lowering barriers for face-to-face interaction leading to knowledge exchange within a region. This effect is magnified in regions with high agglomeration economies. The empirical analysis which relies on a multilevel design shows that regional differences in tolerance matter for product innovation.
R10|Cluster performance: an attempt to evaluate the Lithuanian case|The article takes place in the research area of the ongoing European project â€˜Cluster Development Medâ€™ (Horizon 2020) regarding the innovation and technology in the sustainable development field. Authors suggest a model, which allows to identify the most successful clusters and make comparisons between and within them. The analysis defines where they perform a positive or negative trend in the area examined. The model embraces three dimensions of cluster activity, so called, â€œResources, Activities, Processesâ€ . They have been determined on the work of the Lithuanian association â€œKnowledge Economy Forumâ€ , called â€œCluster Analysisâ€ . Data for practical evaluation purposes were obtained through two stage process. First, an interview on site with the coordinators of the Lithuanian clusters for data collection was done through a questionnaire survey, developed in collaboration with the Science and Innovation Agency of the Lithuanian Government. Secondly, the data have been aggregated by applying one of multi-criteria methods, specifically, Simple Additive Weighting method. Finally, the multi-criteria analysis results were used to estimate the efficiency of the clusters. The results were compared through suggested benchmarking. Suggested model can be used for evaluation of performance of different clusters.
R10|Absolute vs Relative Income and Life Satisfaction|This paper examines whether subjective life-satisfaction is most strongly related to absolute or relative income in terms of either proximal neighbors or a wider aggregated region. The analysis utilizes two unique datasets - survey data on happiness in combination with fine-level income data for postal codes and municipalities. We find a significant relationship between happiness and both personal income and relative income position among nearby neighbors and more remote neighbors. Hence, being rich as well as being richer than others in the area increases the likelihood of being more satisfied with life. Above all, we find individuals’ level of life-satisfaction to be more strongly related to the income of people in the larger municipality than to the income of nearby neighbors.
R10|The Political Economics of Growth, Labor Control and Coercion: Evidence from a Suffrage Reform|In this paper, we analyze how a suffrage reform in 1862/63 that shifted the de jure distribution of political power from landowners to industrialists affected Sweden’s industrialization and economic and social development from the 1860s to the 1910s. Using a newly constructed, comprehensive historical data set of the universe of approximately 2,400 Swedish local governments, we document that the change in suffrage affected a very large number of development and social outcomes at the local level, such as labor coercion, factor price manipulation in the form of entry barriers including investments in local public goods (i.e., schooling) and transportation (i.e., local railways), the real wage structure, technology adoption in both agriculture and industry, labor productivity in both agriculture and industry, changes in the composition of employment and the structure of production, demographic transition, organized labor, and persistence in dysfunctional local political institutions. Our findings are consistent with the idea that political institutions are a key determinant of long-run development and growth. Specifically, our results suggest that politically powerful landowners can block economic development using labor coercion and factor price manipulation, i.e., using entry barriers and other distortionary policies.
R10|Urban Interactions|This paper studies social-tie formation when individuals care about the geographical location of other individuals. In our model, the intensity of social interactions can be chosen at the same time as friends. We characterize the equilibrium in terms of both social interactions and social capital (the value of social interactions offered by each agent) for a general distribution of individuals in the urban geographical space. We show that greater geographical dispersion decreases the incentives to socially interact. We also show that the equilibrium frequency of interactions is lower than the effcient one. Using a unique geo-coded dataset of friendship networks among adolescents in the United States, we estimate the model and validate that agents interact less than the social first best optimum. Our policy analysis suggests that, given the same cost, subsidizing social interactions yields a higher total welfare than subsidizing transportation costs.
R10|Transformation Capacity of the Innovative Entrepreneur: On the interplay between social structure and agency|Structural change features prominently in public policy and scientific debates. While a large body of work is concerned with barriers to structural change, this paper focusses on the interplay between structure and agency by focussing on the transformation capacity of innovative entrepreneurs. Transformation capacity is defined as the ability to combine knowledge and resources across different social structures and stimulate institutional change. The paper discusses why and to what extent transformation capacity rests on three key mechanisms: multiple positions, positional mobility, and networks across social structures. The paper elaborates on potential unintended consequences and pre-conditions for transformation capacity.
R10|Knowledge externalities and firm heterogeneity: Effects on high and low growth firms|Knowledge externalities affect high and low growth firms differently. This paper develops two theoretical arguments. The knowledge equilibrium argument postulates that knowledge externalities weaken high growth firms for the benefit of low growth firms until performance differences vanish. The knowledge competition argument proposes that high growth firms are better positioned to identify, attract, and integrate knowledge, thereby expanding the performance gap between high and low growth firms. Based on 188,936 observations of 32,736 Swedish firms from 2004 to 2011, it is analysed whether knowledge externalities enable high growth firms to surge ahead or low growth firms to catch up. Las externalidades del conocimiento afectan de manera diferente a las empresas de alto y bajo crecimiento. Este artículo desarrolla dos argumentos teóricos. El argumento del equilibrio del conocimiento postula que las externalidades del conocimiento debilitan a las empresas de alto crecimiento en beneficio de las empresas de bajo crecimiento hasta que desaparecen las diferencias de rendimiento. El argumento de la competencia por el conocimiento propone que las empresas de alto crecimiento están en una mejor posición para identificar, atraer e integrar el conocimiento, ampliando así la brecha de rendimiento entre las empresas de alto y bajo crecimiento. Se emplean 188.936 observaciones de 32.736 empresas suecas entre 2004 y 2011 como la bases para analizar si las externalidades del conocimiento permiten que las empresas de alto crecimiento se adelanten o que las de bajo crecimiento se pongan a la altura. 知識の外部性は、成長率が高い企業と低い企業によって異なる影響を及ぼす。本稿では2つの議論を展開する。「知識均衡論 (knowledge equilibrium argument)」は、知識の外部性が、高成長企業と低成長企業の業績の差がなくなるまで、低成長企業に利益を与えて高成長企業を弱らせることを前提とする。「知識競争論 (knowledge competition argument)」は、高成長企業は、認知度、魅力、知識の統合において優位であり、それによって低成長企業との業績の差を拡大するという理論である。2004年~2011年のスウェーデンの32,736の企業に対する188,936件の調査を基に、知識の外部性が高成長企業の成長を更に促進するのか、または低成長企業が追い上げるのを可能にするのか否かを分析する。
R10|Unrelated knowledge combinations: Unexplored potential for regional industrial path development|The paper engages in a critical discussion of the related variety – regional branching argument and foregrounds a more differentiated perspective on regional industrial path development. It contributes by i) sharpening the definition of key concepts, namely specialisation and diversity, related and unrelated variety, ii) discussing their relevance in local and non-local spaces, iii) scrutinizing related variety as source for regional branching, and iv) developing a conceptual framework capturing the opportunity space for regional structural change that unveils the relevance of path upgrading, path importation, path branching, path diversification, and new path creation as different forms of new path development.
R10|Sketching the Contours of an Integrative Paradigm of Economic Geography|Over the last twenty years, modern economic geography has been increasingly fragmented, particularly concerning its themes, on the one hand, and its schools of thought, perspectives and paradigms, on the other. Although there have been arguments in favor of engaged pluralism between the latter, what we see in reality is mainly fragmented pluralism, which is particularly problematic for the identification with the sub-discipline and the exchange with neighboring social disciplines. In order to solve this problem, in our view, we need an Integrative Paradigm of Economic Geography. In this paper, we sketch the contours of such a paradigm, which consists of a core, namely economic activities in space, place and scales and their drivers, and three inter-related ontological foundations, namely networks, evolution and institutions.
R10|Spatial Nexus in Crime and Unemployement in Times of Crisis|Space is important. In this paper we use the global financial crisis as an exogenous shock to the German labor market to elucidate the spatial nexus between crime and unemployment. Our contribution is twofold: first, we lay down a parsimonious spatial labor market model with search frictions, criminal opportunities, and, unlike earlier analyses, productivity shocks which link criminal engagement with employment status. Second, we seek empirical support using data on the 402 German regions and years 2009 - 2010, in a setting that not only allows for crime spatial multipliers but also circumvents reverse causality by exploiting exogenous changes in unemployment due to the crisis. As predicted by our theory, the destruction of the lowest productivity matches, measured by increases in unemployment rates, has a significant impact on pure property crime (housing burglary and theft of/from motor vehicles) and street crime. The analysis offers important implications for local government policy.
R10|The Geography of Consumption|This paper examines the interaction between consumers’ willingness to travel and producers’ choices for a broad range of industries that supply final consumption and account for a large fraction of employment in the United States. Using detailed credit card data, we present evidence that consumers actively manage the spatial dimension of their purchases. Further, the data exhibit considerable variation in expenditure gravity across sectors. We develop a simple theory of how a sector characteristic, the durability/storability of the sector’s output, affects consumer and producer behavior. We present empirical evidence that durability/storability appears to influence local employment, producer density, and establishment size differentially across sectors in U.S. counties. Our results have implications for a broad range of issues, including the consequences of local shocks, the impact of place-based policies, and the geographic market definition in the assessment of horizontal mergers.
R10|The Lead-Lag Relationship among East Asian Economies: A Wavelet Analysis|Recently, the issue of market linkages (and price discovery) between stock indices and the lead-lag relationship is a topic of interest to financial economists, financial managers and analysts, especially that involves the East Asian countries. In this study, to investigate the financial market leader in East Asian countries after the US financial crisis, we employ several conventional time-series techniques and a newly introduced method – wavelet analysis - to economics and finance. Daily return data covering the period from 15th September 2008 to 1st March 2016 for five major international stock price indices in East Asia are analyzed. Our findings tend to, more or less, suggest that the Shanghai stock exchange composite index is the only exogenous variable, whereas the remaining variables are endogenous. Such finding implies that the Shanghai stock exchange composite index is the financial market leader whereas the rest of variables are follower, which includes Nikkei 225 (Japan). In order to check the robustness of our results, we also employed wavelet correlation and cross-correlation techniques. Interestingly, based on the results, the leading role of Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index is very clear at short scales; whereas, the leading role disappears at the long scales. This study shows that wavelet analysis can provide a valuable alternative to the existing conventional methodologies in identifying lead-lag (causality) relationship between financial/economic variables, since wavelets considered heterogeneous agents who making decisions over different time horizons.
R10|Creativity over Time and Space|Creativity is often highly concentrated in time and space, and across different domains. What explains the formation and decay of clusters of creativity? In this paper we match data on thousands of notable individuals born in Europe between the XIth and the XIXth century with historical data on city institutions and population. After documenting several stylized facts, we show that the formation of creative clusters is not preceded by increases in city size. Instead, the emergence of city institutions protecting economic and political freedoms facilitates the attraction and production of creative talent
R10|Building a Scientific Narrative Towards a More Resilient EU Society. Part 1: a Conceptual Framework|This report explains the main elements of a conceptual framework for resilience. The framework was developed in consultation with several Directorate Generals of the European Commission, participating in the Research Network on the Measurement of Resilience, which was jointly established by JRC and EPSC in 2016. The conceptual framework was designed to serve the policy DGs in their policy-making activities by creating a common understanding of the concept and paving the way towards a measurement and monitoring facility.
R10|Spatial-Ethnic Inequalities: The Role of Location in the Estimation of Ethnic Wage Differentials|Analyses of ethnic and racial wage differentials neglect the fact that minorities cluster in urban and in more deprived areas. This paper estimates ethnic wage differentials by comparing minorities to the majority in the same local labour market and therefore facing similar socio-economic conditions. Location is important: in the UK ethnic wage differentials and their variation across areas are partly explained by job characteristics and especially occupation. Since minorities in some areas are worse off compared to minorities in other areas, there may be scope for policy to incentivise mobility of specific groups.
R10|Cities and Entrepreneurs over Time: Like a Horse and Carriage?|Entrepreneurship, being largely an urban phenomenon, co-evolves over time with cities. While this relationship is like a 'horse and carriage', it is not a straightforward one, more akin to 'love and marriage'. In this paper I explore the co-evolution of entrepreneurship and cities. First, I provide a stylized model of development wherein the rise of cities (urbanisation) is the outcome of the activities of entrepreneurs. Second, I provide a stylized overview of entrepreneurship and cities from earlier to later stages of development. In young cities a challenge for establishing an entrepreneurial ecosystem is the provision of infrastructure for business' connectivity and energy. Good urban planning and management skills, including urban policing and dealing with land disputes, may be amongst the most sorely needed in the emerging world today. At more intermediate and later stages of development, cities can become entrepreneurial hotspots and even 'global startup cities'. Three main challenges during these stages, as far as the role of entrepreneurs are concerned, relates to (i) rising property prices and rents, urban congestion and fierce business competition, (ii) environmental sustainability and (iii) the impacts of technology that could make centralization in cities for business purposes unnecessary. Entrepreneurs have important roles to play as property developers and in the creation of new business models and new markets. They can be the drivers of 'smart' cities, 'circular' cities, and of sub-urbanisation and secondary city growth. Over time not all cities, and their entrepreneurs, will necessarily continue to grow and prosper. There is nothing inevitable in the rise of any particular city and the prosperity of its entrepreneurs. Cities do not only generate, they also degenerate. I conclude that the heterogeneity, serendipity and context-specificity of global urbanisation implies that there is much that is still unknown about the specifics of the relationship between cities and its entrepreneurs over time.

R10|Producción y exportación de vino en España: El caso de Castilla y León/Spains?s Wine Production and Exports: The Case of Castile and Leon|La industria agroalimentaria (IAA) constituye una de las principales ramas del sector manufacturero en Castilla y León y en España y una de las actividades que mejor comportamiento ha venido registrando en estos últimos años de dura crisis económica. Tales circunstancias confieren a este sector la condición de importante motor de desarrollo económico territorial. Dentro de la IAA, el subsector del vino ha experimentado un considerable dinamismo, hasta colocar a España como principal país exportador a nivel mundial. El objetivo fundamental del presente trabajo es reflejar la andadura del subsector vinícola en la región de Castilla y León, con particular referencia a su actividad exportadora. Para ello, se examinará la posición de la industria española del vino a escala mundial, su relevancia en el contexto agroalimentario nacional y su comportamiento en los últimos años. Después, se analizará el caso particular de esta rama manufacturera en Castilla y León, haciendo hincapié en sus potencialidades como vehículo de internacionalización, merced a la creciente exportación, y como elemento de desarrollo local/rural. The agrofood industry (AFI) is one of the main branches of the manufacturing sector in Castile and Leon and Spain and one of the best performing activities in recent years of severe economic crisis. In these circumstances this industry appears as an important factor for territorial economic development. Within the AFI, the wine subsector has experienced considerable dynamism, placing Spain as the main exporting country worldwide in volume. The main objective of this work is to analyze the evolution of the wine subsector in the region of Castile and Leon, with particular reference to its export activity. In order to achieve this purpose, the position of the Spanish wine industry at the global level, its relevance in the national agrofood context and its performance in recent years are examined. After that, the particular case of this manufacturing sector in Castile and Leon will be analyzed, emphasizing its potential as a vehicle for both internationalization, thanks to the increasing export, and local/rural development.
R10|The Happiness Function in Italian Cities|We investigate how the city of residence influences subjective well-being. We build up a happiness function that considers city characteristics as determinants of well-being, and we combine individual and city level data through a multi-level analysis. We exploit the dataset HADL on Italian metropolitan area over the period 2010 to 2013. We find a strong variability across cities of the aspects of life that explain subjective well-being. Even accounting for a rich set of individual level variables, the location retains a role in shaping life satisfaction. Surprisingly, economic and familiar aspects explain happiness more at city level than at individual level.
R10|Urbanization and its Effects on the Happiness Domains|We analyze the effects of urbanization on the specific components of the happiness function. We exploit the dataset HADL on Italian citizens over the period 2010-2013. A multilevel approach is used to take into account of regional heterogeneity in the happiness’s determinants. We find that, in line with much of the literature, urbanization is negatively related to subjective well-being. However, the impact of urbanization changes depending on the specific happiness spheres: while satisfaction with economic conditions is not affected by urbanization, job and family satisfaction increase with urbanization. Conversely, satisfaction with health, friendship, spare time and environment decrease with urbanization.
R10|For Whom the Bell Tolls: Road Safety Effects of Tolls on Uncongested SCUT Highways in Portugal|We present a difference-in-differences analysis of the road safety effects of introducing tolls on SCUT highways in Portugal, a policy motivated purely by financial considerations, as congestion was never an issue. Using negative binomial count models and a comprehensive dataset on all mainland municipalities covering 2008 to 2014, we find that introducing tolls led to an increase in the total numbers of accidents and of road injuries in municipalities where SCUT highways are located. Additionally, we register a change in the composition thereof, with fewer occurrences on highways (including on SCUT highways) and an increase on national and other roads. Finally, we find that most effects pertain to light injuries. No statistically significant effects were identified for fatal or serious injuries. Furthermore, as a result of introducing tolls on SCUT highways, we estimate that around 20% of the toll revenue collected is lost on the costs linked to road accidents. This questions the rationale of introducing such tolls, even on a revenue-raising standpoint.
R10|Re-imagining Community Councils in Canadian Local Government|In 2015, Toronto City Council asked city staff to review community councils as part of the Cityâ€™s ward boundary review process. Torontoâ€™s ward boundary review realigned the cityâ€™s wards, so the City now needs to set new boundaries for community councils. Staff has been directed to report back to Council in 2017 on the â€œimpacts to governance and structure changes to the authority, duties, and function of community councils.â€ Meanwhile, in November 2016, the Province of Ontario introduced measures to strengthen the use of community councils across Ontario. There is thus a unique opportunity available to re-imagine the authority and use of Torontoâ€™s community councils. In this paper, we review the function and scope of community councils in Canada, including their theoretical underpinnings and Torontoâ€™s community council structure. We make three recommendations to strengthen Torontoâ€™s community council network. First, we recommend redefining what is considered to be a â€œlocalâ€ or â€œcitywideâ€ matter, thereby allowing community councils to examine a greater range of issues. Second, we argue that the City should expand its delegation to community councils, and thereby take more issues off the agenda of City Council. Finally, we propose allowing residents to serve directly on community councils.
R10|Civic Crowdfunding: A collective option for local public goods?|This paper investigates the potential of civic crowdfunding as an innovative and collective option for contributing to the production of local public goods. It is articulated around two pillars. The first section provides a general understanding of crowdfunding practices and focuses principally on its civic component. Civic crowdfunding should be distinguished from other types of crowdfunding since it pursues an objective of general interest and mainly concerns place-based projects instigated by citizens and civil society organisations. The aim of this section is to better understand this field, from the general principles to the specific characteristics of actors and their motivations. The second section goes a step further towards the analysis of this practice with regards to the provision of local public goods. Crowdfunded local public goods usually belong to a specific category of public goods, “urban commons”, which generate significant challenges in terms of production, governance and sustainability. Building on the theory of contracts to better understand the interaction among stakeholders in this process, a new model of co-production relying on civic crowdfunding is proposed. Subnational governments would have a key role to play in enabling this practice and facilitating citizen empowerment through the mobilisation of platforms assets. Civic crowdfunding can provide opportunities for subnational governments in terms of citizens/user information, funding, communication, trust and territorial attractiveness. This paper outlines a series of key questions to guide policy makers in experimenting this practice.
R10|Subsidy Competition, Imperfect Labor Market, and Endogenous Entry of Firms|This paper constructs a model of subsidy competition for manufacturing firms under the existence of labor market imperfection. Because subsidies affect the distribution of firms, they also affect unemployment rates, the number of firms, and welfare. In our model, governments invariably give inefficiently high rates of subsidy to manufacturing firms. When the labor market friction is large, subsidy competition is beneficial, although subsidies under subsidy competition are inefficiently high. We show that the increase in the labor market friction invariably lowers welfare, while trade liberalization always improves welfare. Finally, we study the effect of the increase in labor market friction in a country. The rise of labor market friction in a country raises the equilibrium subsidy rate, raises or lowers the unemployment rate, and lowers the welfare of this country.
R10|Violent conflicts in ARMM: Probing the factors related to local political, identity, and shadow-economy hostilities|The Philippines has a long history of internecine warfare or conflicts, especially in Mindanao where the secessionist conflicts alone since the 1970s have resulted in enormous human and economic costs. That violent social discords remain varied and widespread in Mindanao underscores the need for a better understanding of their causes to guide policy. Applying regression analysis on a panel dataset for 2011-2014, we examine the factors behind the municipal- and city-level incidence of violent conflicts related to political, identity and shadow-economy issues in the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao. Indicating that geography matters, we find evidence that conflicts spill over between neighboring localities, although the type of conflicts in one locality may not be same as that in its neighbors. Having many neighbors makes a locality more susceptible to political or identity conflicts, while those lying along the coast are more prone to shadow-economy conflicts. Indicating the importance of the quality of local governance, there are fewer cases of identity conflicts in localities where the mayor was re-elected, but more cases of shadow-economy and identity conflicts where the mayor and the vice-mayor or the district representative to Congress are relatives or belong to the same political clan. Also, we find the level of local government fiscal resources to be associated with lower incidence of identity conflicts, but also with higher incidence of disputes related to the underground economy. Moreover, the incidence of identity or shadow economy conflicts is higher in cities and in highly-urbanized provincial capitals than in municipalities. Finally, we find that political conflicts are indeed more frequent in 2013 (election year), and that both identity and shadow economy conflicts have become prevalent in 2014 than in 2011. These results identify some critical areas for interventions to reduce the occurrence or spread of violent discords in ARMM.
R10|Does the abolition of border controls boost cross-border commuting? Evidence from Switzerland|In this paper we study the effects of Switzerland implementing the Schengen agreement in December 2008 on labour mobility. As vehicles are allowed to cross borders without stopping and residents in border areas are granted freedom to cross borders away from fixed checkpoints, we expect cross-border commuting to Switzerland to be higher after Switzerland joined the Schengen area. Using data from the European Labour Force Survey (ELFS), we estimate a Differencein-Differences model and find that the individual probability to crossborder commute to Switzerland has increased from a minimum of 3.2 percentage points to a maximum of 7 percentage points, according to different model specifications. Our result is particularly important due the timely and meaningful policy implications.
R10|Agglomeration patterns in a multi-regional economy without income effects|Abstract We study the long-run spatial distribution of industry using a multi-region core–periphery model with quasi-linear log utility Pflüger (Reg Sci Urban Econ 34:565–573, 2004). We show that a distribution in which industry is evenly dispersed among some of the regions, while the other regions have no industry, cannot be stable. A spatial distribution where industry is evenly distributed among all regions except one can be stable, but only if that region is significantly more industrialized than the other regions. When trade costs decrease, the type of transition from dispersion to agglomeration depends on the fraction of workers that are mobile. If this fraction is low, the transition from dispersion to agglomeration is catastrophic once dispersion becomes unstable. If it is high, there is a discontinuous jump to partial agglomeration in one region and then a smooth transition until full agglomeration. Finally, we find that mobile workers benefit from more agglomerated spatial distributions, whereas immobile workers prefer more dispersed distributions. The economy as a whole shows a tendency towards overagglomeration for intermediate levels of trade costs.
R10|The impact of agricultural activities on urbanization: evidence and implications for India| As a part of the development process, India is currently going through a transformation from agriculture based economy to industry and service lead urbanized economy. However, no formal quantitative research has been done on this phenomenon. In this perspective, based on Matsuyama’s (1992. Agricultural productivity, comparative advantage and economic growth. Journal of Economic Theory, 58(2), 317–334. doi:10.1016/0022-0531(92)90057-O) theoretical framework and using panel data model, the impact of agricultural activities on urbanization in India is analyzed in this paper. For the analysis 15 major agricultural states of India are considered for the period of 1981–2015 by sourcing data from mainly Census of India and Ministry of agriculture, government of India. The results indicates that overall agricultural activities measured by share, growth rate and total agricultural production, amount of cultivated land area, amount of rainfall and rural male employment have a negative effect on urbanization. However, some specific agricultural activities such as higher consumption of fertilizer, state government expenditure on agriculture, production of major crops (wheat, bajra and pulses), rural female employment in agriculture, and rural literacy rate have had a positive impact on urbanization. The results also show that the effect of agriculture productivity is positive on urbanization for a less trade open economy like India. Finally, it is suggested that there is need of higher agricultural development in order to achieve a higher level of urbanization in India. For this purpose use of technology in agriculture sector along with higher level rural education is required. Finally, we need to have balanced rural and urban policy for a smooth rural- urban transformation in India.
R10|Liveable city from an economic perspective|The purpose of this article is to provide an overall image of what a liveable city is. Starting from the theoretical aspects presented in the first part of this work, and ending up with the practical ones, an attempt was made to provide an answer to the following question: why are some cities more attractive than others and what criteria should be fulfilled in order for the life of a city’s inhabitants to be considered qualitative, and that city to be deemed liveable. For a city to be liveable, it is bound to fulfil several conditions, the most important ones being related to economy, environment, infrastructure (healthcare, transport, education etc.), and also to aesthetics & culture, ambient, ways of spending leisure time, safety of life, vicinity etc. Albeit there is no generally accepted concept of Liveable City, a series of methodologies recognised globally provide an assessment of this very aspect (many of them sharing the same elements). In this article, by means of the Liveability indices, cities are classified into several categories. The cities listed in one category are shown to be present in almost all the other categories, on positions that are similar. Hence, the city of Tokyo can be found in five out of six categories proposed by the international organisations which elaborated such methodologies, along with the City of London (in four out of six categories) and with New York City (in four out of six categories) etc. In Romania, the cities that might be classified as liveable are: Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, Timisoara, Brasov, Constanța and Sibiu. The Capital City of Romania, i.e. Bucharest, is ranked the 28th in a List of European Capital Cities, being outranked by Cities like Sofia, Lisbon or Budapest, which means it still does not fulfil many of the criteria for a liveable city.
R10|“Decentralization” of income per capita and its relationship to administrative decentralization in the context of European Union members|"In this research we tried to define, for the first time, the concept of ""decentralization"" of per capita income and its position among other constructions, similar to or associated with it. In this direction, we tried to give decentralization a definition as clear as possible, using existing concepts to identify it, but also to associate it with its most likely cause, administrative decentralization. Besides the theoretical documentation we, additionally, attempted to put this relationship under an econometric test, which indicates some trends but, because of the difficulties in measuring some variables, we were not able to extract absolutely reliable conclusions."
R10|Intermediate Inputs and External Economies|Is the degree of external economies (at the industry level) higher than the degree of internal increasing returns (at the firm level)? If so, what is the exact source of this difference? In the general equilibrium model in which firms producing final goods choose the degree of specialization of their technologies, external economies arise from the usage of intermediate inputs and the existence of internal increasing returns. It is frequently assumed that increasing returns are absent at the firm level while present at the industry level. In this model, the existence of increasing returns at the firm level is necessary for the existence of external economies at the industry level. We show that the degree of external economies increases with the level of linkage effects. However, a higher linkage effect does not always lead firms to choose more specialized technologies.
R10|Do Border Effects Alter Regional Development: Evidence from China|Market access/potential are main explanations for spatial variation in economic activity. Past research has recently used the quasi-natural experiment of the imposition and removal of Iron Curtain to assess how changes in market access influenced economic outcomes. Rather, we focus on key quantity effects of market access by tracking population changes induced by the creation of a subnational border. We exploit a quasi-natural experiment in China and use a difference-in-difference identification strategy to estimate the effects of introducing a new border when Sichuan province was split into Chongqing and Sichuan in 1997. We find that the new border has negative population effects on Sichuan counties located near the new border. These counties experienced a substantial decline in population growth after 1997 compared to Sichuan counties farther from the border, with the negative effects mainly confined to a band within 50-100 kilometers to the new border. Further investigation with falsification tests found that such border effects are unique to the new border region and are not related to the new Sichuan border region being more rural or to being on any provincial border.
R10|Micro-Supply Capacity Assessment and Quality of Education for the Public Sector Schools in Punjab (Pakistan)|Education is an essential input for economic development and is one of the basic human rights. Basically, education provides and contributes to the quality of human assets to achieve all development goals, such as poverty reduction, gender empowerment, improving human capital, and enhances socioeconomic benefits. However, unfortunately, education is the one of the deprived sector and its targets have not been achieved in Pakistan in the past decades. This paper contributes to understanding the micro-supply capacity assessment for the public sector schools of Punjab, using annual school census 2014 and monthly schools reports. It adopts the micro-supply capacity assessment method prepared by the World Bank consulting firm GEDESO (2014). The study shows that 45 percent schools in Punjab are deficient with respect to infrastructure and faculty. Out of 45 percent deficient schools 69 percent are primary schools. Overall, more than 50 percent students are enrolled in the deficient schools. To enroll the 3.2 million school-age children and enhance the quality of education, the government of Punjab should focus on the development of infrastructure and minimizing of lack of faculty, especially in the primary schools.
R10|Complex development alternatives in South-Muntenia region – prospective assessments|To raise the issue of the complex development of a zone where the agricultural production is the prevailing economic activity implies a certain difficulty, induced by the natural question: how can pluri-activity be generated in a predominantly mono-active rural area? Even if, at first sight, the issue could be considered relatively marginal, in reality, at least two essential “agents”: agriculture, as such, and the remaining national economy have participated to the complex development of the rural area. Agriculture, because when it reaches performance, it becomes capable to generate surplus supply compared to the local consumption needs, available for re-distribution to other deficit areas or for processing. The national economy, because it generates alternative incomes for the surplus agricultural population through various non-agricultural activities developed in the rural area. Starting from the premise that regional development, in general, and rural development, in particular, takes place almost exclusively through local initiatives, we consider that by identifying certain production intensification opportunities in crops and livestock species that have favorable conditions in the counties from South-Muntenia region, we can shape the main pillars for the complex development at regional level. From the methodological point of view, the approach is based on public statistical information, using well-known statistical methods for processing the information, of comparison or structural type, the results being mainly presented under table form. The information support necessary for the development of the present approach was based on data supplied mainly by the National Institute of Statistics, through the Tempo-Online database.
R10|Common business cycles and volatilities in US states and MSAs: The role of economic uncertainty|This paper analyses the role of a news-based measure of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) in explaining time-varying co-movements in economic activity and volatility of 48 US states and 51 largest MSAs. In this regard, we, first, estimate a dynamic factor model with time-varying loadings and stochastic volatility (DFM-TV-SV). Then, in the second step, we use a quantile-on-quantile (QQ) predictive regression model to capture the effect of EPU on the common factor and stochastic volatility derived from the DFM-TV-SV for the states and MSAs. Our results show that EPU has a significant negative effect on the common economic activity of both the states and MASs, and it also significantly increases the common volatility. However, the impact of uncertainty varies substantially depending on the initial states (quantiles) of both common output or volatility and EPU. Thus, our results tend to suggest that policy design should be state-dependent.
R10|On the Optimal Design of Place-Based Policies: A Structural Evaluation of EU Regional Transfers|We quantify general equilibrium effects of place-based policies in a multi-region framework with mobility, trade and agglomeration economies. Using detailed data on EU transfers, we infer the local effects of different transfer types on productivity, income and transportation cost. Based on these estimates and the general equilibrium model we derive the spatial distribution of economic activity and the resulting aggregate welfare effects if (i) no transfers were paid and taxes set to zero, (ii) transfers were distributed uniformly, (iii) transfers were welfare-optimally distributed. Characterizing the optimal distributions, we reveal complementarities between transfer types and between transfers and local endowments.
R10|The Effect of a Second Home Construction Ban on Real Estate Prices|In 2012, a drastic regulation prohibiting the construction of holiday and investment homes in touristic municipalities in Switzerland was surprisingly introduced. I investigate the causal effect of such a construction limitation on real estate prices. The regulation does not affect all municipalities, which provides a unique possibility to separate the municipalities into treatment and control groups. I apply the synthetic control method to estimate the causal effect of the regulation. Unlike the classic synthetic control method literature, I deal with multiple heterogeneous treatment units. This allows me to compute statistical significance precisely and construct confidence intervals. I demonstrate a salient drop in real estate prices of between - 10% and -18% three to five years after the intervention. These results are highly significant. However, no effect on prices in the first two years after the intervention is found. The decrease in prices is shown to be caused by indirect channels such as adverse effects on local economies and legal uncertainty.
R10|Out-of-town Home Buyers and City Welfare|The major cities of the world have attracted a flurry of out-of-town (OOT) home buyers. Such capital inflows affect housing affordability, the spatial distribution of residents, construction, labor income, wealth, and ultimately welfare. We develop a spatial equilibrium model of a city with substantial heterogeneity among residents. We calibrate the model to the New York and Vancouver metro areas. The observed increase in OOT purchases is associated with 1.1% (5.0%) higher house prices and a 0.1% (0.34%) welfare loss in New York (Vancouver). Taxing OOT buyers can turn welfare losses into gains when tax revenues finance a local public good.
R10|East Asian Integration: Towards an East Asian Economic Community|East Asia is a region of great global significance, currently accounting for around 30% of the global economy by most measures, e.g. production, trade, investment, and finance. It has also become increasingly integrated in various ways. Integration at the micro-level has steadily progressed since the 1960s, as indicated by rising intraregional trade. Moreover, East Asia’s economic regionalisation has become more functionally integrative, this broadly relating to the spread of transnational business and other technical systems where production, trade, and investment have become a function of each other within those systems. For example, as later explored, much of East Asia’s regionalised trade concerns cross-border movement of parts and components within the international production networks of multinational enterprises. Since the 1990s, East Asian states have in addition looked to strengthen regional cooperation and integration intergovernmentally at the macro-level, i.e. involving whole country economies. This has been driven by the need to manage their growing regional economic interdependencies and address future challenges that confront them all, such as globalisation and climate change. As we will discuss, this has been part of regional economic community-building efforts in East Asia, both across the whole region and within it at various subregional levels. We examine the key dimensions of East Asia’s integration, how they have developed over time, and what likely paths lie ahead in the endeavour to strengthen regional economic community-building.
R10|Who do you know or what do you know? Informal recruitment channels, family background and university enrolments|This paper deals with the role that an extensive use of informal networks to match workers to jobs can play in the university enrolments decisions of low socioeconomic status students in Italy.By applying estimation techniques with instrumental variables to ISTAT microdata, I found that upper-secondary students coming from lower social classes are less likely to participate in higher education when they live in provinces where the percentage of newly tertiary graduates who found a job thanks to the help of relatives, family connections or friends is higher. My results are consistent with the hypothesis that the wide diffusion of â€˜favouritismâ€™ in local labour markets engenders a sense of â€˜economic despairâ€™ among those who are poorly connected, thereby damaging individual human capital accumulation, inequality of access to higher education and local socio-economic development.
R10|International knowledge flows and the administrative barriers to mobility|Face-to-face contact, even temporary one, helps researchers form personal ties and transfer tacit knowledge. The ability of researchers to colocate, including attendance at international conferences, workshops and seminars, is affected by the administrative barriers to international mobility. This paper uses a gravity-style empirical framework to examine the link between international knowledge flows and immigration policies. The results suggest that the paper walls erected by such policies reduce not just the mobility of individuals, but also the diffusion of knowledge. A moderately restrictive mobility barrier reduces incoming and outgoing knowledge flows by about 0.8–1.3% per year. The effect of knowledge-exporting country's policy persists for nearly 10 years. There is also a short-term asymmetry: diffusion of recent knowledge is affected more by the immigration policy of a knowledge-exporter rather than a knowledge-importer.
R10|Delineating functional territories from outer space|Abstract The delimitation of functional spatial units or functional territories is an important topic in regional science and economic geography, since the empirical verification of many causal relationships is affected by the size and shape of these areas. This paper proposes a two-step method for the delimitation of functional territories and presents an application for three developing countries: Mexico, Colombia and Chile. The first step of this method uses nighttime satellite images to identify the boundaries of urban continuums (conurbations). When these continuums extend over more than one municipality, we group and redefine them as a new single spatial unit. The second step calculates a dissimilarity index using bidirectional labor-commuting flows between the resulting areas of the first step and then applies a standard clustering procedure to delineate the definitive functional territories. Our results suggest that, using nighttime satellite images, our method can lead to a more accurate definition of functional territories, especially in developing or underdeveloped countries where the official data on labor-commuting flows are often outdated or unreliable.
R10|Small and medium cities and development of Mexican rural areas|Like the rest of Latin America, Mexico is a highly-urbanized country. Yet rural populations, geographies and economic activities continue to play a significant role in national development, while there are persistent and large rural-urban inequalities in well-being and opportunities. Promoting rural-urban linkages has been proposed as a strategy to reduce spatial inequalities, but there is much academic and policy debate about whether urban development has positive (spread) or negative (backwash) effects on rural development. This could translate into synergistic or predatory urban-rural linkages. This study examines how proximity to cities, and population and per capita income in cities, affect population growth and welfare in rural places in Mexico. Using data for 2000 and 2010, our findings include: (a) 75% of rural people live within 90 min of an urban area, and 60% within 60 min; (b) proximity to a city increases rural population growth and welfare; (c) adverse (backwash) effects on rural areas due to increases in urban per capita income are very small and of no economic significance; (d) cities with populations in the 350,000–500,000 range appear to have more positive effects on rural areas than smaller or larger cities; (e) rural localities interact with multiple urban places simultaneously.
R10|Strategic entrepreneurship and knowledge spillovers: spatial and aspatial perspectives|Abstract The literature in the Strategic Entrepreneurship (SE) is increasingly embracing the concept and implications of knowledge spillovers. In this paper, we add to the theoretical repertoire on SE and knowledge spillovers by investigating the types of knowledge spillovers and what they imply for various dimensions of SE. On the one hand, we distinguish between spatial and aspatial knowledge spillovers. On the other hand, we distinguish between three dimensions of SE, i.e. inputs, resource orchestration, and output. Finally, we conceptually link the various types of knowledge spillovers and dimensions of SE and discuss the implications. Doing so, we argue that spatial knowledge spillovers (inter-firm) has received the major attention in previous research in increasing the amount of ‘inputs’ dimension of SE, while the aspatial knowledge (either inter-regional or intra-firm) has been relatively neglected not only for ‘inputs’, but also for ‘resource orchestration’ dimension. At the end, the paper provides suggestions for future research.
R10|Centro de Estudios Económicos Regionales (CEER): veinte años de investigación sobre economía regional|El Centro de Estudios Económicos Regionales (CEER) cumple veinte años dedicado a la investigación urbana y regional. En sus inicios, el Centro se enfocó en la región Caribe, pero hoy en día es un referente en estudios regionales y urbanos para todo el país. Durante este periodo, no solo se amplió el horizonte hasta abarcar todas las regiones del país, sino que también se han estudiado temas transversales al desarrollo regional en áreas tan variadas como pobreza y desigualdad, crecimiento económico y convergencia regional, finanzas públicas territoriales, educación, salud, agricultura, demografía e historia empresarial. El objetivo del presente documento es realizar un diagnóstico de las actividades académicas del CEER en sus primeros veinte años de funcionamiento. En primer lugar, se describe la conformación del grupo. Posteriormente, se discuten algunos aspectos relacionados con la producción del mismo, así como el impacto que ha tenido en la academia y en la formulación de políticas en Colombia. ******ABSTRACT: The Center for Regional Economic Studies (CEER) celebrates twenty years of work devoted to urban and regional economic research. In the beginning, the Center was concentrated on studying the Caribbean region, but today it is a reference in regional and urban studies for the whole country. During this period, not only has the horizon expanded to cover all regions, but also cross-regional issues has been studied in areas as diverse as poverty and inequality, economic growth and regional convergence, public finances, education, health, agriculture, demography, and economic history. The purpose of this document is to carry out a summary report of the CEER’s academic activities during its first twenty years of operation. Firstly, the conformation of the group is described. Subsequently, some aspects related to its production are discussed, as well as the impact it has had on the Colombian academia and the formulation of public policies in the country.
R10|Educación Escolar para la Inclusión y la Transformación Social en el Caribe Colombiano|La región Caribe tiene un rezago importante en términos de cobertura y calidad de la educación escolar. Este documento tiene por objetivo proponer una serie de políticas que permitan dar un gran impulso al sistema de educación pública de la región y cerrar la brecha para el año 2030. Se proponen cuatro grandes ejes de intervención: educación preescolar, jornada única, formación de docentes y capacidad institucional. Se estima que para llevar a cabo los programas de esta propuesta se requiere de 6.274 millones de dólares en 12 años, de los cuales 2.114 corresponden a inversiones y 4.160 a los costos recurrentes adicionales del sistema educativo. ******ABSTRACT: The Caribbean Region of Colombia is particularly behind in terms of school coverage and quality. This paper proposes a set of policies that provide a big push to the public education system and allow closing the gap by 2030. Policies are organized into four categories: Preschool education, full-day schooling, teacher training and institutional capacity. The total cost of the intervention is estimated at 6,274 million dollars over 12 years, of which 2,114 correspond to investments and 4,160 to the additional recurrent expenditures of the education system.
R10|Geografía económica de los municipios ribereños del Magdalena|Los 125 municipios de la ribera del río Magdalena concentran un total de 6.381.243 habitantes, lo cual equivale a un 13% de la población nacional. El río ha sido desde tiempo atrás un importante medio de comunicación con los municipios del interior del país. No obstante, para potencializar el intercambio de pasajeros, bienes y servicios entre estos municipios y las zonas de puerto en el Caribe, se requiere mejorar las condiciones de navegabilidad del río. En este documento se estudian las principales variables socioeconómicas de los municipios ribereños, así como los planes que existen sobre la recuperación de la navegabilidad por el Magdalena. ******ABSTRACT: The 125 municipalities on the banks of the Magdalena River have a total of 6,381,243 inhabitants, which is equivalent to 13% of the national population. The river has been for quite some time an important means of communication with the inner municipalities. However, to enhance the exchange of passengers, goods and services between these municipalities and the port areas in the Caribbean, it is necessary to improve the navigability conditions of the river. In this document we study the main socioeconomic variables of those municipalities, as well as the plans that exist on the recovery of navigability through the Magdalena River.
R10|Does Increasing Compulsory Education Decrease or Displace Adolescent Crime? New Evidence from Administrative and Victimization Data|This article estimates the contemporaneous effect of education on adolescent crime by exploiting the implementation a reform that increases the school leaving age in Italy by 1 year. We find that the Reform increases the enrollment rate of all ages but decreases the offending rate of 14-year-olds only, who are the age group explicitly targeted by the Reform. The effect mainly comes from natives males, while females and immigrants are not affected. The Reform does not induce crime displacement in times of the year or of the day when the school is not in session, but it increases violent crimes at school. By using measures of enrollment and crime, as well as data at the aggregate and individual level, this article shows that compulsory education reforms have a crime-reducing effect induced by incapacitation but may also lead to an increase of crimes in school facilities plausibly due to a higher concentration of students.
R10|Institutional Architecture for Financing Pan-Asian Infrastructure Connectivity|Asia, particularly its major economies has witnessed slower growth in recent years. To make Asia more economically sustainable and resilient against external shocks to recover from the falling growth, most regional economies need to rebalance their export-oriented (mostly to advanced economies) production and growth towards Asian markets and regional demand, and trade-driven growth through increased intraregional infrastructure connectivity and regional economic integration. In 1992, a pan-Asian transport connectivity was initiated through, Asian Highway Network and Trans-Asian Railways Network. In 2015, an ambitious pan-Asian connectivity initiative, namely “One Belt, One Road” (ancient silk road) initiative has been proposed. This initiative plans to create an economic zone covering Asia, Europe and Africa. To successfully promote and finance greater physical connectivity, at the pan-Asian, sub-regional and national levels, Asia will require a strong and appropriate institutional framework for effective coordination, cooperation and collaboration among national, subregional, and region-wide institutions as well as other stakeholders. This paper discusses the prospects and challenges facing Asian connectivity as well as infrastructure financing needs in Asia. It also examines the nature and characteristics of existing and new institutions and the emerging role of regional and international institutions for enhancing Asian connectivity. Lastly, it proposes an institutional architecture consisting of new “Asian Infrastructure Coordination Facility (AICF)” involving major stakeholders for building a seamless pan-Asian connectivity through bilateral, regional and international cooperation, partnership and collaboration in infrastructure development.
R10|Cities and the Structure of Social Interactions: Evidence from Mobile Phone Data|Social interactions are considered pivotal to urban agglomeration forces. This study employs a unique dataset on mobile phone calls to examine how social interactions differ across cities and peripheral areas. We first show that geographical distance is highly detrimental to interpersonal exchange. We then reveal that individuals residing in high-density locations do not benefit from larger social networks, but from a more efficient structure in terms of higher matching quality and lower clustering. These results are derived from two complementary approaches: Based on a link formation model, we examine how geographical distance, network overlap, and sociodemographic (dis)similarities impact the likelihood that two agents interact. We further decompose the effects from individual, location, and time specific determinants on micro-level network measures by exploiting information on mobile phone users who change their place of residence.

R10|Sostenibilidad de pequeños productores en Tlaxcala, Puebla y Oaxaca, México|La agricultura orgánica es una de las actividades agrícolas con mayor crecimiento. En México, tanto el número de productores como de hectáreas dedicadas a la misma, aumentaron en los últimos años dando oportunidad a los pequeños productores de eliminar parte de la exclusión generada por la agricultura convencional y permitiéndoles ingresar al mercado. Sin embargo, es importante conocer la situación de estos productores desde diversas ópticas, por lo que en este trabajo se llevó a cabo la medición de su sostenibilidad económica, ecológica y socio-cultural con el fin de mostrar que su inclusión en tianguis y mercados orgánicos les permite sostenibilidad. Para esto, se seleccionaron tres mercados de la Red Mexicana de Tianguis y Mercados Orgánicos en los estados de Tlaxcala, Puebla y Oaxaca. Se aplicaron 30 encuestas y, los datos se agruparon en escalas de 0 a 4 indicando menor y mayor sostenibilidad respectivamente, (valores arriba de 2, implican sostenibilidad). Estos indicadores se ponderaron según su importancia. Los resultados muestran que los pequeños productores de estos tianguis son sostenibles económica y ecológicamente puesto que los valores arrojados por los indicadores fueron 2.62 y 2.5 respectivamente, sin embargo, en el criterio socio-cultural el resultado fue de 1.77 es decir, no sostenible. Por lo tanto se requiere llevar a cabo estrategias que mejoren el valor de estos indicadores a través de la promoción y difusión de productos orgánicos y el mercado local, concientización sobre las prácticas ecológicas y sus procesos y, la participación de más actores involucrados en esta práctica agrícola.
R10|Estructura regional y polarización económico-poblacional en el centro de México|La Región Centro de México se constituyó en el espacio demográfico y económico protagónico en el país durante buena parte del siglo XX. La dinámica regional, que había estado ligada casi exclusivamente a la trayectoria y situación de la ciudad capital del país, en décadas recientes se ha nutrido del impulso experimentado por ciudades intermedias de la región y por cambios en las estructuras productivas locales a la vez que se fueron propagando algunos efectos resultantes de los programas nacionales de reforma económica. Sin embargo, en este documento pretendemos cuestionar la rotundidad del fenómeno megalopolitanoo así como el de una significativa reducción de las diferencias intrarregionales en el centro de México. En su lugar, es posible argüir que la serie de cambios en las dinámicas demográficas y económicas de los polos urbanos en la región han contribuido a fortalecer una conformación bastante polarizada al interior de la región, con lazos intrarregionales débiles y carente de una auténtica articulación regional. Esto ha mermado su posición relativa en el país.
