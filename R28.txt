R28|Should I Stay or Should I Go? Neighbors' Effects on University Enrollment|This paper investigates whether the decision to attend university depends on university enrollment of close neighbors. I create a unique dataset combining detailed geographic information and educational records from different public agencies in Chile, and exploit the quasi-random variation generated by the rules that determine eligibility for student loans. I find that close neighbors have a large and significant impact on university enrollment of younger applicants. Potential applicants are around 11 percentage points more likely to attend university if a close neighbor enrolled the year before. This effect is particularly strong in areas with low exposure to university and among individuals who are more likely to interact; the effect decreases both with geographic and social distance and is weaker for individuals who have spent less time in the neighborhood. I also show that the increase in university attendance translates into retention and university completion. These effects are mediated by an increase in applications rather than by an improvement on applicants' academic performance. This set of results suggests that policies that expand access to university generate positive spillovers on close peers of the direct beneficiaries.
R28|Determinantes de la violencia homicida en Bogotá 2002-2017|El presente trabajo tiene como objetivo evaluar los factores que explican la tasa de homicidios en la ciudad de Bogotá. Para ello, se hace una revisión bibliográfica siguiendo el criterio que Briceño establece en su artículo La Comprensión de los Homicidios en América Latina: ¿Pobreza o Institucionalidad? (2002). Este autor separa los trabajos de este tipo en dos vertientes: aquellos que hacen un mayor énfasis en las variables institucionales y aquellos que lo hacen en las socioeconómicas. En el texto se toman estas últimas para evaluar el impacto de estas variables sobre la tasa de homicidios de la ciudad de Bogotá entre los años 2002 y 2017. Este análisis se realiza mediante una regresión econométrica. Los resultados apuntan a una significancia de variables socioeconómicas tales como el índice Gini, la pobreza y el desempleo a la hora de explicar la tasa de homicidios en la ciudad. *** The objective of this paper is to evaluate the factors that explain the homicide rate in the city of Bogotá. To this end, a bibliographic review is carried out following the criteria established by Briceño in his article La comprensión de los homicidios en Amércia Latina: ¿Pobreza o institucionalidad? This author separates this type of work into two aspects: those that place greater emphasis on institutional variables and those that do so in socioeconomic variables. The text takes the latter to evaluate the impact of these variables on the homicide rate of the city of Bogotá between 2002 and 2017. This analysis is executed using econometric regression. The results point a significance of socioeconomic variables such as the Gini index, poverty and unemployment when explaining the homicide rate in the city.
R28|The Effects of Gentrification on the Well-Being and Opportunity of Original Resident Adults and Children|We use new longitudinal census microdata to provide the first causal evidence of how gentrification affects a broad set of outcomes for original resident adults and children. Gentrification modestly increases out-migration, though movers are not made observably worse off and neighborhood change is driven primarily by changes to in-migration. At the same time, many original resident adults stay and benefit from declining poverty exposure and rising house values. Children benefit from increased exposure to higher-opportunity neighborhoods, and some are more likely to attend and complete college. Our results suggest that accommodative policies, such as increasing the supply of housing in high-demand urban areas, could increase the opportunity benefits we find, reduce out-migration pressure, and promote long-term affordability
R28|Solidarities towards disadvantaged households. The case of households headed by women|Private solidarities take various forms in Madagascar. Transfers between households are among of the most common. We analyze the transfer system, taking into account the gender of the head of household. We analyze the relationship between private transfers and public transfers. We use data from the Rural Observatory of Manakara located in Southeastern Madagascar. Our results show clear differences in the payment and receipt of transfers, by gender of the head of the household. Understanding such mechanisms is therefore essential for the development of targeted public policies.
R28|Affordable Housing and City Welfare|Housing affordability has become one of the main policy challenges for the major cities of the world. Two key policy levers are zoning and rent control policies. We build a new dynamic equilibrium asset pricing model to evaluate the implications of such policies for house prices, rents, production and income, residential construction, income and wealth inequality, as well as the spatial distribution of households within the city. We calibrate the model to New York City, incorporating current zoning and rent control systems. Our model suggests large welfare gains from relaxing zoning regulations in Manhattan, and more modest gains from reducing the size of the rent control program. The former policy is progressive and a Pareto improvement, while rent control reform is regressive in nature and hurts the current beneficiaries.
R28|Does Condominium Development Lead to Gentrification?|The condominium structure, which facilitates ownership of units in multi-family buildings, was only introduced to the US during the 1960s. We ask whether the subsequent development of condominiums encouraged high-income households to move to central cities. Although we document a strong positive correlation between condominium density and resident income, this association is entirely driven by endogenous development of condos in areas otherwise attractive to high-income households. When we instrument for condo density using the passage of municipal regulations limiting condo conversions, we find little association between condo development and resident income, education or race.
R28|Assimilation of rural-urban migrants under a less restrictive internal migration policy: Evidence from Indonesia|This paper provides new evidence on how a relatively open internal migration policy can influence migrant assimilation outcomes. We revisit the findings of previous studies on international labour migration in developing countries by investigating the economic consequences of moving people from rural areas to four Indonesian cities in which international migration is relatively free. The empirical investigation uses cross-sectional and individual-level panel data techniques. The results suggest that Indonesian migrants do not experience earnings penalties following their arrival in urban areas but have persistently higher earnings than their urban non-migrant counterparts. However, the higher earnings are accompanied by a worrying decline in migrant mental health. The finding of persistently higher earnings contrasts with the results of studies in countries such as China and Vietnam, which have more restrictive policies for rural–urban migration. We argue that economic assimilation can be highly successful in developing economies if the internal migration regime is relatively open, yet it creates an adverse mental health consequence.
R28|Microfinancing and Home-purchase Restrictions: Evidence from the Online “Peer-to-Peer” Lending in China|This paper uses a quasi-natural experiment to study how houseowners’ borrowing costs were affected by the housing value fluctuation in China using a novel micro-level data from an online peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform. The impacts on other equilibrium loan variables such as borrowing duration and numbers of lenders are also examined. By taking the housing purchase restriction policy shock as an exogenous event, we employ a difference-in-differences (DD) identification strategy. It is found that the equilibrium interest rate decreased, the growth rate of the deal completion time reduced and the number of investors went up for borrowers with house properties from the cities implementing the restriction policy. It echoes from a further triple differences (DDD) when considering city-specific effect based on samples with houseowners and non-houseowners. In addition, we estimate the heterogeneous effect for both household and city-level characteristics. Our dynamic analysis indicates that effects on houseowners’ P2P borrowing activities persist for 9 months. The channel of the effect was from the collateral effect rather than the pure wealth effect.
R28|Political Tensions and Corporate Cross-border Financing: Evidence from the China-U.S. Trade War|A growing body of literature has explored the effects of political tensions on international trade and consumers’ behavior. Still, little is known whether or to what extend it matters to corporations’ cross-border financing activities. This study fills such gap in the literature by investigating the impacts of the recent China-U.S. trade war on Chinese firms’ international syndicated loans. This quasi-nature experiment facilitates the difference-in-differences (DD) identification strategy and we use Chinese corporations seeking international borrowing as the treatment group and non-Chinese counterparties as the control group. Our analysis is taken at both the aggregate level and the deal level. Preliminary results suggest significant negative aggregate consequences, including the number of loan initiations as well as their amount. Deal level estimations exhibit the similar pattern: loan spreads and maturities were adversely affected; and sizes of syndicates became bigger and the probability of secured loan occurrence was higher for Chinese corporations. To substantiate the argument that the observed gloom was caused by the trade war, we adopt the triple difference-in-differences (DDD) estimation method by exploiting U.S. borrowers as an additional level of variation.
R28|Climate change, chemical fertilisers, and sustainable development â€“ panel evidence from Tanzanian Maize farmers|We study the impact of rainfall risk on fertiliser use by Tanzanian maize farmers using newly available spatially disaggregated agronomic survey data on Tanzanian maize producers. We show that fertiliser use is highly sensitive to rainfall risks. Our discussion embeds these findings into the wider debate around environmental sustainability and mineral fertilisers, thus relating directly to the countryâ€™s government efforts of climate mainstreaming into their (agricultural) policies. We conclude that chemical fertilisers are useful for agricultural productivity growth but that they should be used to supplement more economically and environmentally sustainable practices.
R28|Regression tree analysis of soil fertility and agro-economic practices and the effects on yield in Tanzania|Food security and yield production have been extensively studied in regard to fertiliser response in the context of Sub-Saharan Africa. Soil fertility gradients within farms interact with other complex factors such as plot management, alongside bio-physical as well as socio-economic constraints, to create extensive heterogeneity in yield production. Hence, blanket recommendations regarding increasing inputs may not just lead to limited or no change in productivity but may affect long term sustainability. To try and explore the relationships between these factors, Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis was used to simplify the effect of plot management decisions. Data was from the focal plots of the 2016 and 2017 Tanzanian Agronomy Panel Survey (TAPS 2017; n = 580) with a range of yields and socio-economic contexts (2.10tha-1 â€“ 3.68tha-1). Results suggested that in low resource fields, management factors are subservient to extreme soil degradation while in high resource fields good management such as optimal planting are needed for maximum predicted yield (4.48tha-1; n = 51). Boundary line analysis was conducted, and maximum yield-nutrient response values calculated. The yield gap obtained suggested only up to 60% of locally obtainable yield is reached, highlighting the necessary balance between intensity of resource use and good management for sustainable and sufficient crop production, especially in the case of extreme soil degradation.
R28|A novel housing price misalignment indicator for Germany|From 2014 until present, housing prices in Germany have been rising faster than consumer prices in all quarters except one, raising concerns about an excessive over-heating of the housing market. To assess the vulnerability of the German housing market to a future realignment of prices or even a housing bust, this paper develops a housing price misalignment indicator that is composed of seven indicators, which are commonly associated with the fundamental value of residential property. An empirical application to the most recent data suggests that the German housing market exhibits an overvaluation of approximately 11%, where interest rate risk and a relatively advanced stage of the housing cycle are identified as the main factors fueling these imbalances, while a rather solid debt-servicing capacity mitigates these imbalances since end-2009.
R28|“What drives regional differences in BMI? Evidence from Spain”|This paper aims to contribute to the debate on the North–South health divide, by disentangling the conditioning factors that account for regional differences in BMI. Based on the Spanish data of the European Health Survey of 2014, we first decompose the average BMI gap between the North and the South of Spain into the contribution of the explained and unexplained factors, using the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition. We also carry out a distributional analysis by applying the Recentered Influence Function (RIF) Regression and the corresponding decomposition, to analyse BMI differentials along its unconditional distribution. We consider the case of Spain, which is a country characterized by important geographical disparities in BMI and other health outcomes, as well as by the decentralized structure of the Spanish National Health System (NHS). Indeed, this is the first paper that estimates and decomposes the underlying factors responsible for regional BMI variation in European countries. Our findings indicate that North to South differences in mean BMI are significant only for women and a large share (64%) of this gap is explained by differences in endowments (basically years of schooling) to the detriment of women living in the South. Moreover, the explained (unexplained) portion of the gap steadily increases (decreases) along the BMI distribution, revealing that what really matters to deal with the obesity epidemic among overweight women is focusing attention on regional disparities in endowments, human capital being the main driver.
R28|LTV Limits and Borrower Risk|This paper explores the effects of the hard loan-to-value (LTV) limit implemented in Israel in 2012, which had three different cutoffs according to the borrower type: first-time home buyer, upgrader, or investor. The paper tries to overcome identification challenges where the treatment status is not observed. I find that this macroprudential policy measure succeeded in achieving its main goal, which was to reduce borrowers' leverage. I also find that constrained borrowers bought assets farther from the center of Israel, in neighborhoods with lower socioeconomic rankings; and a much stronger response than the impact of the 2010 soft LTV limit. Investors were found to be the borrower type most affected by the LTV limit. In terms of the credit market, the effect of the LTV limit on mortgage terms is counterintuitive: the limit increased the interest rate and the term to maturity. Plausible explanations for those results are discussed.​
R28|In brief...The bedroom tax|The 'bedroom tax' - a UK government policy introduced in 2013 that cut housing benefits for social tenants deemed to have a 'spare' bedroom - saved some public money, according to research by Steve Gibbons and colleagues. But the policy added further strain to the finances of people who were already disadvantaged. Their study, which examines whether the policy achieved its objectives and how the targeted families reacted, finds that the burden of the bedroom tax fell on social tenants who were unwilling or unable to move.
R28|The Bedroom Tax|Housing subsidies for low income households are a central pillar of many welfare systems, but an expensive one. This paper investigates the consequences of an unusual policy aimed at reducing the burden of these subsidies by rationing tenants' use of space. Specifically, we study a policy introduced by the UK Government in 2013 which substantially cut housing benefits for tenants deemed to have a 'spare' bedroom - based on specific criteria related to household composition. Our study is the first to evaluate the impacts of the policy on its target group considering a range of outcomes. To do so, we use a difference-in-difference methodology that compares the observed behaviour of the treated households relative to a control group determined from the details of the policy rules. We find that - as expected - the treated group experienced losses to housing benefit and overall income. Although the policy was not successful in encouraging residential moves, it did incentivise people who moved to downsize - suggesting some success in terms of one of the policy goals, namely reducing 'under-occupancy' in the long run. We find no statistically significant effects on households' food consumption, savings or employment outcomes, despite the associated income reductions. Finally, we find some evidence of a reduction in self-reported satisfaction though this effect is not precisely estimated.

Probablemente los motiva conocer su retraso relativo que se traduce en menor bienestar y calidad de vida frente al que se disfruta en otras regiones. Ese atraso tiene que ver con niveles reducidos de productividad pero también con falta de competitividad de las unidades productoras ubicadas en el territorio. Las razones son múltiples incluyendo las carencias de infraestructura y de acceso a bienes meritorios como educación y salud. El desarrollo regional no ocurre por casualidad sino es consecuencia de la aplicación de determinadas políticas públicas.

R28|Interdependencia municipal en regiones metropolitanas: El caso de la Sabana de Bogotá|Con el avance de los procesos de descentralización en América Latina, los gobiernos municipales han recibido mayor autonomía política, administrativa y fiscal para la toma de decisiones de política pública y desarrollo local. La configuración de economías de aglomeración profundiza las interdependencias entre municipios, ya que las dinámicas socioeconómicas y ambientales sobre el territorio trascienden límites político-administrativos y las acciones de un gobierno local producen efectos sobre los municipios vecinos. Estas interdependencias producen externalidades tanto positivas como negativas que cuando no son internalizadas generan necesariamente niveles subóptimos en la provisión de bienes y servicios públicos. La cuantificación de las interdependencias que se producen entre municipios de regiones metropolitanas es determinante para formular políticas que maximicen las oportunidades que aquellas ofrecen o mitiguen las consecuencias negativas, y también es un invaluable aporte para el diseño de arreglos institucionales que gestionen dichas interrelaciones. La metodología propuesta, aplicada a la región de la Sabana de Bogotá (Colombia), dota de un instrumento para la planificación regional y la implementación de intervenciones mancomunadas de carácter estratégico que trasciendan los límites de los municipios, no solo con un enfoque sectorial integral con visión de mediano y largo plazo, sino también como un ejercicio que necesariamente considera las interacciones relevantes entre municipios.
R28|Financing Affordable and Sustainable Homeownership with Fixed-COFI Mortgages|The 30-year fixed-rate fully amortizing mortgage (or “traditional fixed-rate mortgage”) was a substantial innovation when first developed during the Great Depression. However, it has three major flaws. First, because homeowner equity accumulates slowly during the first decade, homeowners are essentially renting their homes from lenders. With this sluggish equity accumulation, many lenders require large down payments. Second, in each monthly mortgage payment, homeowners substantially compensate capital markets investors for the ability to prepay. The homeowners might have better uses for this money. Third, refinancing mortgages is often very costly. Expensive refinancing may prevent homeowners from taking advantage of falling rates.{{p}}{{p}}To resolve these three flaws, we propose a new fixed-rate mortgage, called the Fixed-Payment-COFI mortgage (or “Fixed-COFI mortgage”). This mortgage has fixed monthly payments equal to payments for traditional fixed-rate mortgages and does not require a down payment. Also, unlike traditional fixed-rate mortgages, Fixed-COFI mortgages do not bundle mortgage financing with compensation paid to capital markets investors for bearing prepayment risks; instead, this money is directed toward lower monthly payments or toward purchasing the home. The Fixed-COFI mortgage exploits the often-present prepayment-risk “wedges” between the fixed-rate mortgage rate and the estimated cost of funds index (COFI) mortgage rate. In addition, the Fixed-COFI mortgage is a highly profitable asset for many mortgage lenders.{{p}}{{p}}We discuss two variations of the Fixed-COFI mortgage. Homeowners with “affordable” Fixed-COFI mortgages are rebated the “wedges” between the traditional fixed-rate mortgage payments and the COFI mortgage payment. After the “wedges” are rebated, these homeowners may pay substantially less to purchase their homes in 30 years than homeowners with traditional fixed-rate mortgages. This mortgage design may help alleviate housing affordability pressures in many areas of the United States.{{p}}{{p}}The other variation of Fixed-COFI mortgage is the “homeownership” Fixed-COFI mortgage. With the “homeownership” Fixed-COFI mortgage, the homeowner commits to a savings program based on the difference between fixed-rate mortgage

R28|Public insurance and climate change (part one): Past trends in weather-related insurance in New Zealand|Climate change appears to be increasing the frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events, negatively affecting communities as well as posing long-term sustainability challenges to insurance (risk transfer) mechanisms. New Zealand’s public natural hazard insurer, the Earthquake Commission (EQC), covers homeowners for damage to land (and in some cases to dwellings and contents) caused by landslip, storm or flood. We comprehensively explore the EQC claims data to investigate these weather-related claims from 2000-2017. We find no clear upward trend yet emerging in the number of claims or their value. We find that the northern regions of both islands are the source of most claims, that only a handful of weather events caused a large proportion of EQC’s weather-related pay-outs, that the average property lodging a weather-related claim is located twice as close to the coast as the national average, and that properties with claims usually are cited on much steeper land than the typical property in New Zealand. We also explore their relation between claims and socio-economic characteristics, finding that higher income neighbourhoods appear to be those most benefiting from the EQC coverage for weather events.
R28|Liquidity vs. Wealth in Household Debt Obligations: Evidence from Housing Policy in the Great Recession|We use variation in mortgage modifications to disentangle the impact of reducing long-term obligations with no change in short-term payments (“wealth”), and reducing short-term payments with approximately no change in long-term obligations (“liquidity”). Using regression discontinuity and difference-in-differences research designs with administrative data measuring default and consumption, we find that principal reductions that increase housing wealth without affecting liquidity have no effect, while maturity extensions that increase only liquidity have large effects. Our results suggest that liquidity drives borrower default and consumption decisions, and that distressed debt restructurings can be redesigned with substantial gains to borrowers, lenders, and taxpayers.
R28|China's Real Estate Market|Since the 1990s, China's real estate market has experienced a dramatic and long-lasting boom across China. This boom has led to substantial concerns in both academic and policy circles that the rising housing prices might have developed into a gigantic housing bubble, which might eventually burst and damage China’s financial system and economy. Motivated by this concern, this paper reviews the historical development of China’s real estate market, describes the real estate boom, and discusses its links to households, local governments, firms and the financial system.
R28|Tax Policy and Toxic Housing Bubbles in China|This paper explores the effects of a government tax policy in a growth model with economic transition and toxic housing bubbles applied to China. Such a policy combines taxing entrepreneurs with a one-time redistribution to workers in the same period. Under the tax policy, we find that the welfare improvement for workers is non-monotonic. In particular, there exists an optimal tax at which social welfare is maximized. Moreover, we consider the welfare effects of setting the tax at its optimum. We show that the tax policy can be welfare-enhancing, compare to the case without active policies. The optimal tax may also yield a higher level of welfare than the case even without housing bubbles. Finally, we calibrate the model to China. Our quantitative results show that the optimal tax rate is about 23 percent, and social welfare is significantly improved with such a tax policy.
R28|Disentangling urban and rural food security in West Africa|Strategies to fight hunger and early warning systems often focus on identifying food crises rather than longer-term trends, and concentrate on rural areas. Data on the food and nutrition security situation of West Africa’s growing urban population is scarce and fragmented. Using geo-referenced information available in the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), this report estimates the total number and prevalence of under-nutrition and over-nutrition in West Africa for both urban and rural areas. The analysis reveals that almost 110 million people in West Africa are not receiving the correct nutrition for their needs. Over 58 million people in the region are underweight, 22 million of which live in cities. Another 52 million are either overweight or obese, the large majority of whom are adult urban dwellers. This situation reveals the severity of the “double burden” of under- and over-nutrition. It also calls for greater efforts to identify appropriate metrics to monitor food and nutrition security in urban areas.
R28|Distinguer sécurité alimentaire urbaine et rurale en Afrique de l'Ouest|Les stratégies de lutte contre la faim et les systèmes d'alerte précoce se concentrent souvent sur les zones rurales et l'identification des crises alimentaires, plutôt que sur les tendances à plus long terme. Les données sur la sécurité alimentaire et nutritionnelle des populations urbaines, en forte croissance, sont rares et parcellaires. En utilisant les informations géoréférencées des Enquêtes démographiques et de santé (EDS), cette Note estime le nombre total et la prévalence de la sous-nutrition et de la surnutrition en Afrique de l'Ouest aussi bien en milieu rural qu’urbain. L'analyse révèle que près de 110 millions de personnes en Afrique de l'Ouest n’ont pas une alimentation adéquate à leurs besoins nutritionnels. Plus de 58 millions de personnes souffrent d'insuffisance pondérale, dont 22 millions en ville. Les autres 52 millions sont en surpoids ou obèses, dont la grande majorité sont des citadins de plus de 15 ans. Ces résultats montrent la gravité du «double fardeau» de la sous-nutrition et surnutrition et appellent à renouveler les efforts en matière de développement d’outils de suivi de la sécurité alimentaire et nutritionnelle en milieu urbain.
R28|Taxing Vacant Dwellings: Can fiscal policy reduce vacancy?|We provide the first evaluation of a tax on vacant housing. This instrument has been used increasingly by governments in order to reduce vacancy in large and dense cities with tight housing markets. We use the quasi-experimental setting of the implementation of a tax on vacancy in France in 1999 to identify the causal direct effect of the tax on the vacancy rate. Exploiting an exhaustive fiscal data-set, which contains information on every dwelling in France from 1995 to 2013, we implement a Difference-in-Difference approach combined with a Propensity Score Matching strategy. Our results suggest that the tax was responsible of a 13% decrease in vacancy rates between 1997 and 2001. This impact is twice as high for municipalities with an initially high level of vacancy. Our results also suggest that most of the vacant dwellings moved to primary residences.

R28|Diversifying Electricity Customer Choice: REVing Up the New York Energy Vision for Polycentric Innovation|Electric utility business models are changing to integrate new technologies and distributed energy resources (DER). Diversifying energy mix and customer choices are both novel and useful in understanding key drivers of this transformation, including distribution system planning and customer-service options. Practical implementation of these solutions, how- ever, shows that without proper planning, energy diversiication could come at very high social and economic costs. For example, regulators have been slow in implementing policy, regulatory, and business model constructs that promote customer choice to animate high levels of grid reliability and resiliency. Equally important is how viable existing utility business models are to navigating transformation processes, including strategic resource management, revenue model, customer interface, and value propositions. This chapter discusses our use of the Hamel business model to ofer strategic analysis of Reforming the Energy Vision (REV), which is aimed at decarbonizing New York’s energy sector and increasing customer choice and control. Speciically, we build from existing literature to argue that implementing distribution management systems (DMS) in which customer choice and DERs are prominent requires a shared or ‘polycentric,’ networked business- model innovations that build on competitive and comparative advantages of existing institutions to meet the growing demand for electricity services and utility strategic goals.
R28|Over Land and Over Sea: Domestic Trade Frictions in the Philippines|This paper evaluates the effects of the introduction of Roll-On Roll-Off (RORO) Terminal System (RRTS) on agricultural trade and on provincial trade frictions within the Philippines. To do so, two datasets are created: (i) the starting dates of RORO services by route; and (ii) intra-provincial trade by product. Results suggest that provinces linked by RRTS increased trade by 35% compared with unconnected provinces. At the same time, RRTS is associated with an average reduction of province trade frictions. However, the distribution of gains among provinces is highly uneven and may have exacerbated pre-existing trade imbalances.
R28|Mi Casa Ya: Programa de Vivienda de Interés Social|El programa Mi Casa Ya es el resultado del fortalecimiento de la interacción de los sectores público y privado en el diseño de la política pública. Es común pensar que el hacedor de política debe limitar su labor al diseño de incentivos para guiar al sector privado, dejando de lado el fortalecimiento de relaciones con sectores claves en la implementación de políticas. Lo cierto es que hay pocos elementos del diseño que pueden ser objeto de controversia en cuanto a los incentivos de unos y otros, mientras que hay cientos de detalles que requieren de un trabajo conjunto, muchos de los cuales pueden contribuir al éxito o fracaso de una política. En un contexto donde el sector público espera el concurso decidido del sector privado para alcanzar las metas que se han propuesto, es determinante la coordinación de acciones entre ambos sectores. Este documento presenta el contexto bajo el que se desarrolla del Programa Mi Casa Ya, resaltando los avances en la coordinación entre el sector público y el sector privado en la implementación de políticas públicas.
R28|Distributional effects of subsidy removal and implementation of carbon taxes in Mexican households|This paper presents a microsimulation using data from the National Households Income and Expenditure Survey (NHIES) from 1994 to 2010 to determine the distributional effects of the price changes arising from energy and environmental policies and their impact on Mexican households.
R28|The Effect of Interest Rates on Home Buying : Evidence from a Discontinuity in Mortgage Insurance Premiums|We study the effect of interest rates on the housing market by taking advantage of a sudden and unexpected price change in a large government mortgage program. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insures most mortgages to lower-downpayment, lower credit score borrowers, including a majority of first-time homebuyers. The FHA charges borrowers an annual mortgage insurance premium (MIP), and in January, 2015 the FHA abruptly reduced the MIP, and thus FHA borrowers’ effective interest rate, by 50 basis points. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that the MIP reduction increased the number of home purchase originations among the FHA-reliant population by nearly 14 percent. The response to the premium cut was negatively correlated with borrower income, with no observable response among relatively high income borrowers. We trace part of the jump in home buying to the MIP reduction helping ease binding debt payment-to-income ratio limits thus allowing more applications to be approved. Finally, we find no evidence that the MIP reduction increased house prices.
R28|Forced off Farm? Labor Allocation Response to Land Requisition in Rural China|Land requisition has been an important process by which Chinese local governments promote urbanization and generate revenue. This study investigates the impacts of land requisition on farmers' decisions of labor allocation between agricultural and non-agricultural sectors. We argue that, conditional on village fixed effects, land requisition can be explored as a quasi-natural experiment to identify the relationship between land rights and labor allocation of farmers. We find that young farmers (age 16-44) are not affected in their migration decisions by land loss through requisition, while some older farmers (age 45-55) are affected. In response to land loss through requisition, the probability that older farmers living beyond the mean distance from the county seat migrates to cities increases by 8.5 percentage points. An econometric test confirms that the finding is unlikely to be driven by unobserved variables associated with household experience of land loss. This finding raises concerns about the wellbeing of the farmers who may not be competitive in the urban labor market and therefore unlikely to leave farming unless they have to.
R28|The impact of social pensions on intergenerational relationships: Comparative evidence from China|China launched a new rural pension scheme (hereafter NRPS) for rural residents in 2009, now covering almost all counties with over 400million people enrolled. This implementation of the largest social pension program in the world offers a unique setting for studying the economics of intergenerational relationships during development, given the rapidity of China’s population aging, traditions of filial piety and co-residence, decreasing number of children, and dearth of formal social security, at a relatively low income level. We draw on rich household surveys from two provinces at distinct development stages – impoverished Guizhou and relatively well-off Shandong – to better understand heterogeneity in the impact of pension benefits. Employing a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, we find that around the pension eligibility age cut-off, the NRPS significantly reduces intergenerational co-residence, especially between elderly parents and their adults sons; promotes pensioners’ healthcare service consumption; and weakens (but does not supplant) non-pecuniary and pecuniary transfers across three generations. These effects are much larger in less developed Guizhou province.
R28|Quel Systeme Incitatif Realiste Pour La Politique De Reduction Des Dechets Menagers ? Enseignements Tires De La Litterature Economique Et Du Cas Français / What Workable Incentive Scheme For The Reducing Kerbside Waste Policy? Lessons Drawn From The Economic Literature And French Cities Experience|Reducing the volume of kerbside waste has become a vital goal for many cities in the world. Since the pricing of communal waste services is often inefficient, economic literature promotes an incentive scheme, which most frequently consist in a unit pricing, “pay as you throw” system. Based on empirical studies, advanced economic works and the French experience, the paper explains why this approach is fairly limited. Unit pricing faces practical difficulties and does not fit to collective housing. Whether households’ motivation is utilitarian or value oriented, the analysis of their behaviour shows that, a too large extension of the inducement part of the price, might bring about significant inconveniences. Finally, a small incentive part is to be favoured. It may seem unsatisfactory and contradictory to the very principle of incentive pricing, but the paper underlines it is not so. Nevertheless, an incentive scheme for households must also use other inducing mechanisms. The deposit refund system is the prominent one; it basically aims at the same goals as unit pricing, but avoids its troubles. NOTICE: the paper is in French
R28|Traffic and crime|We study the link between crime and extreme traffic congestion to estimate the psychological costs of traffic. Our empirical analysis combines police incident reports with observations of local traffic data in Los Angeles from 2011 to 2015. This rich dataset allows us to link traffic with criminal activity at a fine spatial and temporal dimension. Our identification relies on deviations from normal traffic to isolate the impact of abnormally high traffic on crime. We find that extreme traffic increases the incidence of domestic violence, a crime shown to be affected by emotional cues, but not other crimes. The result is robust to a variety of specifications and falsification tests. The results represent a lower bound of the psychological costs of traffic congestion, since most drivers stuck in traffic do not commit domestic violence but still bear some emotional costs.
R28|Housing, the ‘Great Income Tax Experiment’, and the intergenerational consequences of the lease|This paper provides an analysis of how the New Zealand tax system may be affecting residential property markets. Like most OECD countries, New Zealand does not tax the imputed rent or capital gains from owner-occupied housing. Unlike most OECD countries, since 1989 New Zealand has taxed income placed in retirement savings funds on an income basis, rather than an expenditure basis. The result is likely to be the most distortionary tax policy towards housing in the OECD. Since 1989, these tax distortions have provided incentives that should have lead to significant increases in house prices and the average size of new dwellings, should have reduced owner-occupier rates, and should have led to a worsening of the overseas net asset position. The tax settings are likely to be regressive, and are not intergenerationally neutral, as they impose significant costs on current and future generations of young New Zealanders (and new migrants). Since it does not appear to be politically palatable to tax capital gains or imputed rent, to reduce the distortionary consequences of the tax system on housing markets New Zealand may wish to reconsider how it taxes retirement savings accounts by adopting the standard OECD approach.
R28|Gentrification and the Amenity Value of Crime Reductions: Evidence from Rent Deregulation|Gentrification involves large-scale neighborhood change whereby new residents and improved amenities increase property values. In this paper, we study whether and how much public safety improvements are capitalized by the housing market after an exogenous shock to the gentrification process. We use variation induced by the sudden end of rent control in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1995 to examine within-Cambridge variation in reported crime across neighborhoods with different rent-control levels, abstracting from the prevailing city-wide decline in criminal activity. Using detailed location-specific incident-level criminal activity data assembled from Cambridge Police Department archives for the years 1992 through 2005, we find robust evidence that rent decontrol caused overall crime to fall by 16 percent—approximately 1,200 reported crimes annually—with the majority of the effect accruing through reduced property crime. By applying external estimates of criminal victimization’s economic costs, we calculate that the crime reduction due to rent deregulation generated approximately $10 million (in 2008 dollars) of annual direct benefit to potential victims. Capitalizing this benefit into property values, this crime reduction accounts for 15 percent of the contemporaneous growth in the Cambridge residential property values that is attributable to rent decontrol. Our findings establish that reductions in crime are an important part of gentrification and generate substantial economic value. They also show that standard cost-of-crime estimates are within the bounds imposed by the aggregate price appreciation due to rent decontrol.
R28|Educational Choice, Rural-urban Migration and Economic Development|Observing rapid structural transformation accompanied by a continual process of rural to urban migration in many developing countries, we construct a micro founded dynamic framework to explore how important education-based migration is, as opposed to work-based migration, for economic development, urbanization and city workforce composition. We then calibrate our model to fit the data from China over the period from 1980 to 2007, a developing economy featuring not only large migration flows but major institutional reforms that may affect work and education based migration differently. We find that, although education-based migration only amounts to one-fifth of that of work-based migration, its contribution to the enhancement of per capita output is larger than that of work-based migration. Moreover, the abolishment of the government job assignment for college graduates and the relaxation of the work-based migration have limited effects on economic development and urbanization. Furthermore, the increase in college admission selectivity for rural students plays a crucial but negative role in China's development, lowering per capita output and worsening the high-skilled employment share in urban areas.
R28|Housing Policy of the Administrative-Territorial Units in Northeastern Bulgaria 2010-2014|The article examines the status and the change of the parameters characterizing the housing policy in the Northeastern region of the Republic of Bulgaria. Surveyed are the various counties in the Northeastern Region of Bulgaria - Varna, Dobrich, Targovishte and Shumen. Subject of analysis are the strategic goals, the operational aspects and the indicators characterizing the housing policy in these counties. Analyzed and outlined are the impact of specific factors on housing policy and the vision and strategic objectives thereof in this region of the country. The conclusions may be summarized as follows: the strategic objectives are aimed at improving the condition of existing housing and the provision new affordable housing for the population. Housing affordability for the population is improved as a result of reduced price levels and increased incomes. The residential standard, the housing concentration and the average housing area are growing as a result of a slowdown in housing numbers relative to the population and the growth rate of the housing area. These changes are the result of the demographic, economic and social changes in this part of the country.
R28|Do government transfers reduce poverty in China? Micro evidence from five regions|This paper estimates urban and rural poverty rates across five Chinese province-level administrative regions (Shanghai, Liaoning, Guangdong, Henan and Gansu) using representative household survey data from the China Family Panel Studies survey. The types of government transfer payments that households in poverty received and the ability for such payments to lift them from poverty are also assessed. Consistent with published estimates from China's National Bureau of Statistics, the results highlight substantial disparities in poverty rates between provinces in 2014. Nevertheless, for each province, the poverty rates estimated from the survey data were notably higher than the official figures. Although the problem of rural poverty continues to be a significant focus of Chinese policymakers, the results suggest that the poverty rate was higher in urban than in rural areas in most provinces. This partly owed to the higher cost of living in urban China, which is captured in the poverty lines defined for this analysis. In 2014, the most common types of government transfer received by households in poverty were agricultural subsidies or social assistance - principally the dibao. Regarding the latter, the results suggest some improvement in payment targeting in rural areas between 2012 and 2014, but the majority of dibao recipients in most provinces still had income above the defined poverty line in 2014. Furthermore, across all provinces, the vast majority of households living below the defined poverty line did not receive social assistance at that time.
R28|The Differences Between Women Executives In Japan And Romania|FAround the world employment of women on an equal bases allows companies, industries and countries to make better use of the available talent pool, generally with potential growth implication. In Japan, since 2013, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been a ceaseless advocate for the increase in the number of female employees for the revival of the economy, and many governmental programs in support of working women have been put in place. However, the traditional Japanese management systems of lifetime employment, enterprise unions, seniority systems, together with a group-oriented and risk-adverse orientation make things change slowly. In Romania, the second country analyzed in this article, women entrepreneurs also face professional stereotypes, difficulties in getting specific jobs, traditional prejudices and a collective mentality related to women’s place in society. This article explores and compares how Romanian and Japanese cultures, societies, and economies have either encouraged, or discouraged, the growth of female entrepreneurship on their own territories, and analyzes how the best emerging female executives can be supported in the future in order to maximize their potential. The analysis is based on the data provided by OECD, the World Bank, the Global entrepreneurship monitor, Japan statistics, the legislations of the two countries and the literature related to the two social environments. The findings indicate that although there are many similarities between the two countries, the percentage of female executives in Japan is much smaller than the one in Romania. This is due to the fact that Japan, with all the governmental programs in action, for the moment, still has a stricter social and work environment, a weaker maternity and childcare legislation and a higher gender gap.
R28|Liveable city from an economic perspective|The purpose of this article is to provide an overall image of what a liveable city is. Starting from the theoretical aspects presented in the first part of this work, and ending up with the practical ones, an attempt was made to provide an answer to the following question: why are some cities more attractive than others and what criteria should be fulfilled in order for the life of a city’s inhabitants to be considered qualitative, and that city to be deemed liveable. For a city to be liveable, it is bound to fulfil several conditions, the most important ones being related to economy, environment, infrastructure (healthcare, transport, education etc.), and also to aesthetics & culture, ambient, ways of spending leisure time, safety of life, vicinity etc. Albeit there is no generally accepted concept of Liveable City, a series of methodologies recognised globally provide an assessment of this very aspect (many of them sharing the same elements). In this article, by means of the Liveability indices, cities are classified into several categories. The cities listed in one category are shown to be present in almost all the other categories, on positions that are similar. Hence, the city of Tokyo can be found in five out of six categories proposed by the international organisations which elaborated such methodologies, along with the City of London (in four out of six categories) and with New York City (in four out of six categories) etc. In Romania, the cities that might be classified as liveable are: Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, Timisoara, Brasov, Constanța and Sibiu. The Capital City of Romania, i.e. Bucharest, is ranked the 28th in a List of European Capital Cities, being outranked by Cities like Sofia, Lisbon or Budapest, which means it still does not fulfil many of the criteria for a liveable city.
R28|Did minimum wage increases reduce employment? Panel data evidence from Romania|Rising minimum wages is a popular policy used to increase the income of low wage workers, reduce inequalities and improve labour market participation. However, there are concerns among policy makers about its possible negative effects on employment. This paper examines the effect of minimum wage increases on regional employment, using a panel of 42 NUTS III regions from Romania over a recent period, 2008-2014, which includes the economic crisis and the recovery. The results show that, on average, increases in minimum wages had an insignificant effect on employment during the period studied. The results are robust to different specifications. They also highlight the importance of a strong manufacturing base for raising regional employment.
R28|Energy efficiency as an instrument of regional development policy? Trading-off the benefits of an economic stimulus and energy rebound effects|Previous studies show that improving efficiency in household energy use can stimulate a national economy through an increase and change in the pattern of the aggregate demand. However, this may impact competitiveness. Here we find that in an open region, interregional migration of workers may give additional momentum to the economic expansion, by relieving pressure on the real wage and the CPI. Furthermore, the stimulus will be further enhanced by the greater fiscal autonomy that Scotland is set shortly to enjoy. By considering a range of CGE simulation scenarios we show that there is a tension between the economic stimulus from energy efficiency and the scale of rebound effects. However, we also show that household energy efficiency increases do typically generate a â€œdouble dividendâ€ of increased regional economic activity and a reduction in carbon emissions.
R28|The clash of rural-urban migrants and real estate investors on Phnom Penh's housing market: Prospects for garment workers|Housing markets of large cities around the world, particularly in so-called developing and emerging countries, are currently experiencing a clash: On the one hand, large numbers of labour migrants arrive from rural areas and need cheap rental housing. On the other hand, international real estate investment, particularly in the upper market segment, is strong. The resulting mismatch of housing demand and supply increases segregation, marginalises the vulnerable and leads to massive urban development problems. Phnom Penh illustrates this particularly well: Along with Cambodia's rapid globalisation in the last decades, hundreds of thousands of migrants, particularly garment workers, have moved to the capital. Housing for them is insufficient both in terms of supply and quality, though, because Phnom Penh's entrepreneurial mode of governance also attracts many investors, who focus on more profitable and prestigious real estate projects, often linked to speculation. These push land values up and push cheap rental housing further and further outside the city. This study carries out an indepth analysis of the prospects for rural-urban migrant workers on Phnom Penh's investor-driven housing market by firstly outlining both migration and real estate investment trends and by secondly examining the case of garment workers' housing. To complement the scarce literature on the topic, field research and expert interviews have been conducted. From these, an assessment of the status quo, of stakeholders' approaches to it and finally, proposals for action are derived.
R28|Ex-post Livestock Diseases, and Pastoralists' Averting Decisions in Tanzania| Little is known about the factors affecting pastoralists’ livestock vaccination decisions. In this paper, we use a novel survey-based dataset on pastoralists living in the Ruaha landscape in Tanzania, and employ several econometric approaches to identify the factors affecting pastoralists’ decision-making process about vaccination when disease occurrence and severity, vaccination and healthcare access costs and other related variables are known. Results from binary choice models that account for excess zeros indicate that socially and economically active households are more likely to vaccinate their livestock. The results also identify positive marginal effects of having wage earners and illness incidence on vaccination decisions. The results from mixture models also find that these same variables significantly lower the pastoralist’s probability to vaccinate no livestock. Most notably, vaccination cost significantly lowers the probability that pastoralists vaccinate any livestock, as well as the number of vaccinated livestock. These findings have important policy implications considering livestock health education, veterinary service infrastructure, and supply-side management.
R28|Politique de la ville : le zonage comme outil d’identification de la fracture sociale|The recent reform of the geography of the urban policy, established by the ?Loi de programmation pour la ville et la coh?sion urbaine,? aims for better identifying the most deprived areas by putting in place a simpler and more objective zoning based on the concentration of low-income households.?It actually saves consistency and results in a more homogeneous priority card because the single criterion of income managing captures relatively well the other socioeconomic characteristics of neighborhoods.?But, due to the existence of too great territorial differences, this new zoning can?t be the only tool to solve the French ?social divide.??The new priority geography continues thus to target areas with important economic development gaps.?Similarly, the degrees of remoteness of neighborhoods in cities, although made more homogeneous, remain various.?Therefore, given the significant differences that persist between areas, the establishment of criteria for prioritization and finer differentiation seems essential in order to improve the effectiveness of public action.

R28|The Assignment and Division of the Tax Base in a System of Hierarchical Governments|"The existence of either ""horizontal"" fiscal externalities, in which changes in one jurisdiction's policies affect the government budget of other jurisdictions and therefore the utility of its residents or ""vertical"" externalities, in which changes in one level of government's policies affect the budget of another level of government, may lead to non-optimal government policies. These fiscal externalities, then, suggest the possibility of corrective policies. The focus here is on vertical externalities. In a growing literature, these externalities are associated with the extent that tax bases are shared or ""co-occupied"" by two different levels of government. Given that co-occupancy is the cause of or at least exacerbates the externality, I consider, the optimal ""assignment"" of the tax base and, more specifically, whether the co-occupancy of tax bases is desirable. Specifically, I examine the optimal extent of the tax base of a lower level of government (local) and a higher level (state) in a hierarchical system of governments. The co-occupancy of the tax base influences the magnitude and possible the direction of ""vertical"" fiscal externalities associated with the taxes of one or both of the levels of government. Using a model in which there is a continuum of commodities, each with the same demand characteristics, I formally consider whether, as has been asserted in a number of studies, whether it is optimal to eliminate all co-occupancy between the tax bases of the two levels of government. While I find that it is indeed not optimal to have co-occupancy in the tax base in the absence of other corrective policies for the fiscal externality, eliminating co-occupancy does not, in general, eliminate fiscal externalities, meaning that tax rates can still be above or now below the socially-optimal level. Thus elimination of co-occupancy in the tax base is not a substitute for a policy such as intergovernmental matching grants which directly eliminates fiscal externalities. If alternative policies are available such as matching grants that do eliminate fiscal externalities and governments are restricted to set the same tax rate on all commodities in their base, the optimal division of the tax base changes dramatically -- optimality requires both governments tax the entire base.

R28|“Modelling and forecasting mortgage delinquency and foreclosure in the UK.”|In the absence of micro-data in the public domain, new aggregate models for the UK's mortgage repossessions and arrears are estimated using quarterly data over 1983–2014, motivated by a conceptual double trigger frame framework for foreclosures and payment delinquencies. An innovation to improve on the flawed but widespread use of loan-to-value measures, is to estimate difficult-to-observe variations in loan quality and access to refinancing, and shifts in lenders’ forbearance policy, by common latent variables in a system of equations for arrears and repossessions. We introduce, for the first time in the literature, a theory-justified estimate of the proportion of mortgages in negative equity as a key driver of aggregate repossessions and arrears. This is based on an average debt–equity ratio, corrected for regional deviations, and uses a functional form for the distribution of the debt–equity ratio checked on Irish micro-data from the Bank of Ireland, and Bank of England snapshots of negative equity. We systematically address serious measurement bias in the ‘months-in-arrears’ measures, neglected in previous UK studies. Highly significant effects on aggregate rates of repossessions and arrears are found for the aggregate debt–service ratio, the proportion of mortgages in negative equity and the unemployment rate. Economic forecast scenarios to 2020 highlight risks faced by the UK and its mortgage lenders, illustrating the usefulness of the approach for bank stress-testing. For macroeconomics, our model traces an important part of the financial accelerator: the feedback from the housing market to bad loans and hence banks’ ability to extend credit.
R28|The Home Front: Rent Control and the Rapid Wartime Increase in Home Ownership|The US home ownership rate rose by 10 percentage points between 1940 and 1945, about half the size of the net change over the 20th century, despite severe restrictions on construction during World War II. I present evidence that wartime rent control which covered over 80 percent of the 1940 U.S. rental housing stock played an important role in this shift, as suggested by Friedman and Stigler (1946). The empirical test exploits features of the central authority's method of imposing rent control, which generated variation in the size of rent reductions for cities that had seen similar increases in rents prior to control. Greater rent reductions were associated with greater increases in home ownership over the rst half of the 1940's. This relationship does not appear to be driven by di erential trends in housing demand or other unobserved factors potentially correlated with variation in rent reductions. The estimates suggest that rent control may explain 65 percent of the urban increase in home ownership over the rst half of the 1940's.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
R28|The Berlin Labor Market since 2005: Strong Employment Growth yet Unemployment Remains High, Incomes Low|Over the past ten years, the number of employed in Berlin has increased more dynamically than it has anywhere else in the country, resulting in a decrease in unemployment. But because the city’s potential labor force has also experienced considerable growth, Berlin’s unemployment rate remains well above the national average. Since jobs requiring intermediate qualifications have become more prevalent, this high unemployment rate is being influenced more and more by the increasing numbers of Hartz-IV recipients and lowskilled workers as well as academics. Berlin’s strong employment growth has been facilitated by the fact that the productivity gains are low, even in a nationwide comparison. This is also likely one of the reasons that Berlin is still behind when it comes to wages. The weak productivity development also indicates an insufficient innovation capacity that is preventing Berlin from achieving the economic power and income levels that would befit a national capital. Now and in the future, such a transformation requires a well-qualified workforce—which is why policymakers’ highest and most urgent priorities should include combating the glaring lack of apprenticeships as well as improving the quality of local schools and vocational training.

In Berlin ist die Zahl der Erwerbstätigen in den letzten zehn Jahren noch stärker als in Gesamtdeutschland gewachsen. Allerdings konnte die Arbeitslosigkeit nicht überdurchschnittlich abgebaut werden, da gleichzeitig das Arbeitskräftepotential in der Stadt erheblich zugenommen hat. An Bedeutung gewonnen haben Tätigkeiten, für die eine mittlere Qualifikation benötigt wird. Die zwar kräftig gesunkene, aber immer noch weit über dem Bundesdurchschnitt liegende Arbeitslosigkeit verschiebt sich damit mehr und mehr zu den Hartz-IV-Empfängern und zu den Geringqualifizierten sowie hin zu den Akademikern. Der starke Beschäftigungsaufbau wurde dadurch begünstigt, dass die Produktivitätssteigerungen auch im Vergleich zum gesamten Bundesgebiet gering waren. Dies dürfte auch eine der Ursachen dafür sein, dass Berlin bei den Löhnen weiterhin zurückliegt. Die schwache Produktivitätsentwicklung verweist überdies auf eine unzureichende Innovationsfähigkeit, die verhindert, dass Berlin hinsichtlich Wirtschaftskraft und Erwerbseinkommen einen Platz einnimmt, der einer Hauptstadt angemessen wäre. Dazu bedarf es auch in Zukunft eines gut qualifizierten Arbeitskräftepotentials, woraus sich die drängendsten Aufgaben für die Politik ableiten: die Bekämpfung des eklatanten Lehrstellenmangels sowie die Verbesserung der Leistungsfähigkeit der Schulen und der Berufsorientierung.

R28|Qualified residential mortgages and default risk|The Dodd–Frank Act tasks regulators with defining a Qualified Residential Mortgage (QRM) as an exemption from risk retention for residential mortgage-backed securities. Congress instructs regulators to consider factors that result in lower levels of historic default in defining a QRM. We analyze non-agency loans and find credit scores and loan-to-value ratios are among the most significant predictors of default, even when controlling for risky loan products and loose underwriting standards. Importantly, credit scores and loan-to-value ratios better tradeoff the benefit of reduced default risk with the cost of limiting access to capital than most factors, yet are absent from the final QRM definition. Our results have important implications for current and future policy on residential mortgage securitization, risk retention, and disclosure.
R28|Metropolitan area home prices and the mortgage interest deduction: Estimates and simulations from policy change|We simulate changes to metropolitan area home prices from reforming the Mortgage Interest Deduction (MID). Price simulations are based on an extended user cost model that incorporates two dimensions of behavioral change in home buyers: sensitivity of borrowing and the propensity to use tax deductions. We simulate prices with both inelastic and elastic supply. Our results show a wide range of price effects across metropolitan areas and prospective policies. Considering behavioral change and no supply elasticity, eliminating the MID results in average home price declines as steep as 13.5% in Washington, D.C., and as small as 3.5% in Miami-Fort Lauderdale, FL. Converting the MID to a 15% refundable credit reduces prices by as much as 1.4% in San Jose, CA, San Francisco, CA, and Washington, D.C. and increases average price in other metropolitan areas by as much as 12.1% (Miami-Fort Lauderdale). Accounting for market elasticities produces price estimates that are on average 36% as large as standard estimates.
R28|Dimensioni e crescita delle città in Europa: l’incertezza danneggia soprattutto le città medie|In Europa le città medio-piccole sono molto più numerose che negli Stati Uniti e in altri grandi paesi. Queste realtà meritano quindi attenzione, anche se essa è stata negli ultimi anni monopolizzata dalle città grandi che sono cresciute di più. Dal 2000 al 2012 sono soprattutto le città medie (tra 80 e 500 mila abitanti) e non tanto le piccole che sono cresciute di meno. Questo è il risultato che emerge in un campione di 352 città europee. L’interpretazione qui presentata caratterizza le città medie come le più soggette a subire effetti negativi a causa dell’accresciuta incertezza. L’indicazione che ne consegue consiglierebbe di sostenere specialmente in queste realtà urbane la differenza tra rendimenti netti delle attività innovative rischiose rispetto alle tradizionali sicure attraverso buoni servizi di pubblica utilità particolarmente necessari agli agenti dell’innovazione.
R28|Do Mortgage Subsidies Help or Hurt Borrowers?|Mortgage subsidies affect homeownership costs by reducing effective mortgage rates and increasing house prices. I show analytically the role of mortgage subsidies in determining house price changes, economic incidence, and efficiency costs using a theoretical framework for applied welfare analysis. I derive simple expressions for these effects, as functions of reduced-form sufficient statistics, which I use to measure the effects from eliminating mortgage deductions. My main results characterize the distributional impact of mortgage subsidies among buyers and owners and how house price responses attenuate efficiency losses. My results provide broader methodological insights into the welfare analysis of credit policies.

Motivated the economic effects generated by the relaxation of the policy were unclear, we have employed both the industry-related spillover model to examine the economic scale and the number of persons employed created, and to investigate the extent of the effect. Our findings were that the economic spillover effects were brief and transient. Nonetheless, it could overcome Taiwanâ€™s economic challenges. Only through the sustainable management of the tourism-related industry could long-term economic effects be created
R28|Pollution or crime: The effect of driving restrictions on criminal activity|Driving restriction programs have been implemented in many cities around the world to alleviate pollution and congestion problems. Enforcement of such programs is costly and can potentially displace policing resources used for crime prevention and crime detection. Hence, driving restrictions may increase crime. To test this hypothesis, we exploit both temporal and spatial variation in the implementation of Quito, Ecuador's Pico y Placa program, and evaluate its effect on crime. Both difference-in-differences and spatial regression discontinuity estimates provide credible evidence that driving restrictions have increased crime rates.
