J39|Differences in Skill Levels of Educated Workers Between the Public and private Sectors, the Return to Skills and the Connection between them: Evidence from the PIAAC Surveys|This study relates to a series of countries, and examines how the private sector differs from the public sector in the distribution of cognitive skills that characterize educated workers, and what variables are correlated with these differences. We find that in almost all countries, the return on skills is higher in the private sector, but there is a high level of variance between countries. The gap in returns in Israel is similar to the average of the other countries among men, and relatively high among women. The wider the gap is, the higher the skills of workers in the private sector are relative to the skills of those employed in the public sector. It was also found that the higher the country’s per capita GDP is, the higher the skills of educated men in the public sector are relative to the skills of educated men in the private sector.​
J39|Does Happiness Pay Revisited – New Evidence from the U.S.A|In this paper, we revisit our 2004 paper that found a strong positive association between happiness and future outcomes, based on data for Russia in the years 1995-2000. This paper takes advantage of a new Gallup panel for the U.S. for 2014-2016. We essentially duplicate our original method, and add some new specifications. We find remarkably similar patterns and associations between initial period happiness and later period outcomes in the U.S., based on a very different time and sample from Russia in the 1990’s. We believe that duplicating the earlier findings in a very different time and place is an important test of how robust this association is. We also find some new twists in the initial patterns that are interesting in their own right. The aim here is not only to show that the causality does not just run from the usual variables to higher or lower levels of well-being, but that the traits that subjective well-being metrics capture, such as happiness and hope, have their own independent role in the outcomes of the lives of myriad individuals around the world.
J39|The State of the Economy at Graduation, Wages, and Catch-up Paths: Evidence from Switzerland|This paper analyses whether the short- and mid-term labour market outcomes of Swiss university graduates are affected by the state of the domestic economy at the time of labour market entry, where the economic conditions are captured by the regional unemployment rate at the time of graduation. This analysis contributes to the question as to whether labour market outcomes are determined inter alia by luck even under fairly stable labour market conditions. The study provides empirical evidence demonstrating that less favourable economic conditions at the time of labour market entry have a negative impact on the individuals' wages one year after graduation. However, there appears to be a partial catchup towards luckier cohorts in the subsequent four years, which is primarily explained by higher job mobility with respect to the number of jobs an individual has held since his graduation as well as tenure with the first job. Finally, there is strong evidence in favour of heterogeneous effects with respect to, for instance, individuals employed in part-time, for whom the negative effects appear to be most pronounced, while at the same time it is found that the probability of part-time employment rises under less favourable entry conditions.
J39|Earnings inequality in Germany: A decomposition-analysis|Several studies have shown that income inequality has risen in Germany until 2005. Less focus was put on the rise of earnings inequality which continued to rise until 2010. We distinguish different groups in the labour market with respect to working-time, gender and region by exploiting data from the German Socio-Economic panel (GSOEP) for the years 1995 till 2014. Using the decomposition of the Theil1-index we demonstrate that the increase in earnings inequality is primarily the result of diverging average earnings of the various groups in the labour market (between-group inequality) and to some extent due to increasing earnings heterogeneity within groups (within-group inequality). The former effect is larger than the latter. Without the inequality reducing effect on earnings inequality due to the continuous decrease in the share of full-time working employees and the increase in the female labour participation rate (compositional effect) earnings inequality would have actually further increased after 2010. Independent of the policy target, policy measures to reduce inequality need always to be designed in such a way that they take the whole work force into account in order to achieve measurable effects.
J39|Sharing one’s fortune? An experimental study on earned income and giving|In this paper, we investigate the relationship between earnings and charitable giving, in an environment in which earnings depend on luck but not in a manner that makes its contribution obvious. We set up a real effort experiment, in which subjects enter data in four one-hour occasions and are paid a piece rate. From the second occasion onwards, we randomly assign half of the subjects to a treatment with higher piece rates, without the subjects being explicitly made aware of the random assignment into the two groups. At the end we ask subjects whether they want to donate a share of their earnings to a charity of their choice. We find that, despite large differences in earnings due to the different piece rates, subjects receiving the higher piece rate are actually less likely to give, and that givers in the two groups give the same share of their total earnings. Charities receive the same average donation from members of the two groups, indicating that charitable giving by subjects in this experiment does not increase with income. We discuss how these results can be explained by self-serving attribution bias.

J39|The labour cost variables in the building of the “Frame SBS”|The building of the new Structural Business Statistics (SBS) Register (so called Frame) exploits company accounts and en terprise level fiscal data as main sources concerning the variables on revenues and costs. When dealing with labour cost variables an additional source is available: social security data. There are advantages and disadvantages in the use of social security data to feed the variables on wages and labour costs into the frame. In fact, while being heterodox with the main sources, their use has the advantage to introduce consistency with employment data entering the Frame via the business register. This work reports the findings obtained trying to answer questions like: which is the most suitable source to comply with SBS definitions on wages and labour costs? What are the magnitudes and characteristics of discrepancies between sources? What are the causes of these differences? The main reasons of differences have been identified through an in-depth study of the definitions of administrative variables and comparative analyses between sources,at both the macro and micro level. The solution proposed for the Frame involves an innovative correction procedure using social security data to reduce the definitional bias in company accounts due to the inclusion of costs related to external workers into the labour cost.
J39|Trends in Low-Wage Employment in Canada: Incidence, Gap and Intensity, 1997-2014|This paper introduces two new concepts to the debate on job quality: the low-wage gap and low-wage intensity. These two measures provide information on the depth and severity of low wages. Using Labour Force Survey microdata, we discuss trends in these two measures, along with trends in the incidence of low wages over the 1997-2014 period. For example, in 2014, 27.6 per cent of all employees aged 20 to 64 years earned less than two-thirds of median hourly wages for full-time workers aged 20 to 64 years (or $16.01 per hour), our low-wage cutoff. In this same year, the low-wage gap was 21.0 per cent, which means that the average low-wage employee earned approximately 79.0 per cent of the low-wage cutoff (or $12.66 per hour). Consequently, low-wage intensity, defined as the product of the incidence and the gap (scaled by 100) was 5.8. This is down from an intensity of 6.3 in 1997, which was the result of a slightly higher incidence (27.9 per cent) and a higher gap (22.7 per cent). This paper also provides these results by gender, age, educational attainment, industry, occupation, employment status and province. These detailed results help identify which groups face the highest rates, greatest depths, and largest intensities of low-wage employment in Canada. Furthermore, this paper explores the implications of a $15 minimum wage on the low-wage gap in 2014. Finally, to provide a brief sensitivity analysis, we discuss (1) the results for low-wage employment in Canada using a different cutoff (two-thirds mean hourly wages for full-time employees aged 25 to 54 years) and (2) comparisons of our results to those of CIBC’s Employment Quality Index and the OECD’s low-pay data.
J39|The Effects of Economic Growth on Earnings in Bolivia|This paper analyzes the effects of economic growth on labor earnings in Bolivia during 1999-2012. More precisely, we develop a labor market model to capture both cycle and trend effects of prices, and production on earnings, which is estimated econometrically using pseudo-panel data methods. The results show that labor earnings have had a pro-cyclical behavior. In particular, we find that, in the short run, an increase of 1% in prices or production explains an earnings rise of around 0.5%, while, in the long run, a production increase of 1% is associated with an earnings variation of 0.4%. Furthermore, we find that labor earnings growth by sector follows, to some extent, the economic performance of its corresponding sector, which responds to the sector segmentation characteristics in the Bolivian labor market.
J39|Do Right to Work Laws Worsen Income Inequality? Evidence from the Last Five Decades| There is an ongoing debate about whether changes in labor regulations such as Right to Work (RTW) laws are contributing to the rising trend of income inequality in the U.S. We adopt Synthetic Control Method (SCM) for comparative case study to examine the impact of a state’s adoption of RTW law on its income inequality. We use a wide range of inequality measures for Idaho, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas, states that enacted RTW between the 1960s and the 2000s. We find that RTW did not impact income inequality in these states. This result is underpinned by additional finding of a lack of impact of RTW on unionization and investment.
J39|Multiple earnings comparisons and subjective earnings fairness: A cross-country study|Earnings comparisons are defined by the earnings differential within the same social class, the parallel comparison, and the longitudinal comparison, which consists of the upward and downward comparisons. These three types of earnings comparisons are direct and significant determinants of the perception of earnings fairness. The influences of these three types of earnings comparisons on fairness perception vary with societal characteristics, such as the degree of corruption, income inequality, and unemployment. Of these three types of earnings comparisons, the group upward comparison is the most malleable to societal characteristics. Past studies on earnings fairness cannot explain workers’ strong feelings of injustice in the most recent recession, in which the unemployment rate has been high, but the strong feelings of injustice can be explained by the group upward comparison in this study.
J39|The minimum wage versus the earned income tax credit for reducing poverty|Minimum wage increases are not an effective mechanism for reducing poverty. And there is little causal evidence that they do so. Most workers who gain from minimum wage increases do not live in poor (or near-poor) families, while some who do live in poor families lose their job as a result of such increases. The earned income tax credit is an effective way to reduce poverty. It raises only the after-tax wage rates of workers in low- and moderate-income families, its tax credit increases with the number of dependent children, and evidence shows that it increases labor force participation and employment in these families.
J39|¿Se está adentrando el sistema español de pensiones en zona sísmica?/Is the Spanish Pension System Approaching a Seismic Zone?|Numerosos trabajos y foros económicos indican la existencia de problemas en la sostenibilidad del sistema público de pensiones en España en el medio y largo plazo. En esta línea, los objetivos que se plantean en este trabajo son varios: (i) analizar la evolución del envejecimiento de la población española, con el fin de estimar cuáles serían las futuras prestaciones de los pensionistas; (ii) estudiar la dinámica de los afiliados a la Seguridad Social y la cuantía de sus contribuciones; (iii) determinar si en el futuro será sostenible el sistema actual y si no fuera así, estimar en qué momento se produciría su ruptura; y (iv) proponer medidas adecuadas para que en el futuro dicho sistema sea sostenible. A large number of research articles as well as debates in economic forums point out the problem of the sustainability of the Public Pension System in Spain at medium and long-term. So, the objectives of this paper are the following: (i) to forecast the aging people trend in order to estimate the future retirement allowances; (ii) to study the dynamic of the number of affiliates to the Social Security as well as the amount of their economic contribution; (iii) to determine if the current pension system will be sustainable in the future; otherwise, to estimate the date when the system will go in bankruptcy; and (iv) to propose a number of measures conducting to a sustainable system in the future.
J39|Employment and wages before and after incarceration – evidence from Hungary|We study the entry into legitimate employment and earnings of a large sample of convicts released from Hungarian prisons in 2002–08. The employment rate of the prisoners falls short of 20% one year before incarceration, and they earn 25% below the national average. We identify the effect of prison by exploiting differences in the timing of incarceration and also by estimating fixed-effect models. For convicts with a single prison term, we find an initially negative effect on employment, which turns positive after a year, though the impact on earnings is permanently negative. A comparison with recidivists suggests that these results are driven by a drop in the reservation wages of ‘reformed’ criminals. This reading is supported by further data showing that the average ex-inmate tends to make increased efforts to find a legitimate source of livelihood and support in job search.

J39|The Impact of Training on Productivity and Wages: Firm-Level Evidence|This paper uses firm-level panel data of on-the-job training to estimate its impact on productivity and wages. To this end, we apply and extend the control function approach for estimating production functions, which allows us to correct for the endogeneity of input factors and training. We find that the productivity premium of a trained worker is substantially higher compared to the wage premium. Our results are consistent with recent theories that explain work-related training by imperfect competition in the labor market. © 2015 The President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
J39|Tax reform in Georgia and the size of the shadow economy|This paper applies three different methods widely used in the literature to track changes in shadow economic activity in Georgia following a drastic tax reform in 2005. The first method is a currency demand approach based on macro level data. The second and third methods rely on micro data from household surveys. Overall, we find evidence that the amount of income underreporting decreased in the years following the reform. The biggest change is observed for households headed by a farmer, followed by “other” types of households where the head does not report any working status. Employed and self-employed households appear very similar before the tax reform and show minimal adjustment in income reporting in the post-reform period. Results, however, suggest that much of any difference may have come from increased enforcement efforts rather than rate changes.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J39|The development of wages in the public sector and their connection with wages in the private sector|This study finds that there is a long-term connection between the development of wages in the public sector and in the private sector. Since 1999, after the wage gap between the two sectors was closed, the short-term connections also became much stronger. During these years, wages in both sectors moved in tandem, with wages in one of them affecting wages in the other. During the 1990s, public sector wages led developments in private sector wages, and in the economy as a whole. While wage creep in the public sector has had low variance over the years, and is not affected by business cycles, most of the significant wage agreements in the public sector track private sector wage trends, are procyclical, and other than two agreements in the mid-1990s, they expand when the fiscal deficit is low and contract when it is high. The wage agreements themselves are responsible for about one-third of total real growth in employee wages in the public sector, and there is an almost perfect correlation between them and the overall change in employee wages in the public sector. Essentially, the wage agreements signed in the public sector since 1999 are responsible for the strong correlation between wages in the public sector and wages in the private sector. Since the 1990s, the average wage in the public sector, adjusted to workers' characteristics, has increased by less than the average wage in the private sector, while the wage increase for workers who remained employed was similar in both sectors.
J39|Labor Market Careers before and after Incarceration|We study the entry to formal employment and earnings of a large sample of convicts released from Hungarian prisons in 2002-2008. We identify the effect of the prison service on post-release careers by exploiting differences in the timing of incarceration, on the one hand, and estimating fixed effects models, on the other. For convicts with a single prison spell,we find initially negative effect on employment that turns positive after about one year while the impact on wages is permanently negative. A comparison with recidivists, for whom the employment effect is negative and the wage effect is weaker, suggests that these results are driven by a drop in the reservation wages of ‘converted’ criminals rather than the lack of discrimination. This reading is supported by further data showing that the ex-inmates, on average, make increased effort to find legitimate sources of living and support to finding jobs.

J39|Profile of earners and remittances in Mexico: a relative deprivation approach|This research analyzes the individual qualities and microeconomic profiles from mexican workers in Mexico, which under relative deprivation conditions, take the choice to leave the country as an alternative way to improve their life expectations. It is found that mexican assistance programs encompass heterogeneous results and thus, are not a generalized signal of improvement for the families. Using a Multinomial Logit specification we found that public assistance programs reinforce relative deprivation of non-migrants families on those who have relatives who migrated. Human capital attributes present a direct relation with the process of migration not only for traditional exporting labor regions, but also for the north-border of the country. The south supports the relative deprivation hypothesis meanwhile, is not the case for the USA-mexican border States.
J39|What Has Happened to Middle-Class Earnings? Distributional Shifts in Earnings in Canada, 1970-2005|This paper examines how middle-class earnings in Canada have changed between 1970 and 2005 using Census microdata. Middle-class earnings are defined as workersâ€™ earnings between 50 and 150 percent of the median or as earnings between the 20th and 80th percentile earnings. The analysis looks at the proportion of workers (â€œworkersâ€™ shareâ€ ) with middle-class earnings and the proportion of earnings (â€œearnings shareâ€ ) received by middle-class workers. The study finds: (i) there has been a marked decline of full-time full-year middle-class workers and corresponding marked increases of higher- and lower-earning workers in the Canadian workplace; (ii) there has been an even larger shift in earnings with middle-class workers losing out to strong earnings gains of higher-earning workers; and (iii) the majority of the decline of the middle-class earnings share was due to the fall in their workersâ€™ share for male and for full-time full-year female workers.
J39|Labour Market Matters - May 2014|Between 1970 and 2005, the share of total earnings in the Canadian labour market going to middle-class workers has fallen significantly, while the earnings share of higher-earnings workers has risen. Is the middle-class being hollowed out? A paper by CLSRN affiliate Charles Beach (Queenâ€™s University) entitled â€œWhat has Happened to Middle-Class Earnings? Distributional Shifts in Earnings in Canada, 1970-2005â€ (CLSRN Working Paper no. 131), finds that, while there has been a large drop in the proportion of workers making middle-class earnings, there has correspondingly been an increase in the proportion of workers earning higher and lower-end earnings. The study finds that there has been a drop in the number of middle-class earners in the Canadian labour market. In the United States, a marked pattern of â€œjob polarizationâ€ â€“ or the share of employment accounted for by high-skill and low skill jobs growing faster than the employment share accounted for by middle-skill jobs - has led to concern over the disappearance of the middle-class. Given the high degree of economic interconnectivity between Canada and the United States, it seems reasonable to ask whether job polarization is also occurring north of the border. A study by CLSRN affiliates David Green (University of British Columbia) and Benjamin Sand (York University) entitled â€œHas the Canadian Labour Market Polarized?â€ (CLSRN Working Paper no. 133) analyses movements in wage inequality, and employment and wage polarization across occupations in Canada for the last four decades. The authors find that Canada has also experienced faster growth in employment in both high and low paying occupations relative to those in the middle since 1981 but, in contrast to what occurred in the U.S. in the 1990s, wage rates did not exhibit polarization.
J39|MarchÃƒÂ© du travail en revue - Mai 2014|Entre 1970 et 2005, la part des gains totaux de main-dâ€™Å“uvre canadienne obtenue par la classe moyenne a considÃ©rablement chutÃ©, alors que celle des travailleurs mieux rÃ©munÃ©rÃ©s a augmentÃ©.

J39|U.S. Immigration Policy at a Crossroads|Two issues have taken center stage in the recent debates about U.S. immigration policy: one, illegal immigration and more generally the entrance of poorly educated individuals into the U.S. economy and two, whether the U.S. should continue its family-based admissions system or move towards a skills-based system. This paper analyzes these issues culling evidence from the history of U.S. immigration policy, the experiences of different types of U.S. immigrants, and crossnational comparisons.
J39|How Immigration May Affect U.S. Native Entrepreneurship: Theoretical Building Blocks and Preliminary Results|"This paper describes the theoretical underpinnings and provides empirical evidence for a model that predicts a positive impact of immigration on entrepreneurial activity. Immigrants, we hypothesize, facilitate innovation and entrepreneurship by being willing and able to invest in new skills. At the heart of this theoretical prediction is the observation that human capital not immediately valued in the U.S. labor market is useful for learning new skills. Because immigrants face a lower opportunity cost of investing in new skills or methods, this ""transfer"" of source-specific skills to the U.S. may lead immigrants to be more flexible in their human capital investments than observationally equivalent natives. Areas with large numbers of immigrants (even if they are not self-employed) may prove to be areas in which entrepreneurship and innovation are easier to accomplish. Our theory offers a unique perspective on the contributions of immigrants to economic development beyond traditional perspectives that focus on low-cost immigrant labor or immigrant entrepreneurship."
J39|Part-time Work, Wages and Productivity: Evidence from Belgian Matched Panel Data|The authors use matched employer-employee panel data on Belgian private-sector firms to estimate the relationship between wage/productivity differentials and the firm's labor composition in terms of part-time and sex. Findings suggest that the groups of women and part-timers generate employer rents, but also that the origin of these rents differs (relatively lower wages for women, relatively higher productivity for part-timers). Interactions between gender and part-time suggest that the positive productivity effect is driven by male part-timers working more than 25 hours, whereas the share of female part-timers is associated with wage penalties. The authors conclude that men and women differ with respect to motives for reducing working hours and the types of part-time jobs available to them: women often have to accommodate domestic constraints by downgrading to more flexible jobs, whereas male part-time work is frequently related to training and collectively negotiated hours reductions that do not affect hourly pay.
J39|Does academic entrepreneurship pay?| We investigate the private returns for academics that start new businesses. Total earnings for the universe of 478 individuals working at Swedish universities who quit to become full-time entrepreneurs between 1999 and 2008 are compiled. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analysis of entrepreneurial returns to include capital gains. Entrepreneurship for academics appears a gradual process and episodic. Earnings are similar before and after becoming an entrepreneur, and dividends and capital gains are inconsequential. But the income risk is more than three times higher in entrepreneurship.

J39|Making it Work: The Mixed Embeddedness of Immigrant Entrepreneurs in New Zealand|In seeking economic immigrants, especially those who are skilled, entrepreneurial and with capital to invest, a settler country such as New Zealand has assumed that national and city labour markets/economies will gain by adding to the human capital pool as well as creating new 'economic' activities of various sorts. Economic participation, both as labour but also as typically small business owners, often reflects the nature of mixed embeddedness (Kloosterman and Rath 2003) and especially the relational embeddedness (Portes, cited in, Vertovec 2009) of particular immigrant groups. This is most apparent in relation to social and economic networks, the deployment of human capital, immigrant engagement strategies and transnational activities. Using the concept of mixed embeddedness, this paper examines the strategies and outcomes for migrant entrepreneurs from the People's Republic of China, the Republic of Korea, India, South Africa and the United Kingdom, drawing upon a largely qualitative analysis of immigrant employers from these groups.
J39|Heterogeneity in the Production of Human Capital|We derive a tractable nonlinear earnings function which we estimate separately for each individual in the NLSY79 data. These estimates yield five important parameters for each individual: three ability measures (two representing the ability to learn and one the ability to earn), a rate of skill depreciation, and a time discount rate. In addition, we obtain a population wide estimate of the rental rate of human capital. To illustrate heterogeneity in the production of human capital, we plot the distribution of these parameters along with NLSY79 reported AFQT scores. By utilizing these parameters, we are able to verify a number of heretofore untested theorems based on the life-cycle human capital model. In addition, we are able to show how these human capital production function parameters relate to cognitive ability, personality traits, and family background. Among our results, we find: Black-white differences in ability are smaller than those exhibited in standardized tests. Blacks have higher time discount and skill depreciation rates than whites. Individuals with higher time discount rates and greater rates of skill depreciation have fewer years of school. Individuals with both a high internal locus of control and self-esteem exhibit greater ability, lower skill depreciation, and smaller time discount rates. Individuals inclined towards depression have higher time discount rates. Agreeable, open, conscientious and extrovert individuals have a greater ability to learn but not necessarily a greater ability to earn. Neurotic individuals have a lower ability to learn. Higher parental education is associated with a greater ability to learn, lower skill depreciation, and a smaller time discount rate. Educational stimuli, such as growing up in a household that subscribed to magazines, are associated with higher ability. Conversely, growing up poor is associated with lower ability.
J39|Myanmar's apparel industry in the new international environment : prospects and challenges|"Myanmar’s apparel industry had long been denied access to Western markets due to sanctions against its military government. The birth of a ""civilian"" government in March 2011 improved Myanmar’s relations with the international community, and Western sanctions were largely lifted. Regained market access is expected to trigger rapid growth of Myanmar’s apparel exports. This paper examines this impact with a comparison to Vietnam’s apparel industry.The industry’s prospects are getting bright, but the business environment has recently changed drastically in Myanmar. A new challenge for Myanmar’s apparel industry is remaining globally competitive. This paper also examines advantages and disadvantages that apparel firms in Myanmar experience. Although its abundance of low-wage workers remains a source of competitiveness, Myanmar needs its government to play a more active role to build the foundation of the industry."
J39|Estimating the Impact of the Québec’s Work Incentive Program on Labour Supply: An Ex Post Microsimulation Analysis|In 2005, a wage subsidy program was established in Québec to encourage low-income individuals, particularly recipients of social assistance, to work, by offering them fiscal relief. We analyse the effect of this program (the Prime au travail) with a microsimulation model which determines the impact on the labour supply. We estimate the variation in the labour supply at the extensive and intensive margins which allows us to grasp both the income effect and the substitution effect of the Prime au travail on individuals’ willingness to work. On the other hand, our labour supply model has the necessary characteristics to link it to a general equilibrium model and offer an integrated macro-microsimulation analysis. Nonetheless, unlike the usual microsimulation models employed in integrated macro-microsimulation analysis, we provide a number of innovations, notably the analysis at the intensive margin so that it captures both the substitution effect and the income effect. Our results show that a number of individuals entered the labour market in response to the Prime au travail, while others decided to work fewer hours, due to increased income linked to the program. Ultimately, the variation in labour supply was less in the intensive margin than in the extensive margin and it is positive for all types of households, with the exception of female single parents.
J39|Better Safe than Sorry? The Effects of Income Risk, Unemployment Risk and the Interaction of these Risks on Wages|We examine whether income and unemployment risks are compensated by individual wages. Using a portfolio approach we show that the marginal income risk effect on wages is always positive whereas the marginal unemployment risk effect crucially depends on the income risk. The interaction effect between both risk measures is negative. Using administrative panel data from Germany we confirm the theoretically predicted signs for both risks and their interaction effect.
J39|Sub-centres and Urban Inequality: A study on Social Equity in the Barcelona Metropolitan Region|Much of the inequality literature has done a great deal of work to study national inequality. However, most people live in cities and their experience of inequality is shaped by their local and metropolitan environment. This fact implies that next to inequality in countries, local inequality is also important. In this context, this paper investigates the relationship that exists between the urban spatial structure (defined by means of CBD and sub-centres) and the causes and the consequences of urban inequality in cities. To do so, this research takes into account the Barcelona Metropolitan Region as study case. Hence, the aim of this work is to determine whether CBD (central business district) and in particularly sub-centres, exert an influence on urban inequality in order to define future polices that enhance social equity. What determines the degree of inequality across the municipalities of the Barcelona Metropolitan Region and, what are the factors behind the inequality growth across these municipalities?. The former question is addressed through using spatial econometric techniques that estimate if per capita income in 2008 is dependent on the past agglomeration economies that have emerged from CBD and sub-centres in 2001 correspondingly. Consequently, the latter point is also studied, through examining whether urbanization and localization economies that have emerged from CBD and sub-centres in the past, matters for the per capita income growth between 2001 and 2008. The results suggest that agglomeration economies that arise from CBD and sub-centres can explain the degree of income inequality and its growth as well. In addition, once is controlled for other conditions, the econometric models reveal that initial income inequality, population density, presence of human capital, land use balance, urban amenities and coast location are positively associated with per capita income as well as they predict its growth until 2008. Inversely, high level of elderly population is negatively significant correlated with per capita income and its growth. Therefore, planning a metropolitan area by taking into account sub-centres entail a remarkably improvement of its social performance.
J39|Inequality at Work: The Effect of Peer Salaries on Job Satisfaction| We study the effect of disclosing information on peers' salaries on workers' job satisfaction and job search intentions. A randomly chosen subset of University of California employees was informed about a new website listing the pay of University employees. All employees were then surveyed about their job satisfaction and job search intentions. Workers with salaries below the median for their pay unit and occupation report lower pay and job satisfaction and a significant increase in the likelihood of looking for a new job. Above-median earners are unaffected. Differences in pay rank matter more than differences in pay levels. (JEL I23, J28, J31, J64)
J39|Romanians, Hungarians and their wages, in transition, in Romania|Legally binding treaties or memorandums have been used over time to regulate the issue of national borders of many European countries. As a result, relatively large groups of people have become ethnic minorities in other countries. They may conserve their ethnic identities, and therefore their children may accumulate ethnic human capital (e.g., language, culture, and religion) in addition to the general human capital of the country. Therefore, they can get access to an appropriate occupation linked by tradition or other factors to their ethnic group. This paper uses estimates from a selection model with an endogenous switch among three broad types of occupational groups to analyze the composition of the wage gap between Romanians and ethnic Hungarians in Romania before and during the transition from a planned to a market economy. The results suggest that the institutional settings of the controlled economy allowed Romanians to work in occupations that gave them the best returns, while the changes during the transition years allowed ethnic Hungarians to work in occupations that gave them the best returns.
J39|Measuring the Shadow Economy: Endogenous Switching Regression with Unobserved Separation|We develop an estimator of unreported income, perhaps due to tax evasion, that does not depend on as strict identifying assumptions as previous estimators based on microeconomic data. The standard identifying assumption that the self-employed underreport income whereas wage and salary workers do not is likely to fail in countries where employees are often paid under the table or engage in corrupt activities. Assuming that evading individuals have a higher consumption-income gap than non-evading ones due underreporting both to tax authorities and in surveys, an endogenous switching model with unknown sample separation enables the estimation of consumption-income gaps for both underreporting and truthful households. This avoids the need to identify non-evading and evading groups ex-ante. This methodology is applied to data from Czech and Slovak household budget surveys and shows that estimated evasion is substantially higher than found using previous methodologies.

J39|Social Capital And Industrial District Development: The Role Of The Local Government|The paper represent a theoretical attempt to investigate the role that the local government can play in improving the level of social capital for the development of industrial districts. The social capital is not, as generally suggested by the socio-economic literature, an individual attitude towards something which does not imply privately appropriable economic benefits, as it is for a pure public good (which would not imply privately appropriable benefits). Social capital should be interpreted as a public component of an investment which implies private and public benefits entangled with each other. Firms could not have sufficient incentive to increase its investment in social capital, because this investment strictly depends on the economic convenience of investing in the impure public good. Starting from this point of view, we underline the importance of investing local public resources (funds, time and effort) for the development of the local social capital.

J39|Comparison of Venezuela´s minimum wage purchasing power with that in four Latin-American countries in 2008|This paper compares Venezuela´s minimum wage purchasing power with those in Argentina, Colombia, Chile and Peru, using data mining. Using Bayesian networks, it was found that the consumption pattern for the 108 goods considered is similar in these countries. The order of countries according to their minimum wage purchasing power from highest to lowest was found to be Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela and Peru. Results obtained by means of variance analysis pointed out that the variables that influenced the observed price difference between Venezuela and each other country are: type, origin and degree of necessity of each good, gender and, in particular, goods for infants and the elderly.
J39|Quinoa: An Option for Improving Rural Income in Bolivia|"This research examines the production of quinoa as an option for improving rural incomes in the Altiplano of Bolivia; due to, on one hand, the grain is aligned perfectly to the customs and traditions of work and family of the habitants of this region, on the other hand, international demand for the product has increased substantially generating good economic opportunities and better prices. Through microsimulation is observed that in the the Southern Highlands households would benefit from the production and marketing of quinoa, and may even significantly increase these revenues (decreasing poverty levels) increasing the productivity of the land or substituting other crops by it. However, in other highland areas the grain production has a modest impact in terms of income and poverty. These differences explain why just the Southern Highlands produces a variety high demand, ""la quinua real"" while in other areas the other agricultural activities are relatively more profitable alternatives."
J39|Impact of Rural Development Scheme on Availability of Agricultural Labour — A Study of Dairy Farmers in Thanjavur District of Tamil Nadu| This study conducted in the Thanjavur district of Tamil Nadu, has indentified the problems being faced by dairy farmers due to scarcity of farm labour for agricultural and livestock production. The study is based on the data collected from 40 selected respondents involved in crop production and dairying in the study area during the year 2008-09 through primary survey. The study has revealed that the implementation of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) has provided employment opportunities to rural workers and has checked the migration of farm labour from villages to cities and nearby industrial townships. All the eligible family member of landless dairy farmers had the job cards, but medium and large dairy farmers possessing agricultural land, prefer to work at their own farms. These farmers have reported that they were facing acute shortage of labourers during peak paddy planting and harvesting due to MGNREGS. The labour wages have increased significantly from Rs 60 to Rs110 per day since the implementation of MGNREG scheme. It has been observed that milch animals of some landless/ small dairy farmers are being maintained by the children or aged family members, as majority of adult family members prefer the MGNREGS jobs to earn wages. These adult members have complained about not getting 100-day wage employment as per provisions of scheme. The wage payments are also delayed after completion of work and they face problems in getting the job cards. The study has concluded that the minimum wages under MGNREGS should be increased cautiously keeping in view its impact on agricultural/ livestock activities.
J39|Product Market Integration, Rents and Wage Inequality|"Globalization in the form of product market integration affects labour markets and produces winners and losers. While there are aggregate gains, it is in general ambiguous how inequality is affected. We explore this issue in a Ricardian model and show that it depends on the balance between ""protection"" and ""specialization"" rents. In particular, wage inequality among similar workers (residual wage inequality) may be U-shaped, at first decreasing and then increasing in the process of product market integration. Consequently, there may be gains in both the efficiency and the equity dimension until integration reaches a certain level at which a trade-off arises.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>"
J39|El salario mínimo y el régimen de ahorro individual en pensiones: diagnóstico, evidencia y problemática|Uno de los objetivos principales de la Ley 100 de 1993 era propender por la ampliación progresiva de cobertura a los segmentos de población no cubiertos con un sistema de pensiones obligatorio. Sin embargo, esa misma reforma estableció que (i) en ningún caso se podrá cotizar con ingresos inferiores a un Salario Mínimo Legal Mensual Vigente (SMLV); y (ii) debería adoptarse una Garantía de Pensión Mínima (GPM), mediante la cual se le garantiza a todos los afiliados al Sistema General de Pensiones (SGP) una pensión mínima que no puede ser inferior al SMLV. Así, este documento demuestra empíricamente que la existencia conjunta de un salario mínimo elevado, respecto a la productividad media de la economía colombiana, y una GPM indexadaal salario mínimo, están generando exclusión e inequidad en el Régimen de Ahorro Individual (RAIS) y así, en el SGP. En la práctica, el hecho de que la cotización y la pensión mínima estén atadas al SMLV constituye un gran impedimento a la ampliación de la cobertura y equidad del sistema pues las características del mercado laboral (alto desempleo e informalidad) se ven reflejadas directamente en el sistema pensional y se hace muy difícil (i) afiliarse al sistema (las personas excluidas del mercado laboral formal por definición quedan excluidas del sistema pensional); y (ii) acumular el capital necesario que permita obtener una pensión mínima igual a un SMLV por el resto de la vida (requisito del RAIS para poderse pensionar). De esta manera, se impone una barrera a las personas para pensionarse, en especial a las de menor educación que corresponden a las más pobres. Adicionalmente, este hecho genera unas transferencias bastante inequitativas de pobres a ricos dentro del sistema y hace que las mesadas sean inferiores a lo que podrían ser si no existieran esas restricciones. Es decir, se desvirtúan los propósitos que inicialmente dan origen a la GPM.
J39|Personal Earnings Inequality in the Czech Republic|This paper analyzes the inequality of personal earnings in the Czech Republic since the early transition from communism, using relative distribution method. It applies data from two surveys, Microcensus and Living Conditions, covering the period from 1988 to 2008. The trend suggested by many recent empirics, “hollowing of the middle”, was confirmed in the early stages of transition, but later subsided. Earnings polarization was apparent for all sex and education subgroups between the years 1988 and 1996. For international comparison the European dataset EU-SILC 2008 has been used, focusing on four countries: Austria, Germany, Hungary, and Poland. Earnings distributions by gender and education have been analyzed, establishing that male earnings distribution is more homogenous than female, and earnings of highly educated people are more concentrated in the middle than earnings of less educated people.
J39|退職一時金の実態と決定要因：アンケート個票を用いた実証分析|日本の勤労者世帯の家計にとって、多額に上る退職一時金の存在は無視できない。にもかかわらず、退職金の受領実態は家計経済の研究における分析対象とはされて来なかった。本稿では、世帯アンケート調査の個票を用い、個別世帯が受給した退職一時金の実態、将来の退職金への期待、及びそれらの決定要因に関し計量分析を行った。退職一時金の受領経験データで行った回帰からは、退職金受領額は企業規模や勤続年数の増加関数であり、特に勤続年数効果は勤続20－30年を超えると非線形に高まること、他方、退職金月収比の学歴格差は、中卒とその他の間に溝があるものの、高卒と大卒とでは差がないこと等がわかった。また退職金受領期待の分析では、退職金への期待は概ね受領実態を反映しているものの、そのあり方は個人の学歴と相関しており、中卒労働者の期待は実績に比べてかなり低めだが、高卒者の期待は実績相応、大卒者の期待は実績を上回ることが分かった。
J39|Social Network and Job Quality: Evidence from Cameroon|Using Cameroonian data, this paper investigates the effects of social network on job quality. Social network is measured in terms of using friends and relatives while looking for a job. As regards to job quality, two aspects have been taken into consideration: monetary job quality which is captured by wage and non monetary job quality which is captured by a combination of social protection and job security. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of social network as regard to job quality, we make use of both Heckman selection model and Ordered Logit model. Our findings contrast with previous studies. Job seekers who make use of social network do not necessarily get a good job. More precisely, while the users of social networks exhibit a wage premium, they also exhibit a low job quality in terms of social protection and job security. We also find that social network contributes to explain job quality differential according to gender and institutional sectors (formal versus informal).
J39|Education Signalling and the School-to-work Transition|This paper studies the relation between labour market institutions and educational systems and how this relation may affect youth unemployment rates. By constructing a signalling model in which education can be used as a signal of workers’ unobserved productivity and firms face firing costs, we investigate how the structure of the educational system and the labour market institutions may influence the school-to-work transition of young unexperienced workers. In particular, we find that different educational systems can lead to different youth unemployment rates, even for high-skilled individuals. Besides, the framework presented in this paper allows to understand how the existence of minimum wages affects individual’s education decision and helps to explain some of the observed empirical regularities.

J39|Some Reflections On Immigrants’ Fiscal Impact|The influx of immigrants in developed countries has increased in recent decades. This, together with rapid population aging have stimulated public interest on immigration issues. Thus, some authors have argued that immigration could serve as a remedy for age-related fiscal pressures. However, often, immigrants are considered to be a public burden. The studies realised have shown that immigration may have strong quantitative implications for fiscal policy of the host country. The paper makes a brief analysis of the fiscal impact of immigrants with diverse skills in host countries. Are given tax effects that occurred immigrants from countries joined the European Union in 2004 the United Kingdom.

J39|Analyzing the Productivity-Wage-Unemployment Nexus in Malaysia: Evidence from the Macroeconomic Perspective|Using multivariate cointegration and error-correction modeling techniques, this paper attempts to examine whether there exists a productivity-wageunemployment relationship in Malaysia at the macroeconomic level. The main findings show that unemployment is dichotomized from the long-run equilibrium relationship between labor productivity and real wages, implying labor productivity is an important long-run factor in determining real wages, while unemployment has negligible effect on the real wage rates. However, the real wages are very responsive to a change in labor productivity, signaling the labor market is tight that leads to an increase in unit labor cost. To be more resilient to rising wages and productivity gap in a globally competitive environment, the Malaysian industries should move up the value chain, and promote skill- and technology-intensive production.
J39|An Integrated And Empirical Model Of Performance Assessment - A Case Study|In this paper we present a new and competitive personnel assessment procedure, developed and tested on the General Social Care and Child Protection Department of Bihor County. The procedure is based on behavioral anchors evaluation scales and has a seven folded structure, completed by the employee and the hierarchical coordinator. The evaluation of this scale proved valid and also reveled the fact that in assessing the professional performances we cannot use only the self-evaluation, which is under the risk of subjective influence, but in the same time we cannot use only the evaluation of managers because they donâ€™t capture specific aspects of behavior on the workplace.
J39|An Essay on Real Wage Index Numbers|Real wage index numbers have been used to measure movements in the standard of living of the typical worker. This paper describes some of these indicators for the United States and England. A new real wage index is proposed that resembles the sliding scale used to adjust wages in certain industries years ago. This new index is applied to U.S. manufacturing industry and it suggests a fall in real wages by about 40 percent since 1960. Workers’ distributional position in U.S. manufacturing has deteriorated considerably.
