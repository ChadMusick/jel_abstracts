D49|Effects of a Mandatory Local Currency Pricing Law on the Exchange Rate Pass-Through|We analyze whether a 2004 law requiring firms to express prices in the local currency in Peru, which had experienced a high degree of price dollarization, affected the exchange rate pass-through (ERPT). We hypothesize that the enactment of the law introduced menu costs for those firms that set their prices in dollars, prompting several of them to make a permanent switch from dollars to soles. Using disaggregated consumer price index (CPI) data, we find that after the enactment of the law, the ERPT was completely offset for non-durable goods with dollarized prices, and partially offset for durable goods with dollarized prices. These effects could be due to different shares of the imported content, market power and varying mark-ups.
D49|Effects of a mandatory local currency pricing law on the exchange rate pass-through|This paper discusses whether Law 28300 of 2004, that required Peruvian firms to express their prices in Peru's currency in a context of high price dollarization, affected the exchange rate pass-through (ERPT). We hypothesize that the enactment of the Law introduced menu costs for firms that used to set their prices in dollars, prompting several of them to make a permanent switch to pricing in local currency. Using disaggregated consumer price index (CPI) data, we find that, following passage of the Law, the ERPT was completely offset for non-durable goods with dollarized prices, and partially offset for durable goods with dollarized prices. These effects may vary due to differences in imported component shares, market power, and markup pricing.
D49|Multilaterale Interchange-Gebühren: Man sollte das Kind nicht mit dem Bade ausschütten|Die Regulierungsbehörden scheinen in Bezug auf multilaterale Interchange-Gebühren (MIF) ambivalent zu sein. Auf der einen Seite behandeln sie die MIF wie Kartellpreise in konventionellen Märkten. Andererseits haben sie eine Obergrenze für die MIF festgelegt - und damit das Konzept von Preisobergrenzen toleriert. Dieses Papier zeigt, dass diese Haltung der Regulierungsbehörden auf die Komplexität der zweiseitigen Märkte zurückzuführen ist. Es wird verdeutlicht, dass Emittenten nicht im Wettbewerb mit Acquirern und Acquirer nicht im Wettbewerb mit Emittenten stehen. Ebenso wenig besteht eine wettbewerbliche Konkurrenz unter den Emittenten um die Zahlungsakzeptanz am POS. Daher können die MIF kein Kartellpreis sein. Darüber hinaus wird argumentiert, dass die MIF als wirtschaftlicher Höchstpreis ein Bestandteil eines gut funktionierenden Kartenzahlungssystems sind. Alle anderen Optionen der Preisbestimmung leiden unter Trittbrettfahrerproblemen und hohen Transaktionskosten. Um die Funktionsweise eines Systems ohne die MIF richtig zu veranschaulichen, werden das deutsche Geldautomaten-System vor 2011 und die bilateralen Verhandlungen im Rahmen des deutschen electronic cash-Systems näher beleuchtet. Schließlich wird darauf hingewiesen, dass der aktuelle Regulierungsansatz zum Untergang der europäischen Kartensysteme führen kann, die derzeit unter dem Druck von Mastercard und Visa stehen.
D49|An exploratory study into consumers? perspective for establishing price strategies that maintaining consumers' good will|This research related to meal price of food truck service business. Descriptive data was collected through a questionnaire survey. Respondents were Thai people age 16 ? 35 up years. The vast majority of 226 respondents were in the age group between 21-25 years with 45.2 percent respondents. There were male 35.8 percent and female respondents 64.2 percent. This research indicated the maximum willing to pay was the maximum price at 150 baht. On the other hand, minimum willing to pay was the minimum price at 25 baht. The range of acceptable prices was between 25 - 150 baht. The resulting distribution enabled the researcher to determine upper and lower price limits for western food. The results showed that consumers considered the food to be cheap at 65 baht. If the price fell below 33 baht, the lower limit could cause the item to be judged as being of questionable quality. The consumers considered the highest price at 119 baht. If the price rose over 180 baht, the upper limit can cause the item to be judged as being too expensive, suggesting quality levels and attributes exceeding those desired by the consumers. They felt the food was cheap as felt it was expensive at 50 baht (indifference price). In term of the price stress, the indifference price (50 baht) was greater than the optimal price (35 baht). They felt some stress over price, since the price that they would most like to pay was lower than the price they view as cheap.
D49|Intraday Volume-Volatility Nexus in the FX Markets: Evidence from an Emerging Market|Using a dataset on local banks' daily FX transaction volume segregated into counterparty and transaction types, this article investigates the relationship between trading volume and intraday realized volatility for the US dollar/Turkish lira parity (USDTRY), one of the most traded emerging market currencies against US dollar. We question whether type of counterparty and transaction affects intraday volume-volatility relationship across various trading sessions around the world. We reveal that only the spot transactions of domestic customers have positive contemporaneous relation with realized volatility and this significance is valid only in global trading sessions that mostly overlap with the local trading hours. Furthermore, we utilize a metric for the belief dispersion on the level of future exchange rate via currency options and find that the dispersion significantly strengthens the volume-volatility nexus, confirming the Dispersion of Beliefs Hypothesis.

D49|Effects of Consumer Financial Protection Introduced after the Financial Crisis of 2007-2008|This paper studies the effects of consumer financial protection regulation introduced in the US after the financial crisis of 2007-2008. It starts with a review of bounded rationality in the context of retail financial markets. I analyze the survey of consumer finances using diffs-in-diffs, paying special attention to the singularities of this dataset. The main goal is to assess the effectiveness of regulatory changes. Secondarily, the paper tries to find out if deception was occurring in the marketplace. There is support for the effectiveness of the 2011 FTC advertising rule. Results reject effectiveness of HOEPA rule of 2008 and HEOA provisions about private education loans.
D49|An Instrumental Variables Approach to Estimating the Effects of Changes in the Heroin Market on Overdose in the US|We investigate a major supply shock to the US heroin market in the 1990s, the introduction of Colombian-sourced heroin, that led to a substantial rise in heroin overdose admissions. The instrumental variables approach uses the interaction of the timing of the supply shock with city-level pre-shock characteristics that have been shown to facilitate or hinder the introduction of new heroin sources. The estimation strategy allows us to disentangle the causal effects of multiple city-level heroin market factors that are correlated with overdose: the price per pure gram of heroin, the coefficient of variation of purity of heroin, and the proportion of heroin of Colombian origin. We find that changes in the price per pure gram and country of origin have substantial effects on heroin overdose admissions. The results have important implications for understanding the effects of changing heroin market conditions on the current US heroin epidemic.
D49|New vehicle feebates|New vehicle feebate programs encourage improved fleet-wide vehicle fuel efficiency; yet analyses of these policies have been limited to ad hoc proposals. In this paper, we exploit an extensive, multi-year dataset which includes more than 16 million observations to evaluate the welfare implications of a long-standing vehicle feebate program in the Canadian province of Ontario. We: (1) show that second-best optimal feebates can be written as a function of new vehicle Pigouvian taxes; (2) find that Ontario's feebate program was welfare-enhancing relative to a no feebate scenario but that a second-best optimal benchmark would have yielded additional welfare while reducing fleet-wide emissions; and (3) find that Ontarian consumers responded asymmetrically to fees versus rebates.
D49|Charitable giving, suggestion, and learning from others: Pay-What-You-Want experiments at a coffee shop|We examine consumer behavior under Pay-What-You-Want (PWYW) pricing by conducting a series of field experiments that implemented different pricing schemes at a coffee shop: PWYW, PWYW with charitable giving, PWYW with charitable giving and a suggested price, and—for comparison—a regular fixed price group and a fixed price with giving group. We find that the PWYW scheme, when combined with charitable giving and a suggested price, yields net revenue as large as that under the fixed price scheme. We also find that consumers under PWYW with charitable giving are responsive to a suggested price and seek to learn from others.
D49|Misaligned Stakeholders and Health System Underperformance|This paper summarizes the findings of the World Economic Forum’s Industry Agenda Council on the Future of the Health Sector’s two-year inquiry into underperformance of health systems. The Council found that misalignments (i.e., situations involving conflicting incentives, behaviour, structures, or policies) among key stakeholders are likely to lead to significant waste, whether measured in terms of health for money or money for health. This paper defines three types of misalignments (those due to divergent objectives, power asymmetries, and cooperation failures), offers concrete examples of each type, and includes several cross-cutting examples from three particularly burdensome disease areas: cancer, diabetes, and mental health. The Council also examined situations in which stakeholders acted to correct misalignments and reduce waste. This paper details several case studies of achieving greater alignment and enumerates a set of lessons for stakeholders. It concludes by making recommendations for future research in this domain.

D49|The Framework of Tunisian Textile and Clothing Industry|In this paper, we will first present the textile and the clothing sector in the Tunisian economy. It is therefore very important to situate this sector in our economy, evaluating its various features and outline its strengths and weaknesses. We also focus on the historical evolution of Tunisian textile and clothing sector. We will establish then a comparison between Tunisia and China as part of the textile and clothing industry.
D49|The Relationship Between Hong Leong Bank’s Performance with Leverage and Inflation|This paper are for recognize the relationship between risk and performance of Hong Leong Bank. Hong Leong Bank is one of the bank that have a good reputation in banking industry at Malaysia. Thus, it is important to shareholder knows the type of risk that faced by management of bank. The focused risk is leverage and external factor that are inflation by using profitability as the bank’s indicator which is by using ROA and current ratio. Aside that, the external factor such as inflation also give an impact to the performance of bank. The leverage and inflation are significant in business due to the direct and indirect relationship to the profitability. Therefore, this paper further examines if management have taken a serious step in maintaining the risk that will give any reflect to the profitability.
D49|The Pay-What-You-Want game: What can be learned from the experimental evidence on Dictator and Trust Games?|This paper introduces the Pay-What-You-Want game which represents the interaction between a buyer and a seller in a Pay-What-You-Want (PWYW) situation. The PWYW game embeds the dictator game and the trust game as subgames. This allows us to use previous experimental studies with the dictator and the trust game to identify three factors that can influence the success of PWYW pricing in business practice: (i) social context, (ii) social information, and (iii) deservingness. Only few cases of PWYW pricing for a longer period of time have been documented. By addressing repeated games, we isolate two additional factors which are likely to contribute to successful implementations of PWYW as a long term pricing strategy. These are (iv) communication and (v) the reduction of goal conflicts. The central contribution of this study is an attempt to bridge the gap between laboratory experiments and the research on PWYW pricing, which relies largely on evidence from the field. By reviewing the relevant experiments, this study identifies factors crucial for the success of PWYW pricing and provides guidance to developing long-term applications of PWYW pricing.
D49|The robustness of mispricing results in experimental asset markets|Many experiments have been conducted on market mispricing, however there is a distinct lack of guidance over how mispricing should be measured. This raises concerns about the sensitivity of mispricing results to variations in the measurement procedure. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of previous results with respect to four variations: the choice of interval length, the use of the bid-ask spread as a price proxy, the choice of aggregation function, and controlling for observable market characteristics. While a majority of previous results are unaffected, roughly 30% do change significance.
D49|The Recent Evolution of the U.S. Beveridge Curve: Evidence from the ARDL Approach|Using a search and match model of employment, and labor market data from 2000 to the present, this paper provides updated empirical evidence of the U.S. Beveridge Curve - an inverse unemployment-vacancy (UV) relationship - for the periods before and after the 2007-2009 recession. Using Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) data and an enhanced econometric technique - the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach, our results confirm the existence of the Beveridge Curve for the U.S.. We also find empirical evidence of a rightward shift in the U.S. Beveridge Curve following the Great Recession, potentially indicating increases in labor market mismatch or structural frictions in the U.S. labor market.
D49|"Arbeiten in der Sharing Economy: die ""Uberisierung"" der Arbeitswelt?"|"Within a short period of time the sharing-phenomenon, originally triggered by altered consumer attitudes and preferences and enabled by modern networking technologies, gained momentum. Quickly sharing emerged from its niche existence. Today an increasing professionalization of the sharing economy can be observed: Many of the idealistic goals originally set are being abandoned. Also, sharing platforms are more and more recognized not only for their ability to provide alternative ways to satisfy consumption needs but also as sources of jobs and income. Sharing platforms’ specific economical principles bring forth a new sort of self-employed worker—the micro-entrepreneur. This new sort of worker is confronted with specific working conditions prevailing in the new platform economy. As a whole, the further proliferation of this form of working gives rise to concerns about an ""uberization"" of work. This development raises questions in terms of modern protective rights for workers as well as social security benefits and therefore calls for the attention of regulators. Innerhalb kürzester Zeit hat das durch veränderte Konsumeinstellungen angestoßene und durch moderne Vernetzungstechnologien ermöglichte Sharing an Fahrt gewonnen und trat schnell aus der anfänglichen Nische heraus. Heute ist eine zunehmendeProfessionalisierung der Sharing Economy zu beobachten, in deren Zuge ursprüngliche und idealistische Ziele des Sharings zunehmend über Bord geworfen werden. Sharingplattformen dienen auch nicht länger nur als Quelle alternativer Konsumbefriedigung, sondern zudem als Job- und Verdienstquelle. Dabei sind es die spezifischen ökonomischen Grundprinzipien der Sharingplattformen, die einen neuen Typus von Selbständigem hervorbringen – den Mikrounternehmer. Dieser ist unterspeziellen, den Funktionsprinzipien der Plattformökonomie geschuldeten Arbeitskonditionen tätig. Insgesamt lässt die weitere Verbreitung dieser neuen Wirtschafts- und Arbeitsform eine ""Uberisierung"" der Arbeitswelt erwarten. Diese Entwicklung wirftFragen hinsichtlich zeitgemäßer Schutzrechte für Arbeitskräfte sowie sozialer Absicherung auf und ruft Regulierungsinstanzen auf den Plan."
D49|Packaging of sin goods – Commitment or exploitation?|We consider the shopping and consumption decision of an individual with a self-control problem. The consumer believes that restricting the consumption of a sinful product (such as chips) is in his long-run interest. But when facing the actual decision he is tempted to overeat. We ask how firms react to such self-control problems, and possibly exploit them, by offering different package sizes. In a competitive market, either one or three package sizes are offered. In contrast to common intuition, the large, and not the small package might be a commitment device. The latter may serve to exploit the naive consumer.
D49|Buying behaviors when similar products are available under pay-what-you-want and posted price conditions: Field-experimental evidence|This work analyzes relationships between product- and pricing-related attitudes of customers and their choice or rejection of a product offered under the Pay-What-You-Want-(PWYW) pricing mechanism in a situation in which the same supplier simultaneously sells a similar item at a posted price. In a between-person field experiment, we sell two types of freshly prepared sweet treats. In the first experimental condition, we supply waffles under PWYW and crêpes at a posted price. In the second condition, we reverse the allocation of the pricing methods to the two focal treats. Our sweet snacks stand attracts 125 different customers in the first and additional 163 buyers in the second experimental condition. Overall, we find that the customer share opting in favor of a product among all buyers acquired in an experiment is not significantly influenced by the pricing mechanism used in selling the item. The probability that customers choose the PWYW offer increases as they like the underlying product more than the posted price substitute. Several price-related buyer attitudes are also significantly related to customer choice of a PWYW offer. The more customers are concerned about their social image in the context of their payment method choice and behaviors, the more they appreciate to actively participate in price setting and the less difficulty they experience in figuring out a reasonable product price the more probable it is that they opt for a PWYW offer. The results imply that practitioners should carefully reflect consumer attitudes evoked by the PWYW mechanism in case of considering its introduction and in designing its details. In addition, the findings suggest that we need more research on the influence of various product- and price-related cognitions of consumers on their acceptance or rejection of PWYW offers. This holds in particular for goods with higher price levels than the product categories covered in our experiment.
D49|The Industrial Organization of Corruption: Monopoly, Competition and Collusion|We study how the introduction of competition between public officials for the provision of a given license affects extortionary corruption, i.e., the demands of harassment bribes. We conduct a laboratory experiment where citizens need to obtain licenses from public officials, and officials can demand a bribe on top of the license official fee. We first provide officials with monopoly power by giving citizens no choice but to pay the bribe to their assigned official. We then introduce competition among officials by allowing citizens to engage in costly search and get the license from any of the available offices. We examine transactions that are likely to be one-shot, such as the delivery of a drivers' license, and transactions that require frequent interactions between the parties and therefore allow for reputation building, such as yearly renewals of building permits. Finally, we examine officials' ability to collude by communicating before setting their bribe demands. We find that introducing competition significantly reduces corruption both in settings characterized by one-shot and by repeated interactions between citizens and officials. While the possibility to collusion lowers the effectiveness of competition, officials are unable to sustain collusion in the long run.
D49|A Survey of the Empirical Evidence on PWYW Pricing|We review a large number of empirical studies on Pay-What-You-Want (PWYW) pricing. We distinguish between laboratory experiments, field experiments, survey experiments and case studies. Based on this survey we identify the following two gaps in the recently flourishing literature on PWYW pricing: (1) studies on PWYW pricing for goods with high cost, and (2) studies on the long-term effects of PWYW pricing.

Market liberalization became mandatory in Romania, with the adhesion to European Union. Energy price liberalization in our country was a difficult process. Leaders of EU imposed onGovernment a pricing liberalization calendar with the mention that not respecting it, the country isobliged to pay substantial penalties.
D49|Competition between Firms in Economic Evolution: Its Characteristics and Differences to the Biological Sphere|This paper investigates the characteristics of competition among firms from an evolutionary perspective. It develops a coherent approach to economic competition that incorporates two kinds of evolutionary concepts currently used and emerging at the intersection of social sciences, including economics, and biology: Darwinian thinking as well as the naturalistic approach. Inspired by evolutionary theory, the intersection commonly captures concepts that make metaphorical use of Darwinian ideas – these concepts draw on an analogy construction to the biological sphere. As a result in this paper, different characteristics of economic competition may be analogically described by different forms of biological selection, e.g., genetic group selection. However, selection processes do not only act on genes, but also on culture. By considering the naturalistic approach, differences to the biological sphere are revealed. The crux of this paper is the deduction that competition between firms is a form of cultural group selection in economic evolution.

The purpose of this article is to analyse the state-of-the art on innovation in services, and point out some future possibilities. The method used was a bibliographic review. The results indicate that there is a transition taking place, where researchers are no longer trying to explain what innovation is (linked to a school of thought of the subject), but trying to explain how it occurs. Moreover, it is observed that the research trend is the study on innovation in services interconnected with other areas. Apesar dos importantes avanc¸os na pesquisa em inovac¸ão em servic¸os, essa área ainda tem desafios a serem superados. Nesse sentido, o objetivo deste artigo é analisar o estado da arte em inovac¸ão em servic¸os e apontar algumas possibilidades de pesquisas futuras. O método utilizado foi uma revisão bibliográfica. Os resultados indicam que há uma transic¸ão ocorrendo da temática, cujos pesquisadores não estão mais buscando explicar o que é inovac¸ão atrelada a uma escola de pensamento da disciplina, mas tentando explicar como o fenômeno ocorre. Além disso, observa-se que a tendência de pesquisa nessa área é o estudo da inovac¸ão em servic¸os e a sua interligac¸ão com outras áreas.
D49|What the Law of Comparative Advantage Misses in Africa: A New Measure of Economic Complexity|Africa is often referred to as if it were a country. This perspective flattens the understanding of a complex and highly varied set of 54 countries with widely different GDP growth rates and underlying economic complexities. More economically complex countries are able to sustain external commodity price shocks, a factor Ricardo did not consider in his famous law. A method is developed in this paper to better assess a country's economic complexity, modeled after the Herfindahl Index which is widely used in measures of market structure. Data from the MIT/Harvard Atlas of Economic Complexity is used to construct a new economic complexity index that can better track a country's move towards improved business environments. This paper argues that high GDP growth, particularly in African countries, may mask exports of a single crude commodity which is subject to volatile price changes, and hence rocky macroeconomic output.
D49|A Survey of the Empirical Evidence on PWYW Pricing|We review a large number of empirical studies on Pay-What-You-Want (PWYW) pricing. We distinguish between laboratory experiments, field experiments, survey experiments and case studies.

D49|Transport's demand in the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo and urban toll policy as a measure to reduce congestion|The São Paulo Metropolitan Area has been suffering for several years from enormous congestions that causes many problems, such as air and noise pollution, and productivity losses. Until now a day, the city has never had a policy to solve the causes of the problem. Automobile users cause external costs to other individuals and do not pay for it. Those who commute by car take into account only private costs, lower than the total social one, which considers also external costs. Thus, there is an excessive use of the roads and, consequently, congestion. A congestion pricing policy imposes to car users an expense as a way to internalize the costs generated to society by them. At the same time, this policy generates revenues for investment in the city's transport system. This work aims to estimate the demand of different transport modes in the São Paulo Metropolitan Area and simulate how the demand would respond to an implementation of a congestion charge for cars, in a specific area of the city. For this, we use a mixed multinomial logit model, based on Origin-Destination Research. As the variable dependent on the modal choice for commuting, we consider six different modes of transport: walking and cycling (1), buses (2), car (3), subway and train (4), taxi (5) and motorcycle (6). As explanatory variables, we use cost and time travel, besides socioeconomic characteristics of the individuals. We simulate the congestion price policy imposing an additional fee to car journeys intended to or that pass through the restricted area. Our results suggest that an urban toll would have a positive impact on reducing the number of car commuters (each $1 fee would reduce in 6.18% the demand for car commuters), increasing the number of trips in other modes, especially public transport (2.18% for buses and 1.16% for subway and train), and non-motorized transport (walking and cycling, 2.53%). As an additional benefit to public budget, the congestion charging generates revenues for the city to invest in transport infrastructure.
D49|Dynamic directed search|Abstract The directed search model (Peters 52(5):1117–1127, 1984) is static; its dynamic extensions typically restrict strategies, often assuming price or match commitments. We lift such restrictions to study equilibrium when search can be directed over time, without constraints and at no cost. In equilibrium, trade frictions arise endogenously, and price commitments, if they do exist, are self-enforcing. In contrast to the typical model, there exists a continuum of equilibria that exhibit trade frictions. These equilibria support any price above the static price, including monopoly pricing in arbitrarily large markets. Dispersion in posted prices can naturally arise as temporary or permanent phenomenon despite the absence of preexisting heterogeneity.
D49|Law of the jungle: firm survival and price dynamics in evolutionary markets|Abstract In this paper I develop a simple, and general model of supply and demand within which almost any theory of consumer and producer behaviour may be integrated by varying parameters. I then investigate the dynamics of this model and its implications for the theory of market evolution, and show that it unifies a number of insights from evolutionary economics. I extend upon these evolutionary theories and also characterise the distribution of prices across the market and investigate its evolution over time.
D49|Equilibrium Labor Turnover, Firm Growth, and Unemployment| This paper considers equilibrium quit turnover in a frictional labor market with costly hiring by firms, where large firms employ many workers and face both aggregate and firm specific productivity shocks. There is exogenous firm turnover as new (small) startups enter the market over time, while some existing firms fail and exit. Individual firm growth rates are disperse and evolve stochastically. The paper highlights how dynamic monopsony, where firms trade off lower wages against higher (endogenous) employee quit rates, yields excessive job‐to‐job quits. Such quits directly crowd out the reemployment prospects of the unemployed. With finite firm productivity states, stochastic equilibrium is fully tractable and can be computed using standard numerical techniques.
D49|Robust equilibria in location games|In the framework of spatial competition, two or more players strategically choose a location in order to attract consumers. It is assumed standardly that consumers with the same favorite location fully agree on the ranking of all possible locations. To investigate the necessity of this questionable and restrictive assumption, we model heterogeneity in consumers’ distance perceptions by individual edge lengths of a given graph. A profile of location choices is called a “robust equilibrium” if it is a Nash equilibrium in several games which differ only by the consumers’ perceptions of distances. For a finite number of players and any distribution of consumers, we provide a complete characterization of robust equilibria and derive structural conditions for their existence. Furthermore, we discuss whether the classical observations of minimal differentiation and inefficiency are robust phenomena. Thereby, we find strong support for an old conjecture that in equilibrium firms form local clusters.
D49|Union Duopoly with Heterogeneous Labour: The Effect of Wage Ceilings|This research analyzes the labor market outcome when there are two unions in the industry, representing heterogeneous workers - substitutes or complements in production - and using wage strategies, in the presence of wage regulation. Three strategic environments are considered: symmetric Bertrand-Nash duopoly, Stackelberg duopoly and efficient cooperation between the two unions. We discuss the case of the imposition of a wage ceiling, oriented towards increase employment. In fact, this is the general result obtained. We also inspect if it may be optimal for a Stackelberg leading union to push the other to the bound.
D49|I paid a bribe: Information Sharing and Extortionary Corruption|"Theoretical and empirical research on corruption has flourished in the last three decades; however, identifying successful anti-corruption policies remains a challenge. In this paper we ask whether bottom-up institutions that rely on voluntary and anonymous reports of bribe demands, such as the ""I paid a bribe"" website first launched in India in 2010, could act as effective anti-corruption tools, and, if this is the case, whether and how their effectiveness could be improved. We overcome measurement and identification problems by addressing our research questions in the laboratory. Our results suggest that the presence of a reporting platform significantly reduces bribe demands. The most effective platform is one where posting is restricted to service recipients and where posts disclose specific information about the size of the bribes and the location of their requestors, i.e., a platform that could serve as a search engine for the least corrupt officials."
D49|Is More Competition Always Better? An Experimental Study Of Extortionary Corruption|Using a laboratory experiment, we assess whether increasing competition among public officials reduces extortionary corruption. We find that increasing the number of providers has no effect on bribe demands when citizens' search costs are high, but it increases corruption when search costs are low. The effect is absent in a parallel setting framed as a standard market, which we attribute to citizens using a nonsequential search strategy as opposed to sequential search in the corruption setting. We conclude that efforts to reduce search costs, such as infrastructure investments, are preferable to anti‐corruption policies aimed at increasing the number of providers. (JEL D73, D49, C91)
D49|Pricing under noisy signaling|We provide rationale, conditions, and insights for “customized” pricing in markets, that is, for equilibria where different buyers pay different prices for similar products. We use a Spence/Riley signaling model enhanced by a signaling methodology under random relations between costs and attributes, developed by Feldman (Math Soc Sci 48:93–101, 2004 ) and Feldman and Winer (Math Soc Sci 48:81–91, 2004 ). Examples include markets for new cars, retail, human capital, trades where transaction costs are negotiable, and transactions where sellers affect buyers’ costs by offering different levels of service or support for the same products and prices. These encompass a large fraction of all assets, prices, and transactions. Our results help explain the different levels of segmentation and product/service differentiation that we observe in markets and the efficiency of these equilibria. We note that we can demonstrate the results within competitive sellers’ markets. Financial markets examples include dividend, initial public offerings, market microstructure and capital structure signaling, and share class distinctions in mutual funds.

Amellett érvelünk, hogy az árak merevségének DSGE modellekben leírt következményei (átváltás az ár és a termelés ingadozása között, illetve az átlagos értékek változatlansága az ármerevség függvényében) csak a modellek sajátos feltevéseiből következnek. Megmutatjuk, hogy egy ágensalapú modellben más hatások mutathatók ki: pozitív kapcsolat van az ár és a termelés ingadozása között az ármerevség függvényében, ami egy fordított U alakú összefüggés szerint hat a változók ingadozására. A rugalmasabb árak nagyobb átlagos kibocsátáshoz is vezetnek. A vállalatok ármerevségbeli heterogenitásának nincs hatása a változókra. Ha a vállalatok nagyobb súllyal veszik figyelembe a versenytársak árait az árdöntés során, akkor rugalmas árak mellett csökken, ragadós árak mellett nő az ár és a termelés ingadozása. A vállalatok közötti ismertségi hálózat sűrűségének növekedése rugalmas árak esetén csökkenti a változók ingadozását, ragadós árak mellett nem hat rájuk.

D49|An Experimental Study of Decentralized Link Formation with Competition|We design a laboratory experiment to investigate bilateral link formation in a setting where payoffs are pair-specific. Our link formation rule is decentralized and players can make link offers and counter-offers, as in a Beckerian marriage market. The game is designed in such a way that a stable equilibrium configuration exists and does not depend on conditions such as initial configuration or order of move. We test whether the theoretical equilibrium is obtained under experimental conditions, and which individual motivations and decision-making techniques lead players to depart from myopic best response. We find that players are remarkably good at attaining a stable equilibrium configuration, which happens in 86% of the games. Results show that complete information speeds up the game via self-censoring, and that sub-optimal choices are mostly driven by over-thinking behavior and reluctance to accept to link with players who have been disloyal earlier in the game.
D49|Prix, taux de profit cible et prévention de l’entrée<BR>[Price, Target Rate of Profit and Entry Preventing]|Since the marginalist controversy held from 1939 to the mid-fifties, the full cost principle presents itself as an alternative to the marginalist theory of the producer’s equilibrium, without being able to shake its dominance. Yet, through decades, empirical investigations are rather favourable to it. Its rationality has not been sufficiently emphasized; so, orthodoxy was able to belittle it as an empirical practice compatible with its own precepts. The present article shows that three principles stated by the full costers and their successors would allow to build a sound theory of full cost pricing. These are: - preventing entry of new competitors; - target rate of profit; - competitive price leadership The article proves that full cost pricing is more conducive to profit maximization than marginalist rule, especially in the case of a competitive market with few suppliers, a market structure usually neglected by microeconomics. Opponents to full cost pricing often consider changes in demand as its Achilles heel. The present article analyses this problem in depth.
D49|The Agent-Based Model of the Closed Market of the One Commodity with Finite Automata as Participants of the Market|The model of market of one commodity , in which there is in each moment of time the same quantity of goods and the same quantity of money was formulated and researched in this paper. Each partner of the market in the one moment of time can be in one of three status: to be buyer, be seller and do not take part in trade in this moment of time. Partners of market change their statuses and prices, by using the personal information of each of them about trade in the previous moment of time only.. The nature of dynamics of the set of prices of participants was investigated analytically.. The central result of the investigation is the using some finite automata with two action(careful and risky) as a model of a participant of market. The convergence of trajectory of our system to stationary set of states with average price of trade which is close to some constant when behavior of all agent is careful and bounded hesitation of this trajectory when there are risky agents only. These facts are established by series of experiments with computer realization of the model. in the cases when all agents can fulfil only one kind of action and when all agents are identical simple determinate automata with linear tactic with careful and risky actions.. Some cases of the herd behavior of participants were considered in this investigation. We investigate our agent based models first of all as models of trade, but it will be useful to note that these models are example of some complicated self-adjusting systems also. This work was fulfiled by me only.I certify that I have the right to deposit the contribution with MPRA
D49|Динамическая Модель Замкнутого Однотоварного Рынка С Конечными Автоматами В Качестве Участников<BR>[The dynamic model of the closed market with one commodity and with finite linear automata as participants]|The dynamic model of closed market with one commodity, which is some combination of autonomous and interacting participants, is a goal of investigating of this paper. Closure of the market means that quantity of the commodity and amount of money on the market are constant in the all moments of time. Each partner of the market in the one moment of time can be in one of three status: to be buyer, be seller and do not take part in trade in this moment of time. The interaction is realized by the trade. Partners of market change their statuses and prices, by using the personal information of each of them about trade in the previous moment of time only and trying to secure their partnership in trade in the next moment. The finite automata model the choice of the degree of risk at definition of new prices by participants The finite automata model the choice of the degree of risk at definition of new prices by participants. So we study the closed market with one commodity as a system interacting finite automata. We showed by the computer investigation the convergence of the average price of the market to a neighborhood of some his average value. We investigated also the role of volume of automata's memory, which represent of the participants of market, in the behavior of all our system
D49|Is the Nigerian Commercial Banking Industry Experiencing any Competition? An Empirical Approach|The paper investigates the level of competition in the loans and deposit market of the Nigerian commercial banking sector in the post re-capitalization period 2007- 2011 using Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) and Concentration Ratio (CR). The weighted average reveals that in the deposit market 3 banks control 39.4% and in the loans market 2 banks provide 19%. The HHI result of 1073 in the deposit market and 2419 in the loans market infers that the level of competition is higher in the deposit market than the loans market. The Nigerian banking industry is neither highly competitive nor experiencing acute market concentration.
D49|Influence of Marketing Instruments on the Shopping Behaviour of Senior Citizens in the Usti Region|The article analyses changes of shopping behaviour of senior citizens over 60 years from the Usti Region which make up in this area about 23 % of population. 418 respondents took part in the research. They arranged in the order of importance marketing instruments that influence them by their shopping goods of daily use: price, quality, range of products, accessibility of shop, loyalty cards, possibilities of parking, advertising and special offers. In the research it took age, social position and sex of senior citizens into consideration. The results showed that with growing age it changes the shopping decision making of senior citizens. The price of goods of daily use has deciding influence for more than half of respondents, its importance increases with the age of senior citizens together. On the contrary requirements for quality decrease with the growing age. Primarily younger segments prefer in fact quality to low price. Similarly it is in case of influence of range of goods. During the shopping decision making not even different forms of promotion are the major impulse, it influences working senior citizens the least. The segment of older customers is impossible to consider a homogenous group - it is actually about supersegment.
D49|Factors Determining Callbacks to Job Applications by the Unemployed: An Audit Study|"We use an audit study approach to investigate how unemployment duration, age, and holding a low-level ""interim"" job affect the likelihood that experienced college- educated females applying for an administrative support job receive a callback from a potential employer. First, the results show no relationship between callback rates and the duration of unemployment. Second, workers age 50 and older are significantly less likely to receive a callback. Third, taking an interim job significantly reduces the likelihood of receiving a callback. Finally, employers who have higher callback rates respond less to observable differences across workers in determining whom to call back. We interpret these results in the context of a model of employer learning about applicant quality."
D49|Emergence of networks and market institutions in a large virtual economy|A complete set of transactions, more than 40 million within a 1.8 year span, allows us to track the evolution of the trader network and the goods network in an on-line trading community. The computer platform was designed to make barter exchange as attractive as possible; money was not part of the design and all players were created equal. Yet, within weeks, several specific goods began to emerge as media of exchange, and not long after that various sorts of specialized traders began to appear. We track their progress using network-theoretic metrics such as node strength, assortativity, betweenness and closeness. By the end of our sample, virtually all trade was money-mediated and market makers played a major role.
D49|Bottlenecks and Opportunities for Quality Improvement in Fresh Pineapple Supply Chains in Benin| This study mapped and diagnosed the fresh pineapple supply chains in Benin to identify bottlenecks in pineapple quality improvement for different markets. A research framework was defined that comprised all relevant aspects to be researched. After 54 semi-structured interviews with key informants, 173 structured interviews were held with actor groups. The chain diagnosis showed there was no concordance between actor groups in which quality attribute they valued most. Moreover, pineapple quality was found to be highly heterogeneous. Key bottlenecks identified were lack of training of primary producers in production practices, unconditioned transport, and unavailability of boxes for export.
D49|Port Pricing: Principles, Structure and Models|Price level and price transparency are input to shippers’ choice of supply chain and transport mode. In this paper, we analyse current port pricing structures in the light of the pricing literature and consider opportunities for improvement. We present a detailed overview of pricing criteria, who sets prices and who ultimately foots the bill for port-of-call charges, cargo-handling fees and congestion charges. Current port pricing practice is based on a rather linear structure and fails to incorporate modern pricing tools such as price differentiation or revenue management. Consequently, ports apply neither profit maximising pricing nor pricing designed to exploit available capacity more efficiently.
D49|One currency, one price? Euro changeover-related inflation in Estonia|This paper studies euro changeover-related inflation using disaggregated price level data. The difference-in-differences approach is used and the control group for the treatment country, Estonia, is built from 12 euro area countries. The Nielsen Company disaggregated price data are employed at product, brand and shop-type level. The results indicate that while the overall inflationary effect of euro adoption was modest, the effects were significantly different across various market segments. Changeover-related inflation was higher for products that were relatively cheaper than the euro area average. Inflationary effects were stronger in smaller shops. JEL Classification: D49, P46, E58
D49|The Euro Changeover in Estonia: implications for inflation|Estonia changed over from the kroon to the euro in January 2011. This paper analyses the inflationary effect of this event. The analysis is based on the Harmonised Indices of Consumer Prices. The difference-in-differences method is employed where the treated group is Estonia and the control group consists of the other EU member states. The estimation results imply that the inflationary impact of the euro changeover was either insignificant or small in magnitude, depending on which treatment period is considered. The acceleration in inflation mostly occurred in the second half of 2010, during the six-month period prior to the adoption of the euro. Although the actual effect of the euro changeover on inflation was modest, most Estonian citizens felt that the introduction of the new currency increased consumer prices considerably.

D49|Seasonal cycles in a model of the housing market|The US housing market exhibits seasonal boom and bust cycles where prices and the speed of trade (turnover rate) rise in summers and fall in winters. We present a search model that analytically generates the observed cycles. The proposed mechanism is based on swings in market thickness rather than market tightness, the leading explanation in the literature.
D49|Empirical evidence of network neutrality – The incentives for discrimination|For the past few years, the network neutrality debate has been a burning international issue, and many researchers have provided various solutions to solve the network neutrality debate in a short time. So far, however, both the proponents and opponents of network neutrality have not provided the empirical evidence necessary to prove their assertions. This study collected data using surveys and estimated usage rates of end users while changing the QoS level of each application. Based on the estimation results of the willingness-to-pay (WTP) and usage rates of end users, this study investigates whether Internet service providers (ISPs) have the incentives to discriminate against application services and whether those incentives change according to various conditions. As a result, ISPs have the incentive to provide a low QoS level for costly application services, and the incentives change according to conditions such as regulatory regimes, the cost of the Internet access service from the ISP, the WTP of the end users, and the degree of competition among the ISPs.
D49|What floats your boat? Preference revelation from lotteries over complex goods|We examine a type of lottery used to distribute some publicly held resource access rights. The lottery provides participants with the opportunity to choose among a set of simple gambles over multi-attribute goods. Participant choices result in an endogenous distribution of success rates over gambles that reflects tradeoffs between the relative desirability of the available goods and the probability of winning. When lottery winnings are multi-attribute goods, lottery outcomes provide sufficient information to estimate hedonic prices, marginal utility, and marginal rates of substitution among attributes. We develop a model for characterizing preferences from this information set. We apply our model to Idaho׳s Four Rivers Whitewater Recreation Lottery, which allows applicants to apply for one permit among a large set of alternative river/day combinations that provide varying river and weather characteristics. This lottery structure shows promise as a foundation for economic experiments for preference revelation.
D49|Uniqueness of equilibrium in directed search models|We study a decentralized trading model as in [7], where a finite number of heterogeneous capacity-constrained sellers compete for a finite number of homogeneous buyers, by posting prices. This “directed search” model is known to admit symmetric equilibria; yet, uniqueness has proved elusive. This study makes two contributions: a substantive contribution is to establish uniqueness of symmetric equilibrium; a methodological contribution is to develop a tool based on directional derivatives to characterize equilibrium.
D49|Economic Analysis Of Life Insurance Market In Republic Of Serbia|The main goal of this is to evaluate the possibility of efficient expansion of the life insurance market in the Republic of Serbia, as well as the economical and social influence that the development of this market would have on Serbia’s economy. The growth of life insurance market would definitely contribute to a better and safer life, general prosperity of the country, expansion of the economy, and the social structure of the country as a whole. The perspectives of the life insurance market in Serbia are great, since the market is rich enough and incomes have risen, and a very small number of people are insured.
D49|Pay-What-You-Want pricing schemes: A self-image perspective|Pay-What-You-Want (PWYW) pricing schemes are becoming increasingly popular. We develop a model incorporating self-image into the buyer’s utility function and introduce heterogeneity in consumption utility and image-sensitivity, generating different purchase decisions and optimal prices across individuals. When a good’s fixed price is lower than a threshold fair value, PWYW can lead to a lower utility. This may result in a lower purchase rate and higher average price, accounting for previously unexplained field experimental evidence. An increase in the threshold value decreases the buyer’s utility and may further lower the purchase rate, resulting in a further increase in purchase price.

Consequently, ports apply neither profit maximising pricing nor pricing designed to exploit available capacity more efficiently.
D49|Valuation of Intangible Assets the Main Pawn for New Challenges Related to the Knowledge Era|Intangible assets are considered a resource controlled by an economic entity arising from past events that is expected to generate future earnings. Through them we can debate the technical-material and financial developments over time and due to permanent development capacity. Today we are witnessing a constantly changing flow of information found in a perpetual technological change that began the emergence of a new stage in the evolution of society was called knowledge. In this context we talk about the new economy which tries to present more complex reality in which we find ourselves. Evaluation of intangible assets constitute a comprehensive and very complex process that should be treated with great caution, especially since it appears that can lead to new challenges, both because of globalization and the development of technological innovation. It involves understanding the peculiarities of the competence assessment and an independent professional appraiser.
D49|Suspension of Managerial Decisions in Relation to the Risks in the Business|"This paper analyzes the importance of the elasticity of managerial decisions in different territories on the example of Coca-Cola Hellenic Group (CCH Group). Suspension of managerial decisions is an important part of the product life cycle. Previous studies have indicated the price elasticity different approaches depending on the life cycle stage through which the product moves. Bearing in mind the business risks and “sensitivity” consumer prices, CCH Group 's own market divided into three segments: the country in which the sale has been established, developing and emerging countries. On the basis of this division is made portfolio marketing mix, in order to find ""the right product at the right time in the right location at the right price"". In addition to achieving the economic benefits to the countries it operates in, the company generates direct, indirect and induced impact on economic development."
D49|"A Pricing Theory under a Finite Number of Securities Issued: A Synthesis of ""Market Microstructure"" and ""Mathematical Finance"""|Traditional finance theory generally assumes a frictionless market, in which a risk premium is described only by price volatility. In reality, however, the risk premium is influenced by a range of factors including the market microstructure. This paper constructs a novel no- arbitrage and complete model that explicitly incorporates among the market microstructure factors a constraint on a finite number of securities issued. From the theoretical perspective, the model is a synthesis of market microstructure and mathematical finance in that it makes it possible to derive a risk-neutral price applicable to a market with a detailed market microstructure. We also calibrate the model to show that the price in the Japanese government bond futures market is significantly affected by the factor of number of securities issued.
D49|Estimating farmers’ productive and marketing inefficiency: an application to vegetable producers in Benin|This paper estimates the technical and marketing inefficiency of a sample of urban vegetable producers in Benin. Marketing inefficiency is defined as the failure of farmers to achieve better marketing output and is reflected in lower output price indices. The study proposes a Russell-type measure of inefficiency using a directional distance function that accounts simultaneously for the expansion of outputs and price indices and the contraction of variable inputs. A truncated bootstrap regression is used in the second stage to consistently analyze factors that underlie differences in inefficiency. The first-stage results suggest that vegetable producers are more inefficient with respect to marketing than production. The second-stage results indicate that technical inefficiency is affected by the production environment and private extension services. Marketing inefficiency is affected by the type of marketing arrangements. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014
D49|PWYW Pricing ex post Consumption: A Sales Strategy for Experience Goods|Pay What You Want (PWYW) pricing has received considerable attention recently. Empirical studies show that a PWYW pricing mechanism is able to increase a seller’s turnover and profit. This paper addresses PWYW pricing for bundles of experience goods. The paper shows that a PWYW pricing mechanism, if applied ex post consumption, separates the decision to buy from the decision how much to pay. Information asymmetries about the quality of the good are reduced during the act of consumption so that buyers are informed about the product’s quality when they decide how much to pay. As a consequence, risk-averse buyers who would otherwise refrain from purchasing under a fixed price mechanism, can be attracted to purchase under a PWYW pricing ex post consumption (PWYW-EPC) mechanism. In this case, the pricing mechanism itself constitutes a signal. The paper concludes that a PWYW pricing mechanism, applied ex post consumption, can be a profitable strategy for a seller if she sells bundles of experience goods and if she wants to attract risk-averse buyers for realizing economies of scale in production.
D49|Do Consumers' Preferences Really Matter? - A Note on Spatial Competition with Restricted Strategies|In the framework Hotelling-Downs competition two players can freely choose a position along a one-dimensional market. We introduce restrictions of feasible strategies and analyze the consequences for players and consumers. In equilibrium players may minimally differentiate away from the center of the market and even locate completely independently of consumers' preferences. We provide conditions for these novel cases as well as for the standard result that players locate on the median of the distribution of consumers. In addition to the short run, where restrictions are fixed, we elaborate on the long run by studying the players' choice of restrictions under (potential) market entry. In both settings, we find an inefficient outcome, in which a firm is capable of offering a product at the center of the market, but instead chooses a position that is worse for most of the consumers.
D49|Inflation and Financial Sector Performance: the Case of Nigeria|The paper examines the long run and short run relationships between inflation and the financial sector development in Nigeria over the period between 1970 and 2012. Three variables, namely; broad definition of money as ratio of GDP, quasi money as share of GDP and credit to private sector as share of GDP, were used to proxy financial sector development. Our findings suggest that inflation presented deleterious effects on financial development over the study period. The main implication of the results is that poor macroeconomic performance has deleterious effects to financial development - a variable that is important for affecting economic growth and income inequality. Moreover, we observed a negative effect of the measures of financial development on growth, suggesting that impact of inflation on the economic growth passes through financial sector. Therefore, low and stable prices, is a necessary first step to achieving a deeper and more active financial sector that will enhance growth as predicted by Schumpeter.
D49|Demand Model Simulation in R with Endogenous Prices and Unobservable Quality|The aim of the present routine is to simulate a demand equation with endogenous prices and unobservable product quality and to retrieve the original parameters using the Control Function (CF) approach. The CF approach is a very useful and simple method to obtain unbiased estimates. The present R code helps to understand the underlying structure of the endogeneity problem in demand estimations. Results support the important bias correction of the CF approach.
D49|Full Cost, Profit and Competition|During the marginalist controversy, full costers failed to convince economists of the superiority of full cost pricing over marginal theory of imperfect competition. The controversy was closed prematurely; various contributions published immediately thereafter in the fifties did not renew the debate despite their relevance. Topics included entry prevention, target rate of profit and the emergence of the market price The present paper shows that the full cost pricing is not so justified by the need for a rule of thumb than as a rational behaviour aiming at long term profit maximisation, especially in the case of highly competitive markets with few suppliers. The paper focuses also on the relationship between full cost pricing and changes in demand (mostly cyclical). It is also shown that the race for performance deserves a central position in the analysis of competition; it is too often neglected in favour of the sole competition on margins.

Estas vias han sido empleadas para investigar la influencia y divergencia entre ambos precios. Mediante la metodologia utilizada se evidencia que los precios del petroleo influyen directa y significativamente en el largo plazo. Sin embargo, ambos precios no estan conectados en el corto plazo empleandose la metodologia de vectores estructurales con corrector de errores (SVEC por sus siglas en ingles, con base en informacion trimestral: 1992-2011, considerandose tres precios del gas natural: Estados Unidos, Rusia y Japon).
D49|Non-Competitive Potential in the Iranian Electricity Market|The electricity markets worldwide have distinctive particularities due to some political and historical reasons. However, principal guidelines of market design remain very similar. The Iranian electricity market has been inaugurated as a pay-as-bid market in 2004. Although the Iranian electricity market has had positive consequences, the economic discussion about proper market design and architecture is in its infancy. The main goal of this paper is analyzing market power and efficiency in the Iranian electricity market.Generally, in spite of the fact that Iranian electricity market is not a high concentrated market, it has potential for non-competitive results. Analyzing results and other facts of the market shows that the most important reason for this is the urgent shortage of supply threshold in this market, rather than the extent of concentration in the industry.
D49|Bundling information goods under 'breakeven' price|Bundling under monopoly tends to increase demand and market efficiency, but likely at the expense of transferring consumers' surplus to firms. Public utilities can use this increase in demand to reduce the monthly fee per consumer. To demonstrate it, I conduct a numerical analysis of the effects of bundling under breakeven price regulation for the Japan Broadcasting Corporation. I estimate the willingness-to-pay for broadcasting services and simulate consumer choices under pure bundling and a-la-carte pricing with breakeven price regulation. Comparing pure bundling and a-la-carte pricing of terrestrial television and satellite television, the increase in demand caused by bundling is very slight due to the strong positive correlation of WTPs. However, compared with a-la-carte pricing, consumer welfare increases by 1.7% with bundling of channels and by 28.2% with bundling of genres.
D49|Forced Sales and Farmland Prices|We analyze farmland prices in the German federal state of Brandenburg from 2000 to 2011 with the aim to understand the price formation process in farmland foreclosures. Pressured sales usually result in a price discount due to time constraints; however, the land is sold using public auctions. This may lead to a price premium. Since the effect of a foreclosure on farmland prices is ambiguous, we empirically quantify the overall effect. We use matching techniques and a regression-based approach. We find that on average, price premiums are realized, though the effect depends on prevailing land market conditions.
D49|CAP reform and price transmission in the pasta chain| The issue of price transmission along the food chain has attracted considerable interest in the EU because of the welfare and policy implications that could potentially be generated. Price transmission along the food chain is characterized by the speed, the magnitude and the nature of price changes along different segments of the supply chain. Moreover, during the last several years, wheat-pasta chains have been affected by CAP reforms in the durum wheat sector that have progressively reduced government intervention in the market. Specifically, the 2003 reform represented a deep change in the tools applied in the CAP, with a turn from coupled income support to a single decoupled aid where farmers’ incomes are directly supported and are no longer linked to levels or types of production. For the present study, we are particularly interested in examining whether and how CAP reform has altered price transmission in the Italian wheat-pasta chain, from farmer to retailer, including the wholesale stage. We employ Kinnucan and Forker model which has provided a convenient instrument for analyzing the impact of policy intervention and adapted its structure to the characteristics and the composition of the pasta supply chain by introducing an intermediate level (wholesale price), represented by semolina producers. Price data are available monthly from January 2000 to April 2011 for Italy. The results suggest that pricing behavior has changed after CAP Reform introduction.
D49|A Semiparametric Approach to Analyzing Differentiated Agricultural Products| When consumers have heterogeneous perceptions about product quality, traditional parametric methods may not provide accurate marginal valuation estimates of a product’s characteristics. A quantile regression framework can be used to estimate valuations of product characteristics when quality perceptions are not homogeneous. Semiparametric quantile regressions provide identification and quantification of heterogeneous marginal valuation effects across a conditional price distribution. Using purchase price data from a bull auction, we show that there are nonconstant marginal valuations of bull carcass and growth traits. Improved understanding of product characteristic valuations across differentiated market segments can help producers develop more cost-effective management strategies.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

D49|Do Gamblers Think That Teams Tank? Evidence From The Nba|A growing body of literature indicates that sports teams face incentives to lose games at the end of the season. This incentive arises from league entry draft policy. We use data from betting markets to confirm the existence of tanking, or the perception of tanking, in the NBA. Results from a SUR model of point spreads and point differences in NBA games indicate that betting markets believe that tanking takes place in the NBA, even though the evidence that tanking actually exists is mixed. NBA policy changes also affect betting market outcomes.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D49|The Price Premium for Organic Wines: Estimating a Hedonic Farm-Gate Price Equation|Organic wines are increasingly produced and appreciated. Because organic production is more costly, a crucial question is whether they benefit from a price premium. We estimate hedonic price functions for Piedmont organic and conventional wines. We use data on the production side in addition to variables of interest to consumers. Our results show that, along with characteristics of interest to consumers, some farm and producer characteristics not directly relevant for consumers do significantly affect wine prices. We find that organic wine tends to obtain higher prices than conventional wine. The price premium is not simply an addition to other price components; organic quality modifies the impact of the other variables on price. (JEL Classification: C21, D49, L11, Q12)
D49|Motivated sellers and predation in the housing market|We develop an equilibrium search model of the housing market where sellers may become distressed as they are unable to sell. A unique steady state equilibrium exists where distressed sellers attempt liquidation sales by accepting prices that are substantially below fundamental values. During periods where a large number of sellers are forced to liquidate customers exhibit ‘predation’: they hold off purchasing and strategically slow down the speed of trade, which in turn causes more sellers to become distressed. The model naturally suggests several proxies of liquidity. Interestingly, the average time on the market (TOM), one of the most frequently used statistics in the literature, does a poor job within the context of liquidation sales and predation. Specifically we show that TOM falls during periods of predatory buying, which, if interpreted on face value, indicates that the market becomes more liquid with predation. We propose an alternative proxy – the profit loss in fire sales – which appears to be a more robust measure of liquidity than TOM.
D49|Buyer’s equilibrium with capacity constraints and restricted mobility: A recursive approach|We study a decentralized trading model as in Peters (1984a), where heterogeneous market participants face a trade-off between price and trade probability. We present a novel proof of existence of a unique demand vector in Nash equilibrium, based on a recursive approach that exploits the monotonicity of matching functions.
D49|Asymmetric transmission between factory and wholesale prices in fiberboard market in Korea|This paper extends the estimation of price relationships in wood processing and empirical assessment of asymmetric price transmission by incorporating time lags in both explanatory and dependent variables. Each of the models developed and estimated in this article reveals the existence of asymmetric price transmission between factory and wholesale prices of fiberboard in Korea. Estimation results indicate that wholesalers earn additional profits by exploiting price fluctuations in the markets. The empirical findings in this study suggest the potential for lower wholesale prices of fiberboard with more competition in wholesale marketing.
D49|The house doesn’t always win: Evidence of anchoring among Australian bookies|We examine Australian horseracing bookmakers’ responses to late scratches, instances in which a horse is abruptly withdrawn after betting has commenced. Our observed bookies exhibit anchoring on the original odds and fail to re-adjust odds fully on the remaining horses after a scratch, thereby earning lower profit margins and occasionally creating nominal arbitrage opportunities for bettors. We also examine which horses’ odds bookies adjust after a scratch and demonstrate diminished profit margins even after controlling for these endogenous adjustments. Our results indicate that bookies’ adjustments recover approximately 80% of lost profit margin but that bookies forgo the remaining 20% due to systematic under-adjustments.
D49|Buyer behavior under the Best Offer mechanism: A theoretical model and empirical evidence from eBay Motors|We use data from eBay Best Offer listings to analyze haggling over prices in transactions with one seller and a series of potential buyers for a limited-supply product. We characterize this transaction mechanism as a sequential-move game to investigate buyer behavior. Our model suggests that a buyer's offer price increases in relations to the number of buyers who have previously made an offer on the item and the Buy-It-Now price chosen by the seller. On the other hand, the offer price decreases for items which have been listed on eBay for a longer period of time. We empirically test our theoretical predictions using data on the sales of Toyota Camry cars on eBay Motors. The empirical evidence is consistent with our model.
D49|The Interest of Having Loyal Buyers in a Perishable Market|The aim of this paper is to show the particular role of buyer loyalty in a perishable goods market. For this we build an agent-based model, inspired by a wholesale market on which we had performed some qualitative field study. In this model we define a very simple negotiation procedure for wholesalers and retailers, who are divided in two populations: loyal retailers who always visit the same seller first and opportunistic retailers who look for the best prices. In this setting, the presence of opportunistic retailers increases the quantity of waste and reduces global earnings for all agents. We then endogenize the attitude of retailers with a reinforcement learning mechanism and show that the number of loyal retailers reaches 80-100% of the population, depending on the difference of prices between expensive and cheap goods, which is the interval in which the production of waste is minimal.

D49|International dispersion of retail diesel fuel prices and the estimation of normal price values|"For the large majority of goods, the price dispersion between countries does not exceed 1:10. Diesel fuel stands out, with a dispersion which exceeds 1:100. Given a constant oil price the difference in diesel fuel prices between countries is caused by the different taxes. The average share of taxes in the price determines the normal price. An estimation of the normal price of diesel fuel is made using an econometric model (using 79 countries, 1998-2008 by even years). Of greatest interest to economic policy are normal prices for countries with economies in transition and developing countries. This paper is organized as follows. In the introduction a definition of the term ""normal price"" and why it is important are presented. The first chapter is devoted to the notion of ""price level"" both international and national. The normal price is calculated using an econometric model. The estimation of the normal price of goods is determined by the international component and deviation of the normal price by the national one. In the second chapter the results of evaluating the parameters of the econometric model and the values of normal prices are given. In the third chapter price deviations in Russia and Kazakhstan are discussed and it is concluded that they have reached the maximum value, above which mass protests may result"
D49|Voluntary payments, privacy and social pressure on the internet: A natural field experiment|The emergence of Pay-What-You-Want (PWYW) business models as a successful alternative to conventional uniform pricing brings up new questions related to the task of pricing. We investigate the effect of a reduction of privacy on consumers' purchase decisions (whether to buy, and if so how much to pay) in a natural experiment at an online music store with PWYW-like pricing. Our study extends the empirical evidence of the reduced anonymity effect, previously established for donation or public goods contexts, to a consumption environment. We find that revealing the name of the customer led to slightly higher payments, while it drastically reduced the number of customers purchasing. Overall, the regime led to a revenue loss of 15%. The experiment suggests that even low levels of social pressure without face to face interaction on customers leads to a reduction of welfare.
D49|The Interest of Having Loyal Buyers in a Perishable Market|The aim of this paper is to show the particular role of buyer loyalty in a perishable goods market. For this we build an agent-based model, inspired by a wholesale market on which we had performed some qualitative field study. In this model we define a very simple negotiation procedure for wholesalers and retailers, who are divided in two populations: loyal retailers who always visit the same seller first and opportunistic retailers who look for the best prices. In this setting, the presence of opportunistic retailers increases the quantity of waste and reduces global earnings for all agents. We then endogenize the attitude of retailers with a reinforcement learning mechanism and show that the number of loyal retailers reaches 80–100% of the population, depending on the difference of prices between expensive and cheap goods, which is the interval in which the production of waste is minimal.

D49|Láthatóvá tehető-e a láthatatlan kéz? Egy ágensalapú piaci modell tapasztalatai<BR>[Can the invisible hand be rendered visible? Experiences of an agent-based market model]|A szerzők egy ágensalapú modell kialakításával próbáltak válaszolni arra a kérdésre, hogy milyen dinamikát követnek a piaci folyamatok, ha nem teljesülnek a főáramú közgazdaságtan erős megszorításai (a láthatatlan kéz explicit megjelenése a walrasi árverező képében, amely kizárja a nem egyensúlyi tranzakciókat, a szereplők racionális viselkedése, az információáramlás tökéletessége, a szereplők homogenitása, az ár- és mennyiségi alkalmazkodás szétválasztása stb.). Egy egyszerű, alulról építkező modell segítségével elemezték a piaci mikrostruktúrák, illetve a döntési szabályok paramétereinek egyensúlyi folyamatokra gyakorolt hatását. Vizsgálataik során azt találták, hogy a piaci szereplők száma akkor is lényegesen befolyásolja az alkalmazkodási folyamatokat, ha azok homogének; az ár- és mennyiségi szabályozás aránya nem gyakorol jelentős hatást a piaci ár és mennyiség alakulására; az információáramlás kiterjesztése javítja a piaci alkalmazkodást; a heterogén szereplők bevezetésének elsősorban a termelők esetén van jelentősége.

D49|Externalities, Public Goods and Natural Monopoly as Market Failures and Their Implications for the Consumer|The reality of daily life gives us sufficient examples of situations in which individual decisions within free market do not automatically and warranted lead to a global economic optimum. Such a situation is denominated as “market failure”, both understood as “the failure of a more or less idealized system of price-market institutions to sustain “desirable” activities or to stop “undesirable” activities” [1], but also as any performance of the market which is considered less better than the best performance possible [2]. Specialized economic literature generally distinguishes four categories of market failures, namely: externalities, public goods, natural monopoly and information asymmetries. The present paper will focused on the first three of these, both from the point of view of generating causes and the effects involved on the consumers, and from the point of view of the possible solutions for rectifying them

D49|¿Puerto o playa? Un análisis económico del conflicto entre la ciudad de Trujillo y el puerto de Salaverry|Salaverry es un pequeño puerto localizado a pocos kilómetros de la ciudad de Trujillo, al norte del Perú. Moviliza alrededor de 2.5 millones de toneladas de carga al año, en su mayoría, granel seco. Desde 1982, ENAPU, la empresa estatal que opera el puerto, ha venido reduciendo sus costos de dragado mediante el alargamiento de un molón retenedor de arena, solución que ha alterado el equilibrio dinámico de la costa y causado la virtual desaparición de las playas de Trujillo. Desde el punto de vista de las políticas públicas, el problema se vuelve aún más complejo si se toma en cuenta el alto costo de las obras necesarias para detener la erosión de las playas (US$ 150 millones), el incremento de la demanda por más y mejores servicios ambientales, y lo poco probable que resulta concesionar al sector privado una operación que genera una externalidad negativa tan seria. El objetivo de este estudio es el de examinar el conflicto entre el puerto de Salaverry y la ciudad de Trujillo desde el punto de vista económico, y determinar cuál es su solución más eficiente mediante análisis determinísticos y probabilísticos desde los puntos de vista público y privado. Los resultados indican que: (i) el terminal portuario de Salaverry no genera recursos suficientes para operar sin un subsidio, menos aún para pagar el costo de la reparación ambiental; (ii) para concesionar el terminal al sector privado, el gobierno deberá otorgar un subsidio cercano a los US$ 25 millones; y, (iii) cerrar el puerto no es recomendable, pues si bien mantenerlo operativo le costaría a la sociedad US$ 175 millones, cerrarlo le generaría costos por US$ 322 millones.
D49|The normal price. The case of the retail price of diesel fuel|"For the large majority of goods, the price dispersion between countries does not exceed 1:10. Diesel fuel stands out, with a dispersion which exceeds 1:100. Given a constant oil price the difference in diesel fuel prices between countries is caused by the different taxes. The average share of taxes in the price determines the normal price. An estimation of the normal price of diesel fuel is made using an econometric model (using 79 countries, 1998-2008 by even years). Of greatest interest to economic policy are normal prices for countries with economies in transition and developing countries. This paper is organized as follows. In the introduction a definition of the term ""normal price"" and why it is important are presented. The first chapter is devoted to the notion of ""price level"" both international and national. The normal price is calculated using an econometric model. The estimation of the normal price of goods is determined by the international component and deviation of the normal price by the national one. In the second chapter the results of evaluating the parameters of the econometric model and the values of normal prices are given. In the third chapter price deviations in Russia and Kazakhstan are discussed and it is concluded that they have reached the maximum value, above which mass protests may result."
D49|Gasoline price as social phenomenon|The gasoline price transform into the social phenomenon by its role in economy. For the state, it is a source of budget revenue through indirect taxes, which in majority of countries make up most of the price. The upper bound of a gasoline price is limited by risk of mass protests. For the citizens a gasoline price affects the cost of living. The lower bound of this price is limited to possibility of the authorities to subsidize it. Balances of interests of the authorities and citizens are estimated for the gasoline prices deviating from the normal. Normal gasoline prices are offered as standard, with respect to which of the actual prices can distinguish high and low. We propose an econometric model for the estimation of the normal price. The analysis of the results of estimation is presented for 97 countries and the data for 2000, 2004 and 2006. Showing the problems emerging in Russia
D49|Competing Paradigms of Competition|This study aims at the empirical investigation of the different conceptualizations of competition with the data available for Turkish manufacturing from 1980 to 2001. The analysis specifically takes into account the classical/Marxian view of competition, which rigorously recognizes the dynamic and turbulent nature of capitalist competition and is based on the concept of â€œregulating capital.â€ Time series analysis is conducted in order to test for the persistence of profit rate differentials among 3-digit classification of the manufacturing industries. The analysis, by differentiating between the intra- and inter-industry competition, addresses the classical/Marxian emphasis on the inter-industry trends of equalization. For this purpose, industry-based data instead of firm-based data are used. Lastly, the incremental rate of profit as the return to regulating capital is taken as the basis for establishing what is actually equalized in the course of competitive process. The analysis is conducted both for the average and incremental rates of return for a comparative view. The results show that while the average rate of profit shows significant persistence in most of the industries, the incremental rate does not. These results are in accordance with the classical/Marxian long-run center of gravity dynamics.JEL Classifications: B12, B51, D41, D49, L10, L60
D49|Adoption of Electric Vehicle in the Netherlands – A Stated Choice Experiment|In this paper, we apply a dynamic innovation diffusion framework to model adoption of full electric vehicles where we explicitly distinguish three major phases of adoption: introduction, growth and maturity. We combine this approach with an SP study to elicit individual preferences for conventional, hybrid and full electric vehicles. We apply a nested logit model to estimate the preferences for EVs based on the total costs of ownership approach that includes monetary and non-monetary costs of owing a vehicle. With negative estimates of WTP for hybrid vehicles (of about €900 on a yearly basis), our results suggest abolishment of subsidization of hybrid vehicles as they potentially crowd out EV adoption. Besides, EVs need to be subsidized on average at €2,000 per year, and this amount is decreasing in the process of vehicle adoption. Time costs associated with rapid charging are a substantial hindrance to EV adoption with average value of time of €63 per hour, increasing for each subsequent consumer segment from €48 to €122 per hour. Environmental costs of CO2 reductions are valued far above the market average at €160 per ton, but determine EV choices only at a later stage of adoption. Finally, towing potential is valued on average at €540 per year and it is about the same for all consumer segments throughout the adoption phases. Policy implications are discussed involving a mix of structural and monetary incentives.
D49|Negotiation and the clustering of corporate loan spreads|Most corporate loans are priced at rounded spreads, e.g. spreads that are a multiple of 25 basis points. Using a sample of 16,598 loan tranches signed by US borrowers between January 1988 and December 2010, this study explores the determinants of such interest rate clustering in the corporate syndicated loan market. We postulate that lead arrangers round spreads upwards because of the uncertainty about the riskiness of the borrowers. Consistent with this negotiation hypothesis, we find that clustering increases with the degree of uncertainty, e.g. the degree of information asymmetry between the lead arranger and the borrower. In contrast, clustering is less likely when lead arrangers have acquired information about the borrower through prior interactions. Finally, the fear of reputation loss incentivizes the most reputable lead arrangers to price loans at more competitive non-rounded spreads.
D49|Reset Price Inflation and the Impact of Monetary Policy Shocks|" Many business cycle models use a flat short-run Phillips curve, due to time-dependent pricing and strategic complementarities, to explain fluctuations in real output. But, in doing so, these models predict unrealistically high persistence and stability of US inflation in recent decades. We calculate ""reset price inflation""--based on new prices chosen by the subsample of price changers--to dissect this discrepancy. We find that the models generate too much persistence and stability both in reset price inflation and in the way reset price inflation is converted into actual inflation. Our findings present a challenge to existing explanations for business cycles. (JEL E31, E52)"

D49|Illusion therapy: How to impose an economic shock without social pain|This study attempts to demonstrate how a government launched an economic structural reform plan that previous governments, fearing a serious social backlash, had been unable to implement over the course of 30 years. The findings show that the Iranian government used “illusion therapy”, a package of econo-psychological techniques, to implement IMF-backed “shock” economic reforms to long-standing energy and food subsidies, without facing the expected social reaction.
D49|Norms, moods, and free lunch: Longitudinal evidence on payments from a Pay-What-You-Want restaurant|We study the distribution and evolution of payments in a Pay-What-You-Want restaurant. Despite missing price tags and despite the option to pay nothing at all, we observe that the vast majority of guests makes strictly positive payments. Over the two years covered by our data, average payments decline slightly, converging at a positive level. At the same time, the number of daily guests increases steadily, resulting in a considerable increase in total revenues. We discuss one possible interpretation of the long-term trend in payments in terms of social norms. We further show that short-term fluctuations in average payments are partly explained by exogenous weather changes. We provide evidence that – in line with work in psychology – weather-induced changes in mood affect payments.
D49|Coordinating cross-border congestion management through auctions: An experimental approach to European solutions|Competition among producers within an integrated electricity system is impeded by any limited transmission capacity there may be at its borders. Two alternative market mechanisms have recently been designed to organize the allocation of scarce transmission capacity at cross-border level: (i) the “implicit auction”, already used in some countries, and (ii) the “coordinated explicit auction”, proposed by the European Transmission System Operators (ETSO) but not yet implemented. The main advantage of the explicit auction is that it allows each country to keep its own power exchange running. In the European institutional context, this is seen as a factor of success of a market reform, although the explicit auction (not coordinated) is known to be less efficient than the implicit mechanism. The addition of a coordination dimension in the explicit auction is intended to solve problems of international flows. We use the experimental methodology to identify and compare in a laboratory setting the efficiency properties of these two market mechanisms, given a market structure similar to the existing one in continental Europe, i.e. a competitive oligopoly. Our main result highlights the inefficiency of the coordinated explicit auction compared to the performance of the implicit auction, measured in terms of both energy prices and transmission capacity allocation. We suggest that the poor performance of the coordinated explicit auction in the laboratory is due to the level of individual expectations about both energy and transmission prices that the mechanism demands. One solution to resolve this problem when the mechanism is implemented in the field would be to design an additional and secondary market for “used” transmission capacity.
D49|The economic and social impact of public procurement on the EUâ€™s internal market|Our paper proposes to analyze the role of public procurement in achievement of the objectives of Europe 2020 Strategy, highlighting the social and economic impact of this policy on the European market. The research is structured in four analytical chapters and one chapter of conclusions. The first chapter presents the main European regulations on public procurement emphasizing how the legislative framework can contribute to the efficiency of public procurement and to the achievement of economic objectives of Europe 2020 Strategy. The second chapter presents the economic and social impact of electronic procurement and the evolution of main indicators in the field. The third and fourth chapter underline the main obstacles that restrain the access of European enterprises on public procurement market and present some conclusions that illustrate the necessity of the modernization of this policy.
D49|Presence of Check‐Off Programs and Industry Concentration in the Food Manufacturing Sector|The authors examine industry concentration for the U.S. food manufacturing sector. This study is the first to examine whether particular subsectors within the food manufacturing industry, which operate in the presence of industry-funded check-off programs such as marketing orders, are more or less concentrated than industries without such research and marketing programs. The authors find evidence to the hypothesis that industries with demand-enhancing check-off programs have lower concentration relative to industries without these programs.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D49|WTP vs. WTA: Christmas Presents and the Endowment Effect|Using data on the valuation of Christmas gifts received by students enrolled in different fields at a German university, we investigate whether the endowment effect, the difference between asking and bidding prices, differs between males and females, students of economics and other fields and whether it varies with the market price of the object under consideration. Our estimation results suggest that female students display a significantly higher endowment effect, indicating that experimental studies on the endowment effect are highly sensitive towards the choice of the subject pool. The results further indicate that the endowment effect depends on the market price of the object. Finally, even though the point estimates hint towards both, a lower WTP and WTA of economic students, these differences are not statistically significant at conventional levels.
D49|Price Effects of Dutch Hospital Mergers: An Ex-post Assessment of Hip Surgery|This study analyses price effects of six mergers in the Dutch healthcare industry. We investigate whether the merging hospitals raised their prices for hip surgery after the merger and, if so, how patients react to this higher price. For seven of the twelve hospitals involved, we found a statistically significant price increase for hip surgery, for three hospitals we found a significant price decrease. There is no clear relationship between price changes of hip surgery and changes in travelling behaviour of patients post merger. Copyright The Author(s) 2012
D49|Are social preferences related to market performance?|This paper combines laboratory with field data from professional sellers to study whether social preferences are related to performance in open-air markets. The data show that sellers who are more pro-social in a laboratory experiment are also more successful in natural markets: They achieve higher prices for similar quality, have superior trade relations and better abilities to signal trustworthiness to buyers. These findings suggest that social preferences play a significant role for outcomes in natural markets. Copyright Economic Science Association 2012
D49|Monopoly Pricing in the Presence of Social Learning|A monopolist offers a product to a market of consumers with heterogeneous quality preferences. Although initially uninformed about the product quality, they learn by observing past purchase decisions and reviews of other consumers. Our goal is to analyze the social learning mechanism and its effect on the seller's pricing decision. This analysis borrows from the literature on social learning and on pricing and revenue management. Consumers follow a naive decision rule and, under some conditions, eventually learn the product's quality. Using mean-field approximation, the dynamics of this learning process are characterized for markets with high demand intensity. The relationship between the price and the speed of learning depends on the heterogeneity of quality preferences. Two pricing strategies are studied: a static price and a single price change. Properties of the optimal prices are derived. Numerical experiments suggest that pricing strategies that account for social learning may increase revenues considerably relative to strategies that do not.

D49|Motivated Sellers & Predatory Buyers|We develop an equilibrium search model of the housing market where sellers may become distressed as they are unable to sell. A unique steady state equilibrium exists where distressed sellers attempt fire sales by accepting prices that are substantially below fundamental values. During periods where a large number of sellers are forced to liquidate customers exhibit predation: they hold off purchasing and strategically slow down the speed of trade, which in turn causes more sellers to become distressed. From sellers' point of view liquidity disappears when it is needed the most. The model naturally suggests several proxies of liquidity. Interestingly, the expected time on the market, one of the most frequently used statistics in the literature, does a poor job within the context of fire sales and predation.
D49|Responses of European competition policy to the challenges of the global economic crisis|European competition policy has been one of the common policies since the beginning of European integration. The European level economic policy coordination and the customs union have required a uniform framework for competition policy covering the whole Community. Nowadays the economic integration of Europe is suffering from its biggest crisis ever, which also affects companies based and/or operating in Europe. This brings about new challenges for common competition policy as it has to assure, on one hand, a legal framework to maintain fair competition. The importance of cooperation between competition authorities, for example in the field of restrictive agreements, has been recognised by the European Commission. The Commission, on the other hand, has to deal with an increasing number of merger cases because, after the decline of the number of cases in 2008 and 2009, concentrations have started to intensify again. This is due to the recovery of companies in 2010 and the relaunch of lending activity. Also, competition policy has to stimulate markets as it is also a way to put the European economy on a growing path. Much more emphasis should be put on state aid because it does not only spur economic growth but it could have negative effects as well. This type of excessive spending is problematic in the sense of competition policy and it could eventually even worsen the long term economic perspectives of Europe. The crisis in Europe escalated three years ago. I summarise the legal development and guidelines relating to competition policy after 2008. I examine the block exemption schemes and the extended state aid activities. These are developments that may contribute to the recovery from the crisis. It is essentially important to shape competition policy so that it effectively guards companies’ adaptation process to the new economic circumstances, and stimulates their economic activity.
D49|Higher Quality Exhaustible Resource Deposits Receiving Higher Or Lower Resource Rents In A Simple Spatial Framework|"Kolstad's (1994) model of intertemporal, competitive supply to a linear market from two distinct exhaustible resource deposits admits two different interior solutions - one with the low cost deposit ""earning"" the higher resource rent and the other with the low cost deposit ""earning"" the lower resource rent. This latter outcome turns on the initial size of the low cost deposit being significantly larger than the high cost deposit. We infer then that size can trump quality in the determination of the resource rent for a deposit, when geography is explicit."
D49|The Law and Economics of Enhancing Cartel Enforcement: Using Information From Non-Cartel Investigations to Prosecute Cartels|I present the following proposal: information revealed during non-cartel investigations by competition law enforcement authorities, such as evaluation of mergers and acquisitions (M&As) or investigation of monopolization (dominance) conduct, should be directly used to investigate and prosecute cartels. Currently, in several jurisdictions, information acquired in, for example, an M&As investigation typically cannot be directly used for a cartel case due to the underlying statutes and the legal and administrative procedures that govern information use. Reviewing the management and corporate strategy literature, I note that M&As form a vital part of firms core business strategy, with the longer-run strategic aspects being more important. These longer-run strategies could be jeopardized if the firms were engaging in collusion, as the likelihood of detection and prosecution would increase under the proposed rule change, which would punish bad (collusive) behavior. I argue that irrespective of exactly how many cartels are actually prosecuted via this channel, the proposal has the likelihood of creating a meaningful deterrent effect. I also discuss the potential downsides related to Type 1 errors and administrative costs. Overall, I argue that the proposed rule change could increase the efficiency and effectiveness of cartel enforcement, and open an additional front in the fight against hardcore cartels that operate within jurisdictions as well as internationally.
D49|We develop a sequential trade model of Iceberg order execution in a limit order book. The Iceberg-trader has the freedom to expose his trading intentions or (partially) shield the true order size against other market participants. Order exposure can cause drastic market reactions (â€œmarket impactâ€ ) in the end leading to higher transaction costs. On the other hand the Iceberg trader faces a loss-in-priority when he hides his intentions, as most electronic limit order books penalize the usage of hidden liquidity. Thus the Iceberg-trader is faced with the problem to find the right trade-off. Our model provides optimal exposure strategies for Iceberg traders in limit order book markets. In particular, we provide a range of analytical statements that are in line with recent empirical findings on the determinants of traderâ€™s exposure strategies. In this framework, we also study the market impact also market impact of limit orders. We provide optimal exposure profiles for a range of hightech stocks from the US S&P500 and how they scale with the state-of-the-book. We finally test the Icebergâ€™s performance against the limit orders and find that Iceberg orders can significantly enhance trade performance by up to 60%|No abstract is available for this item.
D49|Equilibrium Wage and Employment Dynamics in a Model of Wage Posting without Commitment|A rich but tractable variant of the Burdett-Mortensen model of wage setting behavior is formulated and a dynamic market equilibrium solution to the model is defined and characterized. In the model, firms cannot commit to wage contracts. Instead, the Markov perfect equilibrium to the wage setting game, characterized by Coles (2001), is assumed. In addition, firm recruiting decisions, firm entry and exit, and transitory firm productivity shocks are incorporated into the model. Given that the cost of recruiting workers is proportional to firm employment, we establish the existence of an equilibrium solution to the model in which wages are not contingent on firm size but more productive employers always pay higher wages. Although the state space, the distribution of workers over firms, is large in the general case, it reduces to a scalar that can be interpreted as the unemployment rate in the special case of homogenous firms. Furthermore, the equilibrium is unique. As the dimension of the state space is equal to the number of firms types in general, an (approximate) equilibrium is computable.
D49|Competition In The Banking System Of Republic Of Moldova|The banking system is one of the financial market segments which plays an important role in the financial circuit both at the country level and as a component of the international financial system. Developing a competitive banking system allows to avoid monopoly situations creating the possibility for each bank to be oriented to a certain range of services and products provided willing to increase continuously their quality and attractiveness. The dynamic analysis of effective competition in the domestic banking system would allow determination of factors with negative influence on the rate of participation of each bank in the total bank portfolio items, and also the possibility of reviewing the financial policies pursued in the banking sector. Study of bank system competition is a topic of interest both for financial analysts, and for authorities, given the opportunities arising: qualitative assessment of competition in the banking sector, verifying in which way the regulations in force have influenced the dynamics of competition, measuring the intensity of competition in the banking sector, detection, based on statistical analysis of competitive situation, of the main qualitative types (categories) of financial institutions active in the financial market. Moldova's banking system, according to the results obtained by analyzing the competition, has a moderate competition, even if it is obvious its increasing trend. Banking policies, trends in international financial markets, internationalization of capital markets affect the position of the banking system on domestic financial market, implicitly calculating the contribution of each bank in the formation of the portfolio: bank assets, total regulatory capital, the volume of loans and deposits.
D49|Market integration, competitiveness and efficiency in urban vs. rural markets: male and female flower trading farms in West Bengal|[This paper seeks to measure the magnitude of inter temporal and spatial variations in the prices of flower crop between same type of marketing institutions as well as different types of marketing institutions and to assess the competitiveness and efficiency of marketing in the rural and urban trade markets of flower crops in West Bengal in Indian context where female act as important marketing agents. This study suggests that trade market for most of flower crops are not efficient in the area we studied. However, price per unit for all flower crops is lower in village level markets, and female marketing agents offer lower price for all flower crops in all types of markets. Also, the marketing efficiency for some flower crops is somewhat higher for female marketing agents
D49|Privatising Bratislava: Small Airport - Big Problem|In the paper we describe genezis of decentralisation and corporatisation of airport sector in the Slovak Republic to reveal circumstances influencing expected decision about Bratislava airport privatisation in 2011. Special attention is devoted to unmasking the political umbrella of process in which - as it is known from other privatisation cases worldwide - there is not sufficient space for expert opinions and judgment. We confront various attitudes regarding to Bratislava Airport privatisation. We also explain Bratislava Airport privatisation in light of overall privatisation status of Slovakian airports. In quantitative way we compare Bratislava Airport performance with the main competitor Vienna Airport that is very often seen as the key problem of Bratislava Airport privatisation with regard to overlapping catchment areas of the airports. Comparison of economic performance, as well as airport charges of both airports is made in the paper. The paper does not try to identify the best privatisation arrangement for Bratislava Airport as it is primarily focused on documenting perplexity and intricacy of privatisation of a small airport that could be a big problem and fiscalized matter.In the paper also some considerations are made with regard to some airports competition issues.

D49|The Pricing of the Option Implicitly Granted by the Italian Treasury to the Specialists in the Reserved Auction Reopening|The Italian Treasury selects a group of Specialists within the Government securities primary market participants. They benefit from a set of obligations and privileges. Academic literature paid scant attention to the privilege of participation in reserved auction reopenings, i.e. the right to buy predetermined additional quantities of Government securities at the auction price. This paper attempts to price this privilege as a call option in the framework of the Cox - Ingersoll - Ross model. No matter the one-day life, it has a value significantly different from zero. Moreover, it helps to explain part of the mispricing between the primary and secondary market.
D49|Structure of Markets and Prices in Agriculture|Using primary household survey data, this paper attempts to study the market structure and price behaviour for major crops in Punjab and Bihar. As expected, Punjab farmers were highly commercial, producing more than four-fifth of their output for the market. Bihar farmers, on the other hand, were still subsistence-oriented producing more than half their output for self-consumption. The price index, however, ruled out any discrimination against marginal or small farmers in both states. Significant variables determining marketed surplus in the regression analysis were output, farm and family size, market channels, etc. The factors determining farm price were marketed surplus/value of output, prevalence of credit and availability of formal market channels. The findings of the study present a contrasting picture of two states whereby agricultural marketing in Punjab is in an advanced stage while Biharâ€™s agricultural marketing set-up is still evolving.

D49|Exploiting Naivete about Self-Control in the Credit Market| We analyze contract choices, loan-repayment behavior, and welfare in a model of a competitive credit market when borrowers have a taste for immediate gratification. Consistent with many credit cards and subprime mortgages, for most types of nonsophisticated borrowers the baseline repayment terms are cheap, but they are also inefficiently front loaded and delays require paying large penalties. Although credit is for future consumption, nonsophisticated consumers overborrow, pay the penalties, and back load repayment, suffering large welfare losses. Prohibiting large penalties for deferring small amounts of repayment--akin to recent regulations in the US credit-card and mortgage markets--can raise welfare. (JEL D14, D18, D49, D86)
D49|Motivated Sellers in the Housing Market|We present a search-and-matching model of the housing market where potential buyers' willingness to pay is private information and sellers may become desperate as they are unable to sell. A unique steady state equilibrium exists where desperate sellers offer sizeable price cuts and sell faster. If the number of distressed sales rises then even relaxed sellers are forced to lower their prices. Buyers, on the other hand, become more selective and search longer for better deals. The model yields a theoretical density function of the time-to-sale, which is positively skewed and may be hump-shaped. These results are consistent with recent empirical findings.
D49|Explaining the Favorite-Long Shot Bias: Is it Risk-Love or Misperceptions?| The favorite-long shot bias describes the long-standing empirical regularity that betting odds provide biased estimates of the probability of a horse winning: long shots are overbet whereas favorites are underbet. Neoclassical explanations of this phenomenon focus on rational gamblers who overbet long shots because of risk-love. The competing behavioral explanations emphasize the role of misperceptions of probabilities. We provide novel empirical tests that can discriminate between these competing theories by assessing whether the models that explain gamblers' choices in one part of their choice set (betting to win) can also rationalize decisions over a wider choice set, including compound bets in the exacta, quinella, or trifecta pools. Using a new, large-scale data set ideally suited to implement these tests, we find evidence in favor of the view that misperceptions of probability drive the favorite-long shot bias, as suggested by prospect theory.

D49|THE IMPORTANCE OF PROMOTING ETHICAL PRINCIPLES IN MARKETING (Romanian version)|Consuming is part of the everyday life. The development of contemporary society allows an unprecedented growth of the volume of goods and services, sharpening competition. In these circumstances, marketing practices have become an indispensible utility for informing consumers, promoting offers and increasing sales volume. Commercial publicity went beyond the boundaries of informing, often becoming aggressive, deceiving, manipulating consumers, violating their rights and freedom. As a counterweight, consumer protection associations and governmental institutions were constituted and they dictated an ethical code of consumption and a legislation to protect the citizens’ fundamental rights and freedom in their consumer capacity. The Romanian legislation was gradually harmonized and it is now according to the one protecting European consumers. The problem of ethics in commercial and marketing practices is in the pipeline in all the states of the European Union, including Romania, where a breach in the rules is noticeditura Through the study accomplished in this article we decided to emphasize the opinion of Romanian consumers in the N-E Region regarding the importance of complying with the ethics of marketing principles and highlighting the most common violation of these principles in commercial activities.
D49|Appraisal on End Products and Services Offered by Islamic Banks from Maqasid Shari’ah Perspective|Question arises whether the products and services offered by the Islamic financial institutions (IFIs) genuinely meeting the requirement of Shari’ah. At present, not only Shari’ah advisors have been appointed to scrutinize and endorse the new products and services. In fact, majority of the IFIs have established units or departments to ensure the documentations, legal and Shari’ah framework, the process and procedure, and implementation are in line with the precept of Shari’ah. IFIs not only must avoid riba, but as well as other important elements such as gharar, deception, inequality, duress in developing and executing the end products of IFIs in order to ensure justice and social welfare prevail. This could only be achieved if the products and services approved uphold the importance of Maqasid Shari’ah. This paper will evaluate the key value chain in product approval process, role of Shari’ah advisor in approving products and services in IFIs as well as to raise possible issues and challenges related to the value chain. This paper will also look into the importance of Maqasid Shari’ah in product approval process as it is a vital element to be considered so as to avoid legal conflicts, litigation risk, instability (reputational risk) to the IFIs, tarnish the image of so called Shari’ah compliance products, uphold justice (contracting parties) and more importantly the pure teaching of Islam.

D49|The 'Right' Price for Art Collectibles. A Quantile Hedonic Regression Investigation of Picasso Paintings|Different art objects are likely to be priced by means of different systems of hedonic characteristics; more precisely, different evaluation procedures for high and low price items are often postulated. However, the empirical evidence on this point is scant. The main purpose of this paper is to fill this gap by using the quantile hedonic regression approach. The empirical evidence, based on a data set of 716 Picasso paintings sold at auction worldwide, highlights the critical role of the price classes in determining the evaluation criteria of art items.

D49|Haben und nicht haben. Eine Analyse der Wertschätzung von Weihnachtsgeschenken in Deutschland|Using German survey data, this paper show that the valuation of Christmas gifts varies considerably among the gift receivers. Whether the gifts are associated with an efficiency loss, as some empirical studies for the US conclude, depends however on the particular question posed to gift recipients. Asked about their willingness to pay, recipients indicate that Christmas gifts are indeed associated with an efficiency loss, while we find an efficiency gain when asking about their willingness to accept. The results suggest that objects are valued more highly, once they have become part of the endorsement of the gift recipient.
D49|Fairness, price stickiness, and history dependence in decentralized trade|The paper investigates price formation in a decentralized market with random matching. Agents are assumed to have subdued social preferences: buyers, for example, prefer a lower price to a higher one but experience reduced utility increases below a reference price that serves as a common fairness benchmark. The strategic equilibrium reflects market fundamentals, but it is markedly less sensitive to the buyer-seller ratio near the fair price benchmark. Prices may be sticky around very different reference levels in markets with otherwise identical fundamentals. The implied history dependence turns out to be mitigated rather than exacerbated by friction.
D49|El mercado de insumos: una mirada desde el comportamiento estratégico de las firmas|El análisis del mercado de factores no es un tema usual en los cursos convencionales demicroeconomía y cuando se aborda no se explican las motivaciones de las firmas al momento detomar su decisión de compra de insumos. En contraste, se presentan amplias discusiones dirigidasa interpretar mecanismos de elección de las empresas en la producción y comercialización debienes, en contextos oligopólicos y monopólicos. Este trabajo propone una reflexión del problema,a partir de instrumentos similares a los utilizados habitualmente para entender las motivaciones deuna firma cuando determina sus decisiones estratégicas en mercados de bienes finales.
D49|El poder de mercado bajo el nuevo diseño del Pool eléctrico Español|During 2006 and 2007, by means of the Royal Decree Law 3/2006, the Royal Decree 1634/2006 and the Order ITC/400/2007, several changes were introduced in the running of the wholesale electricity market in Spain. One of the objectives of these measures was to diminish the market power in the industry. This chapter intends to measure this market power by the difference between observed wholesale market prices and estimates of competitive benchmark price. This methodology has been used previously in the United Kingdom and California (Sweeting (2007) and Boresntein et al. (2002)), but has not been used so far in the electricity generation industry in Spain. The market power is reduced in the second quarter of 2006, but it increased again in the third quarter of 2007 and reached levels similar to the ones at the beginning of 2004 (0.43)
D49|Industry concentration in South African manufacturing industry: Trends and consequences, 1972-96|This paper examines industry concentration for the South African manufacturing sector over the 1972-1996 period, for the three digit industry classification. The paper notes both the high level of industry concentration in South African manufacturing, and a rising trend in concentration across a wide range of industries. The paper further explores the impact that industry concentration has on a wide range of indicators of industry performance. We find that increased concentration serves to lower output growth, raise unit labour costs, and to lower labour productivity. The impact on employment, total factor productivity and investment rates based on bivariate examinations of the data are ambiguous. The paper concludes by examining the impact of concentration on employment and investment rates using a dynamic heterogeneous panel estimation methodology. We find that increased concentration unambiguously lowers employment. For investment rates, increased inequality of market share serves to raise investment rates, while falling firm numbers for any given inequality of market share lowers investment rates. The difference can be interpreted as the distinct impact that the pursuit of managerial objectives (large market share promoting further productive capacity expansion) and that market contestability (under falling numbers of firms in an industry, monopolistic incentives to curtail productive capacity rise) have on investment.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D49|Price Dispersion in the Online Auction Markets|Along the standard measures of price dispersion, this paper proposes a new method, the residual variance model, to examine the levels of price and price variation within and across 10 kinds of physically identical products on eBay UK. The results find that the price levels and price dispersions on eBay are lower than the ones reported in the prior literature regarding other online markets, but the ’law of one price’ has not prevailed in any sample category. It further suggests an important interaction between the extent of price dispersion and the heterogeneities of consumers and sellers.
D49|Product Innovation and Survival in a High-Tech Industry|We investigate the relationship between product innovation and firm survival for a sample of 121 firms in a high-tech industry. We find that location near the technological frontier is an important determinant of fim survival. Firms located near the frontier are also more likely to be acquired than to exit by failure if they cannot survive. This suggests that product location in the technology space acts as a signal of firm quality. Possessing a substantial stock of intangible capital, on the other hand, determines neither exit via failure nor exit via acquisition, although it increases the probability of surviving.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D49|Entrepreneurial Behavior and the Development of Trading Institutions: An Analytical Approach|This paper makes explicit the role of the entrepreneur in a consumer-producer economy. Entrepreneurial behavior changes the status quo by altering existing comparative advantages. A positive feedback effect with trading institutions ensues. This model shows how the entrepreneur can, when successful, create economic growth but if unsuccessful, can contribute to an economic contraction. Using our theoretical approach, propositions are generated that explain empirical observations of entrepreneurship. This framework offers a tool for future analytical and empirical investigations into entrepreneurship in a systematic way.
D49|Chinatown Revisited: Owens Valley and Los Angeles--Bargaining Costs and Fairness Perceptions of the First Major Water Rights Exchange|" I examine a complicated bargaining problem in the acquisition of private land and water rights by Los Angeles in Owens Valley. This is a pivotal episode in the political economy of contemporary western water. More broadly, Owens Valley provides empirical evidence on how the gains from exchange were divided among the parties and how equity concerns shaped the process and succeeding assessment of market allocation. Negotiations for key properties took place within a bilateral monopoly context, and the bargaining strategies of both parties raised the transaction costs of exchange and formed fairness perceptions about the outcome of the exchange. I analyze the bargaining environment and estimate the determinants of when properties sold and the prices paid for land and water. Farmers who colluded did better by selling the properties than if they had remained in agriculture. Their ""cartels,"" however, were not strong enough to secure more of the surplus from reallocating water from agriculture to urban demand. Most of the gains went to Los Angeles landowners, and this is a source of the notion of water ""theft"" that continues today. (JEL D02, D23, D49, D74, K11, L13, N52, Q15, Q25) The Author 2008.

D49|Concepts of price fairness: Empirical research into the Dutch coffee market|This paper researches perceptions of the concept of price fairness in the Dutch coffee market. We distinguish four alternative standards of fair prices based on egalitarian, basic rights, capitalistic and libertarian approaches. We investigate which standards are guiding the perceptions of price fairness of citizens and coffee trade organizations. We find there is a divergence in views between citizens and key players in the coffee market. Whereas citizens support the concept of fairness derived from the basic rights approach, holding that the price should provide coffee farmers with a minimum level of subsistence, representatives of Dutch coffee traders hold the capitalistic view that the free world market price is fair.
D49|Market structure, counterparty risk, and systemic risk|Networks modeling bilaterally-cleared and centrally-cleared derivatives markets are shown to yield economically different price impact, volatility and contagion after an initial bankruptcy. A large bankruptcy in bilateral markets may leave a counterparty unable to expectationally prevent bankruptcy (checkmate) or make counterparties push markets and profit from contagion (hunting). In distress, bilateral markets amplify systemic risk and volatility versus centralized markets and are more subject to crises with real effects: contagion, unemployment, reduced tax revenue, higher transactions costs, lower risk sharing, and reduced allocative efficiency. Pricing distress volatility may suggest when to transition to central clearing. The model suggests three metrics for the well-connected part of a market -- number of counterparties, average risk aversion, and standard deviation of total exposure -- may characterize its fragility.
D49|Satisfaction and Disappointment in Consumer Choices|This article investigates the role emotions play in economic decisions. In a computer based experiment our participants were the consumers of a fictitious service bearing resemblance to that offered by mobile phone operators. In each of 17 rounds a participant had to choose between retaining the current supplier or changing it with a competitor, based on information about expected and actual prices to be paid. We recorded participants’ self-assessed satisfaction or disappointment on a psychometric scale. Logit models are used to explain and predict individual choices based on prices, previous decisions, and emotions. Our findings show that prediction of choice is significantly better if information about the participants’ emotions is considered. We analyse how disrupted satisfaction treadmills make people feel disappointed at the face of financial discount and mildly satisfied when they have to pay more than expected.
D49|Payment Systems in Malaysia: Recent Developments and Issues|Payment systems in Malaysia have been undergoing changes in recent years. Among the notable changes is the emergence of electronic-based payment systems. The central bank has been playing an active role in shaping the development of payment systems, particularly in the gradual introduction of electronic-based payment schemes, in the belief that these have the potential to increase efficiency in the economy as whole. The active introduction of e-payment instruments has increased both the value and volume of transactions per capita use of e-payment instruments in recent years. Checks continue to be the major payment instrument, however. Small- and medium-sized enterprises could benefit tremendously from the use of e-payment schemes through more efficient business operations, cost reductions, enhanced security and wider payment channel choice. Noted improvements have also resulted from the introduction of large-value payment systems, such as the payment versus payment infrastructure for the settlement of Malaysian ringgit (RM)-United States (US) dollar (US$) foreign exchange trades and the delivery versus payment settlement for US dollar securities that are issued, deposited and traded in Malaysia. The development of the domestic payment system is becoming more important in the development of a deep and active domestic financial market that promotes financial market stability and the reinvestment of savings in the country. Closer financial market integration in the region and closer cooperation and policy coordination among the monetary authorities in the region is becoming increasingly important. Eight years after implementation in Malaysia, the e-payment schemes should be studied to assess any economic benefits they may have provided.
D49|Price Dispersion with Directed Search| We present a model that generates empirically plausible price distributions in directed search equilibrium. There are many identical buyers and many identical capacity-constrained sellers who post prices. These prices can be renegotiated to some degree and the outcome depends on the number of buyers who want to purchase the good. In equilibrium all sellers post the same price, demand is randomly distributed, and there is sale price dispersion. Prices and distributions depend on market tightness and on the properties of renegotiation outcomes. In a labor market context, the model generates a strong empirical prediction. if workers can renegotiate the posted wage, then the model predicts a positively skewed and realistic-looking density function of realized wages when the mean number of job-seekers per vacancy is large.

D49|Disloyal Commercial Competition And The Jurisdictional Responsibility In The Romanian And E.U. Law System|The esential element of market economy is competition. Foresights of comercial competition are also included in the treaties made with third party states, which are not part of the EU. Besides that, Romania has taken over several firm obligations regarding competitional policies, even by common European agreement on the 1st of February 1993. In this agreement, the progressive elimination of discrimination between romanian economical agents and commons is being provided for, in matters of supplying and distribution conditions of merchandise. This is one of the few things solved regarding this chapter.
D49|El poder compensador de las cooperativas frente a las prácticas restrictivas de la competencia. Las relaciones entre la mitilicultura y la industria conservera en Galicia|The production of mussels in the Galicia region has been historically characterized by an offer consisting of a large number of producers, while demand was concentrated in a small number of canning companies. Moreover, while canning represents more than half of the demand for mussel farmers, the percentage weight of the mussel in the production of canned food is still modest. In this scenario, prices were clearly favourable to the industry. Since the mid-70's, mussel producers, have made great efforts in building partnerships and sales outlets that have enabled them to create a monopoly of supply to cope with the power of the demand. This is the proof that in times of greatest organizational strength, a stronger growth in prices is achieved, while organizational tensions are quickly exploited by the demand to act in the opposite direction.
D49|Information revelation in markets with pairwise meetings: complete information revelation in dynamic analysis|We study information revelation in markets with pairwise meetings. We focus on the one-sided case and perform a dynamic analysis of a constant entry flow model. The same question has been studied in an identical framework in Serrano and Yosha (1993) but they limit their analysis to the stationary steady states. Blouin and Serrano (2001) study information revelation in a one-time entry model and obtain results different than Serrano and Yosha (1993). We establish that the main difference is not due to the steady state analysis but is due to the differences concerning the entry assumption.

The data included the important corporate red wine brands produced in Australia. Hedonic price functions are estimated for red Australian wines to show how price premia associated with the attributes of wine brands including the grape variety and alcohol content differ by corporate brands. Results show the positive effects on price of highly reputable brands, positive effect of grape variety Shiraz, and premia for alcohol content. (JEL Classification: D49, L15, L66, QII)
D49|Does the study of Kondratieff Cycles help us to know more about the social nature of money?|"Money was, until Keynes and Friedman, the great absence in economic literature. After them, relations between money and long economic cycles have been in their turn absent in debate. Perhaps this conform an explanation for logical and chronological relations between business cycles and long cycles been scarcely explored. Notwithstanding, is in those three directions where a new monetary theory should be researched for. This ought to be a more dynamic one. Thus, economic theory would root to anthropology, showing floating relationship between theories, from former cycle theories to most recent monetary and long cycle ones. Yet we can propose as economic models Porter's diamond, applied to money, and Money Value Chain. The aim is to reflect on a ""social dimension of money"" rather than of monetary policy, evoking the rhythms followed by that perception and the means for managing it, along the long cycle."
D49|"Is There a ""Right"" Charging Principle with the NGN Advent?"|"Historically, telecommunications services developed adding one network to another (voice and data networks), but Next Generation Networks (NGN) are developing as native multiservice networks. Main characteristics include: broadband capacity, IP protocol, ability to transmit voice, data and video, quality control, separation among different network layers. The fact to deliver with one only network different services such as voice and data, now treated in a very different way with respect to charging principles (interconnection for voice, peering for Internet exchanges), poses the problem of the charging model to adopt in the future. In the paper we will analyse pros and cons of the different charging principles, both at wholesale and retail level, from an economic perspective. The first conclusion is that there is no ""magic solution"", as any criteria has pros and cons, but that it appears more appropriate to leave operators to choose their retail models, once the wholesale criteria are settled. Then the paper concentrates on the different scenarios which can arise choosing different charging principles at wholesale level. Particular attention is given to the issues of quality safeguard and of recovering nvestments in innovative networks and services. On many aspects ""intermediate"" scenarios seem better to answer economic problems than the ""pure"" scenarios, (calling party network pays for all wholesale services, including Internet/data, or bill & keep for everything, including voice)."
D49|Measuring and Analyzing the Liquidity of the Italian Treasury Security Wholesale Secondary Market|Although its importance, only recently the issue of liquidity in Treasury markets has received greater attention. We survey the literature about market liquidity and liquidity measures, and we put forward new measures. The aim is to provide a description of the liquidity of the Italian wholesale secondary market, which we describe thoroughly. We apply a large set of measures on a unique dataset, which gives us a complete view of the market. Even though the market provides an amount of liquidity that fits the market needs, the quality of the order book is low, and despite the presence of a large number of market makers, the degree of competition among them is not very high. Moreover, no clear and general relationship emerges between trading and order book measures. Indeed, even though trading activity is higher for on-the-run securities with respect to the off-the-run securities, there is not a sharp difference in terms of liquidity of the order book between them. In this case market regulation plays an important role. Finally, we investigate how long it takes for a new issue to become the benchmark for its segment. Our evidence shows that some modifications of the issuance policy in order to have a larger outstanding since the first auction could help securities in gaining earlier their benchmark status, especially in case of 10-year BTPs.
D49|A Test for Dependence and Covariance Estimator of Market Microstructure Noise|There are many approaches for estimating an integrated variance and covariance in the presence of market microstructure noise. It is important to know a dependence of noise to construct the integrated variance and covariance estimators. We study a time dependence of bivariate noise processes in this paper. We propose a test statistic for the dependence of the noises and an autocovariance estimator of the noises and derive its asymptotic distribution. The asymptotic distribution of the autocovariance estimator provides us to another test statistic which is for significance of the autocovariances and for detection whether the noise exists or not. We obtain good performances of the test statistics and autocovariance estimator of the noises in a finite sample through Monte Carlo simulation. In empirical illustration, we confirm that the proposed statistics and estimators capture various dependence patterns of the market microstructure noises.
D49|Welfare dynamics based on a new concept of inefficient equilibrium|This article has developed a new model of welfare dynamics under imperfect information or imperfect competition by introducing a new concept of ‘inefficient welfare equilibrium’. It assumes that an economy can be split into two virtual parts. For one part the fundamental welfare theorems are valid and for the other part welfare is yet to achieve. This model is enhanced to describe market dynamics where market is not uniform but distributed in layers of energy states. The probability of achieving Pareto efficiency decreases down along the market energy states.
D49|Perceptions of price fairness: An empirical research|This paper researches factors that influence price fairness judgements. The empirical literature suggests several factors: reference prices, the costs of the seller, a self-interest bias and the perceived motive of sellers. Using a Dutch sample, we find empirical evidence that these factors significantly affect perceptions of fair prices. In addition, we find that the perceived fairness of prices is also influenced by other distributional concerns that are independent of the transaction. In particular, price increases are judged to be fairer if they benefit poor people or small organisations rather than benefiting rich people or big organisations.
D49|Relative and individual regulation: An investigation of investment incentives under a cost-plus approach|We analyze the effects of a modified Yardstick competition on firms’ cost-reduction efforts. Departing from the existing literature, we use a relative cost-plus approach: firms are regulated on the basis of other firms’ performances, but they are granted a mark-up and not a lump-sum transfer in order to be compensated for their investments. We show that the cost-reduction effort of a regulated firm is decreasing in the mark-up under relative regulation while it is increasing in the mark-up under individual regulation. Hence, the trade-off between encouraging cost reduction and minimizing prices that the regulator faces under individual cost-plus regulation does not exist under relative cost-plus regulation. We extend our model by including technical spillovers and we investigate their effects on firms’ cost reduction efforts and on the efficiency of the whole industry. Finally, we allow for quality-enhancing investments and study the interplay between them and cost reduction investments under relative cost-plus regulation.
D49|Operationalizing and Measuring Competition: Determinants of Competition in Private Banking Industry in India|Using an appropriate theoretical framework and econometric methodology, the study has sought to measure and model competition in private banking industry in India in an attempt to analyse the process of market dynamics in the industry. The changing scenario of private banking consequent to deregulation provided the motivation behind the study. It used the concept of competition proposed by Stigler (1961) and measured it by Bodenhorn’s (1990) measure of mobility. The study provides a critique of the mechanism of inducing competition, which is implicit in the Narasimham Committee (1991). It then provides the theoretical background of an alternative mechanism based on Structure-Conduct-Performance paradigm, which incorporates basic conditions and strategic groups, apart from including entry, economies of scale, product differentiation and price cost margin, One basic contention of the study is that competition goes beyond “conduct” and encompasses all the four components of S-C-P paradigm: basic conditions, structure, conduct and performance. Accordingly, a three equation simultaneous equation model is used to ultimately estimate the equation of competition through Tobit technique. The result demonstrates that variables related to basic conditions, structure, and conduct and performance influence competition. The study has found evidence against the simplistic relationship between concentration and competition, which remained implicit in the literature. The study also developed a methodology to arrive at market form from an analysis of three aspects of a market and concludes that private banking industry in India is characterized by monopolistic competition.
D49|Theoretical Framework Of Competition As Applied To Banking Industry|Concepts evolve through time and over time they assume different meanings. The concept of competition is no exception. This paper discusses the evolution of the concept of competition in general with a view to derive a theoretical framework for analyzing competition in banking industry. Starting from the classical notions of competition it proceeds to some of the latest approaches (Northcott (2004), Neuberger (1998), Toolsema (2003), Bolt and Tieman (2001)). The ordinary Structure-Conduct-Performance approach does not involve any analysis of market dynamics. Our approach introduces various aspects of industry dynamics and growth. It provides a methodology to arrive at the market form in banking industry through an analysis of all the aspects of basic conditions, structure, conduct and performance. It is argued that sustained growth and dynamics of the industry is not price led. Growth arises out of changing basic conditions and dynamics arises out of sharing the new market created by basic conditions. Hence the prime mover of competition is rivalry among firms to control market share and to internalize externalities rather than adjustments brought about by the price mechanism.
D49|The Impact of Housing Market Segmentation between Tourists and Residents on the Hedonic Price for Landscape Quality|Market segmentation is an important issue when estimating the implicit price for an environmental amenity from a surrogate market like property. This paper tests the hypothesis of a segmentation of the housing market between tourists and residents and computes the implicit price for natural landscape quality in Swiss alpine resorts. The results show a clear segmentation between both groups of consumers, although tests also show that the estimated coefficient for landscape is similar in the tourists’ model and in the residents’. However, since the functional form is non linear, the nominal – rather than relative - value of a change in natural landscape quality is higher in the tourist housing market than in the residents’. Hence, considering the segmentation of the market between tourists and residents is essential in order to provide valid estimates of the nominal implicit price of natural landscape quality.
D49|Autochthon vs. blended wines: Do objective and sensory characteristics matter?|There are many types of wines. Wine may be classified as traditional such as Barbaresco or Barolo (among the others), or international, such as the case of Merlot, Sauvignon, etc. Do objective and sensory characteristics impact di?erently on prices according to the wine variety? Using a sample of 3,660 observations, an hedonic technique is applied to investigate this question.
D49|The Formation of the Tibetan State Religion: The Geluk School 1419-1642|Monopolistic competition of Tibetan Buddhism by the eleventh-twelfth century allowed for many schools and sects to develop with little differentiation in religious products. The rise of the Ming dynasty (1368-1424) represented a significant shift in Yuan foreign policy toward Tibetan affairs. Ming disengagement of China in Tibet translated into a liberalization of local politics with one major pattern emerging: a shift from secular politics and clan wealth to ecclesiastical monastic institutions. The Geluk sect formed during this period, successfully introducing superior technology in its organizational characteristics (celibacy, ordained abbots, casuistical adherence, scholastic training and doctrinal orthodoxy). The club model formation of the Gelukpa distinguished it from other schools and sects, reinforcing the technological superiority of its organization. With the loss of its major Tibetan patron, the Gelukpa facing extinction by its fiercest competitor, the Karmapa, raised the stakes by introducing the incarnate position of the Dalai Lama and his labrang (financial estate). The introduction of the incarnate Dalai Lama represented a technological improvement in that the Gelukpa could now directly compete for wealthy patrons with their fiercest competitor, the Karmapa. By forming an alliance with a foreign power (Mongols), the Gelukpa were willing to use extreme violence to become the state religion.
D49|Agricultural sector and competition in Colombia|In this chapter we provide a summary description of Colombian Competition Policy with an emphasis on the agricultural sector. Key developments and recent changes in institutional arrangements affecting competition policy, as it applies to the agricultural sector, are highlighted. Illustrative case studies are depicted to show the richness and complexity of policy developments and enforcement. Some general conclusions are drawn from this examination.
D49|A generalized index of market power|This paper analyses two approaches to measuring market power-the commonly used Lerner index and a range of exploitation measures-. Itis argued that the Lerner index is designed to quantify market power fromthe supply side and the exploitation measures are designed to quantify marketpower from the demand side, and that the two approaches do not always behavein a symmetric way, since they do not always have the same bounds. To sortout these potentially undesirable properties, this paper proposes a new generalindex to measure market power, which is symmetrical in the sense that it isbounded between zero and one, regardless of whether the market power comesfrom the supply or the demand side. The index proposed allows for the presenceof more than one firm and for the existence of conjectural variations.*******************************************************************************************************************Este documento analiza dos enfoques para medir poder de mercado-el frecuentemente utilizado índice de Lerner y un conjunto de medidas de explotación-. Se argumenta que el índice de Lerner está diseñado para cuantificarel poder de mercado por el lado de la oferta y que las medidas de explotaciónestán diseñadas para cuantificar el poder de mercado por el lado de la demanda,y que esos dos enfoques no siempre tienen los mismos límites. Paracorregir estas propiedades potencialmente no deseables, este documento proponeun nuevo índice general para medir poder de mercado, que es simétrico-estando restringido a valores entre cero y uno-, independientemente de si elpoder de mercado proviene del lado de la oferta o de la demanda. El índice propuestopermite la presencia de más de una firma y la existencia de variacionesconjeturales.
D49|Pricing of Scientific Journals and Market Power| We analyze the empirical relationship between journal prices, their quality measured by their citation counts, their age, as well as conduct of publishers. The database covers 22 scientific fields and more than 2,600 of among the most highly reputed and cited journals in 2003. We show that (a) for-profit journals charge roughly 3 times more than journals run by scientific societies; (b) the number of citations has a positive impact on prices; (c) there are large differences in prices across fields that vary by a factor between 1 and 6; these are highly (and positively) correlated with the degree of concentration in the industry.

D49|Liquidity and Arbitrage in Options Markets: A Survival Analysis Approach| This paper examines the determinants of the time it takes for an index options market to return to no arbitrage values after put-call parity deviations, using intraday transactions data from the French index options market. We employ survival analysis to characterize how limits to arbitrage influence the expected duration of arbitrage deviations. After controlling for conventional limits to arbitrage, we show that liquidity-linked variables are associated with a faster reversion of arbitrage profits. The introduction of an Exchange Traded Fund also affects the survival rates of deviations, but this impact essentially stems from the reduction in the level of potential arbitrage profits.

D49|Learning by Investing: Evidence from Venture Capital|To understand the investment behavior of venture capital (VC) investors, this paper estimates a dynamic model of learning. Behavior reflecting both learning from past investments (exploitation) and anticipated future learning (exploration) are found to be prevalent, and the model's additional predictions about success rates and investment speeds are confirmed empirically. Learning is important, since it can create informational frictions, and it has potential implications for VCs' investments and organizations. VCs are found to internalize the value of learning, and this may help promote exploration beyond the levels sustained in standard capital markets, which is socially valuable.
D49|Visualization of competitive market structure by means of choice data|This paper presents a method for visualizing competitive market structures based on scanner panel data where asymmetries are taken into account. For this, I combined consumer choice models based on mixed logit models with three-mode principal component analysis. This approach can be used to unfold a competitive market structure map. The methodology presented is able to quantify the clout and receptivity of various brands. The results can then be visualized over time. Using this approach, guidelines for promotional activities of new brands can be provided, and possible threats from the competition detected.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D49|Test of Unbiasedness of the Integrated Covariance Estimation in the Presence of Noise|The cumulative covariance estimator in Hayashi and Yoshida (2005b) which suits for non-synchronous observations possibly has a bias in the presence of the observational noise. We propose the test statistic to detect whether the observational noise causes a measurable bias in the estimator of Hayashi and Yoshida (2005b). The test statistic proposed in this paper is asymptotically distributed as standard normal under null hypothesis. The finite sample performance of the test statistic is investigated through Monte Carlo simulation.

D49|Perception of market and pricing among the sixteenth century Muslim scholars|The present paper investigates the perception of market and mechanism of pricing among the sixteenth century Muslim scholars, a period hitherto unexplored. In the commencement it briefly states the insufficient attention that the subject of market – the most fundamental element of Economics – has received in the conventional economics. To set a proper perspective it examines the situation in the Islamic tradition in earlier centuries before it studies the understanding of market and pricing among the Muslim scholars of the study period. It also deals with their stand regarding the price regulation. For comparison purpose, it examines the treatment of market and pricing in the work of their contemporary Western scholars. The paper ends with a note on 'just price', one of the most important economic concepts in the medieval period.
D49|Conspicuous consumption in the land of Prince Charming|Conspicuous consumption is a signaling device used to allocate non-market goods (i.e. goods that cannot be traded in markets). In sharp contrast to the existing literature, in our model people do not want to signal wealth but some unobservable traits that, conditional on other observable information, are correlated with wealth. For instance, in order to get non-markets goods like respect, esteem and admiration, people want to signal the talents that generated the wealth, and not the wealth itself. Both the nature of the equilibrium and the policy implications depart dramatically from the literature. More and more papers argue that, because of relative concerns, the government should redistribute heavily. Our model shows that, once taken in a general-equilibrium context, those arguments break down. Furthermore, our model offers explanations beyond the current reach of the literature, like a theory of the natural rate of inequality.
D49|Measuring Quality Change due to Technological Externality in Multi-Feature Service Bundles|Technological innovation, externalities and network effects keep shifting the preference parameters in cellular telecommunication service sector. The paper suggests a framework to model these changes.It notes two channels that affect the service prices (in possibly opposite ways). In each corresponding period, consumer with lower reservation prices are shopping for the services. But these reservation prices are going up due to complementarity/ network effects. Under some reasonable assumptions on industry and cost structure, market data can be used to identify these changes. A price index is suggested that decomposes service bundle price changes into the change in price for same-quality of service and change in quality of the service bundle. Some interesting properties of these indexes are also discussed.
D49|Za obzor neoklasické ekonomie: cesta k principům nové institucionální ekonomie<BR>[Beyond the horizon of neoclassical economics: navigation to principles of the new institutional economics]|This paper starts with discussion about enhanced and frequently used conceptions of free markets, market failures and market primacy. There are pointed some simplifications due to the man should be prospective while using them, especially in applied economics. We have no positive definition of a free market and it is not clear, how often and if any we can observe such market about us. Troubles with market failures are derived from different meanings in different schools of economic thought. The market primacy is an abstract concept more than historical fact. Because of such difficulties the paper is inscribed to institutional alternative which is able to evolve complex research of institutions and to involve useful aspects of neoclassical economics. Useful ground for this analysis is institutional individualism which defines program for research of institutional framework of economy.
D49|Hedonic Housing Price Indices: The Turinese Experience|This study presents the methodology used by the Agenzia del territorio to produce real-estate indices for the analysis of the housing market in the Turinese area districts. The importance of an index is highlighted by the fact that a significant percentage of national wealth is the property sector. To this end, we use a rich and detailed database on transaction prices which allows us to study the dynamics of the residential housing market through the estimation of hedonic price indexes for Turin. This study carried out an hedonic methodology, not yet applied in Italy, on data collected and aggregates in homogeneous areas for the city of Turin. The results obtained appear to be of valid significance in the ratios, also in terms of values. Home price increased 40 percent from first semester of 2003 through the second semester of 2007.
D49|Competição e Concentração entre os Bancos Brasileiros|This paper analysis the relationship between market structure and competitiveness in the Brazilian banking industry. First, it quantifies competitiveness by using the statistic-H proposed by Panzar & Rosse and evaluates its relationship with several concentration statistics: Herfindahl-Hirschman, Concentration Ratio, Hall-Tideman and Theil. The concentration indexes lead concentration in CR10 (assets and deposits), while the concentration of credit reduces. There is a monopolistic competition among Brazilian banks. The relationship between competitiveness and concentration is negative and significant.

D49|Information revelation in markets with pairwise meetings: dynamic case with constant entry flow|We study information revelation in markets with pairwise meetings. We focus on the one sided case and perform a dynamic analysis of a constant entry ﬂow model. The same question has been studied in an identical framework in Serrano and Yosha (1993) but they limit their analysis to the stationary steady states. Blouin and Serrano (2001) study information revelation in a one-time entry model and obtain results different than Serrano and Yosha (1993). We show that there is dramatically loss when restricting the analysis of a constant ﬂow entry model to stationary steady states. Nevertheless, we show that this loss might not explain completely the difference in the results presented in the two papers.

D49|What Determines Wine Prices: Objective vs. Sensory Characteristics|The hedonic technique is applied to wines. In the price equation we include objective characteristics appearing on the label, as well as sensory characteristics and a grade assigned by expert tasters. We have three almost identically structured data sets (two on Bordeaux wines, and one on Burgundy wines). The results are used to make comparisons between two of the most important wine regions in France, and comparisons over time (the two Bordeaux data sets are sampled at different points in time).

D49|Market characteristics and chaos dynamics in stock markets: an international comparison|The chaos theory assumes that the returns dynamics are not normally distributed and more complex approaches have to be used to study these time series. In fact, the Fractal Market Hypothesis assumes that the returns dynamics are not independent of the investors’ attitudes and represent the result of the interaction of traders who, frequently, adopt different investment styles. The studies proposed in literature try to identify the best approach to define the fractal dimension using, in particular, data of highly developed financial markets where a more complete set of information is available and the price determination mechanism is more efficient. A fault found with these approaches is that the results do not allow making out if there is a relationship between fractal dimension and market characteristics and, besides, it is hard to understand which aspects are more relevant in the definition of the fractal market dimension. In fact, previous studies analysed market liquidity for a limited number of countries and no other aspects related to market transactions have been considered. Using a large sample of world stock indexes, I try to identify the main market characteristics that influence returns dynamics. This study, carried out having recourse to the Rescaled Range Analysis (R/S) approach, shows that markets characteristic, like liquidity, type of admissible orders and so on, influence the R/S capability to study returns dynamics.
D49|Ropa a jej postavenie v globalizácii svetového hospodárstva<BR>[Oil and its position in the process of globalization of the world economy]|This study is devoted to analysis of different aspects of world oil market development and its role in further growth of individual national economies, especially in connection with the ever intensifying globalization process. The study shows individual aspects and parts of the oil market, be it production and consumption of crude oil, its territorial dislocation, including EU, and also an analysis of the impact that has the development of oil consumption on economical results of individual national economies. In the first place it analyses the connections with the growth of competition ability of companies. Further research is devoted to the establishment of crude oil price and to the most important aspects on which depends the price creation process. Supply and demand factors are also analyzed. The study comes to a conclusion that the biggest obstacle in using the crude oil will not be its availability, at least in the short run, but the ever fast increasing price. This high price will enable the use of oil only to such companies and countries that will be able to implement the oil in the production process with very high efficiency. Such conditions satisfy only products and services that are based on unique technical and scientific know-how, with high added value, or in such areas of national economies where the use of oil is unenviable.
D49|Competition over agents with boundedly rational expectations|I study a market model in which profit-maximizing firms compete in multi-dimensional pricing strategies over a consumer, who is limited in his ability to grasp such complicated objects and therefore uses a sampling procedure to evaluate them. Firms respond to increased competition with an increased effort to obfuscate, rather than with more competitive pricing. As a result, consumer welfare is not enhanced and may even deteriorate. Specifically, when firms control both the price and the quality of each dimension, and there are diminishing returns to quality, increased competition implies an efficiency loss which is entirely borne by consumers.
D49|Administered Prices and Consumer Price Index: the Influence of Government’s Decisions on Network Industries and Rental Market Prices|Recent studies analyse the dynamic of administered prices. However, the concept of administered prices is not clearly defined in economic literature, and a common approach is missing. This paper gives a brief description of the reasons for administered prices. Moreover, it focuses on the difference between administered and regulated prices. Two relevant and unsolved cases are analysed: telecommunication network industries and the rental market. A particular emphasis is addressed to the regulatory frameworks within these sectors. It is investigated whether they do affect price behaviours. In conclusion, the paper provides guidelines to identify the impact of the regulatory framework on consumer price indices.
D49|Tying lending and underwriting: Scope economies, incentives, and reputation|Informational economies of scope between lending and underwriting are a mixed blessing for universal banks. While they can reduce the cost of raising capital for a firm, they also reduce incentives in the underwriting business. We show that tying lending and underwriting helps to overcome this dilemma. First, risky debt in tied deals works as a bond to increase underwriting incentives. Second, with limitations on contracting, tying reduces the underwriting rents as the additional incentives from debt can substitute for monetary incentives. In addition, reducing the yield on the tied debt is a means to pay for the rent in the underwriting business and to transfer informational benefits to the client. Thus, tying is a double edged sword for universal banks. It helps to compete against specialized investment banks, but it can reduce the rent to be earned in investment banking when universal banks compete against each other. We derive several empirical predictions regarding the characteristics of tied deals.
D49|Competitiveness of Russian Dairy Sector: Inter-Regional Comparison| In competitive market dairy production will shift to the regions with the best conditions. In the Soviet paradigm dairy production was evenly distributed throughout the country, what was caused by extremely low transportation prices and by differentiated by regions procurement prices. Thus, there was no specialized zones of dairy production. The start of economic liberalization in Russia was followed by the process of disintegration of the country's common economic space. Reforms entailed an increase in transportation costs and regional specialization based on comparative advantages of a certain commodity production. Specialized dairy producing zones started to emerge. This paper attempts to determine these zones in Russia in the nearest future. The analysis is based on an interregional comparison of comparative advantages in milk production. The research involves the study of raw milk production, dairy processing and consumption of dairy commodities in 51 regions of the European part of Russia. A system of indices to estimate specialization and comparative advantages in milk production is constructed.
D49|Assessing effects of price regulation in retail payment systems|This paper considers effects of price regulation in retail payment systems by applying the model of telecommunications competition by Laffont-Rey-Tirole (1998).In our two-country model world there is one retail payment network located in each country and markets are segmented à la Hotelling.We show that the optimal price under price regulation is the weighted average of pre-regulation domestic and cross-border prices where the degree of home-bias in making payments serves as the weight.Furthermore, we find that the general welfare effects of price regulation are ambiguous: gross social welfare is higher under price discrimination than under price regulation in the special case where costs of access to banking services (transportation costs) are high.However, there also exist cases where prohibitively high transaction costs make price discrimination to reduce total welfare.Finally, if transportation costs are reduced sufficiently, segmentation of payment markets is eliminated.Markets then become fullyserved as in the original Laffont-Rey-Tirole model, suggesting that price discrimination would be beneficial for welfare. Key words: payment systems, price regulation, retail payments JEL classification numbers: D49, G28, L59

D49|A Limit of Bilateral Contracting Institutions|" Nonconvexities undermine the efficiency of the usually robust ""double auction"" or DA market institution. We experimentally examine two modified DAs that allow for particularly rich bilateral contracting such as arbitrarily nonlinear pricing. The first allows for arbitrarily nonlinear pricing but should not necessarily promote it; the second should promote efficient nonlinear pricing. Experiments support predictions on the emergence of nonlinear pricing, but not those concerning efficiency. Coordination problems are the culprit. We conclude that institutions capable of dealing with some nonconvexities must frequently provide multilateral contracting possibilities not permitted by DA rules and other market-like bilateral contracting institutions.

D49|Toward a non-capitalist market system. Suggestions for curing the ills of our economic system|The paper focuses on the reform of economic institutions -those of the market system and the financial system, in particular. After introducing the analysis with a historical excursion on the development of economic institutions, the intent here is to propose significant modifications of the present market and financial establishments, which despite their radical flavour, will be shown to be, in fact, no less pragmatic then indispensable to cure the economic maladies of our age. Throughout the modern times, all spokesmen of powerful institutions - e.g. , churches, governments and economic elites- have always been keen to recognize in principle that these bodies are never perfect, and that societies assuredly need to take a step back, so to speak, ponder things over and eventually improve them. This is exactly what we set out to do in these pages: namely, we wish to lay the foundation for such ana analysis of market developments, and thereafter suggest the remedies for making society a workable economic proposition.
D49|A Geography Of Illicit Crops (Coca Leaf) And Armed Conflict In Colombia|Colombia is currently the world´s largest producer of coca leaf and the principal producer of opium poppies in the Americas; the plants are the basic raw materials used to produce cocaine and heroin. This document will analyse the current relationship between these crops and illegal armed groups in Colombia, using the hypothesis that the geographical intensification of the conflict is the principal cause of expanding illicit crop production. This relationship was analysed using a theoretic model, in which an interaction between illegal armed activity and strategic territorial control lead to cocaine production. Spatial analysis techniques were then applied, especially spatial association indicators; and a clear spatial dynamic was observed, related to the two aspects mentioned above. Non parametric exercises were also carried out using matching estimators, to determine the effect illegal armed groups have on coca crops, and also to analyse the efficiency of aerial eradication policies. The results suggest that a large percentage of coca production in Colombia is due to the effects of illegal armed activity. We therefore conclude that the expansion of illegal crop growing is a consequence of the expanding conflict. In contrast, coca crops can only be used to explain a small part of the armed conflict in Colombia. In addition, we found that crop eradication via aerial spraying has not been an efficient tool in the fight against coca production in the country.
D49|Efficient Union Contracts in the Presence of Homogeneous Labor and Differentiated Unions|This paper discusses the features of the labor market outcome in the presence of homogeneous labor and multiple unions. It is argued that contract curve agreements, or at least efficient bargaining among unions, may be improved upon by a solution with differential or non-uniform wage payments for workers affiliated to different unions. The equilibrium solution in terms of employment and/or wage bill shares implied for each union with uniform and multiple wage is investigated and confronted for the cases of: a. efficient bargaining among the unions, b. fully efficient bargaining, considering Stone-Geary union utility functions and labor demand is linear.
D49|An empirical analysis of price setting behaviour in the Netherlands in the period 1998-2003 using micro data|In this paper we examine pricing behaviour of retail firms in the Netherlands during 1998-2003 using a large database with monthly price quotes of 49 articles, representing different product types. We have conducted this study in order to gain in sight in the degree of nominal rigidity of consumer prices in the Netherlands. We find that prices of energy and unprocessed food are most flexible, whereas prices of services are stickiest. A multivariate analysis shows that firm size matters with prices being stickiest in small firms and most flexible in large firms and in retail firms consisting of the owners only. Furthermore, we investigate pass-through effects of VAT changes in prices. We find that VAT increases are almost completely passed on to consumers. Finally, there is some evidence indicating that pricing behaviour of retail firms was different during the introduction of the euro than in the period directly preceding it.

We have conducted this study in order to gain in sight in the degree of nominal rigidity of consumer prices in the Dutch economy. We find that energy prices and prices of unprocessed food are most flexible, whereas prices of services are stickiest. Our sample contains not only ample evidence of upward but also of downward flexible prices. A multivariate analysis shows that firm size matters with prices being stickiest in small retail firms and most flexible in large retail firms and in the smallest retail firms consisting of the owners only. Furthermore, we investigate pass-through effects of VAT changes in product prices. We find that VAT increases are almost completely passed on to consumers. Finally, there is some evidence indicating that, after controlling for inflation, pricing behaviour of retail firms was different during the introduction of the euro than in the period directly preceding it.
D49|The Price of Advice|We develop a model of consulting (advising) where the role of the consultant is that she can reveal signals to her client which refine the client’s original private estimate of the profitability of a project. Importantly, only the client can observe or evaluate these signals, the consultant cannot. We characterize the optimal contract between the consultant and her client. It is a menu consisting of pairs of transfers specifying payments between the two parties (from the client to the consultant or vice versa) in case the project is undertaken by the client and in case it is not. The main result of the paper is that in the optimal mechanism, the consultant obtains the same profit as if she could evaluate the impact of the signals (whose release she controls) on the client’s profit estimate.

D49|Consumo d'arte a Firenze in eta' moderna. Le collezioni Martelli, Riccardi e Salviati nel XVII e XVIII secolo|This paper intends to examine the consumption of art by some of the most important aristocratic Florentine families from the seventeenth to the beginning of the nineteenth century. In the last few decades economic and social historians have showed an increasing interest in consumption and material culture. The systematic application of investigations and economic methods to the study of consumption, through model-building and sophisticated quantitative analysis, has led to the discovery that there was a significant increase in the number and types of material goods in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth centuries. Even though this interest has produced many contributions to the field, no systematic and satisfactory interpretations have been made that can be applied as a general model of the phenomenon. The central problem for the historians remains one of explaining the dynamic role of consumption, and the growing urge to own and display some kind of material goods, such as paintings as commodities. Reconstruction of the art collections of the most important Florentine families will be a matter of significant importance towards understanding the art consumption in Florence in the modern age.
D49|Strategic Transfer Pricing With Risk-Averse Agents|In this paper we analyze strategic transfer pricing with risk- and effort-averse divisional managers. In contrast to earlier literature, we find that the existence of a standard agency problem allows transfer pricing to serve as a commitment device even if the transfer prices are not mutually observable. The reason is that transfer prices are set above marginal cost to solve the agency problem and not for strategic purposes. Therefore, delegating the pricing authority to a risk-averse manager implies that he sets a higher product price than does the risk-neutral owner, because at the divisional level the transfer price represents the relevant unit cost for pricing. We show that the optimal scope of managerial authority generally depends on both the risk premium and the intensity of competition in the product market. We also identify conditions under which the delegation of pricing responsibilities to risk-averse managers constitutes a dominant strategy equilibrium.
D49|Un approccio metrico per lo studio dei dati finanziari|In this paper I present a time series analysis based on a metrical approach. I use a definition of distance which depends on the sample correlation coefficient among bonds. The dataset consists on daily returns of US treasury bonds. By mean of a Linkage-Algorithm bonds are classified according to the distance which show the cluster structure. It is evident how the cluster structure depends strongly on maturity date, bonds are classified in three different clusters, one of them consists on long term bonds. The analysis is focused on long term bonds, introducing a modified time series, I show how is possible to evidentiate a complex cluster structure even in this class of bonds.
D49|Competition and regulation in European retail payment systems|In this study, the interaction between the competition-cooperation nexus and regulation in retail payment systems is analysed by applying the main lessons from the theory of network industries. This is justifiable on the grounds that the payment systems industry inherently has many characteristics in common with network industries. On the other hand, since the provision of payment services also has many special characteristics, the regulatory tools commonly used in many other network industries cannot be applied directly. In general, the main role of payment system regulators is to provide a level playing field for different service providers. To secure dynamic efficiency, the regulators also need to ensure adequate incentives for innovation and investment. In this respect, it is important that they do not take too restrictive an attitude towards cooperation among payment service providers. In addition to general policy analysis, the study also analyses developments in the European retail payment system field and the roles and aims of market participants.
