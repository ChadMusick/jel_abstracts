M13|Pay, Employment, and Dynamics of Young Firms|Why do young firms pay less? Using confidential microdata from the US Census Bureau, we find lower earnings among workers at young firms. However, we argue that such measurement is likely subject to worker and firm selection. Exploiting the two-sided panel nature of the data to control for relevant dimensions of worker and firm heterogeneity, we uncover a positive and significant young-firm pay premium. Furthermore, we show that worker selection at firm birth is related to future firm dynamics, including survival and growth. We tie our empirical findings to a simple model of pay, employment, and dynamics of young firms.
M13|Gender Differences in Self-employment Duration: the Case of Opportunity and Necessity Entrepreneurs|A strand of the self-employment literature suggests that those “pushed” into self-employment out of necessity may perform differently from those “pulled” into self-employment to pursue a business opportunity. While findings on self-employment outcomes by self-employed type are not unanimous, there is mounting evidence that performance outcomes differ between these two self-employed types. Another strand of the literature has found important gender differences in self-employment entry rates, motivations for entry, and outcomes. Using a unique set of data that links the American Community Survey to administrative data from Form 1040 and W-2 records, we bring together these two strands of the literature. We explore whether there are gender differences in self-employment duration of self-employed types. In particular, we examine the likelihood of self-employment exit towards unemployment versus the wage sector for five consecutive entry cohorts, including two cohorts who entered self-employment during the Great Recession. Severely limited labor-market opportunities may have driven many in the recession cohorts to enter self-employment, while those entering self-employment during the boom may have been pursuing opportunities under favorable market conditions. To more explicitly test the concept of “necessity” versus “opportunity” self-employment, we also examine the wage labor attachment (or weeks worked in the wage sector) in the year prior to becoming self-employed. We find that, within the cohorts we examine, there are gender differences in the rate at which men and women depart self-employment for either wage work or non-participation, but that the patterns are dependent on pre self-employment wage-sector attachment and cohort effects.
M13|The Best versus the Rest: Divergence across Firms During the Global Productivity Slowdown|"We document that labor productivity of the globally most productive firms - the ""frontier"" - has diverged from all other firms - the ""rest"" - throughout the 2000s. This divergence remains after controlling for capital intensity and markups, and is strongest in ICT services, indicative of ""winnertakes-all"" dynamics. We also find weakening catch-up and market selection below the frontier, which can explain why this divergence at the firm level is linked to weaker aggregate productivity. The divergence is found to be stronger in industries where product market regulations are less competition friendly, highlighting the need for regulatory policy to improve the contestability of markets."
M13|The Impact of Venture Capital Screening|I study the effect of limited attention on resource allocation by venture capitalists. Using engagement in the IPO process as a measure of distraction, I document that investments made by inattentive venture capitalists into new portfolio companies tend to underperform. Such companies are 7% less likely to go public or get acquired, and also exhibit lower exit multiples. The adverse effect of distraction is present only in the vicinity of the distracting IPO and manifests itself both for individual partners and venture capital funds. Overall, the results indicate that the scarcity of attention hypothesis holds in the context of deal sourcing and screening in venture capital, highlighting the presence of skill in the company selection process.
M13|Task Discretion, Labor Market Frictions and Entrepreneurship|Each job can be performed in several ways, which we call tasks An agent's performance at a task is informative about his productivity at different tasks. But tasks are not contractible: choosing tasks is the prerogative of management within firms, and of the agent if he is an entrepreneur. Firms will invest in the discovery of their workers' productivity at different tasks only if they cannot easily move to other firms. Therefore, labor-market frictions determine whether learning an agent's talent occur within firms, or whether an agent may become an entrepreneur to acquire task discretion.
M13|Persistence of Entrepreneurship in Different Historical Contexts|Persistence of entrepreneurship over longer periods of time could indicate a culture of entrepreneurship among the local population that may be an important factor for regional development, but does persistence of economic activity require cultural transmission? We exploit the diverse historical developments in the territory that is Poland today to analyze the level and the sources of persistence from the 1920s until today. Persistence is mainly found in those regions that were part of Germany before World War II. This persistence is noticeable despite the exchange of most of the pre-war population, ruling out that persistence is driven by transmission of culture. In most regions that were already part of Poland before World War II, the relationship between historical and current levels of entrepreneurship is not significant. Persistence of entrepreneurship is related to the historical success of regions, which we capture by the pre-war level of and self-employment in manufacturing industries, particularly in those that can be regarded as knowledge intensive. Our main conclusion is that persistence of entrepreneurship requires a certain level of successful economic development that we capture by the degree of industrialization in the early 20th century, but it does not necessarily require persistence of the local population.
M13|Innovations in emerging markets: the case of mobile money|Mobile money is a financial innovation that provides transfers, payments, and other financial services at a low or zero cost to individuals in developing countries where banking and capital markets are deficient and financial inclusion is low. We use transaction costs and institutional theories to explain the growth and impact of mobile money. Having developed a new archival dataset that tracks mobile money deployment across 90 emerging economies during 16 years between 2000 and 2015, we address the question of relative economic impact of the banking and telecoms sectors in the provision of mobile money. We show that telecom groups and not banks are more likely to launch mobile money in countries where legal rights are weaker and credit information less prevalent. However, it is when mobile money is offered via a banking channel that the spillover effects on the economy are greater. Findings have significant implications for policy and strategy.
M13|Strategic Growth and Implementation: Thriving in a Disruptive Landscape|To create wealth in a changing and competitive landscape, managers need to identify and develop opportunities for new strategic growth. They also need to have excellent implementation capabilities to reap the benefits of their new growth initiatives. Yet, most managers and companies struggle or even fail to do so. To address this struggle, management practice and research about strategic growth and about implementation need integration. In this inaugural address, I propose three avenues, which may contribute to this. First, for organizations to become really good at developing new strategies for growth and also at implementing them, they need ambidextrous managers, i.e., managers with the capacity to do two very different things equally well, like being entrepreneurial and strategic, conducting exploratory and exploitative learning, and putting in place top-down and bottom-up strategic processes. The second avenue is about creating close connections and systematic interactions between new growth and implementation activities within the organization and among the actors involved. This pertains to managers across different hierarchical levels and to the involvement of operational managers and employees. The third avenue points to scale-ups as an exciting context for practice and research on growth and implementation. Interest in scale-ups may benefit from going beyond typical macro questions of job creation as scaling-up a company rapidly is full of unique managerial and organizational challenges, and scale-ups have the potential to be impactful forces for positive change.
M13|Digitalization for Energy Access in Sub-Saharan Africa : Challenges, Opportunities and Potential Business Models|Innovative business models supported by digital technologies, together with the widening connectivity and data collection, are already giving a big contribution in fostering the access to electricity and clean cooking in Sub-Saharan Africa. This paper gives an overview on the actual state of energy access in Sub-Saharan Africa and the current technologies used to provide it, followed by a description of the key trends and drivers of the ongoing African digital transformation. A deep analysis of the Pay-as-you-go business model in the off-grid solar sector will shed light on how this transformation started some years ago and the way it is affecting society in many ways. Strengths and opportunities — as well as weaknesses and risks of the model — are provided through a screening of the most representative business experiences in East and West Africa, financial aspects and market analysis. The perspective of both companies and end-users have been considered here. The last section gives recommendations to policy-makers on how to ride the wave of digitalization to foster the access to clean and reliable energy, by acting on the electrification planning, regulations, business environment, distribution channels and mobile money environment.
M13|Business Dynamics in the National Establishment Time Series (NETS)/Leland Crane, Ryan Decker|Business microdata have proven useful in a number of fields, but the main sources of comprehensive microdata are subject to significant confidentiality restrictions. A growing number of papers instead use a private data source seeking to cover the universe of U.S. business establishments, the National Establishment Time Series (NETS). Previous research documents the representativeness of NETS in terms of the distribution of employment and establishment counts across industry, geography, and establishment size. But there exists considerable need among researchers for microdata suitable for studying business dynamics---birth, growth, decline, and death. We evaluate NETS in terms of its ability to corroborate key insights from the business dynamics literature with a particular focus on the behavior of new and young firms. We find that NETS microdata exhibit patterns of business dynamics that are markedly different from official administrative sources, limiting the usefuln ess of NETS for studying these topics.
M13|Pay, Employment, and Dynamics of Young Firms|Why do young firms pay less? Using confidential microdata from the US Census Bureau, we find lower earnings among workers at young firms. However, we argue that such measurement is likely subject to worker and firm selection. Exploiting the two-sided panel nature of the data to control for relevant dimensions of worker and firm heterogeneity, we uncover a positive and significant young-firm pay premium. Furthermore, we show that worker selection at firm birth is related to future firm dynamics, including survival and growth. We tie our empirical findings to a simple model of pay, employment, and dynamics of young firms.
M13|Small and Mid-Sized Business as a Factor of Economic Growth in Russia|The present edition includes two papers by the leading experts of the Gaidar Institute for Economic Policy. The papers in question are based on the outputs of research carried out by the Gaidar Institute in 2018. Both the papers deal with operation of the sector of small and mid-sized business (SMB). In the first paper – “The Statistics of the Sector of Small and Mid-Sized Business in Russia and the World” – the authors note that there are serious differences in the methods of calculating statistical indices related to the SMB sector and definition criteria. Without understanding those differences, there is no point in inter-country statistical comparison. Utilization of international experience in facilitating and promoting the SMB sector suggests that there is clear awareness of the differences in this sector’s definition criteria and, consequently, statistical data published in international organizations’ reports. In the other paper – “Comparative Analysis of the Government’s Support to Exports by Small and Mid-Sized Businesses in the Regional Aspect” – the authors elaborate on the existing patterns of support to exports in Russia and point to serious disadvantages which largely prevent small and mid-sized businesses from engaging in export activities. The methods of analyzing the assessment of the impact of export support measures at the regional level on the volumes both of the overall regional exports and exports by small and mid-sized businesses are based on econometric models.
M13|Human Capital and Social Capital as Moderators of Start-up Support and Start-up Success|Objective - Start-up support has not received enough research attention although it is an integral element of the start-up ecosystem that provides resources and services in the form of various support to start-ups. There is a need to explore the effectiveness of various start-up support because the question as to whether such supports contribute to start-up success remains unanswered. Methodology/Technique - While human capital and social capital has been linked to entrepreneurial success, little is known about how these capitals moderate the effect of start-up access to support. Finding - This paper contributes to start-up literature by presenting a conceptual framework appropriate to investigate the effect of a start-up's access to support on start-up success as well as how this effect is accentuated by the human and social capital of start-up entrepreneurs. Novelty - Further understanding of how human capital and social capital could strengthen the contribution of support to start-up success represents an important direction for future entrepreneurship research. This paper also discusses the limitations of relevant previous research and offers suggestions for future research.
M13|Micro-work, artificial intelligence and the automotive industry|Abstract This paper delves into the human factors in the “back-office” of artificial intelligence and of its data-intensive algorithmic underpinnings. We show that the production of AI is a labor-intensive process, which particularly needs the little-qualified, inconspicuous and low-paid contribution of “micro-workers” who annotate, tag, label, correct and sort the data that help to train and test smart solutions. We illustrate these ideas in the high-profile case of the automotive industry, one of the largest clients of digital data-related micro-working services, notably for the development of autonomous and connected cars. This case demonstrates how micro-work has a place in long supply chains, where tech companies compete with more traditional industry players. Our analysis indicates that the need for micro-work is not a transitory, but a structural one, bound to accompany the further development of the sector; and that its provision involves workers in different geographical and linguistic areas, requiring the joint study of multiple platforms operating at both global and local levels.
M13|An analytical approach to crowdinvesting: The impact of marketing and idea stealing on the entrepreneur's decision making|In a game theoretical setting, this paper studies the entrepreneur's decision making by using a new financing opportunity referred to as crowdinvesting. In this model, the entrepreneur can collect money and advertise his innovative idea. However, crowdinvesting carries the risk of being copied by a potential competitor. Faced with this trade-off, the entrepreneur strategically diminishes his marketing activity under certain circumstances to remain the monopolist in the market. In the second part, we compare crowdinvesting with two alternative financing opportunities, banks and venture capital. We show that crowdinvesting, often mentioned as a financing instrument for drastic innovations, is generally not appropriate for these ideas because the danger of being copied is too high for the entrepreneur.
M13|Reconsidering the returns to entrepreneurship: Applying a modified version of Lazear’s occupational choice model|The paper analyzes a modified version of Lazear’s (2004, 2005) model for occupational choice that includes a utility adjustment factor reflecting non-pecuniary net benefits associated with entrepreneurship. The model is used to derive analytical expressions for the relative income returns to entrepreneurship defined in two ways: in relation to the incomes of observationally similar wage employed and in relation to the counterfactual incomes of entrepreneurs as wage employed. The analysis shows that the upper bound on the income returns defined in counterfactual terms increases with the market value of entrepreneurial talent and that the lower bound decreases with increasing non-pecuniary benefits. If the entrepreneurial incomes are instead related to the incomes of observationally similar wage employed, and if the skill profiles in the population are assumed to follow a Fréchet distribution, then the upper bound on the relative expected returns will decrease with increasing non-pecuniary benefits. We also show that entrepreneurs on average will earn less than observationally similar wage employed even if there are no net benefits and that the associated self-selection bias will increase the higher the fraction of entrepreneurs. Individual-based data from the Swedish employment register is used to calibrate the parameters of the modified Lazear model and to compute the income returns to entrepreneurship. The model-based income distributions for entrepreneurs and wage employed are consistent with the observed distributions.
M13|Measuring Entrepreneurship: Do Established Metrics Capture High-Impact Schumpeterian Entrepreneurship?|Are quantitative measures driven by small business activity also valid proxies for high-impact Schumpeterian entrepreneurship? We compile four hand-collected measures of high-impact Schumpeterian entrepreneurship (VC-funded IPOs, self-made billionaire entrepreneurs, unicorn start-ups, and young top global firms founded by individual entrepreneurs) and six measures dominated by small business activity as well as institutional and economic variables for 64 countries. Factor analysis reveals that much of the variation is accounted for by two distinct factors: one relating to high-impact Schumpeterian entrepreneurship and the other relating to small business activity. Except for the World Bank measure of firm registration of limited liability companies quantity-based measures tend to be inappropriate proxies for high-impact Schumpeterian entrepreneurship.
M13|Intrapreneurship and Trust|Trust and entrepreneurship are seen as key ingredients of long-term prosperity. However, it is not clear how these two are related. Part of the confusion can be traced back to the measurement of entrepreneurship, biased towards independent entrepreneurship (self-employed and new firms), and excluding entrepreneurship within established organizations. We shed new light on the relationship between trust and entrepreneurship, by proposing two mechanisms relating trust to entrepreneurship by employees, so-called intrapreneurship. We hypothesize that generalized trust influences the prevalence of intrapreneurship in an economy, and the allocation of entrepreneurial talents between independent entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship, through two mechanisms. First, generalized trust may substitute for complete contracts as a means of organizing labor in society, enabling a level of job autonomy in organizations necessary for intrapreneurship to flourish. Second, by way of its influence on the size and scope of the welfare state, generalized trust may increase the benefits of employment relative to self-employment, causing entrepreneurial individuals to elect to be intrapreneurs rather than independent entrepreneurs. Using a novel dataset, we find support for these hypotheses in a cross-country regression model covering the time period 2011–2017.
M13|Local Rates of New Firm Formation: An Empirical Exploration using Swedish Data|We assess the empirical literature on the determinants of spatial variations in new-firm formation rates by undertaking a systematic empirical analysis of the relative roles of different demand- and supply-side factors. Using instrumental variables to address endogeneity, we find that local growth drives local entrepreneurship exclusively in services industries. Average establishment size has a robust negative influence on local new-firm formation rates, but its effect varies across industries. Local industry diversity is only positive for new-firm formation in high-tech and knowledge-intensive activities. There is also some evidence of that longer distances to urban centers is associated with higher new-firm formation rates. The only local factor with a consistent positive effect on new-firm formation across industries is local density of skilled workers. We conclude that industry structure, geography and agglomeration matter, but in the end, new firms are started by people, so it is unsurprising that the main factor driving local entrepreneurship is the characteristics of the local residents.
M13|Editorial: Enhancing Quantitative Exploratory Entrepreneurship Research|The purpose of this editorial is to discuss ways to enhance exploratory quantitative studies in entrepreneurship. We use examples from entrepreneurship research and other scientific fields to illustrate the advantages of graphical data display for both exploratory purposes and post hoc tests. We provide suggestions for authors, reviewers, and editors on ways to enhance the transparency, accuracy, and pedagogical presentation of quantitative data in papers with the explicit purpose of illuminating emerging and important entrepreneurship phenomena. Our hope is that we spark a conversation among entrepreneurship scholars about the state of our empirical work and the possibilities that lie ahead to enhance exploratory entrepreneurship research.
M13|2 Editorial: Enhancing Quantitative Theory-Testing Entrepreneurship Research|The purpose of this editorial is to discuss methodological advancements to enhance quantitative theory-testing entrepreneurship research. As the impact of entrepreneurship scholarship accelerates and deepens, our methods must keep pace to continue shaping theory, policy, and practice. Like our sister fields in business, entrepreneurship is coming to terms with the replication and credibility crisis in the social sciences, forcing the field to revisit commonly-held assumptions that limit the promise and prospect of our scholarship. Thus, we provide suggestions for reviewers and editors to identify concerns in empirical work, and to guide authors in improving their analyses and research designs. We hope that our editorial provides useful and actionable guidance for entrepreneurship researchers submitting theory-testing papers to Journal of Business Venturing.
M13|Immigrant Networking and Collaboration: Survey Evidence from CIC|Networking and the giving and receiving of advice outside of one's own firm are important features of entrepreneurship and innovation. We study how immigrants and natives utilize the potential networking opportunities provided by CIC, formerly known as the Cambridge Innovation Center. CIC is widely considered the center of the Boston entrepreneurial ecosystem. We surveyed 1,334 people working at CIC in three locations spread across the Boston area and CIC's first expansion facility in St. Louis, MO. Survey responses show that immigrants value networking capabilities in CIC more than natives, and the networks developed by immigrants at CIC tend to be larger. Immigrants report substantially greater rates of giving and receiving advice than natives for six surveyed factors: business operations, venture financing, technology, suppliers, people to recruit, and customers. The structure and composition of CIC floors has only a modest influence on these immigrant versus native differences.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
M13|Youth Drain, Entrepreneurship and Innovation|Migration outflows, especially of young people, may deprive an economy of entrepreneurial energy and innovative ideas. We exploit exogenous variation in emigration from Italian local labor markets to show that between 2008 and 2015 larger emigration flows reduced firm creation. The decline affected firms owned by young people and innovative industries. We estimate that for every 1,000 emigrants, 10 fewer young-owned firms were created over the whole period. A simple accounting exercise shows that about 60 percent of the effect is generated simply by the loss of young people; the remaining 40 percent is due to a combination of selection of emigrants among highly entrepreneurial people, negative spillovers on the entrepreneurship rate of locals, and negative local firm multiplier effect.
M13|Be Careful What You Ask For: Fundraising Strategies in Equity Crowdfunding|We use equity crowdfunding data to ask how fundraising amounts can be explained by what entrepreneurs ask for, versus what investors want to invest. The analysis exploits unique features of crowdfunding where entrepreneurs not only set investment goals, but also chose when to close their campaigns. More experienced and more educated founder teams ask for more. Their campaigns succeed more often, and they raise more money. Female teams ask for less, are equally successful, yet raise significantly less. They also wait longer before closing campaigns, suggesting they want to raise more than what they originally asked for.
M13|Experimentation and Startup Performance: Evidence from A/B testing|Recent work argues that experimentation is the appropriate framework for entrepreneurial strategy. We investigate this proposition by exploiting the time-varying adoption of A/B testing technology, which has drastically reduced the cost of experimentally testing business ideas. This paper provides the first evidence of how digital experimentation affects the performance of a large sample of high-technology startups using data that tracks their growth, technology use, and product launches. We find that, despite its prominence in the business press, relatively few firms have adopted A/B testing. However, among those that do, we find increased performance on several critical dimensions, including page views and new product features. Furthermore, A/B testing is positively related to tail outcomes, with younger ventures failing faster and older firms being more likely to scale. Firms with experienced managers also derive more benefits from A/B testing. Our results inform the emerging literature on entrepreneurial strategy and how digitization and data-driven decision-making are shaping strategy.
M13|Evaluating Factors of Small and Medium Hospitality Enterprises Business Failure: a conceptual approach|The aim of this paper is to present a comparison between macro and micro economic factors as they are suggested by the current literature in corporate failure field. Present study answers two research questions, firstly which the causes of corporate bankruptcies in tourism are, and secondly which metrics could help more on effectively predict a corporate failure. Based on a conceptual approach authors analyze and collect different macro and micro economic factors. Results indicates how strongly the various factors affect the quantity and intensity of bankruptcy applications and suggestions are given on how different models could be developed to predict the risk of bankruptcy in a macro or micro aspect. This is one of the first studies that investigates the effectiveness of different types of Corporate Failure metrics, which has, until now, suffered a dearth of conceptual studies in the field, especially in the context of national economies due to the economic recession.
M13|Entrepreneurship, Institutions, and Economic Growth: Does the Level of Development Matter?|This study questions the assumption that entrepreneurship unequivocally leads to economic growth. Using insights from institutional theory and development economics, we reevaluate entrepreneurship’s contribution towards economic growth. Our study uses Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) data for a panel of 83 countries from 2002 to 2014 and highlights several important findings. First, our evidence suggests that entrepreneurship encourages economic growth but not in developing countries. Second, we find that a country’s institutional environment—measured by GEM’s Entrepreneurial Framework Conditions (EFCs)—contributes to economic growth in more developed countries but not in developing countries. Lastly, we find that opportunity-motivated entrepreneurship encourages economic growth in developed countries, while necessity-motivated entrepreneurship discourages economic growth in developing countries. These findings have important policy implications. Namely, our evidence contradicts policy proposals that suggest entrepreneurship and the adoption of pro-market institutions that support it will encourage economic growth in developing countries. Our evidence suggests these policy proposals are unlikely to generate the desired economic growth.
M13|The landscape of corporate venturing in Germany: Insights on corporate venture capitals and corporate accelerators|This paper adds to the literature of external corporate venturing, especially corporate venture capitals (CVCs) and corporate accelerators (CAs) by providing an overview of the German corporate venturing market and by offering first intriguing findings based on a novel and unique hand-collected dataset. It presents insights regarding the set-up, organization and staffing of corporate venturing units, as well as characteristics of start-ups under management. This study distinguishes between the corporate venturing unit's mission, organization, governance and network as well as vehicle leads. Moreover, differences in the characteristics of start-ups supported by corporate venturing units are detected. This work offers unique insights on the German corporate venturing landscape and thereby serves as starting point for future and more elaborate research.
M13|The European venture capital landscape: an EIF perspective. Volume V: The economic impact of VC investments supported by the EIF|This paper examines the impact of venture capital (VC) investments supported by the EIF on the financial growth and performance of young and innovative firms. Using a novel dataset covering European start-ups supported by VC in the years 2007 to 2014, we generate a counterfactual group of non-VCbacked firms through a combination of exact and propensity score matching. To offset the relatively limited set of observables allowed by our data, we estimate treatment propensity using a series of innovative measures based on machine learning, network theory, and satellite imagery analysis. Our results document the positive effects of EIF-supported VC investments on start-up performance, as measured through various financial indicators (e.g. assets, revenue, employment). We find that VC financing enables start-ups to prioritise long-term growth, trading off short- to medium-term profitability if necessary. Overall, our work provides meaningful evidence towards the positive effects of EIF-supported VC investment on the financial growth of young and innovative businesses in Europe.
M13|Existenzgründungen von Frauen: Aktuelle Entwicklungen|Frauen sind seit jeher im Gründungsgeschehen in Deutschland unterrepräsentiert. Diese Unterrepräsentanz hat sich in jüngerer Vergangenheit wieder verstärkt. Analysen auf Basis der Gewerbeanzeigenstatistik zeigen, dass dies zum einen darauf zurückzuführen ist, dass die Gründungsneigung von Frauen noch stärker als die der Männer zurückgegangen ist. Zum anderen trägt ein weit überdurchschnittliches Ausmaß an Gründungsaktivitäten von Männern aus den EU-8- und EU-2-Beitrittsstaaten, mit dem ihre Landsfrauen nicht mithalten können, dazu bei. Die von Frauen gegründeten Unternehmen weisen teilweise andere Branchenschwerpunkte als die von Männern gegründeten auf. Sie sind zumeist im Dienstleistungssektor angesiedelt. Im Bereich der freiberuflichen Gründungen sind Frauen sogar leicht überrepräsentiert. Qualitative Unterschiede im Hinblick auf Größe und Innovationspotenzial bestehen zwischen von Frauen und Männern gegründeten gewerblichen Einzelunternehmen kaum (mehr).
M13|The German Mittelstand: Antithesis to the Silicon Valley entrepreneurship model?|"Whilst internationally, the Mittelstand in Germany is admired and many countries try to emulate it, the current debate in Germany praises the Silicon Valley model of entrepreneurship, contrasting the Mittelstand as low-growth, low-tech and non-innovative - in short: as a hindrance to Germany's economic future. We therefore ask whether the Mittelstand actually is the antithesis to the Silicon Valley entrepreneurship model. We show that Mittelstand is more than a small and medium enterprise size, identifying its distinctive features (identity of ownership and management, sense of belonging). In this regard, we also discuss the influence of historical paths and current institutional settings on the Mittelstand model. Asking to what extent the Mittelstand is distinctive, we address its diverse contributions to economy and society. We suggest that the Mittelstand is an excellent example of everyday entrepreneurship and a vibrant segment of economy which is also competitive, innovative, and growth orientated; albeit in different ways compared to Silicon Valley entrepreneurship. In concluding, we outline ideas for future research and implications for policymakers. In our view, future research and policies should stand back from dichotomies such as ""Mittelstand versus Silicon Valley entrepreneurship"" and acknowledge the diversity and heterogeneity of entrepreneurship."
M13|The Impact of Soft-Skills Training for Entrepreneurs in Jamaica|A randomized control trial with 945 entrepreneurs in Jamaica shows positive shortterm impacts of soft-skills training on business outcomes. The effects are concentrated among men, and disappear twelve months after the training. We argue that the main channel is increased adoption of recommended business practices, exclusively observed in the short run. We see persistent effects on an incentivized behavioral measure of perseverance after setbacks, a focus of this training. We compare a course focused only on soft-skills to one that combines soft-skills training with traditional business training. The effects of the combined training are never statistically significant.
M13|Intellectual Property Protection Mechanisms and the Characteristics of Founding Teams|Intellectual property protection mechanisms (IPPMs) are critical to fostering innovation and their relevance has grown enormously with the increased trade in goods and services involving intellectual property. Scholars have investigated what factors facilitate or hinder the use of such IP protection strategies, identifying country, sector, and firm characteristics. However, the extant literature has overlooked the role of founding team characteristics on the choice of IPPMs. Using data from a large sample of European small and young entrepreneurial firms, we show that controlling for size, R&D intensity, and other firms and market effects, the founding team characteristics such as gender and education greatly influence the choice of IPPMs.
M13|Transitioning from Solo Self-Employed to Microbusiness Employer: Local Economic Environment or Owner Characteristics?|Only a minority of micro-businesses create jobs for others. This paper addresses whether personal characteristics and resources of the microbusiness owner or the local external economic environment are drivers of job creation. In the UK context of significant growth in self-employment but a declining proportion who create jobs, an investigation using longitudinal data is provided. Individual demographic and resource characteristics are found to be more important, but place effects are relatively weak. Entrepreneurship policy needs to target particular groups, including women and less experienced business owners in their localities.

M13|Entrepreneurship over the Business Cycle in the United States: A Decomposition|Entry rates into self-employment increase during recessions and decrease during economic upswings. I show that this is mostly explained by the higher unemployment rate during a recession, together with the fact that at all times, unemployed persons have a relatively high propensity to become entrepreneurs out of necessity because they do not find paid employment. I use econometric decomposition techniques to quantify these effects based on the monthly matched US Current Population Survey before, during and after the Great Recession. I also document that this counter-cyclical pattern of entrepreneurial entry strongly applies to unincorporated entrepreneurship, but only weakly to incorporated entrepreneurship. This highlights the association of unincorporated and incorporated entrepreneurship with necessity and opportunity entrepreneurship, respectively. The results are useful for policy-makers and practitioners to understand, forecast and act on the different types of entrepreneurial activities that are to be expected over the business cycle.
M13|Entrepreneurial Persistence beyond Survival: Measurement and Determinants|Entrepreneurial persistence is demonstrated by an entrepreneur's continued positive maintenance of entrepreneurial motivation and constantly-renewed active engagement in a new business venture despite counter forces or enticing alternatives. It is thus a crucial factor for entrepreneurs when pursuing and exploiting their business opportunities and to realize potential economic gains and benefits. Using rich data on a representative sample of German business founders, we investigate the determinants of entrepreneurial persistence. Next to observed survival we also construct a hybrid persistence measure capturing also the motivational dimension of persistence. We analyze the influence of individual-level (human capital and personality) and business-related characteristics on both measures as well as their relative importance. We find that the two indicators emphasize different aspects of persistence. For the survival indicator, the predictive power is concentrated in business characteristics and human capital, while for hybrid persistence, the dominant factors are business characteristics and personality. Finally, we show that results are heterogeneous across subgroups. In particular, formerly-unemployed founders do not differ in survival chances, but they are more likely to lack a high psychological commitment to their business ventures.
M13|Persistence of entrepreneurship in different historical contexts|Persistence of entrepreneurship over longer periods of time could indicate a culture of entrepreneurship among the local population that may be an important factor for regional development, but does persistence of economic activity require cultural transmission? We exploit the diverse historical developments in the territory that is Poland today to analyze the level and the sources of persistence from the 1920s until today. Persistence is mainly found in those regions that were part of Germany before World War II. This persistence is noticeable despite the exchange of most of the pre- war population, ruling out that persistence is driven by transmission of culture. In most regions that were already part of Poland before World War II, the relationship between historical and current levels of entrepreneurship is not significant. Persistence of entrepreneurship is related to the historical success of regions, which we capture by the pre-war level of and self- employment in manufacturing industries, particularly in those that can be regarded as knowledge intensive. Our main conclusion is that persistence of entrepreneurship requires a certain level of successful economic development that we capture by the degree of industrialization in the early 20th century, but it does not necessarily require persistence of the local population.
M13|Skills, Scope, and Success: An Empirical Look at the Start-up Process in Creative Industries in Germany|Creative industries comprise enterprises focusing on the creation, production, and distribution of creative or cultural goods and services. Following an explorative empirical approach, we analyze start-ups in creative industries regarding three issues along the start-up process: (1) personal characteristics of creative entrepreneurs, (2) their use of labor and capital as input factors, and (3) start-up success as measured by start-up survival, degree of innovativeness, and change in household income. Based on individual-level data from the KfW Start-up Monitor, a large-scale survey on entrepreneurship in Germany, our regression results show that entrepreneurs in creative industries tend to be younger and better educated than entrepreneurs in other economic sectors. Businesses in creative industries are prevalently started on a small scale, as part-time occupations, and with less financial resources. Yet they show a higher persistence and an above-average degree of innovativeness.
M13|An Analysis of Optimal Attributes of Organic Shampoo|This survey research interviewed 400 consumers in Bangkok who ever used or are using organic shampoo. The study objectives were 1) Study the general characteristics of consumers 2) Study consumer behavior in organic shampoo purchase and 3) Analyze the appropriate attributes of organic shampoo products that consumers are satisfied. Cluster Analysis divided the consumers into 2 groups and then Kano Model identified attributes of the products each group prefer. The result indicated that the first group is a group of college students and those who just start the first job. People around them have an influence on the purchase. This group prefers the product of various varieties and formulas, get reviewed on online media. The second group is a group of consumers in the working age always shop for health, The product features are of various varieties and formulas, get reviewed on online media, portable size available at convenience store and online channel distribution.
M13|Factors Affecting Variation in SMES' Export Intensity|Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are more constrained to participate in export market than their large counterparts despite various export assistance provision by the government. Extant literature on SME internationalization mostly focus more on how non-exporting SMEs can become exporters than on how exporting SMEs can sustain and expand their export. This study aims to investigate the factors affecting SMEs’ export intensity with reference to the case of Indonesia. Fractional-logit regressions were used to identify the inﬂuence of export-exhibiting factors, export-inhibiting factors, and ﬁrm and owner characteristics on SMEs’ export intensity. The evidences were collected from 497 SMEs in seven provinces in Jawa, Madura and Bali regions. The ﬁndings show that SMEs’ export intensity is affected by some ﬁrm characteristics including ﬁrm age and total employees. Export intensity is also affected by some exhibiting factors including owners’ overseas and MNC/exporting ﬁrm work experience, central government agencies’ assistance, network relationships with non-government actors, location, export market of choices and years of exporting. By contrast, export intensity is adversely affected by perceived difﬁculties in overcoming informational and human resources barriers, distribution, logistics and promotional barriers, ﬁnancial barriers, foreign government barriers, procedural barriers and price barriers. The policy and managerial implications of the ﬁndings are discussed.
M13|The effect of entrepreneurial origin on firms’ performance - The case of Portuguese academic spinoffs|We investigate the role of different entrepreneurial origin on firms’ performance by comparing academic spinoff firms with their non-academic counterparts and using alternative growth measures. Estimates based upon dynamic panel-data models reveal that academic spinoffs grow through resources accumulation and internationalization. However, comparatively to non- academic counterparts, they fail to translate these advantages into productivity gains. Also, despite younger academic spinoff outperform, in terms of sales growth, firms from different entrepreneurial origin, they fail to retain these scale effects, as they grow older. Portuguese academic spinoffs are contributing to economic development by creating new jobs, yet their relevance as a source of sustained economic value is limited so far. Policy implications are discussed in light of these findings.
M13|Entrepreneurial beginnings: Transitions to self-employment and the creation of jobs|Owner-operated firms are an important part of the New Zealand economy. They employ approximately 30% of the private-for-profit workforce, as well as providing jobs and income to the working proprietors themselves. This paper addresses two questions: what characteristics are associated with entrepreneurship (starting a self-employed business); and which sorts of entrepreneurs are more successful (create jobs)? We pay particular attention to differences in start-up and survival rates by business owner sex and ethnicity, but also consider whether other individual characteristics (including age and skill) and prior job characteristics also relate to the decision to start a business or to create jobs. We find substantial negative gaps in entrepreneurship for females and non-European-only ethnicity groups – gaps that arise in large part because of differential rates of entry into self-employment and, in the case of non-European-only ethnicities, higher attrition rates from self-employment after entry. These gaps persist in the presence of controls for skill, prior labour market experience and other individual characteristics.
M13|Early-Stage Business Formation : An Analysis of Applications for Employer Identification Numbers|This paper reports on the development and analysis of a newly constructed dataset on the early stages of business formation. The data are based on applications for Employer Identification Numbers (EINs) submitted in the United States, known as IRS Form SS-4 filings. The goal of the research is to develop high-frequency indicators of business formation at the national, state, and local levels. The analysis indicates that EIN applications provide forward-looking and very timely information on business formation. The signal of business formation provided by counts of applications is improved by using the characteristics of the applications to model the likelihood that applicants become employer businesses. The results also suggest that EIN applications are related to economic activity at the local level. For example, application activity is higher in counties that experienced higher employment growth since the end of the Great Recession, and application counts grew more rapidly in counties engaged in shale oil and gas extraction. Finally, the paper provides a description of new public use dataset, the “Business Formation Statistics (BFS),” that contains new data series on business applications and formation. The initial release of the BFS shows that the number of business applications in the 3rd quarter of 2017 that have relatively high likelihood of becoming job creators is still far below pre-Great Recession levels.
M13|Innovation, Productivity Dispersion, and Productivity Growth|We examine whether underlying industry innovation dynamics are an important driver of the large dispersion in productivity across firms within narrowly defined sectors. Our hypothesis is that periods of rapid innovation are accompanied by high rates of entry, significant experimentation and, in turn, a high degree of productivity dispersion. Following this experimentation phase, successful innovators and adopters grow while unsuccessful innovators contract and exit yielding productivity growth. We examine the dynamic relationship between entry, productivity dispersion, and productivity growth using a new comprehensive firm-level dataset for the U.S. We find a surge of entry within an industry yields with a lag an increase in productivity dispersion and then after a subsequent lag an increase in productivity growth. These patterns are more pronounced for the High Tech sector where we expect there to be more innovative activities. These patterns change over time suggesting other forces are at work during the post-2000 slowdown in aggregate productivity.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
M13|Immigrant Entrepreneurship in America: Evidence from the Survey of Business Owners 2007 & 2012|We study immigrant entrepreneurship and firm ownership in 2007 and 2012 using the Survey of Business Owners (SBO). The survival and growth of immigrant-owned businesses over time relative to native-founded companies is evaluated by linking the 2007 SBO to the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD). We quantify the dependency of the United States as a whole, as well as individual states, on the contributions of immigrant entrepreneurs in terms of firm formation and job creation. We describe differences in the types of businesses started by immigrants and the quality of jobs created by their firms. First-generation immigrants create about 25% of new firms in the United States, but this share exceeds 40% in some states. In addition, Asian and Hispanic second-generation immigrants start about 6% of new firms. Immigrant-owned firms, on average, create fewer jobs than native-owned firms, but much of this is explained by the industry and geographic location of the firms. Immigrant-owned firms pay comparable wages, conditional on firm traits, to native-owned firms, but are less likely to offer benefits.
M13|Centers of Gravity: The Effect of Stable Shared Leadership in Top Management Teams on Firm Growth and Industry Evolution|We study the processes of firm growth in the evolution of the Japanese cotton spinning industry during 1883-1914 by integrating strategy and historical approaches and utilizing rich quantitative firm-level data and detailed business histories. The resultant conceptual model highlights growth outcomes of path dependencies as firms evolve across periods of single vs. shared leadership, establish stability in shared leadership, or experience repeated discord-induced TMT leader departures. While most firms do not experience smooth transitions to stable shared TMT leadership, a focus on value creation, in conjunction with talent recruitment and promotion, enabled some firms to achieve stable shared leadership in spite of discord-induced departures, engage in long term expansion, and emerge as “centers of gravity” for output and talent in the industry.
M13|When Does Advice Impact Startup Performance?|Why do some entrepreneurs thrive while others fail? We explore whether the advice entrepreneurs receive about people management influences their firm's performance. We conducted a randomized field experiment in India with 100 high-growth technology firms whose founders received in-person advice from other entrepreneurs who varied in their managerial style. We find that entrepreneurs who received advice from peers with an active approach to managing people–instituting regular meetings, setting goals consistently, and providing frequent feedback to employees–grew 28% larger and were 10 percentage points less likely to fail than those who got advice from peers with a passive people-management approach two years after our intervention. Entrepreneurs with MBAs or accelerator experience did not respond to this intervention, suggesting that formal training can limit the spread of peer advice.
M13|The Persistent Effect of Initial Success: Evidence from Venture Capital|We use investment-level data to study performance persistence in venture capital (VC). Consistent with prior studies, we find that each additional IPO among a VC firm's first ten investments predicts as much as an 8% higher IPO rate on its subsequent investments, though this effect erodes with time. In exploring its sources, we document several additional facts: successful outcomes stem in large part from investing in the right places at the right times; VC firms do not persist in their ability to choose the right places and times to invest; but early success does lead to investing in later rounds and in larger syndicates. This pattern of results seems most consistent with the idea that initial success improves access to deal flow. That preferential access raises the quality of subsequent investments, perpetuating performance differences in initial investments.
M13|Choosing between Growth and Glory|Prior work has established that the financing environment can impact firm strategy. We argue that this influence can shape the earliest strategic choices of a new venture by creating a potential tradeoff between two objectives: rapid growth and reaping the benefits of a positive reputation (glory). We leverage a simple reputation-building strategic choice, naming the firm after the founder (eponymy), that is associated with superior profitability. Next, we argue via a formal model that the availability of/dependence on external financing can explain why high-growth firms are rarely eponymous. We find empirical support for the model's predictions using a large dataset of 1 million European firms. Eponymous firms grow considerably more slowly than similarly profitable firms. Moreover, eponymy varies in accordance with the firm's financing environment in a pattern consistent with our model. We discuss implications for the literature on new venture strategy.
M13|Enhancing dynamism in SMEs and entrepreneurship in Korea|Making SMEs and start-ups a driver of growth and job creation requires a number of policies to improve the performance of SMEs, whose labour productivity in the manufacturing sector has fallen to less than a third of that in large companies. The large-scale support for SMEs should shift from supporting the survival of firms to raising productivity. Measures to accelerate SMEs' take-up of new technology and increase their participation in international trade would boost productivity and inclusive growth. Given the chronic labour shortages facing SMEs, reforming the education system to reduce labour market mismatch is a priority. Relaxing the regulatory burden and government control would allow innovative SMEs to create new products and services. Entrepreneurship is lagging, reflecting a higher fear of failure and a lack of skills in Korea. Upgrading entrepreneurship education and lowering the personal costs faced by entrepreneurs who fail would be beneficial. A greater role for venture capital, in part by activating the M&A market to allow investors to recuperate their funds, would encourage firm creation. This Working Paper relates to the 2018 OECD Economic Survey of Korea (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-korea.htm)
M13|Patterns of firm level productivity in Ireland|Productivity is the ultimate driver of sustainable increases in living standards. While Ireland is a high productivity country, it has not been immune from the global productivity slowdown, with the pace of growth on a downward trend throughout the 2000s. Little research has been carried out as to the determinants behind the productivity slowdown in Ireland, and even less so with microdata. To fill the gap, we use a firm-level panel dataset based on production surveys from Ireland’s national statistics office, together with the OECD MultiProd model, in order to identify productivity patterns and trends distributed by percentile, sector, ownership, as well as measures of the efficiency of resource allocation. Our results show a widening of the productivity gap between the most and least productive firms, with the majority of firms experiencing a decline in productivity since the mid-2000s, and also confirm that aggregate results are driven by the impact of foreign dominated sectors, with foreign firms typically larger and more productive. These results are significant in terms of enterprise policy and featured prominently in the OECD’s 2018 Economic Survey of Ireland.
M13|Ekonomická gramotnost podnikatele| Today literacy is the springboard for a successful life. In the current world, it cannot be illiterate. And it is not just literacy in the basic sense, i.e. the ability to read, write and alternatively also count, but to have the whole range of other types of literacy that are usually specified by the adjective before the word literacy itself. One of them is also economic literacy. Literacy is understood as a set of competencies, i.e. the abilities of a given individual realized in the context of reality. The type of literacy then determines what competences, i.e. what area is related. Economic literacy should thus be defined as a set of certain competencies in the economic sphere. The aim of the text is therefore to discuss the approach to defining entrepreneurial competences and defining the concept of economic literacy of the entrepreneur.
M13|Being There: The Role of Mindfulness in the Entrepreneurial Process|The construct of mindfulness has attracted the attention of multiple scientific disciplines. However, research on mindfulness in the field of entrepreneurship remains limited. Research findings suggest that mindfulness through its temporal orientation and wide attentional breadth influences different aspects of cognitions and emotions and is beneficial and cost-effective in a dynamic rather than static environment. Extending these findings to entrepreneurship, I suggest that mindfulness has implications in entrepreneurship because of the environment in which entrepreneurs work and the tasks they usually perform. I propose a theoretical framework for understanding the role of mindfulness in the entrepreneurial process.
M13|Examining business performance of micro, small and medium scale enterprise through accounting records keeping; case study in Ghana|The research study, seek to critically examine and empirically justify the exact role and benefit, financial records keeping does to the performance of start-ups and management of micro, small and medium scale enterprises in Ghana.
M13|Entrepreneurial skills and growth of Small and Medium Enterprise (SMEs): A comparative analysis of Nigerian entrepreneurs and Minority entrepreneurs in the UK|The significance of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to an economy development of a country cannot be ignored. Therefore, the growth of a business depends on the development of abilities needed to execute a smooth running of day to day business activities. Research established the fact that the flat economy growth of region relies on the extent of trade activities in the area. Given this importance of enterprise, this present study aims at developing an understanding of the influence of entrepreneurial skills on SMEs in Nigeria compare with the UK, as perceived by SME owners. The research will benefit the researcher, SME owners in Nigeria, Policymakers, and other researchers. Data collection was through an online survey questionnaire, and it was administered to a population of 38 SME owners both in Nigeria and in the UK. The research followed judgmental sampling techniques to explore their experience, beliefs, and attitudes to entrepreneurial skills because of the limited time frame. Moreover, this survey was used to validate the study conceptual framework and establish an insight on the opinion of business owners of the context. The study findings were that entrepreneurial skills have a significant influence on the growth of SMEs in Nigeria and the UK. However, the respondent in Nigeria and the UK agreed that creative thinking, Problem solving and communication skills are critical for increase sales and competitive advantage. Moreover, the respondent in Nigeria strongly agrees that high level of creative thinking with a bit of problem solving and communication skills will SMEs growth. By contrast, UK minority entrepreneurs argue that great creative thinking and a balance of problem solving and communication skills are critical to SMEs growth.
M13|Entrepreneurship culture, knowledge spillovers and the growth of regions| Entrepreneurship culture, knowledge spillovers and the growth of regions. Regional Studies. An extensive literature has emerged in regional studies linking organization-based measures of entrepreneurship (e.g., self-employment, new start-ups) to regional economic performance. A limitation of the extant literature is that the measurement of entrepreneurship is not able to incorporate broader conceptual views, such as behaviour, of what actually constitutes entrepreneurship. This paper fills this gap by linking the underlying and also more fundamental and encompassing entrepreneurship culture of regions to regional economic performance. The empirical evidence suggests that those regions exhibiting higher levels of entrepreneurship culture tend to have higher employment growth. Robustness checks using causal methods confirm this finding.
M13|Skill variety in entrepreneurship: A literature review and research directions|Lazear’s concept of skill variety has been established in entrepreneurship research and is con-sidered an important extension to human capital theory. The literature on skill variety, its de-terminants and its effects on entrepreneurial outcomes is growing. But especially the literature on determinants of skill variety as well as the relation between gender and skill variety is still in its infancy. Thus, this article takes stock of the academic knowledge collected about skill variety, its outcomes and determinants, its measurement alternatives as well as the role of gender. Overall, it can be summarized that skill variety is an important driver of entrepreneur-ship - above all for the entry-decision into entrepreneurship. The literature on skill variety and entrepreneurial success shows mixed evidence. Looking at the determinants of skill variety, extant literature is scarce. The debate whether the acquisition of skill variety is driven by a purposeful investment strategy or by the possession of certain endowment factors (such as risk aversion or a taste for variety) has not come to a conclusion. Regarding the topic of gender and skill variety, the studies under investigation report negative correlations between being female and skill variety. Measurement alternatives of skill variety used in academic research are diversely and sometimes inconsistently used. This makes it difficult to compare the results of different studies.
M13|Crowdfunding Under Market Feedback, Asymmetric Information And Overconfident Entrepreneur|This article is the first one that considers a model of the choice between the different types of crowdfunding, which contains elements of the asymmetric information approach and behavioral finance (overconfident entrepreneurs). The model provides several implications, most of which have not yet been tested. Our model predicts that equity-based crowdfunding is more profitable than reward-based crowdfunding when an entrepreneur is overconfident. This is because either the entrepreneur learns from the sale of shares before making production decisions or because the crowd anticipates the entrepreneur's behavior when valuing the shares offered for sale. The model also predicts that an equilibrium can exist where high-quality firms use equity-based crowdfunding in equilibrium which contrasts the spirit of traditional results (for example pecking-order theory) where equity represents an inferior security. The latter has rational managers. It also contrasts traditional behavioral finance literature (for example, Fairchild (2005)) where equity is not issued in equilibrium.
M13|Crowdfunding in a duopoly under asymmetric information|Traditionally crowdfunding has been used for funding very innovative projects. Recently, however, companies have begun using crowdfunding to finance more traditional products where they compete against other sellers of similar products. One of the major platforms Indiegogo launched several projects consistent with this trend. This paper offers a model of a duopoly where firms can use crowdfunding prior to direct sales. The model is based on asymmetric information between competitors regarding the demand for the product. It provides several implications that have not yet been tested. For example we find that high-demand firms can use crowdfunding to signal their quality.
M13|Influential Factors of Competitive Advantage Progression on SME Third-Party Logistics in Selangor Malaysia|Small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) of third-party logistics struggle to stay competitive and facing various pressure to stay competitive. One of the tactics to be competitive is to implement effective competitive measures. The purpose of this research was to explore the influential factors of competitive advantage on third-party logistics in Selangor Malaysia. Data collection included semi-structured questionnaires from 370 managers involved in logistics activities from the small and medium-sized enterprise manufacturing industries located in Selangor. Data analysis was used to identify key influential factors of competitive advantage progression. Correlation and regression analysis were conducted to test the research hypotheses. The results reflect that competitive measures needed extensive attention to stay competitive in the market. Thus, third-party logistics needs to cultivate competitive advantage knowledge and other competitive measures that will drive the third-party logistics service uniqueness. The findings may contribute to social change by helping small and medium-sized third-party logistics to improve their survival rate and to create their firm’s sustainable competitive capability and performance and as well provide solutions to challenges facing the third-party logistics.
M13|Firm Dynamics and Multifactor Productivity: An Empirical Exploration|There are indications that business dynamism has declined in advanced economies. In particular, firm entry and exit rates have fallen, suggesting that the creative destruction process has lost some of its vitality. Meanwhile, productivity growth has slowed. Some believe that lower entry and exit rates partly explain the weaker productivity growth. However, the evidence supporting, or invalidating, this view is scarce. In the present paper, we use multi-horizon causality tests and dynamic simulations with Canadian and US data to examine the following question: Do changes to entry and exit rates provide information about, or Granger-cause, future productivity? We do not find significant evidence that entry rates Granger-cause productivity. But we do find evidence that productivity causes entry rates. Using small models with economy-wide data (but not at the sectoral level), we find some evidence that exit rates cause productivity in both countries. This suggests that the decline in productivity growth is partly caused by a decline in the productivity-based exit selection process. However, when other variables, such as measures of the business cycle and the real effective exchange rate, are controlled for, the significance of exit rates in explaining productivity tends to fall. Specifically, business-cycle measures appear to cause both productivity and the exit rate. This suggests that firm dynamics are an intermediate, not an ultimate, cause of productivity growth.
M13|Cyclical fluctuations, financial shocks, and the entry of fast-growing entrepreneurial startups|We analyze a multi-year, multi-country entrepreneurship survey with more than one million observations to identify startups with low- and high growth potential, and we confirm the validity of these ex-ante measures with ex post firm-level information on employment growth. We find that negative aggregate financial shocks reduce all startup types, but their effect is significantly stronger for startups with high growth potential, especially when GDP growth is low. Our results uncover a new composition of entry channel that significantly reduces employment growth and is potentially important for explaining slow recoveries after financial crises.
M13|How Do Banks Interact with Fintechs? Forms of Alliances and their Impact on Bank Value|The increasing pervasiveness of technology-driven firms that offer banking services has led to a growing pressure on traditional banks to modernize their core business activities. Banks attempt to confront the challenges of digitalization by cooperating with financial technology firms (fintechs) in various forms. In this paper, we investigate the factors that drive banks to form alliances with fintechs. Furthermore, we analyze whether such bank-fintech alliances affect the market valuation of banks. We provide descriptive evidence on the different forms of alliances occurring in practice. Using hand-collected data covering the largest banks from Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, we show that banks are significantly more likely to form alliances with fintechs when they pursue a well-defined digital strategy and/or employ a Chief Digital Officer. We evidence that markets react more strongly if digital banks rather than traditional banks announce a bank-fintech alliance. Finally, we find that alliances are most often characterized by a product-related collaboration between the bank and the fintech and that banks most often cooperate with fintechs providing payment services.
M13|Entrepreneurs and Junior Markets: An Assessment|This article shows that a junior market can be an effective financing strategy for growth-oriented entrepreneurs who want to list on a senior stock exchange. We analyze 209 graduations from the Canadian junior market (TSXV) benchmarked with 191 initial public offerings (IPOs) on the senior exchange (TSX). Graduations are as frequent as IPOs, and the probability of reaching the TSX is significantly higher for TSXV firms than for venture capital-backed firms. The growth rate of revenues is significantly higher before graduations than before IPOs, allowing TSXV firms to reach the TSX earlier. Investors value both groups of firms similarly, indicating comparable perceived quality. In Canada, the junior market is a valuable financing strategy for growth-oriented entrepreneurs. It fulfills its role of fostering the development of innovative firms and feeding the senior exchange. However, the choice of the TSXV reduces entrepreneur ownership interest compared with the IPO strategy.
M13|Can government intervention make firms more investment-ready ? a randomized experiment in the Western Balkans|Many innovative start-ups and small and medium-size enterprises have good ideas, but do not have these ideas fine-tuned to the stage where they can attract outside funding. Investment readiness programs attempt to help firms to become ready to attract and accept outside equity funding through a combination of training, mentoring, master classes, and networking. This study conducted a five-country randomized experiment in the Western Balkans that worked with 346 firms and delivered an investment readiness program to half of the firms, with the control group receiving an inexpensive online program instead. A pitch event was then held for these firms to pitch their ideas to independent judges. The investment readiness program resulted in a 0.3 standard deviation increase in the investment readiness score, with this increase occurring throughout the distribution. Two follow-up surveys show that the judges'scores predicted investment readiness and investment outcomes over the subsequent two years. Treated firms attained significantly more media attention and were 5 percentage points more likely to have made a deal with an outside investor, although this increase is not statistically significant (95 confidence interval of -4.7 to +14.7 percentage points).
M13|Verifying High Quality: Entry for Sale|When and how do entrepreneurs sell their inventions? To address this issue, we develop an endogenous entry-sale asymmetric information oligopoly model. We show that lowquality inventions are sold directly or used for own entry. Inventors who sell post-entry use entry to credibly reveal information on quality. Incumbents are then willing to pay high prices for high-quality inventions to preempt rivals from obtaining them. Using Swedish data on patents granted to small firms and individuals, we find evidence that high-quality inventions are sold under preemptive bidding competition, post entry.
M13|Aiming for the Goal: Contribution Dynamics of Crowdfunding|We study reward-based crowdfunding campaigns, a new class of dynamic contribution games where consumption is exclusive. Two types of backers participate: buyers want to consume the product while donors just want the campaign to succeed. The key tension is one of coordination between buyers, instead of free-riding. Donors can alleviate this coordination risk. We analyze a dynamic model of crowdfunding and demonstrate that its predictions are consistent with high-frequency data collected from Kickstarter. We compare the Kickstarter mechanism to alternative platform designs and evaluate the value of dynamically arriving information. We extend the model to incorporate social learning about quality.
M13|Entrepreneurial Discovery Capital|This paper identifies how capital losses are unavoidably incurred in the discovery of viable entrepreneurial ventures. Losses are proportional to the novelty and perceived profit potential of a prospective venture, exemplified by the high risk/high return nature of high technology start-ups. Venture capitalists internalize the costs and benefits of this discovery process, and set up portfolios where the majority of funded ventures unavoidably fail or earn subpar returns. They incur these losses in order to discover the one Winner venture whose outsize returns will compensate for the capital losses in the failed ventures. The investment in failing ventures is unavoidable and necessary to discover the Winner because the winning business model cannot be determined ex ante. I call this investment “Entrepreneurial Discovery Capital.” This paper hypothesizes that many industry and economy-wide cycles may be the result of such a process that occurs at a much larger scale than a single fund. Venture capital in microcosm provides a model of an economy-wide process where the decisions of myriad market participants are coordinated “as if by an invisible hand” by signals from the capital markets.
M13|Do Entrepreneurship Policies Work? Evidence From 460 Start-Up Program Competitions Across the Globe|Many organizations around the world implement programs designed to encourage entrepreneurship, including grant prize awards, accelerator programs, incubators, etc. The goal of these programs is to supply entrepreneurs with early-stage support and visibility to help develop ideas and attract capital; but, if capital markets are efficient, good business ideas should find funding anyways. In this paper, I present evidence from the first global-scale, quasi-experimental study of whether entrepreneurship programs improve outcomes for start-up firms. I employ a regression discontinuity design to test whether winners of start-up program competitions perform better ex-post than losers, where the threshold rank for winning the competition provides exogenous variation in program participation. With 460 competitions across 113 countries and over 20,000 competing firms, I find that winning a competitions increases the probability of firm survival by 64%, the total amount of follow-on financing by $260,000 USD, and total employment by 47%, as well as other web-based metrics of firm success. Impacts are driven by medium-size prize competitions, and are precisely estimated both in countries where the costs of starting a business are low and where these costs are high. These results suggest that capital market frictions indeed prohibit start-up growth in many parts of the world.

M13|Changing Business Dynamism and Productivity: Shocks vs. Responsiveness|The pace of job reallocation has declined in all U.S. sectors since 2000. In standard models, aggregate job reallocation depends on (a) the dispersion of idiosyncratic productivity shocks faced by businesses and (b) the marginal responsiveness of businesses to those shocks. Using several novel empirical facts from business microdata, we infer that the pervasive post-2000 decline in reallocation reflects weaker responsiveness in a manner consistent with rising adjustment frictions and not lower dispersion of shocks. The within-industry dispersion of TFP and output per worker has risen, while the marginal responsiveness of employment growth to business-level productivity has weakened. The responsiveness in the post-2000 period for young firms in the high-tech sector is only about half (in manufacturing) to two thirds (economy wide) of the peak in the 1990s. Counterfactuals show that weakening productivity responsiveness since 2000 accounts for a significant drag on aggregate productivity.

M13|Building Entrepreneurial Ecosystems Conducive to Student Entrepreneurship: New Challenges for Universities|We explore the challenges universities face when contributing to the development of an entrepreneurial ecosystem. The lack of efficiency of policies inspired by the traditional entrepreneurial university model, and the fact that students are more active than academic researchers in creating start-ups, lead to student start-up creation being part of the issue of academic entrepreneurship. The higher the number of stakeholders the broader the ecosystem and the more the challenges for universities actively engaged in their development. Our research explores the mechanisms used by universities in triggering transformation of the entrepreneurial ecosystem when integrating student entrepreneurship. It is based on a longitudinal study of the University of Strasbourg. Our findings highlight the incremental nature of entrepreneurial ecosystem building, the internal changes operated by universities integrating students? entrepreneurship activities in their technology transfer policies, and the evolution of policies oriented to the development of an entrepreneurial culture.

M13|Le financement participatif (ou le crowlending ) aux PME et TPE : mythes et réalités d’une innovation financière|This paper analyses the crowdlending market which is substantially growing during these last years. The objective of the study is to assess the ability of this financial innovation to ease financing for SMEs and very small enterprises (VSEs). To achieve that, we conducted both documentary study of the most important French lending platforms and interviews with managers of these platforms and also with credit brokers. We find that lending platforms are opened to a larger number of companies. We also find that they offer an adaptable funding process for SMEs and VSEs. Their new functioning is progressively changing financial landscape pushing banks to reorganize their credit channel. By ?disturbing? traditional bank credit business model and by providing a new opportunities in terms of financing enterprises, our study concludes that we can consider crowdlending as a real innovative source of financing SMEs and VSEs.

M13|Gender Biases in Bank Lending: Lessons from Microcredit in France|Abstract The evidence on gender discrimination in lending remains controversial. To capture gender biases in banks’ loan allocations, we observe the impact on the applicants of a microfinance institution (MFI) and exploit the natural experiment of a regulatory change imposing a strict EUR 10,000 loan ceiling on microcredit. Descriptive statistics indicate that the presence of the ceiling is associated both with bank-MFI co-financing and with harsher treatment of female borrowers. To investigate causal links, we develop an econometric approach that addresses the concerns of selection biases, multicollinearity, and endogeneity. Our empirical findings suggest that the change in the MFI’s gender-related attitude was triggered by banks through co-financing. Hence, we speculate that co-financing pushes ceiling-constrained MFIs to import whatever biases in loan granting that the banks are prone to. Overall, this paper stresses that apparently benign regulations such as loan ceilings can significantly harm the women’s empowerment efforts made by MFIs.
M13|Investment Strategy and Selection Bias: An Equilibrium Perspective on Overoptimism|Investors implement projects based on idiosyncratic signal observations, without knowing how signals and returns are jointly distributed. The following heuristic is studied: investors collect information on previously implemented projects with the same signal realization and invest if the associated mean return exceeds the cost. The corresponding steady states result in suboptimal investments, due to selection bias and the heterogeneity of signals across investors. When higher signals are associated with higher returns, investors are overoptimistic, resulting in overinvestment. Rational investors increase the overoptimism of sampling investors, thereby illustrating a negative externality imposed by rational investors.
M13|Entrepreneurial motivation and business performance: evidence from a French Microfinance Institution|Abstract This article examines the link between entrepreneurial motivation and business performance in the French microfinance context. Using hand-collected data on business microcredits from a Microfinance Institution (MFI), we provide an indirect measure of entrepreneurial success through loan repayment performance. Controlling for the endogeneity of entrepreneurial motivation in a bivariate probit model, we find that “necessity entrepreneurs” are more likely to have difficulty repaying their microcredits than “opportunity entrepreneurs”. However, type of motivation does not appear to make a difference to business survival. We test for the robustness of our results using parametric duration models and show that necessity entrepreneurs experience difficulties in loan repayment earlier than their opportunity counterparts, corroborating our initial findings. Our results are also robust to a sharper analysis of motivation, focusing on unemployment (on the necessity side) and non-pecuniary benefits from success (on the opportunity side).
M13|Why Fintechs Cooperate with Banks - Evidence from Germany|We developed a conceptual framework to explain why young financial technology companies (fintechs) seek to cooperate with incumbents from the finance sector. Examining 14 case studies on fintech-bank cooperation, we identified three main reasons: first, banks enable a fintech's market entry; second, banks increase a fintech's profits; and finally, banks enable new fintech products. We observed that each of these reasons is related to particular resources, which fintechs obtain through their cooperation partner. Additionally, we found that fintechs use different label approaches to sell their products when they cooperate with banks. Based on these results, we developed propositions that can be tested in future research.
M13|New ventures in Cleantech: opportunities, capabilities and innovation outcomes|Facing the challenge of climate change, innovations that imply environmental benefits create business opportunities for entrepreneurs. This paper analyzes innovation capabilities of startups in Cleantech and how the innovation outcomes of those startups develop over time. Based on the Mannheim Foundation Panel and applying propensity score matching, a cohort of 566 Cleantech startups is analyzed and compared with a control group of non-Cleantech startups. We find that startups in Cleantech have, on average, higher innovation capabilities compared with all startups. However, Cleantech startups are a heterogeneous group including ventures using common technology and those developing new technology. Our econometric evidence shows that, ceteris paribus, Cleantech startups are more likely to combine existing technology in a novel way. Finally, we find that Cleantech startups do, on average, develop more market novelties in later years compared to theirs peers.
M13|An International Comparison of the Contribution to Job Creation by High-growth Firms|The basic principle governing the development of the accounting framework is the choice of appropriate comparators. Firstly, when measuring contributions to job creation, we should focus on just job creating firms, otherwise we are summing over contributions from firms with positive, zero, and negative job creation numbers. Secondly, because we know growth depends in part on size, the ’natural’ comparison for HGFs is with job creation by similar-sized firms which simply did not grow as fast as HGFs. However, we also show how the measurement framework can be further extended to include, for example, a consistent measure of the contribution of small job creating firms. On the empirical side, we find that the HGF share of job creation by large job creating firms varies across countries by a factor of two, from around one third to two thirds. A relatively small proportion of this cross-country variation is accounted for by variations in the influence of HGFs on job creation. On average HGFs generated between three or four times as many jobs as large non-HGF job creating firms, but this ratio is relatively similar across countries. The bulk of the cross-country variation in HGF contribution to job creation is accounted for by the relative abundance (or rarity) of HGFs. Moreover, we also show that the measurement of abundance depends upon the choice of measurement framework: the ’winner’ of a cross-national HGF
M13|Varieties of entrepreneurship: exploring the institutional foundations of different entrepreneurship types through ‘Varieties-of-Capitalism’ arguments|Abstract While entrepreneurship researchers agree that institutions ‘matter’ for entrepreneurship, they also have a rather encompassing understanding of institutions as almost any external factor that influences entrepreneurship. Ultimately, this literature thus comes up with a long list of institutional factors that may explain entrepreneurial differences between countries. But which institutions are most influential? How do these institutions relate to different types of entrepreneurship? And to what extent are institutions complementary to each other in the way they sustain different entrepreneurship types? The literature on ‘Varieties-of-Capitalism’ (VoC) offers a parsimonious theoretical framework to address these questions. Based on the VoC literature, we theoretically derive a consistent set of institutional indicators that can explain differences in entrepreneurship types between countries. Based on principal component and cluster analyses, we illustrate how 21 Western developed economies cluster around four distinct institutional settings. Furthermore, we use simple OLS regressions to show how these institutional constellations are related to different types of entrepreneurship. We conclude that four different ‘Varieties of Entrepreneurship’ can be identified across the Western world. The main implication of our findings is that a ‘perfect’ institutional constellation, equally facilitating different types of entrepreneurship, does not exist. Policy-makers seeking to stimulate entrepreneurship are thus faced with the trade-off of targeting policy reforms to that entrepreneurship type they intend to promote—at the expense of other types of entrepreneurship and the broader societal consequences such reforms will have.
M13|Getting the Facts Right on Born Globals|Policymakers in several countries have recently taken steps to promote the rapid export expansion of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The goal of these policies has been to create successful export-intensive startups, which are often referred to as born globals. These measures are motivated by studies claiming that born global firms are disproportionately important for job creation and economic growth. Using detailed register data on the universe of Swedish manufacturing startups founded 1998–2011, we find that born globals are a very small group of firms whose long-run size and growth do not outperform other exporting firms. We also show that removing continuing firms and spinouts from the analysis is crucial for obtaining correct results. Thus, the notion that born globals are superior to firms that follow a more gradual internationalization process, a conclusion largely based on case studies and surveys, does not withstand scrutiny. Policymakers must therefore be aware that encouraging more born globals need not necessarily lead to large benefits for the overall economy, especially in terms of employment.
M13|An international comparison of the contribution to job creation by high growth firms|This paper addresses three simple questions: how should the contribution of HGFs to job creation be measured? how much does this contribution vary across countries? to what extent does the cross-country variation depend on variation in the proportion of HGFs in the business population? The first is a methodological question which we answer using a more highly articulated version of the standard job creation and destruction accounts. The other two are empirical questions which we answer using a purpose-built dataset assembled from national firm-level sources and covering nine countries, spanning the ten three year periods from 2000/03 to 2009/12. The basic principle governing the development of the accounting framework is the choice of appropriate comparators. Firstly, when measuring contributions to job creation, we should focus on just job creating firms, otherwise we are summing over contributions from firms with positive, zero, and negative job creation numbers. Secondly, because we know growth depends in part on size, the ’natural’ comparison for HGFs is with job creation by similar-sized firms which simply did not grow as fast as HGFs. However, we also show how the measurement framework can be further extended to include, for example, a consistent measure of the contribution of small job creating firms. On the empirical side, we find that the HGF share of job creation by large job creating firms varies across countries by a factor of two, from around one third to two thirds. A relatively small proportion of this cross-country variation is accounted for by variations in the influence of HGFs on job creation. On average HGFs generated between three or four times as many jobs as large non-HGF job creating firms, but this ratio is relatively similar across countries. The bulk of the cross-country variation in HGF contribution to job creation is accounted for by the relative abundance (or rarity) of HGFs. Moreover, we also show that the measurement of abundance depends upon the choice of measurement framework: the ’winner’ of a cross-national HGF ’beauty context’ on one measure will not necessarily be the winner on another.
M13|Exporting a Bit Faster: The Long-Run Performance of Born Globals in Computing|Policymakers in several countries have recently taken steps to promote the rapid export expansion of high-tech small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The goal of these policies has been to create successful export-intensive firms, which are often referred to as born globals. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study born globals in computing using firm-level register data, which cover the universe of firms in a particular country and sector. Using data on all Swedish computing startups founded 2007–2015, we find a systematic positive relationship between the propensity of a computing firm to reach customers globally via digital platforms and its long-run employment growth relative to domestically-oriented computer firms. We find mixed evidence that born globals in computing grow faster in terms of sales or value added. Our analysis also indicates that very few computing firms fit the profile of born globals; only 15 percent of the 250 largest computing employers in 2015 were born globals. Moreover, only 1.5 percent of computing startups founded 2007–2015 were computer game publishers, which arguably have the highest propensity to be born global. Thus, although we find positive born global effects at the firm level, policymakers must be aware that encouraging more born globals need not necessarily lead to large benefits for the overall economy.
M13|Sorting on Unobserved Skills into New Firms|Human capital features prominently in theoretical work on post-entry performance of new firms. Empirical analysis has, however, to a large extent overlooked the unobserved component of human capital focusing on years of education or labor market experience. This paper adds to the literature on worker characteristics and post-entry firm performance by putting the unobserved quality of workers in the center of analysis. I find strong evidence that new firms on average employ workers of lower unobserved quality relative to incumbent firms. Among new firms workers of higher unobserved quality are overrepresented in spin-offs and incorporated new firms. I further show that unobserved quality of workers is important for the post-entry performance of firms as it is a strong predictor of new firm survival.
M13|Ethnic Enclaves, Self-Employment and the Economic Performance of Refugees|In this paper I estimate the causal effect of ethnic enclaves on the probability of self-employment. To account for neighborhood selection I make use of a refugee dispersal program. Results indicate that larger ethnic enclaves, measured as the share of self-employed coethnics in the municipality immigrants first arrive into, effects the probability of self-employment positively, while the share of all other coethnics has a negative effect. Results however also indicate that there is a long term economic penalty to being placed with a larger share of self-employed coethnics, an effect which is partly mediated through the choice of selfemployment.
M13|Immigrant Entrepreneurship in Finland|Abstract Immigrant entrepreneurship is the subject of a prolific economic literature, as well as a source of wide public debate. This is because the participation of immigrants to the business community can provide a significant contribution to innovation and to market dynamics. This report touches multiple aspects of immigrant entrepreneurship in Finland, looking at the years from 2006 to 2014. I find that while the number of self-employed immigrants has increased dramatically, the entrepreneurial rate has been stable. Moreover, the immigrant self-employment rate is similar to the one of natives. I find that the median earnings of foreign entrepreneurs are lower than the ones of Finnish entrepreneurs, but this is driven by the different industry distribution. Finally, I find an overrepresentation of foreign workers and entrepreneurs in the Helsinki region, while the immigrants’ self-employment rate is higher in poorer areas. I gather multiple evidence pointing toward the fact that difficulties in the job market push foreign residents to self-employment. For example, I find a negative correlation between the employment rate and the foreign share of entrepreneurial inflows, and a strong negative relationship between the employment rate and the immigrant self-employment rate at the regional level.
M13|Young Enterprises and Bank Credit Denials|By employing a sample of 20,956 observations of nonfinancial small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) headquartered in the euro area, between 2009 and 2015, we test whether young businesses are more likely to face credit rejections from lenders than their older peers. Our findings appear to confirm our suspicions that new enterprises consistently experience higher denials from banks compared with more established businesses. Such a result is stable to different model specifications and is also confirmed once we handle the issue of sample selection bias potentially affecting our data. Additional tests also reveal that credit constraints are particularly difficult for young SMEs located in Southern and Central Europe, as well as for those operating in the “trade” industry. Overall, our evidence suggests that actions from the policy maker could be desirable to support the viability of credit and, thus, ensure the growth of young businesses in the euro area.
M13|Competition in the Venture Capital Market and the Success of Startup Companies: Theory and Evidence|We examine the effect of a competitive supply of venture capital (VC) on the success rates of VC-backed startup companies (e.g. IPOs). We first develop a matching model of the VC market with heterogeneous entrepreneurs and VC firms, and double-sided moral hazard. Our model identifies a non-monotone relationship between VC competition and successful exits: a more competitive VC market increases the likelihood of a successful exit for startups with low quality projects (backed by less experienced VC firms in the matching equilibrium), but it decreases the likelihood for startups with high quality projects (backed by more experienced VC firms). Despite this non-monotone effect on success rates, we find that VC competition leads to higher valuations of all VC-backed startups. We then test these predictions using VC data from Thomson One, and find robust empirical support. The differential effect of VC competition has a profound impact on entrepreneurship policies that promote VC investments.
M13|State-Of-The-Art Entrepreneurship Theories: A Critical Review Of The Literature|"After a long period of ""semi-forgetfulness"", the academic interest in the entrepreneurship field and in the study of the entrepreneur as an individual has resurfaced in the last two and a half decades. This resurgence is related with the reactivation of small businesses and the emergence of an ""entrepreneurial culture"". Since Richard Cantillon introduced the term for the first time in 1755, several entrepreneurship theories have been put forward by scholars to explain the entrepreneurial phenomenon. This variety of theories causes that this field have a weak conceptual framework. This research, therefore, has a double purpose. On the one hand it aims to review and summarize the multidisciplinary nature of the different entrepreneurship theories. On the other hand, this paper gives a critical review showing the strengths and weaknesses of these theories. In order to achieve these objectives and understanding that the research of these theories continues to be important for the development of this field, this paper classifies 26 entrepreneurship theories into four Mainstreams (Economic, Psychological, Sociological and Management Entrepreneurship Theories). Then, this work summarizes the main proposals of each entrepreneurship theory. Finally, this research presents some critics and limitations to the entrepreneurship theories in order to present some future research directions.From the above discussions, this research concludes that it is clear that the field of entrepreneurship have some interesting and relevant theories. But taking advantage of the renewal fascination with the study of the entrepreneurship field and the multiplicity of interpretations and alternative approaches that have been developed, it is time to refocus our efforts at integrating the diverse viewpoints and to analyze if there are any common denominators within the diversity of entrepreneurship literature. The value of this investigation can be appreciated from two points of view: (1) it facilitate researchers the integration of diverse perspectives that allow finding any common denominator within the entrepreneurial literature diversity and (2) helps to identify specific gaps within the entrepreneurship field that have not yet been studied and that must be answered. So, this investigation pretends to contribute to the study, research and practice of the entrepreneurship field."
M13|Development Of Alternative Finance Models And The Position Of Crowdfunding In Alternative Forms Of Finance|Considering recent developments in IT and the wake of the global economic crisis, crowdfunding has become an increasingly significant alternative form of finance. The aim of this paper is to analyse and discuss the current state and development of alternative finance markets focusing on crowdfunding. Firstly, we define the terms ?alternative finance?, ?alternative funding?, and ?crowdfunding?. The paper continues with the theoretical framework of crowdfunding and discusses different models of this type of financing. Development of alternative forms of financing is analysed based on data from previous surveys carried out in the field of alternative finance markets and individual crowdfunding platforms functioning around the world. Crowdfunding is growing worldwide, and the Asia-Pacific region, headed by China, is the world?s largest alternative finance market, followed by the Americas. In Europe, the UK is the market leader in alternative finance. As individual models of financing are concerned, the most common forms of alternative finance activities are peer-to-peer consumer lending, reward-based crowdfunding, and peer-to-peer business lending. At the end of the paper, we provide a conclusion of the presented aspects of crowdfunding and development of alternative finance. Finally, we mention potentially problematic areas of this type of financing that could be elaborated upon in the future.
M13|The financing of immigrant-owned firms in Canada|Abstract Using recent survey data, this paper examines access to financing by immigrant business owners. We hypothesize that immigrant and Canadian-born owners finance their businesses in significantly different ways and that immigrant-owned small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have more difficulty accessing financial capital. The results suggest that, after adjusting for firm and owner characteristics, financing sources for growth financing tend to be similar for the two groups. Although immigrant owners—notably those in Canada for more than 20 years—were less likely than Canadian-born owners to seek financing from any source, their applications were as likely to be approved. Both immigrant and Canadian-born owners reported that, among seven potential obstacles to firm growth presented in the survey, “access to financing” was the least important. The study finds only weak evidence to support the hypothesis that access to financial capital is a more serious issue among immigrant-owned SMEs than among SMEs with Canadian-born owners.
M13|Classifying Firms with Text Mining|Statistics on the births, deaths and survival rates of firms are crucial pieces of information, as they enter as an input in the computation of GDP, the identification of each sectorâ€™s contribution to the economy, and the assessment of gross job creation and destruction rates. Official statistics on firm demography are made available only several months after data collection and storage, however. Furthermore, unprocessed and untimely administrative data can lead to a misrepresentation of the life-cycle stage of a firm. In this paper we implement an automated version of Eurostatâ€™s algorithm aimed at distinguishing true startup endeavors from the resurrection of pre-existing but apparently defunct firms. The potential gains from combining machine learning, natural language processing and econometric tools for pre- processing and analyzing granular data are exposed, and a machine learning method predicting reactivations of deceptively dead firms is proposed.
M13|The Market Cycles of ICOs, Bitcoin, and Ether|We apply time series analysis to investigate the market cycles of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) as well as bitcoin and Ether. Our results show that shocks to ICO volumes are persistent and that shocks in bitcoin and Ether prices have a substantial and positive effect on these volumes – with the effect of bitcoin shocks being of shorter duration than that of Ether shocks. Moreover, higher ICO volumes cause lower bitcoin and Ether prices. Finally, bitcoin shocks positively influence Ether but not the other way round. Our study has implications for financial practice, in particular for cryptocurrency investors and entrepreneurial firms conducting ICOs.
M13|Caractéristiques de l’entrepreneuriat féminin à Dakar au Sénégal|Cet article vise principalement à mieux comprendre la participation des femmes aux activités entrepreneuriales de la région de Dakar. À partir de modèles théoriques bien connus, nous créons le modèle de l’entrepreneure sénégalaise en mettant l’accent sur la culture entrepreneuriale. Des méthodes d’analyse de données multidimensionnelles, à partir de données primaires collectées auprès de 153 femmes entrepreneures, nous permettent de créer des typologies supervisées de l’entrepreneuriat féminin selon les secteurs (formel, informel). Les résultats montrent que la création dépend du capital humain, social et culturel de l’entrepreneure, et confirment l’importance du capital social dans l’entrepreneuriat féminin des pays en développement.
M13|Cyclical Fluctuations, Financial Shocks, and the Entry of Fast-Growing Entrepreneurial Startups|We analyze a multi-year, multi-country entrepreneurship survey with more than one million observations to identify startups with low- and high growth potential, and we confirm the validity of these ex-ante measures with ex post firm-level information on employment growth. We find that negative aggregate financial shocks reduce all startup types, but their effect is significantly stronger for startups with high growth potential, especially when GDP growth is low. Our results uncover a new composition of entry channel that significantly reduces employment growth and is potentially important for explaining slow recoveries after financial crises.
M13|Can Government Intervention Make Firms More Investment-Ready? A Randomized Experiment in the Western Balkans|Many innovative start-ups and SMEs have good ideas, but do not have these ideas fine-tuned to the stage where they can attract outside funding. Investment readiness programs attempt to help firms to become ready to attract and accept outside equity funding through a combination of training, mentoring, master classes, and networking. We conduct a five-country randomized experiment in the Western Balkans that works with 346 firms and delivers an investment readiness program to half of these firms, with the control group receiving an inexpensive online program instead. A pitch event was then held for these firms to pitch their ideas to independent judges. The investment readiness program resulted in a 0.3 standard deviation increase in the investment readiness score, with this increase occurring throughout the distribution. Two follow-up surveys show that these judges' scores predict investment readiness and investment outcomes over the subsequent two years. Treated firms attain significantly more media attention, and are 5 percentage points (p.p.) more likely to have made a deal with an outside investor, although this increase is not statistically significant (95 confidence interval of -4.7 p.p., +14.7p.p.).

M13|Agiles Business Model Management mit dem Canvas Business Model|Es wird in diesem Working Paper untersucht, in wie weit sich das Canvas Business Model zum agilen Business Model Management für Unternehmen in der Vorgründungs- und Gründungsphase eignet.
M13|Existenzgründungen von ausländischen Staatsbürgern: Aktualisierung 2018|Ausländer haben das Existenzgründungsgeschehen in den Jahren 2007 bis 2016 sowohl in Deutschland als auch Nordrhein-Westfalen in erheblichem Maße mitgeprägt. Eine besonders große Rolle haben ausländische Gründer im gewerblichen Bereich gespielt. Differenzierende Analysen auf Basis der Gewerbeanzeigenstatistik zeigen, dass der Gründungsboom unter den Ausländern ausschließlich auf die Bürger der ost- und mitteleuropäischen EUBeitrittsstaaten von 2004 und 2007 zurückging. Unter den übrigen Ausländern war im betrachteten Zeitraum ebenso wie unter den Deutschen ein Rückgang bei den gewerblichen Gründungen zu beobachten. Die Gründungen von Ausländern weisen teils andere Tätigkeitsschwerpunkte und eine im Durchschnitt geringere wirtschaftliche Substanz auf als die der deutschen Gründer. Diese Unterschiede sind wiederum zu einem großen Teil auf die Bürger der genannten EU-Beitrittsstaaten zurückzuführen, deren Anteil am gewerblichen Gründungsgeschehen seit 2014 aber rückläufig ist.
M13|Regionale Analyse des Gründungsgeschehens in Nordrhein-Westfalen - 2015 bis 2017|Das IfM Bonn hat mittels Sonderauswertungen der Gewerbeanzeigenstatistik und Angaben der Finanzverwaltungen das Gründungsgeschehen in den Wirtschaftsregionen Nordrhein-Westfalens analysiert. Dabei zeigen sich zum Teil erhebliche Unterschiede zwischen den Regionen, z.B. in der Existenzgründungsintensität, der Entwicklung im Zeitverlauf und der Bedeutung bestimmter Tätigkeitsbereiche. Eine hohe Gründungsintensität weisen die Regio-nen Düsseldorf/Kreis Mettmann und Köln-Bonn auf, sowohl im Bereich der gewerblichen als auch der freiberuflichen Gründungen. Gründungsschwach in diesem Sinne sind die Regionen Südwestfalen, Ostwestfalen-Lippe und das Münsterland.
M13|Reform der Einheitlichen Ansprechpartner (EA): Anregungen von europäischen Good-Practice-Beispielen|Ausgangspunkt der Studie ist der Rückstand Deutschlands gegenüber anderen EU-Ländern bei der Implementierung des Einheitlichen Ansprechpartners. Basierend auf leitfadengestütz-ten Experteninterviews stellt die Studie die stärker digitalisierten EA-Systeme in Österreich und Dänemark vor und leitet daraus Handlungsempfehlungen für Deutschland ab. Neben notwendigen Fortschritten im Bereich des E-Government sollten die wirtschaftspolitischen Akteure - u.a. mit Hilfe einer Koordinierungsgruppe - den Aufbau weitgehend einheitlicher, modular konzipierter Strukturen für die Weiterentwicklung der EA-Landesportale anstreben und dabei auch relevante externe Stakeholder einbeziehen. Die Konsolidierung von beste-henden Parallelangeboten sollte im Wege eines speziellen Beirates erfolgen. Weitere Empfehlungen betreffen u.a. den inhaltlich-thematischen Aufbau der EA-Portale, die (indirekte) Verfahrensabwicklung sowie die stärkere Automatisierung der Helpdesk-Funktion des EA.
M13|Regionale Gründungsumfelder am Beispiel ausgewählter Hot-Spots|Im Rahmen der Studie werden Gründungsumfelder anhand von fünf ausgewählten Gründungs-Hotspots untersucht. Dabei zeigte sich, dass Hochschulen für die Regionen als Gründungsstandorte vielfältige Vorteile bieten, insbesondere wenn sie eng mit regionalen Akteuren des Gründungsgeschehens kooperieren. Die gründungsunterstützende Infrastruktur ist hinreichend vorhanden, doch besteht Bedarf einer stärkeren Bündelung der Maßnahmen sowie einer stärkeren Kooperation der regionalen Stakeholder. Insbesondere Kooperationen etablierter Unternehmen mit Start-ups können die Gründungsaktivität in einer Region fördern. Auch zieht die Attraktivität einer Region Fachkräfte wie Gründungswillige an. Dagegen werden infrastrukturelle Vorteile von Metropolregionen mit einer guten wirtschaftlichen Lage teils durch hohe Kosten sowie geringe Verfügbarkeit von Raum und qualifizierten Fachkräften reduziert.
M13|Die Auswirkungen des Gründungsgeschehens auf das regionale Wirtschaftswachstum|Die vorliegende Studie untersucht den Einfluss des Gründungsgeschehens auf die wirtschaftliche Entwicklung. Hierfür wurden die 402 deutschen Kreise und kreisfreien Städte betrachtet. Dabei zeigt sich, dass Kreise mit hohen Gründungsraten nicht automatisch ein höheres Wachstum generieren. Zwar wirken sich Markteintritte junger Unternehmen grundsätzlich positiv auf die wirtschaftliche Entwicklung aus. Dieser Effekt wird bei höheren Startup-Raten aber immer geringer und kann sich schließlich sogar ins Negative umkehren. Vor diesem Hintergrund ist eine spezielle Gründungsförderung nicht per se falsch. Sie wird aber häufig wenig wirksam sein, da sie auch dann gewährt wird, wenn von weiteren Gründungen kaum noch positive Wachstumsimpulse ausgehen. Im Zweifelsfall sollte daher der Schaffung wirtschaftsfreundlicher Rahmenbedingungen der Vorrang vor speziellen Gründungsförderungsprogrammen gegeben werden.
M13|Neugegründete Unternehmen und ihre Entwicklung: Eine empirische Analyse anhand verschiedener Erfolgsdimensionen|Die vorliegende Studie widmet sich der Entwicklung neugegründeter Unternehmen in den ersten vier Jahren. Ziel war es anhand von verschiedenen Erfolgsdimensionen (Überleben am Markt, Deckung des Lebensunterhaltes und Schaffung von Arbeitsplätzen) zu analysieren, wie sich die Unternehmen in der Nachgründungsphase entwickeln. Es zeigt sich, dass fast drei Viertel der Neugründungen am Markt verbleiben. Allerdings schafft nur eine Minder-heit dieser Unternehmen neue Arbeitsplätze. Auch den Lebensunterhalt kann vier Jahre nach Gründung nur rund die Hälfte aus der unternehmerischen Tätigkeit bestreiten. Es zeigt sich, dass dafür beispielsweise eine hybride Selbstständigkeit, ein weiteres Haushaltseinkommen und/oder persönliche Wahrnehmung der Vorteile einer Selbstständigkeit verantwortlich sind.
M13|Brain-driven entrepreneurship research: Expanded review and research agenda towards entrepreneurial enhancement|The advent of significant advances in neuroscience has produced the capacity to examine the human brain at a profound level, yet the academic and practical value of existing evidence based on neuroscience techniques and methods within the field of entrepreneurship remains unexplored. To address these issues, the author draws from entrepreneurship research and presents a braindriven approach as a basis for future in-depth studies on the role of cognitive, affective, motivational and hormonal mechanisms in entrepreneurship theory and practice. To further articulate a research agenda, the author reviews the state of knowledge of existing evidence by content analysis of articles published until 2016. The analysed articles incorporate the use of a brain-driven research perspective in their studies. It is found that although neuroscience affords unique technological opportunities, few studies have thus far benefited from these advances, and among existing studies, only the topic of entrepreneurial decision-making has been partially covered. Building on these observations, the author proposes a definition of brain-driven entrepreneurship research and a research agenda to advance the integration of neuroscience tools and technologies in entrepreneurship research.
M13|A research note on entrepreneurs’ financial commitment and crowdfunding success| Established early stage investors decide to invest in new ventures after evaluating the propensity of success and the risk of failure. Consequently, it is of considerable importance that the founders invest substantial own financial means and are thus highly committed to business success. Despite its key role in practice, the entrepreneurs’ own financial commitment has not yet been discussed in an equity crowdfunding context. Applying a signalling approach, our empirical findings show that entrepreneurs with comparatively more ex ante financial commitment in their venture achieve significantly higher funding success. Moreover, our results suggest that financial commitment is the single most important variable determining funding success.
M13|New venture investing trajectories: A large scale longitudinal study|Investment trajectories of new enterprises are a largely neglected but important issue of new firms' business behavior. This paper debuts in showing robust evidence of new venture investment time patterns by using investment time series of 4.733 new businesses. Based on a fixed effects nonlinear panel regression approach, the study models the trajectory of new venture asset acquisition in the first years after market entry. The results unveil durations and levels of investment patterns. Showing a first investment peak at market entry and a second peak years later, an initial new venture investment cycle is bimodal. Its peak-to-peak duration yields approximately nine years on average. New venture investment can be staggered into three stages, namely an initial, a plateau, and a replacement and expansion stage.
M13|The role of hybrid entrepreneurship in explaining multiple job holders’ earnings structure|Despite the high prevalence of hybrid entrepreneurs among multiple job holders, research on hybrid entrepreneurship and multiple job holding has largely evolved independently from each other. We take a first step for a fruitful exchange between both research streams by building on hybrid entrepreneurship theories to explain why multiple job holders frequently have higher hourly earnings in their second job compared to their main job. Consistent with these entrepreneurship theories, our empirical analysis, based on the British Household Panel Survey (1991–2008), demonstrates that engaging in self-employment as second job significantly increases the probability of having higher average earnings in this second job, compared to being paid employed in both occupations. Furthermore, we explore the roles of gender and household composition in explaining multiple job holders’ earnings structure.
M13|Strategic alliances between banks and fintechs for digital innovation: Motives to collaborate and types of interaction|In times of digitalization, firms increasingly need to form alliances due to the higher complexity and greater dynamics of markets. Digital innovation poses challenges for established institutions (e.g., banks) in adapting to changing rules that are set by new competitors and higher customer expectations. However, young firms providing technical solutions for the financial services industry (fintechs) also face difficulties, such as meeting regulatory requirements. Due to the shortcomings of both banks and fintechs, firms in the financial services industry are increasingly forming alliances. We conducted interviews to examine the motivations of both banks and fintechs to join forces. The resulting motives are categorized as matching, complementary, and neutral. The alliances in our sample can be differentiated into financial investments and customer-service provider relationships, with the second category being most common. However, our findings reveal that the occurrence of particular motives is not linked to certain types of alliances. Building on these findings, we develop a motivation framework and derive practical implications.
M13|The Corporate Venture Capital Exit Decision|This paper investigates an entrepreneur who decides whether to obtain funds from an independent venture capital firm (IVC) or a corporate venture capital firm (CVC) to develop an innovative product. In case of success, the entrepreneur enters a market and competes with an incumbent. The CVC is a subsidiary of an input producer. This input will be required by both the entrepreneur and the incumbent to produce their products. I analyze three different exit routes: (1) IPO, (2) Trade Sale via incumbent and (3) Trade Sale via input producer. I show that the CVC does not exit via a Trade Sale to its parental company due to a loss of demand for the input good. Moreover, I find that the IVC exits more innovative ventures more likely via an IPO, in comparison with the CVC. The analysis generates a number of empirical implications for the difference between IVCs and CVCs and the link between CVCs and the Trade Sale decision of their parental companies.
M13|Capital gains taxation and funding for start-ups|We examine how capital gains taxes affect investment in start-up (i.e., pre-IPO) firms. Using data on capital raised by start-up firms in individual funding rounds, we estimate the effect of the SBJA of 2010, which implemented a full exemption from federal capital gains tax on the sale of qualified shares. Because of higher expected after-tax returns (lower future capital gains taxes), we hypothesize and find evidence consistent with this capital gains tax reduction increasing the amount of investment in start-up firms per funding round by about 12%. We also provide evidence that this effect is concentrated in start-up firms that are likely to be more financially sophisticated.
M13|"""It takes three to tango"": Brain, cognition and entrepreneurial enhancement"|In the global clash for unveiling the 'innermost secrets' of the brain, the field of neuroscience is the most fitting contender. Neuroscience is not quite ready to win the war for now, but it is assuredly equipped to win some battles. Notwithstanding that entrepreneurship is fundamentally a braindriven phenomenon, entrepreneurship research based on neuroscience's tools cannot be counted on the fingers of more than one hand. Grounded on a prior literature review that investigates the state of neuroscience's use in entrepreneurship research, this position paper reflects on the future implications that the utilization of neuroscience brings to entrepreneurship research and cognition. To articulate this exercise, I present the so-called five 'winds of disruption' to signal where to go next in the study of entrepreneurship from a brain-driven perspective. Next I spell out four ways to maximize neuroscience's inputs into entrepreneurship research. Furthermore, I synthesize the value of three neuroscience-based tools to rear and boost 'entrepreneurial enhancement', the ultimate challenge in the orbit of entrepreneurship research.
M13|TV and Entrepreneurship|Can TV influence the entrepreneurial decisions of individuals? To identify causal effects, we utilize a quasi-natural experiment, namely that during the division of Germany after WWI into the capitalistic West Germany and the socialistic East Germany, West TV was exogenously available only in some regions of the latter. Using regional and individual data, we show that, after the Reunification, entrepreneurship is higher among the residents of East German regions with West TV signal, indicating a direct effect of TV on the entrepreneurial mindset of exposed individuals. Moreover, we find second-order effects due to intergenerational transmission, which cause persistent differences.
M13|Corporate Venture Capital and the Nature of Innovation|This paper investigates a model where two corporate venture capital firms (CVCs) decide whether to finance a new venture stand-alone or together, called syndication. The CVCs obtain a cash flow if the venture succeeds. In addition, the venture has a positive or negative effect on an asset of the CVCs parental companies. This effect may differ among the parental companies. I show that the CVC faced with the weaker positive effect becomes the stand-alone investor only if the expected cash flow is low. Otherwise, in equilibrium, there are only syndicates or stand-alone investments of the CVC with the stronger positive effect. However, if one CVC faces a positive effect on its parental company's asset whereby the opponent faces a negative effect, then a syndicate is still possible. The model generates empirical predictions for syndicates consisting of several CVCs.
M13|The Growth and Human Capital Structure of New Firms over the Business Cycle|Recent research based on aggregate data suggests that employment in young firms is more negatively impacted during economic crises than employment in incumbent firms. Using firm-level data, we show that under constant human capital of the firms' founders, employment growth in less than 1 1/2-year-old start-ups reacts countercyclically and employment growth in older start-ups reacts procyclically. The young start-ups realize their countercyclical growth by hiring qualified labor market entrants.
M13|The productivity effects of worker replacement in young firms|Existing management research has so far dealt with the consequences of labor turnover for established firms, but has not addressed its effect on young entrepreneurial businesses. In this paper I assess, both theoretically and empirically, the productivity effects of worker replacement in young firms. Worker replacement isolates labor turnover due to employee replacement as a separate category of turnover and has been shown to positively affect the productivity of established firms in previous research. Using a large and representative sample of German start-ups, I show that worker replacement has negative effects on young firms' productivity that remain even when controlling for moderating factors. These effects are even more negative when the founder does not have prior managerial experience.
M13|The organizational design of high-tech startups and product innovation|"""We investigate whether appointing a middle management level affects startups' innovation performance. Additional hierarchical levels are often suspected to restrict innovative activities. However, founders' capacities for information processing and resource allocation are usually strongly limited while, at the same time, R&D decisions are among the most consequential choices of startups. We argue that middle management is positively related to introducing product innovations because it improves the success rates from recombining existing knowledge as well as managing R&D personnel. In addition, we suggest that the effectiveness of these mechanisms depends on the riskiness of a startup's business opportunity. Based on a sample of German high-tech startups, we find support for our conjectures."" (Author's abstract, IAB-Doku) ((en))"
M13|Intrapreneurs and Entrepreneurs – Do They Differ in Romania?|This study focuses on the theory of planned behaviour in order to understand and to predict the entrepreneurial behaviour of Romanian early-stage entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs, identifying the main differences among them. We first present the individual level analysis of these new venture creators using the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) Adult Population Survey database of Romania from 2011 to 2014, followed by the estimation of logistic regressions in order to test the applicability of the theory of planned behaviour in predicting entrepreneurial behaviour. We aim to contribute to the understanding of differences in start-up activities by broadening the concept of start-up to include intrapreneurship as well. The findings of this study provide partial support of the theory of planned behaviour.
M13|Crowdfunding et diasporas?: le financement participatif vient-il remettre en cause les acteurs du financement diasporique'|Crowdfunding is an emerging form of entrepreneurial finance. Financial flows from migrants and their descendants to their homeland are important. Do crowdfunding platforms disrupt this diaspora financial flow ? Our aim is to contrast and compare the literature in sociology of immigration, diaspora and entrepreneurial finance. The study of this new literature and the interviews with key French “Fintechs” entrepreneurs lead us to propose a first description of this market including typologies of diasporas. We also highlight diaspora members’ motivations to invest as well as the trend of evolution of these motivations with the development of crowdfunding. The main results deal with the balance between emotional and rational motivations in the decision to invest for the new generations of immigrants, the competencies that diaspora members give back to their country of origin and the modification of the hierarchy of financing sources due to the possibility to raise money online.

M13|Between Innovation and Tradition: French Design Schools, their Historical Roots and their Innovation System|Over the last two decades, a new kind of learning programme to promote innovation and ?individual creativity? has seemed to flourish at the global level in numerous universities, engineering and business schools within industrial and emergent countries. If some are really well known, such as the Stanford D. School, many have been created within old institutions. In France, the empirical field of the article, one can count more than 20?innovation/design schools. These ?innovation? training courses are based on participative pedagogical approaches, often mainly related to ?design thinking? methods, linked to new technologies, multidisciplinary projects and prototyping activities. The article aims to consider design or innovation schools in France as a result of the complex interaction between the historical roots of French higher technical education and new education pathways arising from the transfer of an international standardised model that began in Stanford or the U.S. JEL Codes: I21, 032, 039, M13
M13|Equity Crowdfunding in Germany and the UK: Follow-up Funding and Firm Failure|Today, startups often obtain financing via the Internet through many small contributions of non-sophisticated investors. Yet little is known about whether these startups can ultimately build enduring businesses. In this article, we hand-collected data from 14 different equity crowdfunding (ECF) portals and 426 firms that ran at least one successful ECF campaign in Germany or the United Kingdom. We empirically analyze different factors affecting follow-up funding and firm failure. The findings show that German firms that received ECF stood a higher chance of obtaining follow-up funding through business angels or venture capitalists, but also had a higher likelihood of failure. The number of senior managers, subsequent successful ECF campaigns, and the number of venture capital investors all had a positive impact on obtaining post-campaign financing, while firm age had a negative impact. Subsequent successful ECF campaigns were significant predictors decreasing firm failure.
M13|Zur Kredithürde: Perzeption der Kreditvergabebereitschaft der Banken und unternehmensspezifische Kreditmarkterfahrung|Seit 2003 werden die deutschen Unternehmen im Rahmen des ifo Konjunkturtests regelmäßig auch nach ihrer Beurteilung der Kreditvergabebereitschaft der Banken gefragt. Die Antworten auf diese »Kreditfrage« werden sowohl für die Bildung makroökonomischer Indikatoren – wie der »Kredithürde« – als auch für die Analyse von Mikrodaten, d.h. von Beobachtungen auf Ebene des einzelnen Unternehmens, genutzt. Allerdings ist es dabei unklar, ob die Antwort eines Unternehmens dessen eigene Situation reflektiert oder vielmehr die sektorspezifischen, regionalen oder gar makroökonomischen Tendenzen widerspiegelt. Deshalb wird die regelmäßige Kreditfrage seit März 2017 in veränderter Form gestellt. Die Unternehmen werden explizit danach gefragt, ob sie Kreditbedarf haben und wie sie das Verhalten der Banken bei den Kreditverhandlungen einschätzen.
M13|Las microempresas y la reducción de la pobreza en Jalisco, México|Las PYMES y las microempresas se consideran un motor para el desarrollo económico nacional partiendo del desarrollo económico local en los diferentes sectores, debido a la cantidad de microempresas existentes y a la representatividad sobre el total de empresas en un país. El estudio parte de la necesidad de una mejora en la calidad de vida de las personas y de una redistribución más equitativa de los recursos, donde las microempresas pueden ser un factor decisivo para la disminución de la pobreza considerando la capacidad que las microempresas tienen en los diferentes elementos que la integran. Los resultados sugieren que las microempresas generan un beneficio para la comunidad en la que se encuentran y pueden ser un factor decisivo para la reducción de la pobreza.
M13|Are They All Like Bill, Mark, and Steve? The Education Premium for Entrepreneurs|We study how the educational composition and the return to education of US entrepreneurs has evolved since the late 80's. The fraction of entrepreneurs with a college degree has increased, while the fraction of entrepreneurs with a post-college degree has remained stable over time at around one third. The premium of having a college degree relative to a high school degree has increased, but roughly as much as the analogous premium for workers. The premium for postgraduate education relative to college education has increased substantially more for entrepreneurs than for workers: now an entrepreneur with a post-graduate degree earns more than twice us much as he used to earn in the 90's. The analogous percentage increase for entrepreneurs with a college degree is just 50 percent. The sharp increase in the skill premium for entrepreneurs with post-graduate education is partly due to the higher value of their businesses (in terms of dividend payments and firm valuation) and partly due to the greater speed at which they sell their businesses. The premium to post-graduate education has remained high during the Great Recession and is still present when looking at the higher deciles of the entrepreneurs income distribution.
M13|A Scientific Approach to Entrepreneurial Decision-Making: Evidence from a Randomized Control Trial|A classical approach to collecting and elaborating information to make entrepreneurial decisions combines search heuristics such as trial and error, effectuation, and confirmatory search. This paper develops a framework for exploring the implications of a more scientific approach to entrepreneurial decision making. The panel sample of our randomized control trial includes 116 Italian startups and 16 data points over a period of about one year. Both the treatment and control groups receive 10 sessions of general training on how to obtain feedback from the market and gauge the feasibility of their idea. We teach the treated startups to develop frameworks for predicting the performance of their idea and to conduct rigorous tests of their hypotheses very much like scientists do in their research. We let the firms in the control group, instead, follow their intuitions about how to assess their idea, which has typically produced fairly standard search heuristics. We find that entrepreneurs who behave like scientists perform better, pivot to a greater extent to a different idea, and do not drop out less than the control group in the early stages of the startup. These results are consistent with the main prediction of our theory: a scientific approach improves precision â€“ it reduces the odds of pursuing projects with false positive returns, and raises the odds of pursuing projects with false negative returns.
M13|Man vs. machine in predicting successful entrepreneurs : evidence from a business plan competition in Nigeria|This paper compares the relative performance of man and machine in being able to predict outcomes for entrants in a business plan competition in Nigeria. The first human predictions are business plan scores from judges, and the second are simple ad hoc prediction models used by researchers. The paper compares these (out-of-sample) performances with those of three machine learning approaches. The results show that (i) business plan scores from judges are uncorrelated with business survival, employment, sales, or profits three years later; (ii) a few key characteristics of entrepreneurs such as gender, age, ability, and business sector do have some predictive power for future outcomes; (iii) modern machine learning methods do not offer noticeable improvements; (iv) the overall predictive power of all approaches is very low, highlighting the fundamental difficulty of picking winners; and (v) the models do twice as well as random selection in identifying firms in the top tail of performance.
M13|Entrepreneurs, culture and productivity|This paper contributes to explain the persistence of differences in levels of entrepreneurship within and across countries. We analyse in a dynamic setting the mutual relationship among the distribution of preferences for entrepreneurship in the population, public administration efficiency, and entrepreneurial productivity when preferences and productivity evolve over time. Individuals with entrepreneurial preferences start their own business, while the other individuals join the public and traditional sectors. In each generation, individuals vote on the taxes the entrepreneurs will pay. Under a balanced public budget, the collected taxes are used to pay the civil servants' wages. The effort of civil servants captures the effort made to generate an efficient normative and regulatory environment, and it will affect the probability of success of entrepreneurship. The dynamic of entrepreneurial productivity is determined by the relative proportion of entrepreneurial and non-entrepreneurial individuals among generations. We show that an economy can reach two different long-run equilibria: a traditional equilibrium, with a low proportion of entrepreneurs, low productivity, high taxes and an ineffcient Administration and an entrepreneurial equilibrium with a high proportion of entrepreneurs, a higher productivity and lower taxes but enough to implement an efficient Administration. Our main result is that the equilibrium achieved completely depends on the tax policy followed by the different generations. If decisions are made by majority voting in a myopic way, then the initial conditions of the society become crucial. This result explains persistence: an economy evolves around similar levels of entrepreneurship unless some reforms are implemented.
M13|Les business angels, rÃ©vÃ©lateurs, plus que moteurs, de lâ€™engagement des entreprises dans lâ€™innovation|Whereas the funding of the first years of the life cycle of companies is presented as a key condition for their survival and growth, the attention given to business angels (BA noted below) by academics have been growing steadily during the past years. This article proposes to discuss the extent, which they contribute to innovation from a unique database of 432 French companies financed by one of the members of the network France Angels (French Federation of Business Angels networks) during the period 2004-2011. We compare it to a test group constituted of 2,160 similar companies. We specify an econometric model specifying the determinants of innovation approximated by the share of non-financial intangible assets in total assets explained by the presence or absence of a BA and control variables. The use of the estimation method using a Fixed Effects Vector Decomposition method shows the positive effect of BA on innovation. Elements of explanation of these results are provided from a qualitative survey of BA members of France Angels and from a subset of companies extracted from the population of 432 ones backed by BA. They illustrate how the specific behavior of BA at the time of selection of companies and their attitude during the accompaniment period explains these different trajectories.
M13|New firmsâ€™ bankruptcy: does local banking market matter?|This paper investigates the role of local context, with regard to the effect of local financial development and banking concentration, on a new firmâ€™s probability of bankruptcy. Our empirical setting is based on the Logit Multilevel Model that better allows the treatment of data referring to different levels of aggregation (firm and local variables) applied to new firms located in Italian provinces. We find that a higher level of financial development in a province decreases the likelihood of a new firmâ€™s bankruptcy. This result is robust considering a 2SLS regression in which we use instruments for the local financial development and for the concentration of bank branches. In addition, our estimations suggest that the effect of local financial development and bank concentration is shaped by size. Local financial development is particularly significant for small start-ups, which traditionally suffer from great difficulty in accessing credit, whereas local banking concentration reduces the probability of bankruptcy for large, new firms.
M13|Does the Crowd Support Innovation? Innovation Claims and Success on Kickstarter|Online crowdfunding is a popular new tool for raising capital to commercialize product innovation. Product innovation must be both novel and useful (1-4). Therefore, we study the role of novelty and usefulness claims on Kickstarter. Startlingly, we find that a single claim of novelty increases project funding by about 200%, a single claim of usefulness increases project funding by about 1200%, and the co-occurrence of novelty and usefulness claims lowers funding by about 26%. Our findings are encouraging because they suggest the crowd strongly supports novelty and usefulness. However, our findings are disappointing because the premise of crowdfunding is to support projects that are innovative, i.e. that are both novel and useful, rather than projects that are only novel or only useful.
M13|A Universe of Stories: Mobilizing Narrative Practices During Transformative Change|Constructing narratives of transformative change is an important but challenging practice through which strategy makers attempt to influence acceptance of an ongoing transformation. To understand whether and how strategy makers can construct a steady influx of captivating narratives of transformative change, we analyzed how one noted strategy maker assisted the successful transformation of his organization over three decades by orchestrating the production of change narratives. Our analysis reveals that the strategy maker constructed and reconstructed meanings of change over time using three sets of distinct but interconnected narrative practices. We develop a dynamic model linking the simultaneous mobilization of these practices to strategy makers’ ability to harness the persistent tension between novelty and familiarity in a transformative change, and thereby win endorsement from key audiences.
M13|University and Entrepreneurship: An Empirical Investigation in the Tunisian Context|Higher education in Tunisia is currently confronted with the explosion of students’ number. This significant growth represents an important challenge to take up: Improving the quality of education and its relevance to the labour market and promote entrepreneurial culture and firm creation. In this context, we investigate the entrepreneurial intentions of final-year university students in the Tunisian economy by applying the theory of planned behavior (TPB). The objectives of the study were to test whether the TPB can help explain the entrepreneurial intentions of university students; to determine whether students will have intentions to start a business and to identify the key determinants of each antecedent of entrepreneurial intention. Data was analyzed by means of the SPSS using descriptive statistics, hierarchical multiple regression analysis and principal components analysis. In line with the TPB, the attitude towards becoming an entrepreneur, perceived behavioural control and subjective norms were statistically significantly associated with entrepreneurial intention. Most of the Tunisian students indicated that they intended to start businesses as soon as they had completed their studies. Furthermore, some key determinants of each antecedent of entrepreneurial intention had been proposed as entrepreneurship educators to the Tunisian authorities to improve entrepreneurship and the creation of firms
M13|RACE: The Theory of Emergence for Strategic Entrepreneurship|This paper discusses the theory of emergence for strategic entrepreneurship, RACE. It explains the importance of contemplation in developing entrepreneurship among leaders, which would be crucial in attaining strategic agility that is needed for organizational sustainability. One of the difficulties in developing entrepreneurship is due to inability to breakthrough from social needs to self-esteem needs. RACE highlights that contemplation enable individuals to fulfill their self-esteem needs and move towards operating from superconscious mind which enables creativity. Creativity is the link between superconscious mind and universal energy. Through this link, individuals would be able to discover and recover novel ideas that will be beneficial for human kind and crucial for organizational sustainability.
M13|The Impact of Self-efficacy on International Student Entrepreneur Intention|Entrepreneur self-efficacy is the level to which people perception of their capacities to successfully perform the various roles and tasks of entrepreneurship (Chen et al., 1998; De Noble et al., 1999; French, 2009). The research sampled students from two universities in Cyprus. The data was collected through a questionnaire. Statistical Package for Social Science software was used for data analysis. It was discovered that, in exception of motive toward business success and status in the society, emerging small and medium size enterprise do not have motive for economic growth, though the significant relationship between status in the society and self-efficacy were discussed. Conclusively, there exist a negative relationship between selfefficacy and desire for status among entrepreneurs.

M13|Spin-Outs and Patterns of Subsequent Innovation: Technological Development of Laser Diodes in the US and Japan|By exploring the technological development of laser diodes in the US and Japan, this study examines how the existence or absence of an entrepreneurial strategic choice for spin-outs influences patterns of subsequent technological development. The results show that spin-outs could hinder the subsequent development of existing technology when that technology is still at a nascent level, because the cumulative effects of technological development could disappear if research and development personnel left their parent firms in order to target different sub-markets.
M13|How a laid-off employee becomes an entrepreneur: The case of Nokia’s Bridge program|This paper investigates how to support employees to become entrepreneurs. Using original survey data by Nokia, we show two main findings. First, some contents of entrepreneurship were effective commonly to employees with an R&D background and to those with a non-R&D background while other contents were effective to either employees with an R&D background or those with a non-R&D background. The former contents are general knowledge on management, and the later contents are further development of their own specialties. Second, providing a such program to employees had merits to the program provider. Our findings have implications for how a firm to design entrepreneurial programs for employees and to form a business ecosystem around it.
M13|Ethnic diversity in start-ups and its impact on innovation|"""The study analyses the impact of different ethnic compositions of start-ups in Germany on the innovativeness of the new businesses. We are able to distinguish between the ethnicity of the founders and that of the early employees following new results that demonstrate the importance of including all new firms' stakeholders for the firm's success. We make use of a measure introduced by Ruef (2002) and Ruef et al. (2003) which not only takes into account the number of different ethnicities involved, but also includes the unusualness of the ethnic compositions. Our results first reveal that foreigners are an important source of both entrepreneurs and employers. Second, we can show that only really rare combinations, of the founders and employees together, lead to more innovative businesses whereas the more common minorities are even found to have a negative impact on firms' innovativeness.""

M13|Commercialization Strategy and IPO Underpricing|This paper studies the interplay between two defining features of technology-based firms: licensing as a commercialization strategy and the reliance on equity financing. Within the context of an IPO, we argue that the technology commercialization strategy of a firm going public affects information asymmetries and, therefore, IPO underpricing. In particular, we theorize that underpricing will be higher when a firm’s technology commercialization strategy is more based on licenses. We also posit that the size of the patent portfolio will mitigate this effect. Our results from a sample of 130 IPOs in the U.S. semiconductor industry confirm these predictions.
M13|Homeownership and entrepreneurship|Housing costs can damage labour market outcomes and increase unemployment. Also, an important and related research stream claims that higher homeownership rates are associated with fewer new businesses. Using a search-matching model, this paper investigates the relation between homeownership and entrepreneurship by distinguishing two channels through which homeownership affects the creation of enterprises and jobs. The first channel looks at the job search intensity of homeowners, while the second considers the link between the benefit of being a homeowner and the productivity of a new enterprise. The key result of this paper is that the intrinsic preference for homeownership plays a key role in the establishment of new small businesses, while in general homeownership does not encourage the development of existing enterprises.
M13|How Does Firm Survival Differ between Business Takeovers and New Venture Start-ups?|Focusing on entrepreneurship entry modes, we investigate two research questions regarding firm survival: how does the survival probability differ between business takeovers and new venture start-ups? And how do the determinants of survival differ between the two entry modes? Using a large French dataset, we find that business takeovers have a higher survival chance than new venture start-ups. Yet, the differences between two entry modes partially disappear when controlling for differences in founder and firm characteristics. Moreover, we identify differences in the determinants of survival between the two groups, highlighting the distinction between the two forms of entrepreneurship.
M13|Cities and Entrepreneurs over Time: Like a Horse and Carriage?|Entrepreneurship, being largely an urban phenomenon, co-evolves over time with cities. While this relationship is like a 'horse and carriage', it is not a straightforward one, more akin to 'love and marriage'. In this paper I explore the co-evolution of entrepreneurship and cities. First, I provide a stylized model of development wherein the rise of cities (urbanisation) is the outcome of the activities of entrepreneurs. Second, I provide a stylized overview of entrepreneurship and cities from earlier to later stages of development. In young cities a challenge for establishing an entrepreneurial ecosystem is the provision of infrastructure for business' connectivity and energy. Good urban planning and management skills, including urban policing and dealing with land disputes, may be amongst the most sorely needed in the emerging world today. At more intermediate and later stages of development, cities can become entrepreneurial hotspots and even 'global startup cities'. Three main challenges during these stages, as far as the role of entrepreneurs are concerned, relates to (i) rising property prices and rents, urban congestion and fierce business competition, (ii) environmental sustainability and (iii) the impacts of technology that could make centralization in cities for business purposes unnecessary. Entrepreneurs have important roles to play as property developers and in the creation of new business models and new markets. They can be the drivers of 'smart' cities, 'circular' cities, and of sub-urbanisation and secondary city growth. Over time not all cities, and their entrepreneurs, will necessarily continue to grow and prosper. There is nothing inevitable in the rise of any particular city and the prosperity of its entrepreneurs. Cities do not only generate, they also degenerate. I conclude that the heterogeneity, serendipity and context-specificity of global urbanisation implies that there is much that is still unknown about the specifics of the relationship between cities and its entrepreneurs over time.
M13|Enterprise promotion in the road construction sector in a conflict-ridden area in Kenya : a solution for the nexus of developmental problems?|Overcoming the missing middle syndrome by promoting growth of micro and small enterprises through training is a key to solve the nexus of problems including industrial stagnation, inequality, and ethnic confrontation in Africa. We focus on collaborative interventions by an international NGO and the Kenyan government to disseminate labor-based technology of road construction and strengthen managerial skills of youth self-help groups in a county ridden by an ethno-political conflict, called the Post-Election Violence. They tried to help groups formalize as corporations and develop their businesses through training. Our research reveals that ethnically homogenous groups might have better chances to obtain construction contracts but the reason would be trust among permanent members lowering internal transaction costs, rather than ethnicity itself. In conclusion, development of micro and small firms are to some extent determined by education of leaders and internal trust. Trainings could contribute in case groups are equipped with those conditions.
M13|TV and entrepreneurship|We empirically analyse whether television (TV) can influence entrepreneurial identity and incidence. To identify causal effects, we utilise a quasi-natural experiment setting. During the division of Germany after WWII into West Germany with a free-market economy and the socialistic East Germany with centrally-planned economy, some East German regions had access to West German public TV that - differently from the East German TV - transmitted images, values, attitudes and view of life compatible with the free-market economy principles and supportive of entrepreneurship. We show that during the 40 years of socialistic regime in East Germany entrepreneurship was highly regulated and virtually impossible and that the prevalent formal and informal institutions broke the traditional ties linking entrepreneurship to the characteristics of individuals so that there were hardly any differences in the levels and development of entrepreneurship between East German regions with and without West German TV signal. Using both, regional and individual level data, we show then that, for the period after the Unification in 1990 which made starting an own business in East Germany, possible again, entrepreneurship incidence is higher among the residents of East German regions that had access to West German public TV, indicating that TV can, while transmitting specific images, values, attitudes and view of life, directly impact on the entrepreneurial mindset of individuals. Moreover, we find that young individuals born after 1980 in East German households that had access to West German TV are also more entrepreneurial. These findings point to second-order effects due to inter-personal and inter-generational transmission, a mechanism that can cause persistent differences in the entrepreneurship incidence across (geographically defined) population groups.
M13|Cross-faculty proximity and academic entrepreneurship: The role of business schools|Over the past decades, entrepreneurial activity has started to be considered a third mission of higher education institutions. Our study examines the extent to which entrepreneurship at universities is driven by spatial proximity between university faculties. To this end, we use a new dataset that links information on business idea generation by faculties of German universities between 2007 and 2014 with comprehensive data on structural characteristics of these universities and faculties (e.g., number of academic staff, students, industry funding). Our analysis shows that the emergence of entrepreneurial ideas in natural sciences is positively affected by proximity to business schools. This pattern suggests the presence of knowledge flows between university faculties as an important source of science-based and technology-oriented business ideas.

M13|The formation of opportunity beliefs among university entrepreneurs: an empirical study of research- and non-research-driven venture ideas|Abstract Opportunity beliefs, in other words the beliefs of a potential entrepreneur about the feasibility and market fit of a venture idea, are considered as a key driver of entrepreneurial action. The entrepreneur’s existing knowledge plays an important role in reducing the uncertainty surrounding a venture idea, thereby contributing to the formation of strong opportunity beliefs. We develop and test a model which incorporates different types of knowledge that can be considered relevant for the formation of opportunity beliefs. Following a screening of 5955 students at 12 German universities, we identify a sample of 292 aspiring entrepreneurs who evaluate their own venture ideas. We analyze the determinants of opportunity beliefs and entrepreneurial action using structural equation modeling. Empirical evidence suggests that different types of knowledge are relevant depending on the venture idea pursued. Research-driven venture ideas benefit from industry experience, whereas general human capital is important for other types of ideas. We also find divergent relationships between opportunity beliefs and entrepreneurial action. The results contribute to our understanding of how opportunity beliefs are formed and how they relate to entrepreneurial action under different conditions of uncertainty. Our study has practical implications for entrepreneurship education and the support of university start-ups.
M13|Technology entrepreneurship research opportunities: insights from across Europe|Abstract Over the last two decades, the phenomenon of technology entrepreneurship has attracted the interest of researchers and policy makers due to its significant impact upon economic progress. Several authors define technology entrepreneurship as the interface of two well-established, but related fields—entrepreneurship and technological innovation. In this vein, technological opportunities can be recognized and exploited by individuals through new venture creation yet equally can be pursued by individuals or groups within existing public or private organizations. This special section provides a more fine grained understanding of technology entrepreneurship by considering interactions across these individual and organizational levels. We present three studies, empirically grounded within the specific and distinct policy contexts of Spain, Italy and the UK, that reveal new insights on the determinants of technology entrepreneurship. In this introductory paper, we consider the themes and contributions of these papers and provide an agenda for further research outlining a greater use of multi-level approaches to further our understanding of technology entrepreneurship.
M13|Risk, balanced skills and entrepreneurship|Abstract This paper proposes that risk aversion encourages individuals to invest in balanced skill profiles, making them more likely to become entrepreneurs. By not taking this possible linkage into account, previous research has underestimated the impacts of both risk aversion and balanced skills on the likelihood individuals choose entrepreneurship. Data on Dutch university graduates provide an illustration supporting our contention. We raise the possibility that even risk-averse people might be suited to entrepreneurship; and it may also help explain why prior research has generated somewhat mixed evidence about the effects of risk aversion on selection into entrepreneurship.
M13|Pricing shares in equity crowdfunding|Abstract We analyze the pricing of cash flow rights in start-up companies using a unique data set of 44 equity crowdfunding campaigns. Our sample consists of 499 backers who invested during the period from November 6, 2011, to March 25, 2014, on the German equity crowdfunding portal Innovestment. In contrast with all other European equity crowdfunding portals, Innovestment runs a multi-unit second-price auction in which backers themselves can specify the price of an investment ticket. We exploit this unique auction mechanism to analyze backers’ willingness to pay for cash flow rights. We find that campaign characteristics, investor sophistication, progress in funding, herding, and stock market volatility influence backers’ willingness to pay in an economically meaningful manner, while geographic distance, learning effects, and sniping at the end of an auction have no effect.
M13|Drivers of high-quality entrepreneurship: what changes did the crisis bring about?|Abstract This paper examines antecedents of high-quality entrepreneurship in European countries before and after the financial crisis that burst in 2008. In a context of ambitious entrepreneurship, we consider three quality aspects of early-stage entrepreneurship referring to innovativeness, export orientation, and high-growth intentions of entrepreneurs. Using microlevel data retrieved from Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) annual surveys, we investigate whether the role of gender, education, opportunity perception, and motives of early-stage entrepreneurs changes between crisis and noncrisis periods. Our results show that the perception of business opportunities has a particularly pronounced effect on high-quality entrepreneurship in adverse economic conditions. We also find that the beneficial effects of educational attainment on growth intentions strengthen in times of crisis. Finally, the gender effect on entrepreneurs’ high-growth intentions and export orientation appears to be stronger in the crisis period, implying that ambitious female entrepreneurship suffers more in the midst of crisis.
M13|Cross-national differences in entrepreneurial activity: role of culture and institutional factors|Abstract A review of literature in entrepreneurship and public policy suggests that the level of political freedom, corruption, and education are important antecedents to the rate of entrepreneurial activity in nations. However, empirical analysis of the effect these factors have on entrepreneurial activity across nations remains ambiguous. This study proposes that the cultural context of nations moderates the effect of these factors. Consistent with this argument, it investigates the role of individualism-collectivism in moderating the effect of political freedom, corruption, and education on entrepreneurial activity across nations. Macro-level data on 84 nations is obtained from multiple reliable sources and used to test the hypotheses. Results support the theorized arguments and suggest that individualism positively moderates the effect of political freedom, negatively moderates the effect of corruption, and positively moderates the effect of education, on the rate of entrepreneurial activity across nations.
M13|Founders’ human capital and external knowledge sourcing: An absorptive capacity perspective for innovative start-ups|This study explores the role of founders’ human capital in determining the external knowledge sourcing (licensing-in and joint R&D) of a firm during the start-up period using panel data drawn from original questionnaire surveys conducted in Japan. The results of a probit model with an endogenous regressor show that firms managed by founders with a high level of specific human capital, measured as prior work experience in a related field or as technological experience, tend to engage in external knowledge sourcing because of their absorptive capacity. The findings indicate that this type of human capital also promotes R&D investment. Contrariwise, this study finds that firms managed by founders with a high level of general human capital, measured as educational attainment, tend to invest more in R&D as an absorptive capacity-building activity, which may promote external knowledge sourcing. The implications of these findings are discussed from the perspective of economic policy.
M13|Factors Influencing SMEs Engagement in Direct Export Activities|The benefits of trade liberalisation are not shared equally among countries and enterprises across the globe. Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in developing countries are less able to participate in export market than their large counterparts despite various export assistance provision by the government. This study aims to investigate the factors influencing Indonesian SMEs decision and ability to engage in direct exporting activities. The evidences were collected from 271 exporting SMEs and 226 non-exporting SMEs in seven provinces in Jawa, Madura, and Bali regions. Logistic regressions were used to identify the distinct characteristics of exporting SMEs. The findings show that the exporters differ from non-exporters in firm and owner characteristics, perceived export barriers, participation in government export assistances and network relationships. The policy and managerial implications of the findings are discussed
M13|Peer effects and risk-taking among entrepreneurs: Lab-in-the-field evidence|We study how social interactions influence entrepreneurs’ risk-taking decisions. We conduct two risk-taking experiments with young Ugandan entrepreneurs. Between the two experiments, the entrepreneurs participate in a networking activity where they build relationships and discuss with each other. We collect data on peer network formation and on participants’ choices before and after the networking activity. We find that participants tend to make more (less) risky choices in the second experiment if the peers they discuss with make on average more (less) risky choices in the first experiment. This suggests that even short term social interactions may affect risk-taking decisions. We also find that participants who make (in)consistent choices in the experiments tend to develop relationships with individuals who also make (in)consistent choices, even when controlling for observable variables such as education and gender, suggesting that peer networks are formed according to unobservable characteristics linked to cognitive ability.
M13|University Management Practices and Academic Spin-offs|Building upon the recent literature on the empirical economics of management, we posit that different forms of management practices introduced by Universities to support academic entrepreneurship affect how well spin-offs get created, supported and evaluated and, eventually, account for academic spinoff performance. We draw on a longitudinal sample of 790 Italian University spin-offs founded by 42 different Italian Universities and observed over the period 2006-2014. Our results suggest that management practices contribute to explain the growth of academic spin-offs and that this effect varies across management practices (e.g. support operations management vs. target management) and spin-offs’ growth patterns (e.g. high-growth vs. low-growth spin-offs). Drawing on these results, the adoption of management practices by University managers should be carefully considered as they seem to serve different purposes. Their appropriateness can vary and, not surprisingly, some management practices seem to be more effective than others in driving spin-offs’ growth.
M13|The Productivity Advantage of Serial Entrepreneurs|Serial entrepreneurs, who open more than one business, are found to have higher sales and higher productivity than novice entrepreneurs, who open one business. Using panel data on entrepreneurs and their firms from Denmark for 2001-2013, the serial entrepreneur has 67% higher sales than the novice, but also opens firms that are larger in terms of the initial capital and labor, and thus is 39% more productive. There are subsets of firms that perform especially well – serial entrepreneurs that hold a portfolio of overlapping ongoing firms perform the best, as do those that open as limited liability firm rather than proprietorships. Female serial entrepreneurs do as well as male serial entrepreneurs relative to the performance of novices of their own genders. The second firms of the serial entrepreneurs also stay in business longer than the first (and only) firms of the novices.
M13|Squaring Venture Capital Valuations with Reality|We develop a valuation model for venture capital-backed companies and apply it to 135 U.S. unicorns – private companies with reported valuations above $1 billion. We value unicorns using financial terms from legal filings and find reported unicorn post-money valuation average 50% above fair value, with 15 being more than 100% above. Reported valuations assume all shares are as valuable as the most recently issued preferred shares. We calculate values for each share class, which yields lower valuations because most unicorns gave recent investors major protections such as a IPO return guarantees (14%), vetoes over down-IPOs (24%), or seniority to all other investors (32%). Common shares lack all such protections and are 58% overvalued. After adjusting for these valuation-inflating terms, almost one-half (65 out of 135) of unicorns lose their unicorn status.
M13|Personality Traits of Entrepreneurs: A Review of Recent Literature|We review the extensive literature since 2000 on the personality traits of entrepreneurs. We first consider baseline personality traits like the Big-5 model, self-efficacy and innovativeness, locus of control, and the need for achievement. We then consider risk attitudes and goals and aspirations of entrepreneurs. Within each area, we separate studies by the type of entrepreneurial behavior considered: entry into entrepreneurship, performance outcomes, and exit from entrepreneurship. This literature shows common results and many points of disagreement, reflective of the heterogeneous nature of entrepreneurship. We label studies by the type of entrepreneurial population studied (e.g., Main Street vs. those backed by venture capital) to identify interesting and irreducible parts of this heterogeneity, while also identifying places where we anticipate future large-scale research and the growing depth of the field are likely to clarify matters. There are many areas, like how firm performance connects to entrepreneurial personality, that are woefully understudied and ripe for major advances if the appropriate cross-disciplinary ingredients are assembled.
M13|Business registration pillars: Good regulatory practice for ASEAN|Business registration is crucial for ensuring accountable, transparent and viable business environments. By bringing businesses into the formal economy, governments are able to provide more strategic and targeted policies for businesses and consumers. The objective of this working paper is to look at the importance of business registration for governments, businesses and citizens. It explores the this issue through a series of case studies that support good practices in customer orientation and joined-up government. Each of the different case studies fall under a pillar that aims to support countries in the development of their business registration systems.The paper also aims to provide policy directions for countries in Southeast Asia when developing modern business registration systems and provides some background for the development of ASEAN’s regional business registration principles.
M13|Using Crunchbase for economic and managerial research|This note describes a new database on innovative start-ups and companies, called Crunchbase, with a focus on its potential for economic and managerial research. Crunchbase is rapidly being discovered by scholars from different fields. It has notably already informed studies on specific sectors as well as studies of networks in the start-up ecosystem. This note first describes the contents of Crunchbase and then reviews academic research that has used it. We further suggest that many more valuable avenues for economic and managerial research can be opened through the combination of Crunchbase with selected supplementary data sources and provide two such examples.
M13|The determinants of crowdfunding development – empirical analysis in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe|Research background: Crowdfunding (CF) is a method of raising money for projects and enterprises by an online platform. Since around 2003 it is getting popular and becoming a natural method of pre-financing for start-ups before reaching out to investors. The estimations gave the scale of raising worldwide 35 bn USD via CF platforms in 2015. In 2016 CF was on track to surpass venture capital investments. Yet, this method doesn’t progress equally worldwide and it is essential to find out what makes the difference of its development between the countries. Purpose of the article: The aim of the article is to examine the potential relation between: (1) the welfare of the countries, (2) structure of population and (3) availability of crowdfunding. The research is dedicated to the chosen countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) in the period of 2005-2015, giving a perspective of changes in different terms of economy. Methodology/methods: This article, theoretical and empirical in character, is based on international desk research findings. The authors used methods of data collection, organizing and processing information. Moreover, they implemented methods of analogy and deduction, while studying papers, as well as the selection, analysis and synthesis methods. Findings: There is no direct correlation between GDP per capita of the country with it online alternative investments per capita. The richness of the country does not influence people willingness to invest money through online tools. In the countries of average level of welfare, alternative financing is used more widely. Moreover, there is a significant impact of the age structure of the population on the crowdfunding development. Estonia has the youngest structure of population and even there are not many inhabitants and the GDP per capita is average, the country has the most willing online crowd investors.

M13|Capital structure and competitive intensity: Considerations for Start-Up Firms|This short perspective article discusses the effect of a start-up firm's capital structure on the nature and degree of competition in the marketplace. Specifically, the article argues that the nature of financing availed by the start-up firms expose them to the risk of predatory price-based competition from a well-capitalized competitor. The staged model of capital infusion works best when tangible progress can be demonstrated at every new round of financing. Indian start-up firms need to acknowledge this fact, pursue innovations that complement the local realities and develop a distinct local model that justifies the need for additional capital.
M13|Qual a importância da Auditoria Operacional nas PME Portuguesas?<BR>[The importance of the operational audit of Portuguese SMEs]|Atualmente, as organizações enfrentam vários desafios, por exemplo, as suas transações organizacionais crescem em volume e complexidade e estão a viver em ambientes de negócios altamente regulamentados. Portanto, os mecanismos de controlo e monitorização são necessários para avaliar e validar todas as transações, de forma abrangente, para atender aos controlos e regulamentos. Contudo, o processo de auditoria tradicional ocorre principalmente após a conclusão das transações, uma vez que não é viável auditá-las a tempo. Assim, torna possível inibir o risco associado à sua execução. Para muitas organizações existe um conjunto de riscos significativos de erros e fraudes e estes não são detetados atempadamente, resultando num impacto bastante nefasto para as organizações. A atual crise financeira global e os sucessivos e conhecidos escândalos de algumas organizações, como Lehman Brothers, A-Tec, Madoff, Kaupthing Bank, WorldCom, Enron, Parmalat, e muitos outros, levaram a que exista uma forma de prever esses erros e fraudes. Assim, qualquer organização deve estar suficientemente preparada para sobreviver, independentemente do número de riscos a que está sujeito, mediante a implementação de um sistema adequado de Garantia Contínua, com o quadro legislativo e regulamentar aplicável. Esta garantia contínua poderá ser efetuada através da auditoria operacional. O presente artigo tem como objetivo a análise da importância da auditoria operacional das PME’s portuguesas. Através da aplicação de um questionário semiestruturado, e da análise de um caso prático, identificam-se o tipo de erros que podem ocorrer afetando de forma significativa as Demostrações Financeiras.
M13|The Mediating Role of Job Satisfaction between Transformational Leadership and Organizational Commitment within the SMEs of Karachi|The mediating role of job satisfaction between transformational leadership style and the organizational commitment within the SMEs in Karachi is the aim of this study. The correlation between variables is explored through quantitative methods. Total 190 respondents participated from 49 SMEs in Karachi. The results showed that job satisfaction has significant mediating role between variables of interest. This study confirmed that there is a positive strong correlation between transformational leadership and organizational commitment. Employees having high job satisfaction showed higher organizational commitment. Females scored more in comparison to males in terms of overall organizational commitment. However, males have high affective and normative while females have high continuance commitment.
M13|Les déterminants de l’entrepreneuriat féminin à Dakar Sénégal<BR>[The determinants of female entrepreneurship in Dakar Senegal]|The purpose of this paper is to understand the determinants of women's entrepreneurship in the informal sector in Dakar (Senegal). It aims mainly at a better knowledge of women's involvement in economic activities through the informal sector. The paper does this in three ways: first, by defining the informal sector and the female entrepreneur through a literature review; second, by adapting theoretical models in entrepreneurship to the Senegalese informal sector and by defining the concept of entrepreneurial culture ; third, by making a discriminating factorial analysis and a barycentric analysis, based on primary data collected from 153 women in Dakar, to describe a woman’s belonging to a category of creation: creation in the formal or large informal sector, creation in the small informal sector and non-creation. The results show that the woman entrepreneurial activity from one sector to another depends on her human, social and cultural capital and confirm the importance of social capital in the female entrepreneurship of the developing countries where the informal sector is highly developed.
M13|De l’intention entrepreneuriale à la création effective d’une entreprise : Une explication par les réseaux sociaux<BR>[From Entrepreneurial Intent to Effective Business Creation: An Explanation Through Social Networks]|"According to an international study carried out in 2015. in Morocco, it has been found that the transition from intention to start-up is very mixed. Indeed, out of 35.8% of the Moroccan active population intending to undertake, only 1.31% of people actually created their businesses.Indeed, the process of business creation is a complex process and it is usually generated in the environment where strong and weak bonds are present in the creation of businesses.This is why several authors, Colemen (2004) and Granovetter (2004) mobilized the theory of social networks to explain this passage. Indeed, the social networks of the entrepreneur play an important role in the acquisition of the social and financial capital needed to start up the company.From this we ask the following research question: ""What is the impact of the social networks of the entrepreneur on the actual creation of a business project? According to the methodology used by Grossetti and Barthe, (2008), life stories were used in a mixed way.This original method in the field of entrepreneurship allows to identify the characteristics of the joint evolution of the activity and the social network and then to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the processes underlying these dynamics.We opt for reasoned sampling (Thietard et al, 2007). So we will interview entrepreneurs who have created a business in the twelve regions of Morocco.The results expected from analysis of the field data will allow us to corroborate our theoretical model and thus prescribe the best ways to create effective networks for entrepreneurs and creative organizations."

M13|Do Company Builders Create Jobs? Examining the Rise of Incubation Finance in Germany|Over the past decade, new types of business incubation have been developed. One particularly prominent example is company builders, which use their own resources to build up companies, establishing numerous companies in a series. In doing so, this investor type facilitates internal and external business ideas. It offers a new or-ganizational solution that combines both the innovative capacity of founders and the financial resources of a large company with the desire for long-term employment and corporate affiliation. This article examines the economic impact of company builders in Germany compared with other venture capital (VC) investor types on the basis of employment trends in the portfolio companies from 2011 to 2015. It is shown that company builders promote more dynamic employment growth than do other types of investors. This finding suggests that this type of investor is particular-ly well positioned to take advantage of the institutional deficiency in the German VC market. The results are also discussed in the context of the growth of the Berlin-based VC and start-up ecosystem.
M13|Tracking Windows of Opportunity along the Industry Development Trajectory|Opportunity stands for a central category for entrepreneurship research. Entrepreneurial identity is defined with the core reference to opportunity. Meanwhile extant studies highlight important challenges when it comes to discuss the very nature of opportunity. A promising approach to reconcile discovery and creation perspectives is to embrace the notion of time. Thus the aim of this conceptual article is to contribute to existing body of knowledge by providing a dynamic perspective for understanding and investigating entrepreneurial opportunities.
M13|Importance of Creativity of Employees in Adaptation of Food Companies to Innovative Trends in the World|The purpose of this paper is to identify a gap in knowledge and understanding of the need to motivate employees for creative and pro-innovation activities in the organization. Another aim is to provide an overview of innovation in one of the low-tech industries - in the food industry. The concept of innovation and creativity is presented. The characteristics of the concept of creativity have been briefly described. Then examples of ways how food companies are dealing with current trends in the area of innovation in the world are briefly described. Among these trends, the focus on radical innovations has been highlighted, more tightly aligned firm innovation and business strategies, better insight into customers' needs and increased collaboration with other entities. Analyses based on the desk research technique were performed with the inclusion of literature regarding the examples of implementation of innovations in the food sector companies. The conducted analyses allowed us to confirm that exemplary food companies are actively engaged in improving their competitive position, by introducing creative solutions in their products or by new ways of organizing different processes. It has been shown that creativity should be used as the primary source of innovation in the food industry.
M13|An empirical investigation of factors affecting the performance of women entrepreneurs in Harare: a case of food vendors|Zimbabwe, whose economy is under life support; continues to be characterized by company closures with many workers losing their jobs through retrenchments (Nyathi et al, 2018). This fragile economic situation has resulted in a number of Zimbabweans resorting to entrepreneurship as their last option. We note with kin interest that the growth of women entrepreneurs in Zimbabwe has also increased significantly. This study seeks to empirically investigate the factors that affect the performance of women entrepreneurs in Harare. The study adopts a case study approach, specifically focused on food vendors in Harare. Questionnaires consisting of structured and unstructured questions were used for data collection. The research employed purposive sampling to select the target population and 190 questionnaires were completed and analyzed. While consistent with both the psychological and economic theories of entrepreneurship, the results of this study also indicate that the performance of women entrepreneurs in the food vending sector in Zimbabwe continues to be hindered by a serious lack of adequate financial resources. The study managed to come up with two main policy recommendations that are envisioned to go a long way in improving the performance of women entrepreneurs in Zimbabwe.
M13|Female underperformance or goal-oriented behavior?|The purpose of this study is to examine the mediating effect of an owner’s growth goal on the relationship between the gender of new venture owners and the growth outcomes of their ventures. This is a quantitative study using a large, national database and structural equation modelling. Findings indicate that the negative relationship between gender and growth outcomes is fully mediated by the growth goals of new venture owners, their available internal resources, and the amount of time and money they are able (prepared) to invest in their new venture.
M13|Understanding Organizational Renewal from a Multi-level Perspective – Challenges and Advancements|The authors of this special issue 'Approaching Dynamic Capabilities from a Multi-Level Perspective – Macrofoundations and Microfoundations' found their specific way of coping with the challenges outlined in the field of forces, expectations and tensions that characterize multi-level research. There is a considerable advancement as the authors contribute to construct specifications on a theoretical basis and either prepare the next steps for multi-level empirical analyses concisely or even present empirical data. It is interesting to note that three out of five papers contribute to macrofoundations of DCs. It seems to be an issue of current research that has the potential to gain equally high interest in the future as microfoundations have nowadays.
M13|Towards a Regional Dynamic Capability View – Components of Macrofoundation|The paper outlines components of a regional dynamic capability view (RDCV) considering the interdependence between regional and firm development. It is aiming at enhancing the multilevel perspective of the dynamic capability view (DCV) with respect to upper-level dynamics and mechanisms of organizational renewal. For this macrofoundation components from new institutionalism and regional studies enrich the DCV. The outline treats the interconnected ecosystem of regional firms and institutions as the unit of analysis, gives emphasis to institutional entrepreneurs in their pivotal role for sensemaking and to the middleground as a supporting organizational form for enhancing enactment as the key prerequisites for allocating resources in a new manner. The RDCV especially outlines the process of seizing. The example of the recent transformation of the Ruhr area serves as an illustration for the relevance of the theoretical considerations. In order to prepare empirical analyses, the paper, moreover, outlines a research design for data collection and evaluation based on a mixed-method approach combining document analysis with participating observation aiming at an operationalization of second-order constructs during the process of data evaluation. The contribution is considered as an invitation to other researchers to build on an RDCV mutually.
M13|Distributed Ledger Technologies for Developing Asia|This paper takes a first pass at assessing areas of implementation for distributed ledger (or blockchain) technology in the context of development finance. It identifies five use cases, including digital identity, trade finance, project aid monitoring, smart energy, and supply chain management. A discussion of the main benefits, risks and implementation challenges suggests that experimentation with distributed ledger technology can produce immediate significant benefits in some areas, while others require further research and investment, as well as additional technical, infrastructural, or regulatory development. Development lenders can play a role in helping unleash these technologies’ positive developmental impact throughout the Asian region.
M13|The Effects of High Growth on New Business Survival|High-growth, young businesses have received increased attention in the research and policy sphere because of their job creation potential. However, relatively less attention has focused on the effects of high growth on firm survival and its implications for job creation and destruction dynamics. This paper analyzes the effect of high employment growth on the survival of new establishments and the survival patterns of high-growth firms in the U.S. State of Georgia. We use the National Establishment Time-Series (NETS) data to examine the new establishments that started between 1990 and 1999 and trace their employment dynamics through 2008. We analyze how early-stage employment growth impacts the survival rate of these establishments. Our analysis provides evidence that high employment growth early in their life cycle significantly reduces the likelihood of subsequent failure.
M13|The role of Innovation Hubs taking start-ups from idea to business. The case of Nairobi, Kenya|"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the start-up scene in sub-Saharan Africa. ""Silicon Savannah"" is today widely used to describe the thriving IT industry in and around Nairobi. Kenya's geographical advantage, its favorable economic reforms, and mature start-up ecosystem makes it stands out positively. Since a lot of hype exists around the start-up scene many investors are drawn to it, but in reality very few start-ups are investment-ready. The increasing start-up requirements and needs force incubators to diversify their offer. In contrast, to traditional incubators, an Innovation Hub (Hub) is characterized based on the concept of open innovation and collaboration. A Hub nurtures an enabling environment where a community of entrepreneurs can grow. At the same time, it serves as a nexus point for the local start-up community, investors, academia, technology companies and the wider private sector. It aims to create a structure where people serendipitously interact with others that they would not typically meet. Considering the great interest for and the large amounts of money invested in Hubs by governments, universities, private companies and other interested parties, not only researchers have been raising the question of the actual benefit of Hubs. This research study aims to investigate to what extent the support offered by the Hubs is tackling the challenges faced by start-ups in Nairobi, Kenya. The analysis can serve as a basis for identifying strength and weaknesses in the Hub models."
M13|Characteristics of high-growth entrepreneurs in Latin America|Abstract Scholars and governments presumed that growing the rate of entrepreneurs would naturally result in economic and job growth, and entrepreneurship has widely been viewed as an important tool for developing economies. Yet recently scholars have questioned the empirical evidence regarding the actual contribution of entrepreneurship to economic development. Recent contributions to the field suggest that not all entrepreneurial activity has a positive effect on economic growth in developing regions. The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) provides a unique lense in assisting the predictive capability of entrepreneurial motivation. In this research, we focus on what factors influence the motivation of some entrepreneurs to seek a high-growth model as these growth oriented entrepreneurs, usually associated with opportunity-motivated firm founding, are the most likely to actually create jobs in developing countries. We utilize motivation for founding, five entrepreneurial competencies and three firm characteristics to predict growth expectations of entrepreneurial growth expectations. Leveraging responses to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor survey from more than 100,000 entrepreneurs in 19 Latin American countries, we discovered the existence of a triple interaction effect amongst opportunity-based entrepreneurs with higher levels of education and an export orientation and their growth expectations. In discussing the results, we reflect on the public policy implications for promoting the desired types of entrepreneurship in developing regions.
M13|AHP Competency Model in the Service Chain Industry|Due to the increasing importance of the service industry and the highlyÂ competitive environment in the chain business, it is essential for enterprises toÂ develop their own core competitiveness in industry. This study discusses theÂ high-level managerâ€™s competency development model in the chain business fromÂ the perspective of competency-based human resource management. This studyÂ develops the competency model using a literature review and expert interview andÂ divides the competency model into three major factors including â€œcoreÂ competencyâ€ , â€œmanagement competencyâ€ and â€œspecialized competency,â€ andÂ further divides the three factors into 15 sub-factors. To understand the weight ratioÂ and importance order of the major and sub-factors, this study adopts the analyticÂ hierarchy process (AHP) method to conduct a three-level and four-combinationÂ analysis. This study reveals that in the second level of analysis, mid- andÂ high-level managers share the same view points,and a mid-level manager shouldÂ focus on building up the â€œcore competencyâ€ , hereas a high-level manager shouldÂ focus on the â€œmanagement competencyâ€ ; At the third level of analysis of theÂ sub-factors, this study present conflicting point of views between mid andÂ high-level managers. Mid-level managers believe that they should concentrateÂ more on â€œorganization commitmentâ€ , â€œfranchise development,â€ and â€œtargetÂ executionâ€ , hereas high-level managers see â€œindignity,â€ , â€œbranch management,â€ Â and â€œtarget executionâ€ as the main competency for mid-level managers.JEL classification numbers: M13; M14; M38Keywords: Competency, Chain Service Industry, Analytical Hierarchy ProcessÂ (AHP)
M13|Groupon, m-commerce and mobile apps: Perceptions of small business owners and consumers|This study analyzes the digital and mobile commerce market from the perspectiveÂ of both consumers and small business owners in a particular urban area. TwoÂ surveys were conducted, one from a consumer perspective and the second fromÂ the small business owners' perspective. The surveys asked about use of andÂ perceptions of Groupon and other mobile coupon deals. Preliminary findingsÂ suggest that while consumers are likely to use mobile apps to make purchases andÂ save money, small business owners consider Groupon deals risky and are lessÂ likely to use them to help drive sales and attract new customers. The paperÂ concludes with recommendations for business owners to design digital deals thatÂ maximize consumer engagement as well as new revenue generation, thusÂ minimizing the risk expressed in the business owner surveys.JEL classification numbers: M13, M31Keywords: mobile apps, Groupon, mobile deals, daily deals, digital marketing,Â small business, entrepreneurship
M13|Does Business Cycle Have an Impact on Entrants and Exits?|Purpose: The role of entrants and exits has enlarged indisputably over recent years. The basic explanation is connected to the deepening of innovation's influence on industrial growth. Furthermore, new businesses have to be more effective, and based on products, technological or organizational innovations, and exits have to be ineffective (respectively unprofitable), based on denoted products or technology. Design/methodology/approach: According to the above-mentioned prerequisites, policymakers need to manage the role (respectively the impact) that entrants (new start-up companies) and exits play in industrial growth. Nevertheless, this impact is not a cornerstone of the Bulgarian National Strategy, or the Europe 2020 Strategy. Findings: The paper tries to answer the following two questions: 1) Do new start-up companies and exits have any role and influence on economic growth in Bulgaria? and 2) Does the role (respectively the impact) of entrants and exits in industrial growth change according to economic cycle? Research limitations/implications: In addition, according to the Lisbon Strategy, as well as the European Union's (EU) Strategy 2020, the current economic policy supports entrepreneurship and innovations. Thus, the establishment of innovative companies, as well as the development of innovative, incumbent business are core issues of EU economic policy for the past decade. Originality/value: The paper builds on the industrial dynamic methodology and on the understanding of how business decisions (entrepreneurship, innovations, and R&D) on micro level correspond to macro level (GDP growth and innovation policy).
M13|Intuitive versus Contemplative: Do Entrepreneurs differ in their Decision-Making Style from Managers and Employees?|We examine in a large survey (n = 1,928) how contemplative entrepreneurs, managers and employees are in their decision making styles. Besides two well-known subjective measures taken from psychology, we also build on Rubinstein (2016) by including two objective measures derived from response times and the nature of the strategic choices made. Supporting conventional wisdom, we find that entrepreneurs have a stronger subjective Faith in Intuition than others. Their actual action choices are partly in line with this: entrepreneurs make indeed more intuitive choices than managers, but are equally intuitive as employees. At the same time entrepreneurs have response times and a subjective Need for Cognition that (on average) equal those of managers. Together these findings tentatively suggest that entrepreneurs start from a stronger prior intuition, making them ceteris paribus more intuitive than others, but at the same time share with managers a higher need for cognition, and thus take more time to think things over.
M13|Fission, forking and fine tuning|Perhaps because we live in the age of the Internet and social networks, everyone seems agreed that innovation is all about recombination. Although not fully dissenting from this consensus, and perhaps in the end affirming it in an important way, I want to draw attention to some apparently different mechanisms of innovation, both suggested by Adam Smith: subdivision (or differentiation) and fine-tuning. On the surface at least, these – especially the second – do not appear to be processes of recombination. I will attempt to elucidate what I mean by these concepts and try to think about how they fit together with recombination in a full Smithian account of innovation. Whether innovation proceeds from the top down or the bottom up depends crucially on the structure of complementary stages in the process of production. Especially if it takes place in a non-modular way, recombination may require unified decision rights, implying the vertical integration of complementary stages of production, in order to overcome the dynamic transaction costs of change. But the processes of subdivision and differentiation may also require changes in decision rights in order to overcome dynamic transaction costs. I illustrate these points with a case study of three generations of an American family of inventor-entrepreneurs in electricity and electronics.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
M13|Nascent Entrepreneurship and Race: Evidence from the GATE Experiment|We examine white-black disparities in the labor market outcomes of nascent entrepreneurs using data from Project GATE, an experimental-design entrepreneurship training program. Findings show that white nascent entrepreneurs who applied for the program were more successful than their black peers in starting a business, becoming self-employed, and achieving high earnings. These disparities were largely because whites were more likely to have access to start-up financing and – to a lesser extent – because whites had more human capital and business background. The program was found effective in helping both white and black nascent entrepreneurs to start a business and become self-employed, but there is limited evidence that it reduced white-black entrepreneurship gaps.
M13|A Tale of Two Cities: An Examination of Medallion Prices in New York and Chicago|This paper examines the institution of taxicab medallions in two of the largest cities of the U.S.: New York and Chicago and changes in the prices of those medallions during the period 2009-2016 (for New York City) and 2007-2016 (for Chicago). We document a drop of roughly 50% in the prices of these medallions in New York and roughly 80% in Chicago from their peak in 2013/2014 to the present. We also find that medallion prices are positively correlated with taxicab revenues and negatively correlated with proxies for the intensity of adoption of Uber and Lyft in both cities.
M13|Cognition in design management. At the intersection of conceptual innovation and design thinking|Design thinking has been a growing topic over the past years in management literature. The novelty brought by this approach to managing innovation processes is not simply due to an enriched set of phases and principles, but it rests on the way innovation opportunities are framed through design. We suggest that the design thinking approach helps to deal with an inner and deeper level of each innovation process, that is the conceptual one. Counterintuitively, we argue, that this process of conceptual innovation starts much earlier than the Òconcept generation phaseÓ already enucleated within the design thinking process. Drawing on most recent contributions on the cognitive nature of innovation processes, the paper aims at investigating the conceptual innovation mechanisms that are at play in design thinking dynamics. Through a multiple case study of three iconic design innovations in Italy, that revolutionized the way a scooter, a moka or a shop was conceived, and gave rise to a new generation of products and concept shops, we have identified the three phases of the design thinking in each innovation process and detected the mechanisms of conceptual innovation operating in each of them.
M13|Man vs. Machine in Predicting Successful Entrepreneurs: Evidence from a Business Plan Competition in Nigeria|We compare the relative performance of man and machine in being able to predict outcomes for entrants in a business plan competition in Nigeria. The first human predictions are business plan scores from judges, and the second are simple ad-hoc prediction models used by researchers. We compare these (out-of-sample) performances to those of three machine learning approaches. We find that i) business plan scores from judges are uncorrelated with business survival, employment, sales, or profits three years later; ii) a few key characteristics of entrepreneurs such as gender, age, ability, and business sector do have some predictive power for future outcomes; iii) modern machine learning methods do not offer noticeable improvements; iv) the overall predictive power of all approaches is very low, highlighting the fundamental difficulty of picking winners; and v) our models can do twice as well as random selection in identifying firms in the top tail of performance.
M13|Entrepreneurship and industrial clusters: evidence from China industrial census|Abstract This article studies the synergy effect of entrepreneurship on China’s industrial cluster. We propose an extension to Duranton and Overman’s (The Review of Economic Studies, 72(4), 1077–1106. https://doi.org/10.1111/0034-6527.00362 , 2005) method which enables us to delimit industrial cluster in space. A cross-sectional model is identified with historical measures of local entrepreneur potential in the spirit of Chinitz (The American Economic Review, 51(2), 279–289, 1961). Alternatively, we use lagged cluster and entrepreneurship variables to mitigate the endogeneity problem. We find that measures of entrepreneurship contribute significantly to the cluster formation, the cluster size, and the cluster strength. The causality remains strong even when we control for lagged cluster variables. Out of the factors proposed by the NEG theory, access to sea ports, light industry, localization economies, urban population density, and market potential are generally found to benefit cluster. Most of the results are robust to alternative measures of entrepreneurship and instrumental variable.
M13|The European venture capital landscape: an EIF perspective. Volume III: Liquidity events and returns of EIF-backed VC investments|Despite the sometimes intensive media coverage and exuberant storytelling around the industry, venture capital (VC) investors tend to operate in highly opaque markets. On this premise, this work contributes to the literature via a hand-collected dataset of about 3,600 EIF-backed VC investments made in the 1996-2015 period, with the aim to analyse their liquidity events and returns. The paper finds, inter alia, that VC returns show sensitivity to the economic cycle. At the same time, it discusses how their heterogeneity leaves room for VC firms to pursue diversification strategies and minimise the correlation with other asset classes. Moreover, this work provides preliminary evidence in support of the often claimed heuristic that VC returns follow a power-law. Finally, it employs competing risks models to analyse time-to-outcome data, observing that VC firm experience only relates positively to performance when outstanding (e.g. 3rd generation fund or above). However, this may also be a reflection of EIF's high-standard screening of first-time VC teams. The paper is structured as follows. Section 1 introduces the key research motivations, while section 2 discusses the features of the analysed dataset. Section 3 provides a descriptive overview of the data, while section 4 discusses the statistical test of power-law behaviour. Section 5 explores exit outcomes against the background of profitable or unprofitable trade sales. Last, section 6 analyses the determinants of exit outcomes. Section 7 concludes.
M13|The European venture capital landscape: an EIF perspective. Volume IV: The value of innovation for EIF-backed startups|The creation of value through innovation is among the defining traits of new technology-driven ventures. In this paper we contribute to the literature by investigating the value of innovations for start-ups supported by EIF in the years 1996 to 2014, as measured through patent applications. The paper is structured around two main parts. The first part presents a series of descriptive statistics on EIF's VC investee patent portfolio and discusses some of the strategic aspects of patenting, such as timing and geographical coverage. The second part develops an econometric model to estimate the Euro-value of innovations based on patent renewal data, following the seminal work of Pakes and Schankerman (1984). We observe that start-ups are efficient at transforming financial capital obtained through VC financing into innovative capital. On average, for every Euro of EIF-supported VC financing, start-ups generated 2.74 Euro of private innovation value.
M13|Do Company Builders Create Jobs? Examining the Rise of Incubation Finance in Germany|Over the past decade, new types of business incubation have been developed. One particularly prominent example is company builders, which use their own resources to build up companies, establishing numerous companies in a series. In doing so, this investor type facilitates internal and external business ideas. It offers a new organizational solution that combines both the innovative capacity of founders and the financial re-sources of a large company with the desire for long-term employment and corporate affiliation. This article examines the economic impact of company builders in Germany compared with other venture capital (VC) investor types on the basis of employment trends in the portfolio companies from 2011 to 2015. It is shown that company builders promote more dynamic employment growth than do other types of investors. This finding suggests that this type of investor is particularly well positioned to take advantage of the institutional deficiency in the German VC market. The results are also discussed in the context of the growth of the Berlin-based VC and start-up ecosystem.
M13|A replication of ‘Entry regulation and entrepreneurship: a natural experiment in German craftsmanship’|Rostam-Afschar (2014) analyzes the impact of the deregulation of the German Trade and Crafts Code of 2004 on entrepreneurial activity, using German microcensus (MC) data. He finds a positive effect on market entry and self-employment and no change in exit probabilities. As these results partially conflict with company registry data, we re-examine the causal effects. Most importantly, we generate a novel classification scheme that aims to achieve an improved identification of crafts trades. Non-craftsmen need to be removed from the analysis as the policy change exclusively pertains to the crafts sector. In contrast to Rostam-Afschar’s findings, the increase in self-employment and entry is more pronounced in the completely deregulated B-trades rather than the partially deregulated A-trades. In addition, exit probabilities do not remain constant but rather increase. Our results are in line with company registry data.
M13|Business takeovers and firm growth: Empirical evidence from a German panel|The present article links business takeovers to the literature on serial autocorrelation of growth rates. The aim of the study is to identify the effects of successions on the performance of small German firms by analysing the growth pathways over a period of eight years after business takeover. Using panel data from 1,872 firms, the present article shows that for the first two years after a business takeover, small firms are subject to negative serial correlation of growth rates regarding employment. The analysis underlines the importance of longitudinal data to provide evidence on changes in the behaviour of a firm following a business takeover.
M13|Who creates jobs? Econometric modeling and evidence for Austrian firm level data|This paper provides evidence on the role of firm size and firm age for firm level net job creation in the Austrian economy between 1993 and 2013 and during the Great Recession. We propose a new estimation strategy based on a two-part model to decompose behavioral differences between exiting and surviving firms. Young firms contribute most to net job creation, despite high relative exit rates, due to high growth rates among young surviving firms. Small firms have similar job creation rates conditional on survival as large firms. Small firms' contribution to job creation is, however, smaller due to higher exit rates. The up-or-out dynamics characterizing less regulated economies such as the US also apply to the more regulated Austrian economy. During the Great Recession both the relative net job creation rate conditional on survival and the relative survival probability of young firms decreased. The relative contribution of small firms to net job creation, by contrast, increased due to increased relative job creation rates of small firms conditional on survival.
M13|How economic freedom affects opportunity and necessity entrepreneurship in the OECD countries|This research addresses the extent to which economic freedom, understood as market economy-oriented institutions and policies, matters for opportunity entrepreneurship and necessity entrepreneurship. To this end, we carry out a panel data dynamic analysis in the OECD countries during the period 2001–2012 by using the system Generalized Method of Moments estimator. We examine the relationship between the Fraser Institute's economic freedom index and its five areas, and both indicators from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor on opportunity entrepreneurship and necessity entrepreneurship. We find that economic liberalization tends to encourage opportunity entrepreneurship and to discourage necessity entrepreneurship. In particular, opportunity entrepreneurship seems to benefit from improvements in legal structure and security of property rights and in regulation of credit, labor, and business, while both aspects and more freedom to trade internationally seem to damage necessity entrepreneurship.
M13|The gender gap in entrepreneurship – The role of peer effects|In virtually all industrialized countries, women are underrepresented in entrepreneurship, and the gender gap exhibits a remarkable persistence. We examine one particular source of persistence, namely the prevalence of gendered peer influences. We study how early career entrepreneurship is affected by existing entrepreneurship among neighbors, family members, and recent schoolmates. Based on an instrumental variables strategy, we identify strong and heavily gendered peer effects. While men are more influenced by other men, women are more influenced by other women. We estimate that differences between male and female peer groups explain approximately half of the gender gap in early career entrepreneurship.
