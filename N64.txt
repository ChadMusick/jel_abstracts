N64|The Impact of the 1932 General Tariff: A Difference-in-Difference Approach|We evaluate the effect of the 1932 British General Tariff on the output, labour productivity and employment growth of British industries. We provide a new disaggregated data set that matches industry-level Census of Production data with industry-specific tariff rates to accurately isolate treatment and control groups and estimate the effect of the General Tariff using difference-in-difference regressions. We evaluate a two-group comparison, between newly and non-newly protected industries, and a three-group comparison, between non-newly protected industries and newly protected industries further divided into those given a baseline 10 percent tariff rate and those given additional tariffs. In the two-group comparison, we identify a tariff effect that is large and statistically significant on output and productivity. In the three-group comparison, we show that the positive output and productivity effects of the tariff arise from the additional tariff protection, over and above the 10 percent level. These effects are observed over the periods 1930-35 and 1930-48, suggesting both short-run and medium-term effects on output and productivity of UK industries protected by the 1932 General tariff.
N64|Why Was Unemployment so Low in Postwar Sweden? An Analysis with New Unemployment Data by Manufacturing Industry, 1935-1948|Sweden is often cited as one of the starkest examples of a country where corporatist policy structures and centralized wage bargaining produced remarkable economic and social outcomes in the postwar golden years. Not surprisingly, previous explanations for Sweden’s full employment period have emphasized this set of labor market institutions which was in place from the 1950s. Alternatively, temporary demand-factors in connection with the Second World War have been stressed as a cause. In this paper, I examine the development of unemployment in Sweden in the 1930s and 1940s and establish two facts: i) unemployment fell continuously from the mid-1930s until immediately after the end of the Second World War, resulting in the low levels of unemployment that would characterize the postwar period, and ii) inflation did not spiral as a result, suggesting restraint in wages over the same period. The fact that unemployment fell before the establishment of Sweden’s postwar labor market institutions suggest that they were not the cause for the full employment economy. The absence of escalating inflation likewise rules out temporary demand-factors such as Keynesian economic stimulus and military conscription. The failure of these factors to explain the change suggests instead that exogenous forces shifted the relationship between wages and unemployment during this period, lining up with similar observations for the UK. The results have implications for the literature on the determinants of unemployment, indicating that neither corporatist institutions nor expansionary fiscal policy played a role in the shift to full employment in Sweden - one of the marking examples of postwar economic success.
N64|Labor Productivity during the Great Depression in UK Manufacturing|This paper provides estimates of labor productivity for one-third of UK manufacturing during the Great Depression. It covers engineering and allied industries, and metal working industries. A unique data set of actual hours of work is combined with comparable real output and employment statistics. It establishes that output per worker-hour was countercyclical in the 1929-1932 peak-to-trough years of the Depression. This result has also been found for US manufacturing over the same period. Working time is found to play a crucial role the UK productivity response. Countercyclical productivity is discussed in terms of (i) the strong final output and consumer price deflations of 1929 to 1934, (ii) an absence of significant labor hoarding, and (c) diminishing returns to long weekly hours of work.
N64|Contemporary Trends in the Development of Industry in the World and Serbia|The authors offer a view on the current state of industry and contemporary tendencies in its development in Serbia and the world. Particularly, this academic paper analyzes the state of Serbian industry, which collapsed at the beginning of the last decade of the 20th century, after having gone through three waves of industrialization. Serbian economy and industry have not recovered from deindustrialization even after two decades of unsteady development in the current century. Lastly, it presents some possibilities to revitalize the industry and achieve its harmonious development.
N64|Metal and machine industry in Serbia|The paper analyses status of metal and machine industry in Serbia, with short retrospect to previous period. Also, it presents the short review of the EU policies incentives and subsidies for industry development, especially through European Commission and their concept Horizont-2020. Bad conditions for industry of Serbia in last century quarter are not exceeded, arising trends are questionable. The development conception is not defined and established. Special interest of the paper is the status of the metal and machine industry, as very important branches for the economy of each country.
N64|Market potential and city growth: Spain 1860–1960|Abstract In this paper, we employ parametric and nonparametric techniques to analyse the effect of market potential on the structure and growth of Spanish cities during the period 1860–1960. Even though a few attempts have been made to analyse whether market potential might influence urban structures, this period is especially interesting because it is characterised by advances in the economic integration of the national market together with an intense process of industrialisation. By using an elaborated measure of market potential at the city level, our results show a positive influence of this market potential on city growth, although this influence is heterogeneous over time. Only changes in the market potential from 1900 have a significant effect on population growth.

N64|State aid for the restructuring of the Spanish steel industry from a European perspective (1975–1988)|Given the serious crisis of the European steel industry between 1974 and 1986, the Member States of the European Economic Community allocated a large amount of public resources to avoid the bankruptcy of major steel undertakings and to facilitate restructuring of the sector. In this regard, what the Spanish government did in relation to the steel aids was no exception. The main difference between the Spanish and European Community steel policies was not so much on the amount of the public resources but rather on the use of them in the restructuring process, especially since the 1980s. So while in the EEC steel aids were granted only in exchange for the elimination of surplus capacity, in Spain not adjustment was made until its accession to the European Communities on 1 January 1986.

N64|The Schneider company as a key actor of the industrial war in 1914-1918|At the heart of the economic war and as leverage to the military war, some companies asserted themselves as essential suppliers of the armies. They constituted poles of investment, innovation, and production, that complied to the ever growing orders of the state. Schneider reinforced therefore its equipments in Le Creusot, in Normandy and in Gironde, supported by the banks, in particular for its purchases in the United-States. It also the head of a cluster, of a group of companies cooperating for the main orders. As a hub-firm, it mobilised thus dozens of suppliers and sub-contractors. It earmarked it portfolios of skills to the arts of steel-working, metal-working, and mechanics (artillery, tanks, etc.). Throughout these developments it had to reinvent its management and follow new tracks for efficiency.
N64|Constructing equality? : Women’s wages for physical labor, 1550-1759|This paper combines new archival data on women’s wages from southern Sweden with published series from Stockholm in order to create a series of early modern female construction workers’ wages between the middle of the sixteenth and middle of the eighteenth centuries. This paper finds that women had relatively high relative wages in the later part of the sixteenth century, with an increasing wage gap into the eighteenth century, and that the changes in women’s relative remuneration are connected to changes in demand factors. This paper challenges assumptions about women’s participation in manual labor, in many cases finding a lack of differentiation between female and male unskilled workers as well as and unskilled labor force comprised of from forty to sixty percent women and high work intensity for female construction workers.
N64|Why did socialist economies fail? The role of factor inputs reconsidered|This article presents new estimates for investment and new growth accounts for three socialist economies between 1950 and 1989. Government statistics reported distorted measures for both the rate and the trajectory of productivity growth in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland. Researchers have benefited from revised output data, but have continued to use official statistics on capital input, or estimated capital stock from official investment data. Investment levels and rates of capital accumulation were much lower than officially claimed and over‐reporting worsened over time. A setback in factor accumulation—both investment in equipment and labour input—contributed very significantly to the socialist growth failure of the 1980s.
N64|Regional growth with spatial dependence: A case study on early Italian industrialization|The paper estimates a conditional ß-convergence model of labor productivity growth in Italy’s manufacturing industry during 1871-1911, accounting for spatial dependence. The empirical evidence is based on a recent set of data at provincial (NUTS 3) level on manufacturing value added at 1911 prices, and a new set of data on human and social capital, political participation, and infrastructures. By focusing on a country and a time when the agglomeration forces and spillover effects advocated by the new economic geography were only starting to operate, we can investigate a particularly interesting case study. Our results suggest that human capital, a cooperative culture, and initial productivity in neighboring provinces can explain much of the geographical variability of productivity growth in manufacturing in nineteenth-century Italy.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N64|Learning Capitalism the Hard Way--Evidence from German Reunification|We develop a model of firm learning in volatile markets with noisy signals and test its predictions using historical data from the Ifo Institute's Business Climate Survey. We find that firms' forecasts improve as they age. We also exploit German Reunification as a natural experiment where firms in the East are treated with ignorance about the distribution of market states. As theoretically predicted, Eastern firms make larger forecast errors than Western ones, but this gap gradually closes over the decade following Reunification. The slow convergence rate stems from differences in expectations rather than market conditions. We also find evidence for the model's predictions that improvements from learning are faster where market signals are noisier.
N64|Why Did Socialism Fail? The Role of Factor Inputs Reconsidered|We present revised growth accounts for three socialist economies between 1950 and 1989. Government statistics reported distorted measures for both the rate and trajectory of productivity growth in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland. Researchers have benefited from revised output data, but continued to use official statistics on capital input, or estimated capital stock from official investment data. Investment levels and rates of capital accumulations were, in fact, much lower than officially claimed and over-reporting worsened over time. Sluggish factor accumulation, specifically declining equipment investment and labor input, contributed much more to the socialist growth failure of the 1980s than previously thought.
N64|Industry structure, entrepreneurship, and culture: An empirical analysis using historical coalfields|There is mounting evidence demonstrating that entrepreneurship is spatially clustered and that these spatial differences are quite persistent over long periods of time. However, especially the sources of that persistence are not yet well-understood, and it is largely unclear whether persistent differences in entrepreneurship are reflected in differences in entrepreneurship culture across space as it is often argued in the literature. We approach the cluster phenomenon by theorizing that a historically high regional presence of large-scale firms negatively affects entrepreneurship, due to low levels of human capital and entrepreneurial skills, fewer opportunities for entry and entrepreneurship inhibiting formal and informal institutions. These effects can become self-perpetuating over time, ultimately resulting in persistent low levels of entrepreneurship activity and entrepreneurship culture. Using data from Great Britain, we analyze this long-term imprinting effect by using the distance to coalfields as an exogenous instrument for the regional presence of large-scale industries. IV regressions show that British regions with high employment shares of large-scale industries in the 19th century, due to spatial proximity to coalfields, have lower entrepreneurship rates and weaker entrepreneurship culture today. We control for an array of competing hypotheses like agglomeration forces, the regional knowledge stock, climate, and soil quality. Our main results are robust with respect to inclusion of these control variables and various other modifications which demonstrates the credibility of our empirical identification strategy. A mediation analysis reveals that a substantial part of the impact of large-scale industries on entrepreneurship is through human capital.
N64|The Impact of Stop-Go Demand Management Policy on Britain's Consumer Durables Industries, 1952-1965|We examine the impacts of British government stop-go policy on domestic sales of consumer durables over 1952 - 1965, via hire purchase restrictions and punitive Purchase Tax rates. Our analysis includes a general review of contemporary evidence regarding the impacts of these measures, a more detailed study of the television sector, and time-series econometric analysis for both televisions and a representative high-ticket labour-saving consumer durable washing machines. We find that the restrictions had devastating impacts on Britain's consumer durables industries, preventing firms from fully exploiting economies of scale, reducing output growth and international competitiveness, and eroding industrial relations. Government officials were aware of these problems, but considered them a price worth paying to facilitate moves towards sterling convertibility and the re-establishment of the City as a leading financial and trading centre.
N64|European Strategy 2020: what about the carrot?|This paper aims at testing the incitative role of past structural funds on the achievement of targets of Europe 2020 strategy. The methodology used is a quantitative analysis aiming at explaining a dependant variable “difference to target” for each dimension of Europe 2020 (employment rate, R&D expenditures, greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy, early leaving from education, tertiary education, people at risk of poverty) by several independent variables, namely structural funds consumption (inputs), structural funds outputs over the period 2007-2013, cumulated structural funds for the previous period 2000- 2006. These independent variables will be used among other variables classically considered by scholars and/or by the European Commission.
N64|Economic Governance of Northern European Countries by the European Union 2010- 2015: The Cases of Finland, Germany, Lithuania and Sweden|Four European countries have been selected from the northern part of Europe to carry out cross-case comparisons of their strategic state capabilities. They are Finland, Germany, Lithuania and Sweden. Each of the cases has some distinctive features in terms of their recent developments or their strategic reputations. Finland’s national government has been frequently identified as taking a strategic approach to governance. The government has made reports on the future to parliament and the parliament had its Committee for the Future. Germany, in contrast, has a reputation for being more strategic at local and regional government level and the national level of government is portrayed as much less strategic. It is plausible to argue that the strength of the constitution is a major influence on how public governance works in Germany, and it maybe for this reason that strategic-state capabilities appear to be emerging quite slowly. Lithuania is an interesting case because of its apparently well-institutionalized system of strategic planning that was introduced in 2000. There is now a long-term Lithuania 2030 strategy. Central capacity for strategic planning is partly established through ministry units and a governmental Strategic Planning Committee dating from 2013. Finally, Sweden’s system of public governance is interesting in part because of the 1997 reforms that created a more integrated approach, a whole of government approach, in which the ministers were appointed by the prime minister and worked collaboratively, which has been termed as ministerial decision making according to a collegiality norm. This implies quite a step change in strategicstate capabilities in the sense of moving away from ministerial silos.
N64|Learning that milk comes from a cow: supply management and the character of neoliberalism in Spain’s dairy chain|This article takes Spain’s dairy chain as a study case of the transformations in the political economy of the food system in the West since the Second World War. I find that there is much to support the prevailing narrative in food regime analysis: the organised capitalism of 1952-1986 was gradually weakened by a policy agenda of deregulation stemming from both internal and external pressures. I also find, however, a thread of continuity between the period 1952-1986and the post-1986 period – in both periods there were strategies of supply chain management by means of which the power of political or business elites joined the market as a mechanism for the coordination of decisions. I argue that there is a case for reassessing the degree up to which the term “neoliberalism” does a good job at describing the new historical era that started in the food system in the latter decades of the twentieth century.

Resources For A Future Development|Economically, the County of Sibiu has been characterized, especially after 2007, by an accelerated speed of development, the recorded increase pushing our County among the most dynamic economies at regional and national level as well. The present paper aims at analyzing the specificity of the economic development of Sibiu County, namely to identify the resources of the obtained economic progress. The purpose of this study also consists in identifying new opportunities for the local economy, outlining new sources of development that are more important as competition, both at regional and national level, is tighter and tighter.
N64|Measuring trends and cycles in industrial production in Norway 1896-1948|This paper presents new indices for industrial production in Norway covering the years 1896-1948. Separate annual and monthly indices of gross output and labour productivity are computed for 45 manufacturing and mining industries, using annually updated weights based on value added at factor cost. The new industrial production index shows somewhat stronger growth of output in the years before WWI and, in particular, in the 1930s, than the existing index published by Statistics Norway. The new monthly data set also provides a basis for identifying a business cycle chronology for Norway in the first half of the twentieth century.
N64|Output growth in German manufacturing, 1907–1936. A reinterpretation of time-series evidence|This study uses state space time series analysis to estimate output growth in German manufacturing between 1907 and 1936. In the absence of net-output data, previous research has estimated output change using proxy variables. Various proxy-based output series are available that imply either a 25% German labor-productivity lead over Britain or a parity of performance in 1907. The conventional strategy to deal with this conundrum involves a choice between the series. With the correlation between the different proxies and output unknown, such a choice is inappropriate because it results in the loss of information provided by the rejected proxies. Instead, this study makes full and efficient use of all information by estimating a common component in the various output series. The new estimate of output change implies a German lead over Britain in manufacturing labor productivity of 4.4% in 1907.
N64|A closer look at the long-term patterns of regional income inequality in Spain: The poor stay poor (and stay together)|Using a novel dataset, this paper explores the evolution of regional income inequality in Spain, 1860-2010. We follow the growth literature and use spatial exploratory tools to analyse modality, mobility and spatial clustering. We find two clearly distinguishable periods. First, there was an upswing in regional inequality accompanied by a certain mobility between 1860 and 1930. This was followed by a period of regional convergence, in which mobility was rather low. In parallel to this, a geographical concentration of the richest and poorest regions took place, with wealthy Spain located in the north-east and poor Spain in the south. In the last decades convergence has come to a halt, mobility is quasi-non-existent and spatial polarization has tended to increase. A partir de recientes estimaciones históricas de PIB provincial, este trabajo explora la evolución de la desigualdad regional en España entre 1860 y 2010. Siguiendo a la literatura de crecimiento económico, se presentan diversos indicadores para analizar la modalidad, la movilidad y la aglomeración espacial de las provincias españolas. Nuestros resultados muestran la existencia de dos períodos claramente diferenciados. En primer lugar, entre 1860 y 1930 la desigualdad regional aumentó y este aumento se vio acompañado de una cierta movilidad en el ranking provincial. A partir de entonces se dio un proceso de convergencia, en el que la movilidad fue bastante reducida, y donde además se produjo una creciente concentración geográfica de las provincias más ricas y más pobres, situándose las primeras en el noreste peninsular y las segundas en el sur. En las últimas décadas el proceso de convergencia se ha detenido, la movilidad es prácticamente inexistente y la polarización espacial ha continuado aumentando.
N64|Dimensions of Precarity: A Contradictory Case of Non-Standard Employment|This paper discusses the concept of ‘precarious employment’ in relation to the Swedish shipbuilding industry in the 1960s and 1970s. In this setting, characterized by shortage of labour, a dual labour market structure emerged, where some workers were directly employed by the shipyards and others indirectly employed through intermediaries. The case differs from classical accounts of dual labour markets and it is not obvious to use the term precarious employment to describe the situation of the external workers. On the one hand, the external workers had insecure jobs and were involved in triangular employment relationships, where the true identity and responsibility of the employer was unclear. They were also excluded from the social security systems. On the other hand, the external workers appear to have had higher incomes, opportunities to work long hours, less responsibility for unrewarding maintenance tasks and perhaps even the advantage of working under more flexible supervision. The case demonstrates the diversity that can be found in historical work arrangements and suggests that the term precarious employment should be applied with some caution, both past and present.
N64|Stalin`s Inventors: Leonid Zherebov and Soviet Pulp Industry, the 1940s-1960s|This paper examines Soviet engineer Leonid Zherebov, an inventor of continuous pulp cooker. After twenty-five years of experiments, Zherebov’s design failed, and Soviet factories began to produce pulp using imported Swedish digesters. This article examines the biography of Leonid Zherebov and continuous pulp cooking in order to better understand the nature of Russian technological innovation and its failures. It emphasizes the communication between different institutions involved as well as a range of technological, social, economic and political factors. The paper contends that technological failures were emerged from the failure of Soviet forestry as a technological system due to a lack of open discussion between its builders and the scarcity of resources required for innovation.
N64|A closer look at the long-term patterns of regional income inequality in Spain: the poor stay poor (and stay together)|This paper explores regional (NUTS3) income inequality in Spain, 1860-2010. Using a novel dataset spanning 150 years, we analyse the evolution of inequality in regional per-capita GDP. To do this, we follow the growth literature and use spatial exploratory tools. Our aim is to understand not only the long-term evolution as regards convergence or dispersion, but also aspects related to income distribution, i.e. modality, mobility and spatial clustering. We therefore use tools such as kernel density estimates, boxplots, transition probability matrices, Shorrocks indices, KendallÕs !, MoranÕs I and LISA maps. The main finding is that there were two clearly distinguishable periods in the economic development process. First, there was an upswing in regional inequality accompanied by a certain mobility between 1860 and 1930. This was followed by a period of regional convergence lasting until the 1980Õs, in which mobility in income class or rank was rather low. As a result, spatial clustering became more significant and income distribution was transformed. Decreasing regional inequality was thus accompanied by a geographical concentration of the richest and poorest regions. While wealthy Spain was located in the north-east, poor Spain was in the south, particularly the south-west. Mobility has also been virtually non-existent in recent decades. All in all, the study shows the importance of history in the shaping of SpainÕs regional income distribution.
N64|The Role of Foreign Participation in Soviet Industrialization: An Institutional View|The foreign participation in USSR industrialization is considered to be a factor of institutional development of Soviet society. The paper considers the intellectual contribution of foreign specialists in the creation of important industrial projects. Foreign businessmen and specialists had considerable difficulties in their activity under influence of hostile institutional environment. Nevertheless, their professional success demonstrated the advantages of capitalism and conduced to dangerous spread of capitalist values into working class consciousness. Using repressions and propaganda, communist leaders institutionalized isolationism, i.e. watchful attitude to Western countries and belief in ability to solve any economic problem relying upon internal resources.
N64|Bank on steel? Joint-stock banks and the rationalization of the British interwar steel industry|This study investigates the impact of joint-stock banks on the rationalization of the British interwar steel industry. A new panel data set of steel firm characteristics covering 1920–1938 is used to document rationalization and bank involvement, including interlocking directorships, with both found to be more extensive than previously thought. A set of all potential amalgamation pairs is created and used in a logit analysis of the determinants of mergers. Bank involvement with firms increased the probability that a particular merger occurred. Furthermore, mergers with bank involvement differed in their impact on profitability from those without.
N64|Market potential and regional economic growth in Spain (1860–1930)|In this study, parametric and nonparametric techniques are employed to analyze the effect of changes in regional market potential on the growth of Spanish regions during the period 1860–1930. The study of Spain sheds light on whether the construction of new transport infrastructures coupled with changes in trade policy ultimately shaped regional growth trajectories. The study draws upon new evidence of per capita gross domestic product for Spanish provinces and combines this evidence with Harris' market-potential function to measure regional market potential. Results show that market potential had a positive influence on regional economic growth, particularly between 1900 and 1930.
N64|Historical Aspects, Traditions and Statistical Gaps. The German Economy versus the Romanian Economy|This paper reveals some historical aspects and some common traditions of German and Romanian economies, justifying some of the trends of contemporary decades underlying the statistical gap. The specific method used in this article is a statistical confrontation based on historical variables and statistical data, graphs emphasizing the abnormalities in evolution, etc. After a brief introduction, inside the major part of the structure of this paper some selected economic and social evolutions are presented together for both German and Romanian economies, somehow becoming the limits of the European Union construction. Few general gaps of the two economic marginal models as performance and cohesion are detailed during the historical and statistical investigation and the conclusions anticipates some expectations in the medium term dynamics of these economies. At the same time the article discusses Berlin’s position within EU and argues that Germany remains a selective continental hegemon, bent on securing national primacy and profit more than generating win-win solutions for its neighbours.

N64|The Deindustrial Revolution: The Rise & Fall of UK Manufacturing, 1870-2010|This paper considers the evolution of the manufacturing sector in the UK since 1870. It analyses the contribution of manufacturing to national income, employment and trade. From 1870 to 1960, manufacturing played a key role in the development of the economy, undergirding success in other sectors of the economy and securing rising living standards. The subsequent fifty years, from 1960, have witnessed a relative decline of the UK manufacturing sector - relative to other sectors of the economy, and relative to the manufacturing sectors in other countries. The paper considers the thesis that the relative decline of manufacturing is a natural outcome of the development of advanced economies, and the counter-arguments suggesting that decline of UK manufacturing reflected economic weaknesses and structural imbalances. We argue that in the case of the UK, the relative decline of manufacturing has indeed reflected deep-rooted structural problems. In particular there has been a chronic failure to invest in manufacturing, with the UK economy and investment being instead skewed towards short-term returns and the interests of the 'City'. A stronger manufacturing sector would help to rebalance the UK economy away from an over-reliance on the banking sector and would help rebalance the UK economy and society in regional terms. To achieve such a rebalancing requires active government policies to help increase investment in education, skills and innovation.
N64|Towards a History of the Italian Industrial Districts from the End of World War II to the Nineties|When did the first Italian industrial districts spring up? In which regions have they developed, and over what times, in the forty years of republican Italy from the end of World War II to the nineties? How do districts develop? How do they change their shape in time? By using for the first time comparable census data from 1951 to 1991 and with reference to the main existing literature on the subject, we try to answer these questions and to trace a history of the Italian industrial districts. In the discussion, we enquire into how the importance and role of the districts vary over time, and we attempt to assess their prevailing working conditions, their efficiency and their ability to face up to international competition.

For this reason, the paper reconstructs the sector evolution considering all its phases. In the 1950s, on the basis of a semi-handcrafted production, an industrial sector takes shape, then becoming the “factory of Europe”. As much as at the beginning it was the Schumpeterian “innovation entrepreneurs” to give birth and then successfully develop a sector, strategic partnership innovation is now the key factor in order to overcome this negative phase.

Its industrial fabric is extensive: alongside a number of major firms there is a broad network of small businesses and technological start-ups. However the Italian market has contracted over the past years. Those firms least present in the international markets are the hardest hit: data highlights the good performance achieved by exports that supported production in recovering from the 2011 downturn.
N64|Trade policy and wage gradients: evidence from a protectionist turn|In the spirit of Hanson (Econ J 107:113–133, 1997), we analyse, first, the existence of a relationship between the wage level and the market potential of Spanish regions; second, we explore the relative importance of domestic and foreign markets in this relationship; and finally, we examine the existence of a regional nominal wage gradient in Spain during the interwar period (1914–1930) centred on the main industrial cluster, Barcelona, and its transformation following the increase in protectionism in the Spanish economy as well as in the international economy. As suggested by NEG literature, our results support the hypothesis of a relationship between wages and regional market access and show the change in the regional wage structure following the gradual closing of the Spanish economy and of Spain’s trade partners, as a result of the increasing importance of the domestic market. We find evidence of the existence of a regional wage gradient centred on Barcelona which weakened during these years. Therefore, in Spain, during the interwar period, protectionist policies appear to have favoured the loss of centrality of a border region (Barcelona) and the relative rise of other locations.
N64|Autarquía y atraso tecnológico en la industria textil española, 1939-1959|This paper analyzes the effect of Franco's autarchic policy (1939-1959) on the delay in the technological advance of the Spanish textile industry. The study is based on official data from patents, textile machinery imports, and various comparative estimates on the efficiency of the textile industry. It was found that some of textile machinery produced in Spain was introduced, that partially covered the shortage of imported machinery. But, when international technology transfer was interrupted, it was not possible to advance towards a complete replacement of the technology in the textile machinery industry. Based on new empirical evidence, it concludes that the autarchic period not only had a negative impact on the technological development of the Spanish textile industry, but it also led to a genuine regression in international terms.

Entre la copia, la adaptación y la creatividad|During the first 20 years of Franco's dictatorship, the Spanish economy remained isolated, and technological innovation suffered a large backlog. Still, Spanish companies were able to advance technologically to gain advantage in the internal market taking advantage of import substitution. The article compares three firms with different characteristics located in Manresa (Barcelona), an industrial city with district behavior in certain sectors. Strategies for business innovation or technological license acquisition during autarchy and “development policy” are discussed. The main contribution of the paper is the explanation of the mechanisms of development and spreading of innovation, and its close relation with the generation of external economies.

El estudio se centra en los cambios realizados en el sector con el fin de adaptarse a las condiciones del mercado en las diferentes situaciones coyunturales del período. Se realiza un recorrido temporal en dos etapas: el primer tercio del siglo XX y desde la Guerra Civil hasta la liberalización del sector textil en 1952 y sus inmediatas consecuencias. La principal conclusión es que a pesar de los cambios en la localización del sector dentro de la región, en el tipo de fibras y tejidos a elaborar, y en la organización empresarial, así como, de las ventajas políticas generadas tras la Guerra Civil, el sector textil en Castilla y León no consiguió transformar ni modernizar su estructura industrial lo suficiente para acceder al mercado en condiciones competitivas.

N64|Industrial Output in the USSR and Russia, 1861—2012|"Part II. Crises and Cycles Calculation of the aggregated ""consensus"" industrial production index has made it possible to date cyclical turning points and to measure the depth and length of the main industrial recessions in Russian Empire/USSR/Russia for the last century and a half. The most important causes of all these recessions are described. The cyclical volatility of Soviet/Russian industry is compared to that of American one."
N64|Industrial Output in the USSR and Russia, 1861—2012|Part I. Reconstruction of Basic Time-series The trajectory of the industrial output of the Russian empire/the USSR/ the Russian Federation for more than 150 years has been carefully investigated through official statistics as well as dozens of alternative estimates made by Russian and foreign experts. Alternative estimates are compared with official data and the usefulness and credibility of the latter are determined. Official figures for Russian industrial production for 1941—1945 as well as the time-series for 1887—1926 as constructed by V. Varzar have been retrieved from the archives and are being introduced here for the first time.
N64|Cyclical Waves in the Economic Development of the U.S. and Russia|(Issues of Methodology and Analysis) The article describes the methodology for identifying and analyzing economic cycles, which are based on historical spectral approach that combines the advantages of the historical and economic analysis and spectral method of the study of economic series. The proposed approach is used to isolate and analyze both their own regular fluctuations of economic dynamics inherent in the developed­ economies and the vibrations induced by technological and external economic shocks. The analysis has been carried out on the basis of data on the dynamics of the post-war U.S. economy as the main driver of world cycles, and of Russia’s economy from 1861 to 2012 using the latest research on the reconstruction of the time-series of its economic dynamics. Finally, conclusions are drawn in relation to the state economic policy in the conditions of the global cyclical development.
N64|Industrial Composition, Methods of Compensation and Real Earnings in the Great Depression|A major objective of the government during the Great Recession has been severely to restrict public sector real wage growth. One potential advantage of performance-related pay schemes is that they naturally offer greater wage responsiveness to fluctuations in the business cycle. Based on evidence from engineering and allied industries during the Great Depression we show that piecework wages exhibited more flexibility than their timework equivalents. We compare and contrast southern/midland engineering districts of Britain with northern districts. The former region was dominated by piece-rated workers and by modern sections of the industry, such as vehicle and aircraft manufacture. Time-rated work predominated in northern districts where older sections â€“ for example, marine and textile engineering â€“ were clusteredâ€¥
N64|Productivity and transition in Swedish iron and steel, 1870-1940| This paper presents a long-run analysis of an industrial branch in Europe's periphery. It examines how the Swedish iron and steel industry reacted to the strains of increasing competition on world markets which affected the branch between 1870 and 1940. The first part of the paper presents a breakdown into periods. We then go on to analyse the sources of growth with both a primal and a dual approach and look at the dynamics between factor substitution and relative prices. Finally, we examine the contribution of the different factors during the periods of transition. Overall we find total factor productivity as the main responsible force for overcoming the effects of competitive pressure. Some of this aggregate technological change can also be traced to a more intensive use of inputs and to extensive growth, indicative of structural change in the industry. Throughout the period examined the industry reacted to increased competition by process and organisational transformation.
N64|El Estado y la industria del calzado en Francia en el siglo XX. La definición de una escala territorial para la coordinación entre los poderes públicos y las empresas|El tema de los distritos industriales surgió en las ciencias sociales en los años setenta, cuando la crisis económica hizo dudar del modelo de organización fordista. Los poderes públicos franceses buscaron entonces una alternativa en las PYME y los distritos industriales. Vista en el largo plazo, esta actuación pública se inscribe dentro del papel económico y social movilizador adoptado por el Estado francés durante el siglo xx . Este artículo analiza las vías seguidas por las políticas públicas para optimizar la movilización de los recursos. El problema planteado se sitúa en la encrucijada de la historia económica y la sociología de la acción pública. El enfoque se ha realizado a través del ejemplo de la industria del calzado, que ha conocido dos tipos de configuración: concentración geográfica de PYME y concentración económica en grupos industriales. El trabajo pone de manifiesto que el Estado, en su búsqueda de apoyos para garantizar su control sobre la economía, se ha visto obligado a tener en cuenta las reconfiguraciones del sistema productivo, sin conseguirlo siempre.

N64|The roots of success: industrial growth in Italy reconsidered, 1911-1951|This article reconsiders the growth of Italian industry from the First World War to the eve of the economic miracle, with the aid of sector-specific new value-added series, at three different price-bases. The new estimates reduce growth during the First World War, making the Italian case comparable to the other belligerent countries, while improving the performance of the 1920s. The 1929 crisis looks more profound than before, while the recovery after 1933 is now stronger. During the 1920s and the 1930s, a significant shift from traditional to more advanced activities took place: when confronted with the rest of Europe, the interwar period was a relative success, which laid the ground for the following economic boom.

The 1929 crisis looks more profound than before, but the recovery after 1933 is now stronger. During the 1920s and the 1930s, a significant shift from traditional to more advanced activities took place, and the cycles of consumption related industries grew in importance: after linking the available estimates with those produced by Fenoaltea for liberal Italy, both descriptive statistics and cointegration analysis suggest that some of these movements began with the turn of the previous century, a finding in line with institutional interpretations of Italy's economic growth. When confronted with the rest of Europe, in industrial production Italy's first half of the twentieth century was a relative success, which laid the ground for the following economic boom.
N64|Long-Term Development Path of the Second Industry in Central Asia|In this paper, I compile 100-year statistics of the countries of Central Asia using declassified confidential documents of the Soviet Statistical Office obtained from the Russian State Archives and other materials and quantitatively characterize the long-term development path of the second industry in the region. The issue of the possible up-ward bias of the Soviet industrial statistics is also examined. Comparative analysis between the USSR and the Central Asian region and among Central Asian countries basing on the above long-term statistics provides valuable findings including the close relationship between the socialist industrial allocation policy and the growth rate of the second industry for deeper understanding of the economic development history in Central Asia during the socialist era and the following transition period towards a market economy.
N64|Economic Viability And Macroeconomic Impact Of The Burgas - Alexandroupolis Pipeline|This paper is a condensed version of an actual study commissioned in 2010 to the authors by the Administrative District of East Macedonia and Thrace. The proposed investment plan for the construction of the Burgas-Alexandroupolis Pipeline (BAP) is a significant energy transportation project for South-East Europe and for the local economies in Greece and Bulgaria. The BAP is designed to serve as a complimentary channel to the maritime route of transportation of crude oil from the Black and Caspian Sea to the international markets. The construction and operation of the pipeline is expected to have a significant direct and indirect impact on the national and local economies in terms of increased direct demand for goods and services and employment. In this paper, we thoroughly examine the financial viability of the BAP using an exhaustive number of alternative scenarios as it is a prerequisite for any favorable macroeconomic effects. In doing so, we employ the use of Cash flow analysis, the IRR, the NPV and Break-Even-Point analysis. Finally, after we establish the viability of the investment plan, we investigate its macroeconomic impact on local and national unemployment, GDP and local government revenue that appear to be significant especially on the local level.
N64|La pequeña y mediana empresa en la edad de oro de la economía española: estado de la cuestión|The article is about the evolution of small and medium-sized firms in the period of the so called “desarrollismo” (1959-1975). We analyze the growth of these firms comparing the process to that of big Spanish firms in the same period. The data has been obtained from the information existent at the Instituto Nacional de Estadística about all the industrial sectors. One of the most interesting conclusions is related to the data from the INE about small and medium-sized firms, as it does not seem to agree with classical economic theory that considers big firms to be more efficient. The data sheds light on this matter very clearly. However, there still remain many aspects which are difficult to quantify, such as the impact of different industrial policies, the effects of tariffs and the quantification of the effects of regulations throughout all this period.

N64|The origins of Made in Spain fashion. The competitive advantage of the textile, apparel and footwear districts since the Golden Age|This paper explores the sources of competitive advantage of the Spanish export industrial districts that specialised in textile, apparel and footwear products. It shows that most of the nowadays outstanding Spanish firms in fashion-related international markets emerged from 1980s districts. Using a new database, the paper concludes that by then there were as many neo-Marshallian exporting districts dominated by small firms as hub-firm districts coordinated by medium-large companies. This probably allowed the latter to combine the advantages derived from Marshallian external economies (i.e. non-codified knowledge, subsidiary industries and specialized labour force) with those connected to leading firms organizational capabilities.
N64|From trade to industry. The wine production sector in the Penedes Denomination of Origin, 1940-2000|The paper aims to show the extent to which the wine production sector in the Penedes Denominacio dOrigen responded to the challenges posed both in terms of supply (consolidation and emergence of producing countries outside the traditional European sphere) and demand (fall in wine consumption and new consumer habits). It looks at the evolution of the sector in the region from the beginning of the 1940s up to present day. With the end of the 1936-1939 Civil War the sector had to deal with a fall-off in production, though it continued to take shape around the traditional wine trade. This situation changed when, at the end of the 1960s, demand increasingly turned towards higher quality bottled wines. From the legislative standpoint, the response centred on technological innovation and company restructuring. This period saw the introduction of new equipment and processes, such as stainless steel tanks and controlled- temperature fermentation, with bottled wines pushing out bulk wine and the large warehouses giving way to wineries and cellars. In addition, one of the main features of the 1970-1985 period was the formation of the big wine and cava business conglomerates. Spains entry into the European Union in 1986 accelerated this transformation process, leaving the sector made up of companies that produced both wines and cavas, introduced red and varietal wines into the range of products they offered, owned many hectares of vines and in many cases showed a clear intention to enter the international market.
N64|Internal Geography and External Trade: regional disparities in Italy, 1861-2011|This paper explores the interactions between external trade and regional disparities in the Italian economy since unification. It argues that the advantage of the North was initially based on natural advantage (in particular the endowment of water, intensive in silk production). From 1880 onwards the share of exports in GDP stagnated and then declined; domestic market access therefore became a key determinant of industrial location, inducing fast growing new sectors (especially engineering) to locate in regions with a large domestic market, i.e. in the North. From 1945 onwards trade growth and European integration meant that foreign market access was the decisive factor; the North had the advantage of proximity to these markets.

The studies were conducted in food industry enterprises that possessed quality systems, certified according to ISO 9001:2000 standard. Author-investigated assessment of enterprisesâ€™ activities in the area of customer satisfaction management indicate that American and Polish companies have similar perceptions of issues associated with measuring customer satisfaction. However, American companies have more knowledge of the theoretical concept of customer satisfaction, therefore they possess a greater understanding of the implications of customer satisfaction research.
N64|The Expansion of Silk Textile Export in Northern Italy, 1919-1929|The purpose of this article is to examine the expansion and the aspect of silk textile export in Northern Italy, especially in Como district, during the period of 1919-1929, when the Italian silk textile industry gained an international competitive advantage. The author would like to propound some views to which little attention has been given. Generally speaking, the modernization of management organization in the early 1920 fs accelerated the development of silk textile industry. Firstly, the textile machine industry concurrently came to grow, which made it possible to improve the quality of textiles and helped for the silk industry to acquire the new markets for its goods. Secondly, the increasing use of artificial silk from the early 1920 fs drastically changed the situation around silk textile. Thirdly, the silk textiles with the new additional raw material came to be woven under the mass production system. Fourthly, the silk textile industry tried to improve the design of silk textiles for couture, and succeeded in reaching the forefront of Italian fashion, cooperated with the government. All of the above-mentioned facts did start when the British government imposed tariff barriers on the silk textile. At that time, Italy had no choice but to develop overseas market. In the second half of the 1920s, capturing the new markets of Asia, Africa and South America, the export of silk textiles including artificial silk as new mass products remarkably increased.
N64|Mature Systems in Global Markets: The Need for an Institutional Division of Labour|This paper approaches innovation as a need and not as a choice, particularly in the case of mature systems, defined as localized systems of production that are deeply specialised in mature industries. Their only strategy to achieve competitiveness is an innovation-driven shake-out combining new technological patterns with the existing resources and involving local institutions in production in order to avoid an unbearable shock. The Italian case is useful to introduce the idea of an institutional division of labour limited by the extent of the market and the institutional coherence of the system. According to this approach, the innovation policy has also a political dimension, which development and competition possibilities depend on.
N64|Manufacturing and economic growth in developing countries, 1950–2005|Historically, manufacturing has functioned as the main engine of economic growth and development. However, recent research raises questions concerning the continued importance of the manufacturing sector for economic development. We re-examine the role of manufacturing as a driver of growth in developed and developing countries in the period 1950–2005. We find a moderate positive impact of manufacturing on growth. We also find interesting interaction effects of manufacturing with education and income gaps. In a comparison of the subperiods, it seems that since 1990, manufacturing is becoming a more difficult route to growth than before.

Se utiliza el método transversal dejando a un lado el análisis por etapas tan característico en el discurso histórico. La idea es explicar al lector como las empresas cooperativas han ido respondiendo a los vaivenes de los ciclos de la economía española, qué sectores de la actividad productiva se vieron más afectados, y cómo se inició la modernización cuyo resultado fue la aparición de empresas de mayor tamaño. Se quiere indagar si los ciclos de creación de las cooperativas guardan relación con los períodos de expansión o contracción de la economía española. Se trata de conocer si en períodos de dificultades económicas son las empresas con perfil solidario las que mejor reaccionaron
N64|Eibar y la industria armera: evidencias de un distrito industrial|The Basque Gunmaking industry experienced its most important growth during the last decades of the 19th century and fi rst years of the 20th. This growth was due to the increasing exports of revolvers and pistols which made up almost 90 per cent of total sales. This industry was concentrated around the town of Eibar which, together with other villages of Guipuzcoa and Biscay, constituted the “Gunmaking Zone”. The international competitiveness achieved by this industry was mainly a consequence of the flexibility and adaptability given by its Marshallian industrial district structure since Eibar fulfilled most of the characteristics cited by specialized literature, e.g., specialization, in this case in fi rearms, a relatively homogeneous product; predominance of SME in its production structure and subcontracting relationships among them; existence of internal rules and institutions that protect them; and, due to cooperation between companies, creation of institutions to improve the development of the district’s characteristic industry.

Its development was slow, as was the development of the local automobile industry, but before 1936 it had achieved a significant size and was in process of growth and modernization. The Spanish Civil War and the industrial policy of the forties slowed down this process, but in the fifties the industry grew quickly while the automobile industry took off. The rapid growth of the supplier industry between 1950 and 1970 took place in a protectionist framework, which limited its modernization and caused shortage of components. But after the liberalization of the seventies, it succeeded in modernizing and internationalizing, although this was to a great extent attributable to the multinational companies established in Spain.

N64|Industrializando la España interior: El ensamblaje del Renault 4CV en la “FASA de Valladolid”, 1951-1958|Fabricación de Automóviles SA (FASA) was founded in Valladolid in 1951. FASA owned the licence to manufacture the Renault 4CV in Spain, and between 1953 and 1958 produced 26,298 units, which represented 29% of the total Spanish output. The period was marked by disagreements both between the Spanish partners and between the Spanish partners and Renault, the technology supplier, and by the need to satisfy the requirements of domestic production. Drawing on unpublished primary sources of information (the Minutes of the Board of Directors and the Shareholders’ Meetings) the article analyses the development of FASA during its early years. The article explores the hypothesis that the developer of FASA decided to locate the factory in Valladolid for personal reasons. Moreover, it shows that the fact that the Spanish market was closed was the main factor in obliging Renault to grant the manufacturing licences. KEY Classification-JEL: L62, N64, N84, O14
N64|Explaining contract choice : vertical co-ordination, sharecropping, and wine, France 1850-1950|Recent literature on sharecropping has emphasized its importance in reducing problems associated with moral hazard in cultivation (Tuscany), or in providing an important ‘rung’ on the farm ladder (US South). Yet despite these and other important features, sharecropping is surprisingly absent in many, if not most other settings. Using case studies associated with French wine production, this paper argues that a number of factors have often been overlooked in the literature: 1) the need for landowners to be able to offer farms that were both sufficiently large to employ full time the sharecropper’s family, and allowed them to produce a variety of products to minimize risk; 2) measurement problems associated with the division of the harvest, especially when quality was an important factor in determining farm price; 3) and the nature of vertical co-operation and integration associated with the production and marketing arrangements of individual crops explains that landowners were not indifferent to receiving payment in cash or kind, and this affected contract choice. This paper incorporates these ideas to explain not just the presence and absence of sharecropping in different geographical localities, but also the wide variety of different forms of the contract that existed in Europe.
N64|Real Wages, Working Time, and the Great Depression: What Does Micro Evidence Tell Us?|Based largely on industry-level aggregate statistics, the prevailing view, and one that has strongly influenced macroeconomic thought, is that real wages during the cycle containing the Great Depression are either acyclical or countercyclical. Does this finding hold-up when more micro data are employed? We examine this question based on detailed blue-collar workers’ company payroll data for a large section of the British engineering and metal working industries. We distinguish between pieceworkers and timeworkers, with pieceworkers accounting for over half the workforce. For the period 1927 to 1937, the two pay groups are broken down into 14 occupations, and 48 travel-to-work geographical districts. We estimate wage and hours cyclicality in respect of the national unemployment rate as well as the district rates. Weekly hours and real weekly earnings are found to be strongly procyclical. Real hourly earnings of pieceworkers are also significantly procyclical. The roles of standard and overtime hours are crucial to these findings.

On the other hand, we expand the model by including two further strategic, i.e. dependent, variables. The paper contributes to research by finding three distinct internationalization processes in CEE, two of them new to the Uppsala Model. Furthermore, the paper strongly supports our argumentation with regard to collective learning and thereby draws new conclusions on learning processes that take place within and between firms over time.

We find that the political decisions after the Spanish Civil War of 1936 are determinant in explaining the change of size of this industrial district, but also that Valladolid knew how to take advantage of its privileged geographic situation, its means of transport -Canal and Railway-, and the introduction of electric power at the beginning of the century, to free itself from an excessive dependence on the agricultural sector for its development. Not only the political advantages coming out of the war, but also the tradition developed since 1842, explain the introduction of large companies in the next decades.

N64|Los Depósitos Francos en España, 1914-1930|In the last third of the nineteenth century free warehouses and free trade zones sprang up in several European countries as economic policy resources. At the turn of the century some Spanish ports wished to equip themselves with this institution in order to make up for the loss of the last ultramarine colonies, gain trade and help to promote commodity exports. After fifteen years of parliamentary debate and disagreement, the free warehouses of Barcelona, Bilbao, Cadiz and Santander were established during the First World War. In addition to the processes initially authorized, such as coffee roast or coconut oil refinement, other industries soon developed especially automobile assembly. The establishment of Ford was as decisive for the free warehouses as it was for the American company, which made good use of the duty-free institution. Free warehouses allowed the multinational firm to assemble automobiles using national or foreign components, delaying taxes until the car was imported to Spain or remaining free of those tariffs if the merchandise was sent to another country. The assembly plant of Barcelona made up about 40 per cent of the domestic market before the Civil War, and was successful in assembling and selling automobiles in Portugal, North Africa, Italy or Adriatic Europe.
N64|The international competitiveness of cava: success of a particular firm or the district ?|First of all, the author wonders about the degree of success of the Catalan sparkling wine industry in the recent past. The comparison with the Italian sparkling spumante and also with the case of the most celebrated sparkling wine in the world, champagne, shows a very positive trend of the cava production and exports in the last three decades of the XXth century. Secondly, this paper focuses on the agent or cause responsible of this success. Is it due to a particular firm or should it be attributed to the whole industrial cava cluster around the area of Sant Sadurni dAnoia? More than two thirds of the exports correspond to a particular firm. In this sense, we should attribute the success to it. However, the historical explanation of the development of the industrial cava cluster in the main and well-kwown viticultural Catalan area of Penedes, shows that all producers have benefit from the Marshalian external economies due to this concentration. And the paper shows that the leading export firm would never have succeeded in the international market without the existence of this kind of invisible advantages.
N64|Religion, longevity, and cooperation: The case of the craft guild|When the mortality rate is high, repeated interaction alone may not sustain cooperation, and religion may play an important role in shaping economic institutions. This insight explains why during the fourteenth century, when plagues decimated populations and the church promoted the doctrine of purgatory, guilds that bundled together religious and occupational activities dominated manufacturing and commerce. During the sixteenth century, the disease environment eased, and the Reformation dispelled the doctrine of purgatory, necessitating the development of new methods of organizing industry. The logic underlying this conclusion has implications for the study of institutions, economics, and religion throughout history and in the developing world today.
N64|The emergence of the 'coastal steelworks' in the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), 1952-1967|The coal and steel production was key in the post-war rebuilding of the European economy. However, after WWII, Germany still had the technological knowledge and experience to quickly regain its pre-war position as the dominant economic force in Europe. In response to this ‘problem’, the political leaders of six Western European countries founded the European Coal and Steel Community or ECSC, which they hoped would provide a common legal framework for the coal and steel industry. When the ECSC was founded, all six founding countries of the ECSC produced steel and all but two also produced substantial quantities of coal. However, there were considerable differences in the ‘regional concentration’ of the coal and steel companies and before 1952 (the first year of the ECSC), a (relatively) small geographical area was responsible for more than 90 % of both the European coal and steel production. We have then looked at how the relative importance of this ‘industrial triangle’ in the total coal and steel production of the ECSC has decreased between 1952 and 1967 and we discuss the different causes of this decrease. More specifically, we show how the importance of the so-called ‘coastal steelworks’ has increased between 1952 and 1967.

N64|Il dibattito degli economisti italiani sull’impresa pubblica negli anni Sessanta del ‘900<BR>[The debate on public corporation between Italian economists in the Sixties of the 20th Century]|The debate on public corporation between Italian economists in the Sixties of the 20th Century is characterized at least by four theorizations. The first is the macroeconomic one, in which public corporation is considered as an instrument of the policy of economic planning. The second is the institutional one: public corporation is seen as an economic institution which can develop the market where private enterprise fails. It can do it through the creation of different and complementary industries and a large-scale planned industrialization which doesn’t have to neglect economic efficiency. In the third approach, catholic economists see public corporation as an actor able to reinforce the market where it is not able to rise or where it is strongly inefficient. Finally, in the fourth thesis, liberal economists think that public corporation has to be managed as a private one and don’t have to be privileged by the government, not even for the development of depressed areas.

N64|Sísifo en España: doscientos años de banca francesa (c.1800-c.2000)|With unpublished sources, this paper draws the evolution of French banking in Spain between 1800 and 2000 and shows how French banks operated in the country, seeking, once and again, to consolidate business positions in a more and more difficult market. As the oldest foreign bank presence in the country, French banks strongly dominated the Spanish market in the 19th century. The turn of the 20th century and the Spanish economic evolution meant a sort of hibernation for French banks. They only did with it in the middle of the fifties. The second half of the 20th means for French banking the search of a place in the difficult Spanish bank market. Following the legislation and economy evolution, French banks diversified their financial supply in the sixties, lent capitals in the seventies and the eighties, and tried to compete with Spanish commercial banks in the nineties. Its evolution, for almost one hundred and fifty years, allows us to analyze an episode of foreign direct investment (FDI), focused, in this occasion, in transnational banking. This paper tries to contribute in the debate about persistent and changing patterns of FDI in a host country in the long run.

La IV Planta Siderúrgica Integral de Sagunto (1966-1977)|The aim of this article is to analyse the reasons for the creation of the Fourth Integrated Steel Plant in Sagunto. Using primary sources, we demonstrate that it was a rational decision that imitated the experience of other developed countries. This decision was based on a market study that failed in its steel consumption forecast. But such error was not due to the imperial dreams of Franco’s regime, but to the unforeseeable character of the 1970’s economic crisis and its effects on the steel industry.

N64|A Different Song: Schneider’s ‘Singede Steine’ as evidence of work practices in the late 12th century|"In the mid 1940's, while walking in the cloister of the monastery at Ripoll in Catalonia,ethnomusicologist Marius Schneider noted that the carvings of the column capitals seemed familiar. On inspection of these and the ones at Sant Cugat del Valles he realized that they were the creatures comprising an Indian musical notation. On further study he realized that they ""sang"" the hymn of the patron saint of the region, St. Cucufate. He further extended his findings to include the Cathedral at Girona as well as the monasteries at Ripoll and Sant Cugat del Valles. While this is a fascinating notion, that a 12th century carver was ""writing"" music in the stones of cloisters in the region, it has a practical implication for economic history as well. Given that carvers must be familiar with the stone of a region, and that their skills were generally more locally than widely known, it is unlikely that more than one workshop was undertaking this particular style. By this signature skill, carving Indian musical notation, it is possible to trace the path of the work of this particular workshop, and its master carver."
N64|Did Economics Cause World War II?|Historians have long recognized the role of economic resources and organization in determining the outcome of World War II: the Nazi economy lacked the economic resources and organization to oppose the combined might of the U.S., U.K., and U.S.S.R. A minority view is that the Germans were defeated not by economics, but by Hitler's many strategic and tactical mistakes, of which the most important was the invasion of the Soviet Union. Compared to this debate about the outcome of the war, there has been less attention to economics as the cause of World War II. This is a review article of a new economic history of the Nazi economy by Adam Tooze which cuts through the debate between economics and Hitler's mistakes as fundamental causes of the outcome. Instead, Tooze argues that the invasion of the Soviet Union was the inevitable result of Hitler's paranoia about the land-starved backwardness of German agriculture as contrasted with the raw material and land resources of America's continent and Britain's empire. The American frontier expansion that obliterated the native Indians provided Hitler with a explicit precedent, which he often cited, for pushing aside the native populations in the east to provide land for German Aryan farmers. Germany's agricultural weakness is summarized by its low land-labor ratio, but Poland and the Ukraine had even less land per person. Thus simply acquiring the land to the east could not solve Germany's problem of low agricultural productivity without removing the native farming populations. Far better than other histories of the Third Reich, Tooze reveals the shocking details of General Plan Ost, the uber-holocaust which would have removed, largely through murder, as many as 45 million people from eastern agricultural land. Tooze, like the Nazis before him, fails to emphasize that the solution to Germany's agricultural problem was not acquiring more land for the existing German farm population, but rather by raising the land-labor ratio by making the existing German land more efficient, mechanizing agriculture and encouraging rural-to-urban migration within Germany.
N64|In search of lost time. Large firms and technological innovation|This essay offers some thoughts prompted by reading volume X of the series of historical studies produced by the Bank of Italy – a volume devoted to analyzing the relationships between technological innovation and economic growth in Italy in the post-World War II period. The major message emerging from it is that technological innovation has declined in Italy as from the end of the 1980s due to the collapse of many of the big corporations that were alone able to develop innovative research and introduce technological change. It was therefore in the first place a crisis in demand that led to the decline in innovation, and only subsequently in supply.
N64|La primera crisis de SEAT: el veto a General Motors y la compra de AUTHI a British Leyland (1972-1976)|In 1972 SEAT was the first Spanish industrial firm and led the export of automobiles, thanks to a nationalist policy. However, the industrial policy of late Francoism experienced a dramatic change with the approval of Ford’s decrees. Such a change included the invitation to General Motors to rescue the Spanish subsidiary of British Leyland Motor Corporation (BLMC), AUTHI, in 1973. The purchase of its plant in Landaben by SEAT in 1975 has to be considered more the consequence of a pact preventing the entrance of General Motors than the outcome of direct pressure by government. The increase in the size of employment resulted to be a very risky decision for a company which was experiencing a significant push on labour costs since 1969 and a dangerous fall in demand since 1974. Moreover, the change of policy and the further removal of the veto on General Motors, would contribute to jeopardize the relationship with FIAT, ending the Honey moon experienced during the early seventies.

N64|Why sharecropping? : explaining its presence and absence in Europe's vineyards, 1750-1950|The traditional view that sharecropping was a cause of low productivity in European agriculture prior to the Second World War has been challenged by economic historians, and today the contact is often considered as efficient at reducing the monitoring costs associated with labour and allocation of risk between landowners and farmers, especially when capital markets were weak for working capital. Yet if sharecropping was a relatively efficient contract, why was it not found more often? This paper looks at the vine, a crop that was widespread in Europe and that has been central to the current debates. It argues that while the literature has been right to emphasise the importance of the high monitoring costs, it has ignored the equally important costs associated with dividing the harvest. These were sufficiently large to make the contract unattractive, except in the few cases where the landowner was prepared to be actively involved in wine making and its sale, such as was found in Beaujolais or Tuscany.
N64|Vers une politique sectorielle régionale ? Leçons à partir de l'histoire de l'industrie aérospatiale en Aquitaine|NAIn this paper, we examine the hypothesis of the increasing role of regional level for designing and driving industrial politics in France. We consider the case of aerospace industry and Aquitaine region. We adopt a historical approach, and consider three key periods. The first corresponds to the initial localizations of aerospace plants in Aquitaine: between WWI and sixties. Then we consider the nineties when the Aquitaine industry –essentially defence oriented- enters into crisis. The third period concerns the current years. This historical approach shows that the region is now a key actor for the local aerospace plants. It’s a new phenomenon. In the two first periods, the State oriented closely the development of this strategic industry; now the Aquitaine institutions are major sources for supporting the local enterprises.

N64|Parallel Development? Productivity Growth Following Electrification and the ICT Revolution|This paper investigates labor productivity growth and the contribution to labor productivity growth in Swedish manufacturing during electrification and the ICT revolution. The paper distinguishes between technology-producing, intensive and less intensive technology-using industries during these technological breakthroughs. The results show that labor productivity growth and the overall contribution to labor productivity growth was considerably higher in technology-producing industries following the ICT revolution. Moreover, the results presented here show no evidence that industries that were early adopters of electric motors and ICT, on average would have contributed more to productivity growth in Swedish manufacturing.
N64|Tawney's Century (1540-1640): the Roots of Modern Capitalist Entrepreneurship in England|Richard Tawney (1880-1962), who taught at the London School of Economics from 1917 to 1949, was unquestionably one of the very most important economic historians that England has ever produced: so much so, indeed, that the era of his major research and publications, 1540 - 1640, has justly come to be known as ï¿½Tawneyï¿½s Centuryï¿½. Those publications, and the debates that they provoked, concern the origins or roots of modern capitalism and (implicitly) capitalist entrepreneurship that were supposed to have been established in this century. Though the roots of those economic developments, in particular those leading to more modern forms of industrial capitalism, may indeed lie in that century, nevertheless the main thesis of this study is that most of their positive fruits are instead to be found in the ensuing century of 1640 - 1740, the century preceding the advent of the modern Industrial Revolution. Tawneyï¿½s seminal scholarship, towards these ends, was concerned with two major issues. The first considered in this study is his 1926 monograph: Religion and the Rise of Capitalism, which in part was designed to promote, in the English-speaking world, Max Weberï¿½s famous thesis (1905) on ï¿½The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalismï¿½. Both works focused on how three elements of one Protestant sect in particular, the Calvinists (from 1536), came to influence so deeply that Protestant Ethic and new ethos of modern capitalism: Predestination, the Calling, and ï¿½Worldly Asceticismï¿½. The significance of this form of Protestantism in England is that Calvinists and other Non-Conformists or Dissenters, those who refused to conform to the Church of England after the 1660 royalist Restoration, constituted about one half of the known scientists, innovators, and entrepreneurs from the later 17th century and through the Industrial Revolution era (1760-1820), though constituting only 5 percent of the population. The debate concerns the roles of their restricted (legislated) minority status and of schools and superior educational systems that they had to establish, but also the applicability of the Weber-Tawney thesis, in explaining their superior economic performance. Tawneyï¿½s second major issue was that of ï¿½agrarian capitalismï¿½, along with the supposed ï¿½rise of the gentryï¿½: involving the transfer of vast amounts of land from the old aristocracy, the crown and church together, and finally the free-holding yeomanry into the hands of a non-aristocratic upper class who were far more predisposed and able to engage in profit-maximizing agriculture, especially through enclosures and the technology of the New Husbandry. But if Tawney dates this shift from Henry VIIIï¿½s Dissolution of the Monasteries, in 1536, this study contends that the real shift, but certainly a major shift, to ï¿½agrarian capitalismï¿½, involving enclosures and the New Husbandry, again came only after the 1660s. To provide a contrast to Tawneyï¿½s work, this study examines two alternative theses on the origins of modern industrial capitalism within Tawneyï¿½s century (1540-1640): (1) Earl Hamiltonï¿½s thesis of ï¿½Profit Inflationï¿½, one fully endorsed by Keynes; and (2) John Nefï¿½s ï¿½Early Industrial Revolution in Tudor-Stuart Englandï¿½. The Hamilton thesis is rejected in this study, with the contention that its true importance was to inspire Nefï¿½s counter-thesis: on the decisive shift from wood and charcoal fuels to coal fuels, which in turn required very major technological changes (in furnace designs), which in turn led to major increases in industrial scale, and (for Nef) to true ï¿½industrial capitalismï¿½. This study, noting the importance of Wrigleyï¿½s similar thesis on a shift from an organic (wood-based) to an inorganic (coal-based) industrial economy, supports the essence of the Nef thesis ï¿½ but only for the period after 1640 (with new data). Finally, this study considers two other related changes so necessary for the development of early-modern capitalism, in this era: the development of the Full Rigged or Atlantic Ship (but from the 1450s) and the overseas joint-stock trading companies. Again, their major impact came after 1660, with the ï¿½New Colonialismï¿½ (Hobsbawm) or ï¿½Commercial Revolutionï¿½ (Davis). The study also considers the history of the English joint stock companies, from the first joint-stock company, in overseas trade (the Muscovy Company of 1553) to the Bubble Act of 1720, which restricted their formation until 1825. Also included is their role in the so-called ï¿½Financial Revolutionï¿½ from 1694 to 1757 (ï¿½Pelhamsï¿½s Conversionï¿½ of the national debt).

N64|Series De Deflactores Corcheros Desde 1900|The aim of this work is to elaborate series of deflators, for whole twentieth century, of three representative products in the cork business: raw cork, corkwood in planks and stoppers of natural cork. Given that prices of these products are not available, the data bases for reconstruction are, on one hand, unitary values of production and exports from Portugal and Spain and, on the other hand, unitary ones of United Kingdom’s imports. By using these values, selected after different tests of coherence and credibility, Laspeyres, Paasche and Fisher’s indexes and a “synthetic cork deflator” are calculated. Then, a preliminary analysis about the unitary values as a proxy to the prices during the second half of twentieth century is realized. At last, the main figures which have been employed to the building of the deflators are shown in a statistical appendix.

Unlike other food industries, the flour industry has decreased, especially in the last decades of the twentieth century, due to its low income elasticity. This work identifies four main characteristics of the growth of the flour industry from the years following the WWI until the last decades of the century: 1) the productive grew more rapidly than the production and the consumption; 2) the industry was composed of small establishments and firms which were maintained while the industry underwent a process of modernization towards the creation of bigger entities; 3) increasing state regulation; and 4) a process of convergence between the location of the flour industry and the wheat production areas due to the weight of the raw material in the total productive costs.

N64|Verkstadsindustri i globaliseringens tidevarv. En studie av SKF och Volvo 1970-2000|This working paper explores the impact of the globalization process 1970-2000 on two manufacturing industries in the Gothenburg area –SKF and Volvo. Three aspects of the process are highlighted: the development of new Information and Communication Technology (ICT), the increased mobility of capital, and the increased importance of knowledge in manufacturing industry. The history of the two companies is analyzed from the early 1970s to the turn of the century, using literature and interviews. Firstly, the paper explores the organizational development of the two companies. The study shows how SKF and Volvo during these years transformed from being organized as nationally oriented hierarchies to become nodes in global networks. Secondly, a number of specific themes are explored, such as ownership, branding, R&D, and outsourcing. The international ownership increased and the production is now coordinated on a global scale. The main conclusion of this working paper is that SKF and Volvo are representatives of an emerging informational economy. The flexibility generated by new ICT and more liquid financial markets has proven to promote economic growth, while at the same time generate social conflicts as the labour security decreases.
N64|0 Comércio Externo Corticeiro na Peninsula Ibérica no Período de 1930 a 1974 - Uma Perspectiva Comparada|The aim of this paper is to undertake a comparative analysis of the particular features of the foreign trade in cork products from Portugal and Spain between 1930 and 1974. In the first part, we analyse the main structural alterations that occurred in the foreign trade in cork products from the two countries. This analysis highlights the Spanish loss of leadership in the area of cork exports, which passed to Portuguese producers after the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). Next we explain the reasons for this change, beginning with a series of factors that we consider to be the most relevant for the period under study. Because of the State's heavy involvement in the economy, a feature that was inherent in the political regimes of Salazar and Franco, questions relating to the institutional framework of the cork sector appear to be particularly pertinent, especially matters relating to the industrial, commercial and foreign exchange policies that were implemented in the two countries. Furthermore, in relation to the institutional question, we highlight the processes leading to the opening up of the two economies to the outside world during the period under study- namely their links with EFTA and the EEC. Such changes were all the more important because the foreign markets represented the preferential destination for the two countries' cork production. In the last part of this work, consideration of the production costs also shows itself to have been a decisive factor in determining the capacity to compete in foreign markets, where the two Iberian countries were faced with competition both from other cork-producing countries and from substitute products.
N64|Networks of People in Specialty Production: Family Firms in the Iron and Steel Wire Industries in Spain (1870-2000)|Capital intensive industries in specialized niches of production have constituted solid ground for family firms in Spain, as evidenced by the experience of the iron and steel wire industries between 1870 and 2000. The embeddedness of these firms in their local and regional environments have allowed the creation of networks that, together with favourable institutional conditions, significantly explain the dominance of family entrepreneurship in iron and steel wire manufacturing in Spain, until the end of the 20th century. Dominance of family firms at the regional level has not been an obstacle for innovation in wire manufacturing in Spain, which has taken place even when institutional conditions blocked innovation and traditional networking. Therefore, economic theories about the difficulties dynastic family firms may have to perform appropriately in science-based industries must be questioned.

La fabricación de locomotoras de vapor en España, ¿Una ocasión perdida para la industria?|El objetivo de este trabajo es el de analizar si existían elementos objetivos, de carácter tecnológico o infraestructural, que impidieran un temprano nacimiento de la industria de construcción de material ferroviario y, específicamente, de locomotoras de vapor. Para ello se hace un repaso a lo acontecido en otros países de la Europa occidental y Estados Unidos para conocer en que condiciones surgió esta actividad. A continuación se efectúa una reconstrucción del parque de locomotoras de las mayores compañías ferroviarias españoles, con el objeto de conocer su demanda y la procedencia de las locomotoras adquiridas. Seguidamente se reflexiona sobre las condiciones de la industria española en la segunda mitad del siglo XIX al objeto de establecer comparaciones con otros países que nos indiquen si las diferencias eran o no especialmente sustanciales. Por último se estudia, sintéticamente, la aparición del sector en España y su posterior desarrollo, lo que permite observar las similitudes y divergencias con los países de nuestro entorno .

En ese sentido, cuatro son los grandes paradigmas tecnológicos dentro del axioma termodinámico: las máquinas alternativas de vapor, los motores de combustión interna alternativos, las turbinas de vapor y las turbinas de gas. Cada una de estas trayectorias abrió oportunidades tecnológicas e industriales que, en un país atrasado y dependiente como España, fueron difíciles de aprovechar. En los tres primeros paradigmas descritos los procesos de innovación nacionales fueron muy escasos durante el periodo estudiado –cuando no inexistentes–, pero incluso la aparición y crecimiento de un sector industrial especializado en la fabricación de motores térmicos, aunque fuese a partir de la tecnología exterior, fue, o bien muy tardío (caso de las máquinas alternativas de vapor) o bien suficientemente lento y escaso (motores de combustión interna alternativos y turbinas de vapor) como para no poderlo considerar un sector clave en el cambio estructural, por más que durante el primer tercio del siglo XX se desarrollaran en la Península algunos centros importantes de producción de motores. Analizando los hitos principales en la historia tecnológica de las máquinas térmicas y estudiando en detalle todas las patentes relacionadas que se registraron en España entre 1826 y 1914 –junto con las más significativas depositadas en otros países– se pretende arrojar luz sobre la mecánica de los procesos de cambio técnico en el largo plazo, sobre las características del sistema español de innovación y sobre las causas de su escasa participación en el establecimiento y dirección de las trayectorias de los motores térmicos. Por último, también pretendemos acercarnos al origen de la industria nacional relacionada con este tipo de maquinaria antes de la Primera Guerra Mundial, para tratar de averiguar en qué medida pudieron existir capacidades y actitudes innovadoras y cuál fue su grado de dependencia tecnológica del exterior.
N64|Siglo y medio de comercio exterior de productos corcheros en españa, 1849-1999|In this work it is analyzed the evolution and composition of the foreign Spanish trade of cork products during the second half of the XIXth century and the XXth century. For it there has been in use the Estadística del Comercio Exterior de España, elaborated from 1849 up to the current importance. The above mentioned analysis sets up important changes in the characteristics that the cork business has had in Spain during the considered period, at least from a commercial point of view, emphasizing the major relevancy acquired by the import trade in the last quarter of the XXth century and the return to the stopper, which has frustrated the diversification process of the cork industry and trade, initiated in the first years of last century. For countries, Portugal has turned, from the civil war, into the first world power to the detriment of Spain. Our country could not have recovered the commercial leadership, that had during the second half of the XIXth century and the first third of the XXth, on the principal cork markets and, at present, it has small presence, in relative terms, on the markets of the new wine countries, great buyers of cork stoppers.
N64|Were Spanish migrants attracted by industrial agglomerations? An analysis for the interwar years in the light of the new economic geography|In this paper we examine whether access to markets had a significant influence on migration choices of Spanish internal migrants in the inter-war years. We perform a structural contrast of a New Economic Geography model that focus on the forward linkage that links workers location choice with the geography of industrial production, one of the centripetal forces that drive agglomeration in the NEG models. The results highlight the presence of this forward linkage in the Spanish economy of the inter-war period. That is, we prove the existence of a direct relation between workers localization decisions and the market potential of the host regions. In addition, the direct estimation of the values associated with key parameters in the NEG model allows us to simulate the migratory flows derived from different scenarios of the relative size of regions and the distances between them. We show that in Spain the power of attraction of the agglomerations grew as they increased in size, but the high elasticity estimated for the migration costs reduced the intensity of the migratory flows. This could help to explain the apparently low intensity of internal migrations in Spain until its upsurge during the 1920s. This also explains the geography of migrations in Spain during this period, which hardly affected the regions furthest from the large industrial agglomerations (i.e., regions such as Andalusia, Estremadura and Castile-La Mancha) but had an intense effect on the provinces nearest to the principal centres of industrial development.

In addition to the description of the procedure, this illustration is particularly useful in explaining why the method is especially appropriate for comparison of trends growth rates extracted from time series with diverse degrees of variability.
N64|O Crescimento da Produtividade da Indústria Portuguesa no Século XX|This paper examines the growth of Portuguese industry throughout the XXth century, focusing on the dynamics of its productivity, measured by the ratio of value added to labor force. The analysis consists of: (i) construction of productivity indices for the Portuguese industrial sector and sub-sectors, as well as for the industrial sectors of fourteen European countries, covering the widest possible period within the century; (ii) identification of growth cycles for each productivity series, by means of estimation of trend growth rates; (iii) assessment of the contributions of each sector to the productivity dynamics in each growth cycle, using structural change analysis and international and inter-industries comparisons; (iv) appraisal of the results in the light of previous analyses of historical data.Portuguese industrial productivity has trended up systematically during the XXth century, but with well-differentiated growth phases matching the institutional changes that most markedly influenced the economy. The growth cycles clearly distinguish a first phase of weak growth, until the beginning of the 50s, from a subsequent phase of strong vitality and industrial modernization, especially in the manufacturing industry, ending in the mid-70s. A negative growth cycle follows, until the mid-80s, in which the consumption goods industries, with a large share in total industry, assured a minimum productivity threshold, in a context of severe reductions in the industries producing intermediate and capital goods. During the last fifteen years of the century, a new positive growth cycle emerged, led by some modern manufacturing sectors, although with a clear deindustrialization trend, ie of loss of production and labor force shares, in favor of services. The two phases of higher industrial productivity growth, 1951-1973 and 1985-2000, coincided to a large extent with institutional changes leading to openness and international integration, which proved to be crucial in enhancing the international tradability of industrial goods. When assessed in international perspective, with a focus on Europe, the performance of Portuguese industrial productivity is much less impressive, even during the cycle of higher growth and industrialization – 50s and 60s.
N64|Spanish Merino wools and the Nouvelles Draperies: an industrial transformation in the late-medieval Low Countries|This article seeks to explain why Spanish merino wools arrived so late in the Low Countries, only from the 1420s, why initially only those cloth producers known as the 'nouvelles draperies' chose to use them, and why their resort to such merino wools allowed at least some of them to escape the current crisis afflicting the traditional ‘old draperies’, and indeed to expand to become the chief producers of woollen cloths in the southern Low Countries during the later fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. Although the merino have been by far the world’s finest wools, since at least the seventeenth century, English wools had enjoyed that supremacy in the medieval era. The Spanish sheep breeds that produced the first merino wools did not emerge until or after the 1340s; and it took many decades of experimental breeding and improved flock management to produce better quality wools in sufficient quantities for export (first to Italy). Before the introduction of merinos, the indigenous Spanish sheep had produced some of the worst wools in Europe. In the thirteenth century, they were used only in making very cheap, coarse, light cloths, when north-west Europe was producing a wide range of textiles, from such coarse light generally worsted-style fabrics to the most luxurious woollens. For reasons that I have elaborated elsewhere, the onset of a spreading stain of chronic and debilitating wars, from the 1290s, throughout the Mediterranean basin and north-west Europe, resulted in a sharp rise in transaction costs that made long-distance trade in cheaper textiles unprofitable. Consequently, by the 1330s, most north-west European draperies had abandoned export-oriented production of cheaper line textiles to concentrate on very high priced luxury woollens, those that could so much better ‘bear the freight’. Furthermore, in Flanders, a considerable number of small-town and village producers engaged in precisely the same industrial re-orientation; but in producing genuine heavy weight woollens, they sought to imitate those of the large Flemish towns; and, in selling their cloths at lower prices, came to be known as the nouvelles draperies. This industrial reorientation meant that cloth producers in the Low Countries became all the more reliant on English wools, above all the traditional urban draperies (who came to use such wools exclusively). The English crown was quick to exploit this dependency by sharply raising export taxes, which, by the 1390s, constituted half of the sales price; and that in turn accounted for up to 70 percent of production costs in the Low Countries’ urban draperies. Meanwhile, English cloth exports, very lightly taxed, gained an enormous cost and thus price advantage, but one not fully exploited until the fifteenth century. The catalyst for the final economic crisis, one that brought about the irredeemable decline of most of the urban draperies in the Low Countries, and the expansion of the nouvelles draperies, took place from 1429 to 1473, when the English crown sought to exploit the wool trade even further, in pursuing ill-advised bullionist policies: by requiring that the Calais Staple wool cartel sharply raise prices, that it seel all wools only for ‘ready English money’ without credit, and that it deliver one third of the sales receipts to the mint in gold bullion. Not until the 1470s did the Burgundians succeed in having these bullionist ordinances revoked. Meanwhile the traditional Flemish and Brabantine draperies, in continuing to use such high-cost English wools exclusively, for fear of losing customers, ensured their own rapid decline, indeed losing markets to both the English cloth trade and the nouvelles draperies, who also acquired considerable capital and labour from the declining draperies. Their success, as less quality-conscious imitators, lay in their willingness to use the far cheaper but now improved Spanish wools. An historic prejudice against pre-merino Spanish wools probably explains whey even they had not used these wools before the onset of this crisis. Having displaced the traditional draperies, the nouvelles draperies reached their apogee in the 1540s, when they were superseded by the sayetteries, after international market conditions had once more favoured long-distance trade in truly cheaper, light textiles.
N64|The Cutting Edge of Modernity: Machine Tools in the United States and Germany 1930-1945|This paper aims to examine the difference between US and European manufacturing before and during the World War II, focusing on the key technology in the metal-working sector: machine tools. We present a new data set covering the installed capacity of metal-working tools in the United States and Germany for the period 1930-1945. The existing literature is heavily dependent on assumptions about the different type of machine tools in use on either side of the Atlantic. So far, systematic comparison has been limited to case studies. This is the first attempt to quantify the differences in this key technology for the entirety of metal-working in both economies. The enormous detail of the statistical sources we have uncovered allows us to combine aggregation and a degree of specificity, which exceeds that of any previous case study. In the German case, the original data is divided into well over a hundred sub-categories. For comparative purposes, we have identified 19 major classes of machines, which aggregate over 50 sub-categories. Our results suggest the need for a far more nuanced understanding of metal-working than the dichotomous picture of American mass manufacture, reliant on special-purpose tools, and European craft manufacturing employing general-purpose machinery. For 1930, we find a remarkable similarity in machine to worker ratios between Germany and the United States. There are differences in certain key areas. However, the US stock of metal-working tools is not yet distinguished by a clear commitment to mass production technology. For the period after 1935, until the early 1940s, our data suggest a remarkable degree of convergence. The American stock stagnated. In some areas, there was disinvestment. And the average age of machinery rose dramatically. By contrast, Germany entered a period of rapid catch-up, which appears to have continued into the early years of the war. By 1940, German metal-working came close to matching its American counterpart in terms of the number of workers employed and the quantity and types of machines installed. German machines were, on average, far younger. This process of catching-up, however, was dramatically reversed during World War II. Over a period of no more than four years the American stock expanded by over eighty percent and growth was markedly concentrated in key categories of mass production equipment. It appears that it was only in this period that mass production machinery came to truly dominate US metal-working. German investment, albeit moving in the same direction, failed to match the new intensity of American commitment to mass production in some key machinery classes
N64|Desarrollo, crisis y reconversión de la siderurgia española a través de una empresa vizcaína AHV (1929-1996)|The process of industrialisation in the Basque Country experienced a change and acceleration as from the setting up of three large siderurgical plants (Altos Hornos de Bilbao, La Vizcaya y La San Francisco) around 1882. Thus heavy industry was prioritised over light industry, and especially so after the 1891 customs duties to siderurgy as a whole. This model of economic development 'large companies of the siderurgical sector that conformed the industrial fabric' especially affected Biskaia and lasted up until the oil crisis in the nineteen-seventies and the industrial reconversion of the nineteen-eighties. The closing down of Altos Hornos de Vizcaya and its partial replacement by a mini-smelting plant and the closing down and the reiterated difficulties of the large shipyards that survived, evidence a substantial transformation of the economic model, which has been traumatic for many sectors. The successive tariff liberalisations have largely been the cause of such a change.
N64|Crisis y reconversión de la industria de construcción naval en el País Vasco|The Basque shipbuilding industry, which had experienced a golden age during the period 1959- 1974 thanks to the State support, faced from 1974 onwards the impact of the international shipping crisis and the challenges stemming from the entry of Spain into the EEC. The process of industrial restructuring, effected during the 1980s, diminished the productive capacity, the number and size of the establishments and the employment, without a great social cost, but did not solve the problem of scarce competitiveness of the industry with regard to Asian producers. The full integration of Spain in the EEC in 1990 and the subordination to the European policy have provoked a second restructuring in the Basque shipbuilding industry, led by the small and medium shipyards, what has resulted in a further decrease of the productive capacity and employment, and of the relative importance of the shipbuilding industry in the Basque one as a whole. However, by changing their production and commercialisation strategies, the small and medium shipyards have been able to face with relative success the challenge of international competitiveness.
N64|A hesitant evolution: industrialisation and de-industrialisation in Greece over the long run|The paper is an attempt to examine the idiosyncratic unfolding of Greek industrialisation and de-industrialisation from a long-run perspective (1867-1994). Following stylized facts, it is shown that the main shifts in the Greek economy occurred outside industry (from agriculture to services). Also, industrialization was a hesitant process evolving slowly and reaching a plateau in 1950-73. Three structural continuities that accompanied this progress have been a large state sector, the commercial character of Greek entrepreneurship and the incomplete transition from a mercantile/family to corporate capitalism. Also, a rising share of manufacturing in GDP related consistently with increasing per capita income, improving trade performance and ‘trading up’ efforts within manufacturing.
N64|Transformation Pressure and Growth - a Missing Link in Macroeconomics|Economists and politicians in Sweden stated in the early 1990s that devaluations of the country's currency had lessened the external pressure on manufacturing and led to a delay in structural change and rationalizations. The theory of transformation pressure generalizes the idea that productivity growth in firms is promoted by intense competition, cost pushes and low product demand. The main challenge faced by such a theory is to explain why it seems that an immediate threat is needed to get a productive response from firms. Three separate explanations are presented here emphasizing either the value of waiting to get more information about potential threats, the irrational tendency to ignore threats until they show up or the stimulation of individual creativity when firms are put under real pressure. But productivity growth is not always promoted by tight external circumstances. Growth may be maximized if pressure in each period is moderate or if periods with strong pressure are followed by periods of financial and technical consolidation, scale advantages and lesser needs to spend resources on rationalization in order to survive.
N64|Did Manufacturing Guilds Monopolize Markets in Medieval England?|The prevailing paradigm of medieval industry rests on the belief that guilds monopolized markets for manufactures. The type of market power possessed by guild which manufactured durable goods is, however, unclear. Scholars have shown manufacturing guilds did not possess natural monopolies.
N64|The Legal Structure of Markets for Manufactures in Medieval England|The prevailing paradigm presumes that manufacturing guilds in medieval England monopolized markets for durable goods. The sources of the monopolies are said to have been the charters of towns, charters of guilds, parliamentary statutes, and judicial precedents.This essay examines those sources, shows they did not give guilds legal monopolies in the modern sense of the word, and replaces that erroneous assumption with an accurate description of the legal institutions underlying markets for manufactures in medieval England.
N64|How to Win Schumpeterian Competition: Technological Transfers in the German Plastics Industry from the 1930s to the 1970s|Introducing the concept of innovation capital we will analyse conditions under which a national industry is able to succeed in international Schumpeterian competition. Then we will discuss the significance of this concept for the economic development of the German plastics industry from the 1930s to the 1970s. Using a repeated game model of technological cooperation we will especially focus on technological transfers from chemical firms to plastics fabricators. We will deploy both a microeconomic approach when viewing product innovations transferred by the so-called Kunststoffrohstoffabteilung (KURO) of chemical firm BASF, and a macroeconomic approach when looking at the development of total factor productivity in the German plastics fabricating industry. It will turn out that we can distinguish three subperiods with respect to technological cooperation in the German plastics industry: the beginning in the period of National Socialist dictatorship and post war reconstruction, the developing in the time of the West German economic miracle, and the ending in the decade of the two oil price shocks.
N64|Semicollusion in the Norwegian cement market|A model of semicollusion, where firms collude on prices and compete on capacities, is tailor-made to the characteristics of the Norwegian cement market and tested empirically on this particular market for the period 1927-1982. The results indicate that the rapid increase in capacity and thereby in exports in the period 1956 to 1967, the late phase of the price cartel, best can be explained by the market sharing agreement : each firm overinvested in capacity to receive a large quota in the domestic market.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N64|Accounting for Productivity Growth in Norwegian Manufacturing Industries 1927-1959|This paper presents estimates of total factor productivity growth for 55 manufacturing industries over the period 1927 to 1959. The long-run rate of growth in TFB is about 1 per cent per year for total manufacturing, but there are considerable variations in TFP growth rates acros industries and over time. For total manufacturing the TFP growth rate was higher in the 1930s than in the 1950s. The first half of the 1950s are characterized by a high rate of output expansion but a marked slowdown in TFP growth, particularly in the export-oriented industries. Is is conjectured that TFP growth in the early 1950s was negatively affected by government regulations and overinvestment in real capital.
N64|The Low Countries' Export Trade in Textiles with the Mediterranean Basin, 1200-1600: A Cost-Benefit Analysis of Comparative Advantages in Overland and Maritime Trade Routes|This paper challenges the conventional wisdom in European economic history that long-distance maritime transport was always more cost-effective than overland trade routes. Thus the majority of historians in the past century have attributed the rapid decline of the medieval Champagne Fairs, governing the textile trades between the Low Countries, northern France, and Italy, to the establishment of an effective and permanent' direct sea-route between Italy and north-west Europe from the early 14th century (though the first, a Genoese galley, can be dated to 1277). The paper concludes by examining the various factors and forces that led to a fall in transport and transaction costs in the international textile trades, via the overland routes, including river routes, between north-west Europe and the Mediterranean basin from the later 15th to early 17th centuries.
N64|State and industry in the 1940s: The Spanish automobile industry|The decade of the 1940s was one of the darkest periods in the country's history, with years of famine, repression, general misery, and impoverishment of all aspects of national life ranging from culture to the economy. During those years plans were made to establish a Spanish motor industry once the Civil War had come to an end in 1939. It seemed a propitious moment for private enterprise and various foreign motor companies presented proposals for manufacturing their entire vehicle range, from cars to trucks. However, the government plans were for a State monopoly, a policy which meant that any private projects which did not contemplate the regime taking management decisions were rejected out of hand. From 1941 onwards, any new initiative was required to meet the plans set by INI. The main argument running through this paper is that one can only understand the development of the modern Spanish motor industry if one grasps the haggling between motor companies and government regarding market entry and the impact of the regime's autarchic policies in the 1940s.
N64|The Theory of Transformation Pressure - a New Perspective on Growth and Economic Policy|"The theory of transformation pressure offers a uniquely Swedish perspective on the ""productivity slowdown"" of the 1970s and 1980s. One example of this theory can be found in an influential argument from the early 1990s which states that devaluations of the Swedish currency lessened the external pressure on manufacturing and led to a delay in structural change and rationalisations. The theory generalises the idea that productivity growth in firms is stimulated by intense competition, cost pressures and low or qualified demand. The main challenge faced by such a theory is to explain why it seems that an immediate threat is needed to get a productive response from firms. The theory presented here assumes either genuine uncertainty, irrational behaviour or that firms become more creative when they are put under real pressure. Productivity growth is not always promoted by tight external circumstances. Growth may be maximised if pressure in each period is moderate or if periods with strong pressure are followed by periods of financial and technical consolidation."
N64|Entrepreneurship, organization and economic performance among Spanish firms, 1930-1975. The case of the motor industry|Before the Civil War (1936-1939), Spain had seen the emergence of firms of complex organizational forms. However, the conflict and the postwar years changed this pattern. The argument put forward in this paper is based on historical experience, the efforts will be addressed to explain the development of Spanish entrepreneurship during the second half of the twentieth century. To illustrate the change in entrepreneurship and organizational patterns among the Spanish firms during the Francoist regime we will turn to the case of the motor vehicle industry.
N64|The Evolution of Britain's Urban Built Environment : 1840-1960|This paper examines the evolution of the non-residential urban built environment in Britain form the 1840s to the 1950s. Long-run trends towards both functional and geographical specialisation of offices, shops, and industrial property are identified and the economic, and other, forces which contributred to this process are discussed. The paper also outlines the evolution of Britain's property development and investment sectors and their contribution to the built environment's evolution.
N64|Organizational Capabilities and the Economic History of the Industrial Enterprise|"In my book Scale and Scope (1990), I focused on the history of the modern industrial firm from the 1880s, when such firms first appeared, through World War II. I did so by comparing the fortunes of more than 600 enterprises—the 200 largest industrial firms at three points in time (World War I, 1929, and World War II) in each of the three major industrial economies (those of the United States, Britain, and Germany). In this paper, I first describe the similarities in the historical beginnings and continuing evolution of these enterprises and then outline my explanation for these similarities. Next, I relate my explanation of these ""empirical regularities"" to four major economic theories relating to the firm: the neoclassical, the principal-agent, the transaction cost, and the evolutionary. Finally, I suggest the value of the transactions cost and evolutionary theories to historians and economists who are attempting to explain the beginnings and growth of modern industrial enterprises."
