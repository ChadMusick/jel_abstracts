F39|Estimates of Foreign Assets and Liabilities for Ireland|This paper calculates foreign assets and liabilities for Ireland that are more reflective of foreign activities of Irish-resident entities. This is accomplished by stripping from the Irish international investment position the intermediation component that arises from the activities of investment funds and special purpose entities and, to some extent, correcting distortions arising from redomiciled PLCs, intellectual property transfers and aircraft leasing. My estimations not only reduce substantially gross external positions, but also shrink the extent of Irish net foreign indebtedness from 280 to 80 per cent of modified gross national income.
F39|On the preferences of CoCo bond buyers and sellers: a logistic regression analysis|This paper estimates the preference scores of CoCo bond buyers and sellers by running logistic regressions taking into account both bond and issuing bank’s characteristics, and also considers the role of country−specific CoCo bond market competitiveness. Buyers are found to be characterised by stronger preference responses to CoCo bond coupons and credit ratings, while sellers are more sensitive to CoCo bond issue size and financial characteristics including return on common equity, price−to−book ratio and total regulatory capital to risk−weighted asset ratio. Further, sizeable responses to CoCo bond and issuing bank’s characteristics are found in most European countries, Brazil, Mexico and China, the strongest responses being estimated in the case of the UK and China.
F39|Country factors and the investment decision-making process of sovereign wealth funds|In this paper, we examine the complex decision-making processes that lead to sovereign wealth funds' (SWFs’) choice of investment location. Using a two-tiered dynamic Tobit panel model, we find that country-level factors do not have the same impacts on the investment decision and the amount to invest and that SWFs tend to invest more frequently and at higher amounts in countries in which they have already invested. More specifically, we find that SWFs prefer to invest in countries with higher political stability, whereas they are more prone to invest large amounts in countries that are less democratic and more financially open. Our results also lend support to the idea that SWFs are prudent in their choice of a target country with regard to their investment decision but behave as more opportunistic investors with regard to the amounts to be invested.
F39|Digitalization and Firm Performance in Thailand: Evidence from Firm Dividend Payout Policy|Digitalization has continuously transformed economy in the global landscape, including developing countries in ASEAN region. Accordingly, Thailand has established a framework for digital economy development alongside with the ?Thailand 4.0? policy to enhance the country competitiveness. As part of this initiative, healthcare services are profoundly promoted and aimed to be Asia?s capital of health and wellness, as well as a number of digital projects are initiated to drive forward this digitalization. Consequently, businesses in both ICT and healthcare sector should be beneficial from this policy, and should reveal in their financial performance. In corporate finance, firm?s dividend decision could provide useful information about firm performance, and might be taken into consideration when making their investment decision. This paper examines the relationship between dividend per share and financial performance using panel data from Thailand listed firms in ICT and healthcare sectors during the period 2009-2018. In order to investigate such relationship, return on asset (ROA) is a proxy for firm financial performance while firm size, asset tangibility and leverage are treated as controlled variables. Regression results confirms the differences of such relationship between the two sectors. In ICT sector, both firm size and dividend per share shows positive and significant relationship to the firm performance, which provide evidence in support of both Signaling and Bird-in-hand hypotheses of dividend policy theory. Contrary, there is no clear evidence from firms in the Healthcare sector, whose financial performance only depends significantly on asset tangibility but not on dividend.
F39|Emergence of sovereign wealth funds|In this paper we show that domestic economic and political characteristics can explain why some countries established a Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) and others not. We find that 1) the existence of natural resources profits, 2) the government structure and 3) the ability to invest in a socially beneficial way in the domestic economy can explain this choice. At the same time these same factors do not relate to the size of the national savings. We use a sample of countries that established a SWF in the period 1998–2008 and compare them to those that did not set up a fund in the same period. The results suggest that SWFs tend to be established in autocratically run countries that have difficulties finding suitable opportunities for domestic investments.
F39|Is the emergence of new sovereign wealth funds a fashion phenomenon?|Abstract The paper deals with the important financial policy issue of the decision for a country to establish a sovereign wealth fund (SWF). Using a large-scale database, we analyze the economic, political and institutional factors that should be considered in such a decision. In particular, we test if the emergence of SWFs and more specifically of a specific type of SWFs can be explained by the following factors: the excess foreign exchange reserves due to natural resources rents or persistent current account surpluses; the volatility of commodity prices; the appreciation of the real exchange rate leading to the “Dutch Disease” effect and the governance of the country. The results suggest that countries with excess foreign exchange reserves, which are dependent on a commodity and which suffer from an appreciation of the real exchange rate are more likely to create a fund. We also find that commodity-based funds tend to be established in low democratic countries. Finally, our results suggest that the factors driving SWFs creation are different depending on the origin of the funding (commodity or non-commodity) and the macroeconomic objective(s) assigned to the fund. Our results may be of interest for policymakers debating whether or not it can be optimal for the country to establish a SWF.
F39|Long-Run Determinants of Japanese Import Flows from USA and China : A Sectoral Approach|We analyze the determinants of the sectoral Japanese imports from her two main partners, China and the USA over the period 1971-2007. We estimate cointegration relationships with breaks, using the Saikkonen-Lütkepohl method. For six sectors: foods, raw materials, textile, mineral fuel, chemicals and machinery and equipment, we show that if the domestic demand affects positively the imports, the impact of prices changes can be different whether we retain the relative prices (homogeneity hypothesis) or we consider both domestic and import, while when we decompose the relative prices between imports prices and domestic (corporate) prices, except in one case (textile imports from the USA), we can reject the homogeneity hypothesis. A possible explanation is the greater volatility of import prices compared to domestic prices which leads importers to wait when import prices change, insofar as they don't if these changes are temporary or permanent.
F39|Long‐Run Determinants Of Japanese Exports To China And The United States: A Sectoral Analysis|We show that during the period 1971–2007, Japanese sectoral exports to China and the United States have depended on real exchange rate fluctuations and external demand (gross domestic product of the country of destination). This result holds for six sectors: foods, textile, metal products, chemicals, non-metal products, and machinery and equipment, as well as for both geographical destinations. Generally, the real exchange rate fluctuations and GDP have had the expected effects. In particular, a real appreciation of the yen and a bigger uncertainty has reduced the Japanese exports. But there is an important exception, as we find a price inelasticity of the principal Japanese exports to USA, i.e. Machinery and Equipment, which represent 80 percent of total exports to USA. So, a real depreciation of the yen may constitute an inappropriate policy to favor a process of growth export-led.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F39|Operationalising selected reporting and flexibility provisions in the Paris Agreement|An enhanced transparency framework is a central component of the Agreement, and will apply to all Parties, with flexibility for developing country Parties that need it in the light of their capacities. This paper examines how such flexibility might be operationalised when reporting information under the future enhanced transparency system for greenhouse gas inventories and for progress towards the mitigation component of NDCs under Article 4. The paper also highlights how improvements over time in reporting of adaptation, and support needed and received could be encouraged. For each individual reporting element in these four areas, the paper identifies possible ways that countries with a range of different capacity levels could provide information for specific elements under the four reporting areas examined in the paper.
F39|Myths and Observations on Unconventional Monetary Policy -- Takeaways from Post-Bubble Japan --|Reservations are sometimes raised regarding the effectiveness of unconventional monetary policy (UMP) due to the concerns about influences of impaired financial systems and low policy rates. To see if this is the case, we combine the local projection method of Jorda (2005) with shadow rates to estimate macroeconomic effects of monetary policy shocks during the implementation period of UMP, and test if effects of these shocks with the same magnitude differ across periods or states of the economy, using Japan's data from the 1980s to 2016. We find that monetary policy shocks during the implementation period of the UMP had statistically significant expansionary effects on the economy. We also find that an unexpected 100 basis point cut in shadow rates during the UMP yielded larger expansionary effects on key economic variables than it did during the conventional monetary policy (CMP), because of the following three reasons: (i) A cut in the shadow rates resulted in a larger reduction in the real interest rate, and affected a wider range of borrowing rates during the UMP; (ii) The effectiveness of monetary policy shocks was dampened when the financial system was significantly impaired, particularly during the CMP; (iii) Other things being equal, the effectiveness has been so far little affected by the level of policy rate. Our results show that UMP has been effective, but that the nature of monetary transmission is subject to change depending on financial conditions or other economic circumstances, and therefore monetary policy needs to be carefully implemented. Note also that our study only explores the effects of a one-unit shock to the monetary policy rule, and does not address the entire effects of monetary easing that are affected by the size of shocks as well.
F39|Do extreme returns matter in emerging markets? Evidence from the Chinese stock market|Recent evidence in the U.S. and Europe indicates that stocks with high maximum daily returns in the previous month, perform poorly in the current month. We investigate the presence of a similar effect in the emerging Chinese stock markets with portfolio-level analysis and firm-level Fama–MacBeth cross-sectional regressions. We find evidence of a MAX effect similar to the U.S. and European markets. However, contrary to U.S. and European evidence, the MAX effect in China does not weaken much less reverse the anomalous idiosyncratic volatility (IV) effect. Both the MAX and IV effects appear to independently coexist in the Chinese stock markets. Interpreted together with the strong evidence of risk-seeking behaviour among Chinese investors, our results partially support the suggestion that the negative MAX effect is driven by investor preference for stocks with lottery-like features.
F39|The effects of fair value reporting on corporate foreign exchange exposures|We analyze the effects of fair value reporting standards (FVR) SFAS 133 and IAS 39 on foreign exchange (FX) exposures of U.S. multinational firms. We observe reductions in FX exposures to developed market currencies that coincide with the implementation of FVR. Risk reductions mainly affect U.S. multinational firms and to a much lesser extent matched control groups of domestic firms. For firms with exposures to emerging market currencies, we observe no changes in positive FX exposures but substantial shifts in negative exposures resulting in a change of exposure direction. Additionally we report changes in FX exposure asymmetry affecting multinational and domestic firms. Observed results are robust to several alternative model specifications and are unlikely explained by the launch of the euro, changes in firm-level FX exposure determinants, the rise and decline of technology shocks, shifts in systematic risk factors, or the Asian Financial Crisis.
F39|Trade Credit Insurance and Asymmetric Information Problem|The presence of different risk factors in international trade gives evidence of the necessity of support in gaps that may affect exporters’ activity. To maximize the trade volumes and in the same time to minimize the exporters’ risks the stakeholders use trade credit insurance. The paper provides analysis of conceptual background of the trade credit insurance in the world. We analyzed briefly the problems, arising in insurance markets due to asymmetric information, such as adverse selection and moral hazard. Also we discuss the main stages of development of trade credit insurance in countries worldwide. Using comparative and graphical analysis we provide a brief evaluation of the dynamics of claims and recoveries for different forms of trade credit insurance. We found that the claims related to the commercial risk for medium and long trade credits in recent years exceed the recoveries, while with the political risk the reverse trend holds. And we originally consider these findings in terms of information asymmetry in the trade credit insurance differentiated by type of risk.
F39|Emigrant’s remittances, Dutch Disease and capital accumulation: the case of Bangladesh|This paper examines varying macroeconomic impacts of international emigrant remittances in Bangladesh since 1976 by using a vector auto-regression (VAR) framework. Bangladesh has recorded better economic performance during last two decades, 1996-2014, compared to earlier two decades, 1976-1995. The time-series analysis therefore uncovers some transition in the remittance impacts composed of the “Dutch Disease” effect and the capital accumulation effect. The empirical results reveal the existence of the Dutch Disease effect for the first period, 1976-1995, but turned to show the positive impact on capital accumulation for the second period, 1996-2014. We speculate that the recent manufacturing-oriented policies together with institutional improvements have contributed to the transformation in the remittance impact towards a positive direction between two periods.
F39|Transferts de fonds des migrants et croissance économique : une analyse comparative entre le Cameroun et le Sénégal<BR>[Remittances and economic growth: a comparative analysis between Cameroon and Senegal]|The purpose of this research is to assess the effect of remittances on growth in Cameroon and Senegal, main beneficiaries respectively in CEMAC and UEMOA regions respectively. The role played by institutions in the mecanism is highlighted through property right protection. Results indicates that a 1% increase in remittances leads 0,41% to a marginal increase in the GDP per capita growth in Senegal compared to 0.08% increase in Cameroon. Moreover, taking into account the protection of property right, it appears that the impact of a 1% increase in remittances on per capita GDP growth rise to 0.85% for Senegal and 0.21% for Cameroon respectively. We then recommend to Cameroonian authorities to improve property right protection which create more incentives for productive investments of remittances.
F39|Examining Granger Causality in the Behavioral Reactions of Institutional Investors|Institutional investors have played significant role in the growth and development of capital markets. Developed countries? capital markets have a proven record of success in terms of transforming funds from surplus units to deficit units. Both domestic institutional investors (DII) and foreign institutional investors (FII) have been instrumental in establishing key functional areas of stock markets and enhancing efficiency in the operations of such markets mechanisms. Domestic institutional investors try to facilitate funds availability in the core sectors of the economy; foreign institutional investors, on the other hand, provide funds to generate economic benefits from large scale projects like infrastructure. Both investor classes use stock markets to channel their funds for investment purposes and maximize their wealth.Developed countries have seen institutional investors contributing significantly since 1960s but developing countries have been bit late mainly because of capital controls and other restrictive regulatory conditions. Foreign institutional investors have become active player in the developing countries from 1990 onwards when there was economic integration and financial liberalization process taking place especially in the developing part of the world. This has led the global institutional investors put approximately US$63 trillion worth of assets under management by 2011. Developing and emerging markets have also attracted vital share of the assets through institutional investing. Global investors found India as an attractive destination for investments and their net investments in Indian equities and debt amounted to US$ 7.46 billion in 2016-17. Cumulatively, it makes up around US$ 183.69 billion up to 2016. A recent report by Ernst & Young suggests that India is rated 3rd in the most attractive investment destinations in the world. But the growing activities of institutional investors have also raised some concerns about the behavioral reactions of the investors and their implications on the fundamental value of the stocks. This paper is an attempt to examine those behavioral reactions of both institutional investors ? foreign and domestic. The study aims to apply granger causality on the institutional investments through vector autoregressive (VAR) model in order to find out relationship between foreign and domestic institutional investors trading strategies. It would also be interesting to see if foreign institutional investment strategy influences domestic institutional strategy or vice-versa.
F39|Cooperation with bank as a competitiveness factor for the export-oriented company|The present paper concerns the evaluation of the relationship between SMEs conducting export business and the banks that support them. The evaluation will assess the share of banks in financing these companies, the reason for establishing a relationship, the intensity of the relationship and dependence of companies on the main partner bank. The analysis is based on research of Polish exporting businesses and was carried out by using standard EFIGE questionnaires.
F39|Invoice Currency in Brazil|The article describes the invoice currency choice in the Brazilian foreign trade, focusing on the use of the Brazilian real (BRL). The Ministry of Foreign Trade (MDIC) database is used for the first time for this purpose. Even with the US dollar being far more used in Brazil than in other countries, the BRL use for denominating trade has had exceptional growth. We categorically move away from the idea that the BRL is not used in Brazilian international trade. Brazilian imports show a strong tendency toward being more invoiced in noninternational currencies than exports. Brazilian trade evidence does not confirm some previous international findings. Although they are homogenous products, sugar and tobacco are the two main exports denominated in BRL. BRL use as invoice currency and as payment currency does not match.
F39|Regulatory Reforms and the Dollar Funding of Global Banks: Evidence from the Impact of Monetary Policy Divergence|Deviations from the covered interest rate parity (CIP), the premium paid to the U.S. dollar (USD) supplier in the foreign exchange swap market, have long attracted the attention of policy makers, since they often accompany a banking crisis. In this paper, we document the emergence of the new drivers of CIP deviations taking the place of banks f creditworthiness and assess their roles. We first provide theoretical evidence to show that monetary policy divergence between the Federal Reserve and other central banks widens CIP deviations, and that regulatory reforms such as stricter leverage ratios raise the sensitivity of CIP deviations to monetary policy divergence by increasing the marginal cost of global banks f USD funding. We then empirically examine whether the data accords with our theory, and find that monetary policy divergence has recently emerged as an important driver that boosts CIP deviation. We also show that regulatory reforms have brought about dual impacts on the global financial system. By increasing the sensitivity of CIP deviations to various shocks, the stricter financial regulations have limited banks f excessive gsearch for yield h activities resulting from monetary policy divergence, and have thereby contributed to financial stability. However, the impact of severely adverse shocks in the asset management sector is amplified by the stricter financial regulations and is transmitted to the FX swap market and beyond, inducing non-U.S. banks to further cut back on their USD-denominated lending.
F39|Foreign bias in Australian-domiciled mutual fund holdings|The paper employs International Capital Asset Pricing (ICAPM), Mean-variance, Global minimum variance, Bayes–Stein, Bayesian and Multi-prior models to develop foreign equity bias measures for 1414 Australian domiciled mutual funds, which invest in 41 countries worldwide. The Bayesian foreign equity measures, which take into account various degrees of mistrust in ICAPM, suggest that Australian domiciled mutual funds prefer investing in US, UK, Japan, France and Germany. The plausible sources of foreign equity bias are found to be GDP per capita, GDP growth rate, exchange rate volatility, tax, stock market development, familiarity, institution and stock characteristic variables.
F39|Modelling the joint dynamics of oil prices and investor fear gauge|This paper investigates the interdependent relationship between WTI returns and the newly published crude oil volatility index (OVX), combining a cross-correlation function approach, a time-varying parameter (TVP) GARCH model, and a multivariate regression analysis, by which the direction, dynamics, magnitude and asymmetry of their relationship are modelled. At the same time, the implied volatility indexes in the stock market and the gold market are considered for comparison. It is found that there is a significant unidirectional causality-in-mean from WTI returns to the OVX changes, while causality-in-variance from the OVX changes to WTI returns is also significant. The contemporaneous relationship between the OVX changes and WTI returns is significantly negative, and their asymmetric relationship implies that OVX has played a greater role as a gauge of investor fear than as risk preference. The time-varying results indicate that the relationship between the changes in OVX and WTI returns is not always negative.
F39|The “four I's” of the international monetary system and the international role of the euro|This article highlights the main sources of negative externalities in the current international monetary system, through a “four I's” approach (instability, incertitude, inequity and insufficiency of the aggregate demand). It then questions the ability of the euro to contribute to a more balanced and sustainable international monetary regime. The euro cannot become a major international currency without long-term growth in the Eurozone, without the creation of a unified marketplace for public debt backed by the European Central Bank, and without shared desire to internationalize the euro, particularly as an invoicing currency for trade.
F39|"What Makes a Good ""Bad Bank""? The Irish, Spanish and German Experience"|"This paper examines the experience of three asset management companies (AMCs) or ""bad banks"" established in the euro area following the 2008 global financial crisis. Specifically, it studies NAMA, Sareb and FMS Wertmanagement (FMS). These AMCs were set up to purchase growing nonperforming loans on banks’ balance sheets with the aim of their eventual disposal. The study seeks to identify factors that support an AMC’s success. It also analyses the impact of the European regulatory framework, including the Eurostat rules, State-aid regulations and bank resolution rules, on the AMCs’ design. It also reflects on the way recent changes to EU bank resolution rules now limit the involvement of State aid in AMCs. The study finds that the type of assets transferred and the macroeconomic environment are crucially important for successful asset disposals. The paper also focuses on additional success factors, such as clean asset documentation, a solid valuation process, efficient asset servicing, a strong legal framework and skilled staff. Though challenges remain, the three AMCs have contributed to banking sector stabilisation as they have been undertaken alongside bank restructuring measures. The financial backing of the authorities, decisive in the cases analysed, has however come at a fiscal cost."
F39|Análisis Econométrico Autoregresivo del Tipo de Cambio Real Flexible en México 1999-2012|La explicación teórica del comportamiento del tipo de cambio real mexicano en el largo plazo por factores internos y externos, desde niveles de precios hasta los niveles monetarios en Estados Unidos, permite proponer un modelo autorregresivo monetario considerando el análisis de los shocks de cada factor y su efecto en el tiempo. Los resultados obtenidos explican las razones principales de las devaluaciones sobre el tipo de cambio real en los últimos doce años. / The theorical explanation about the behavior of the real Mexican exchange rate in the long term by internal and external factors, from prices levels to monetary levels in USA allows to propose a monetary and autoregressive model, considering the shocks analysis of each factor and its effects in the long term. The results obtained explain the main reasons about the devaluations on the Mexican currency in the last twelve years.
F39|Zero Lower Bound Monetary Policy’s Effect on Financial Asset’s Correlations|Abstract We investigate the hypothesis that zero lower bound monetary policy has an effect on the correlations of financial assets. Using an event-study approach, we evaluate the impact of the zero lower bound monetary policies of the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England, and the Federal Reserve on the bond and equity markets in Japan, the UK, the US, and the Eurozone. We evaluate the bond markets using the Japanese 10-year Sovereign bond (JGB), UK 10-year bond (Gilt), US 10-year Treasury note (T-note), and German 10-year bond (Bund). For the equity markets we use the Nikkei 225, FTSE 100, S&P 500, and Euro STOXX 600 as proxies for each regional market. We also include gold and silver as control commodities. Our analyses demonstrate significant changes not only in the evaluated assets’ correlations with each other, but also in their general behavior. This has major implications for investment portfolio construction and provides useful insight for financial service regulators and the central banks themselves in monitoring the fragility and stability of the financial system.
F39|Loans Provided By Chinese Government: Opportunities And Risks For The Republic Of Moldova|As external development partners have put on hold their financial support for Moldova, contracting loans from China sparks an increasing interest. Because debates on this topic take place with very little information available, in this article we have made a synthesis of official data disseminated by the Chinese authorities, estimations made by the OECD and other organizations, records from the archive of the National Bank of Moldova, documents from the state register of legal acts, as well as of data published by the press. The results show that, although loans provided by the Chinese government are not an alternative to the loans offered by the IMF and other traditional creditors for budget and balance of payments support, they have a range of peculiar advantages and can be a convenient means of financing projects in the area of energy, industry, and agriculture.
F39|Credit and Oil Consumption|Credit greases the wheels of oil consumption—it is prevalent in purchases of cars, trucks, and even the construction of factories. But the traditional view is that it affects oil consumption only through economic activity and the price of oil. I argue that credit is important in its own right. To make my case, I first show that an association between credit and oil consumption growth exists across countries and time. I then give a nod to the traditional view, and conclude by showing that changes in credit alter oil consumption—even after accounting for economic activity and oil prices.
F39|Trade credit insurance: theoretical background and some international practices|The paper provides analysis of conceptual background of the trade credit insurance in the world. We analyzed briefly the problems, arising in insurance markets due to asymmetric information, such as adverse selection and moral hazard problems. Also we discuss the main stages of development of trade credit insurance in countries worldwide. Using comparative and graphical analysis we provide a brief evaluation of the dynamics of claims and recoveries for both short-term and long and medium term trade credit insurance in the world. For this purpose we used data on claims paid and recoveries for the period of 2005-2015. We found that the claims related to the commercial risk for medium and long trade credits in recent years exceed the recoveries, while with the political risk the reverse trend holds.
F39|Trade, Trade Finance, and Global Liquidity in Asia; Markov-Switching FAVAR Approach|This paper analyzes why the global financial crisis in 2008 severely affected Asia's trade. Asia has been suffering from the falls in export demand from developed countries. However the abrupt trade declines in Asia are not fully explained by reactions to this as in previous experiences. The question is why the financial crisis in 2008 brought about the abrupt and deep collapse in world trade, while other world-wide recessions had more moderate effects on world trade. This paper shows that the dynamic relationship between trade and trade finance is one important factor in explaining this question. This paper also applies the Granger (causality) test to uncover different relationships in the developed and developing economies and show different results for different countries in Asia. We employ a Markov-Switching FAVAR (Factor Augmented VAR) to show that global liquidity shocks are important factors in explaining the huge and abrupt trade drops in Asia.
F39|Global Financial Crisis, Capital Inflows and Policy Trilemma: An Analysis of the Indian Experience|In the context of the global financial crisis, this article analyzes the behaviour of capital inflows in India during the period from 1993.2 to 2012.4. It also examines the question, how have the policy makers in India dealt with the â€˜policy trilemmaâ€™ in a regime of liberalized capital inflows? The study finds that the volatility of capital inflows increased after the global financial crisis. Further, due to the global financial crisis, there were substantial changes in the relative importance of the factors that explain capital inflows. Although the â€˜pull factorsâ€™ played major roles in both the periods, before and after the crisis, there were significant changes in their relative importance. In the first sub-period, real effective exchange rate and foreign exchange reserves played the most important roles in determining the capital inflows whereas in the second sub-period, it was only current account balance. While dealing with â€˜policy trilemmaâ€™, we observed that the monetary policy independence was maintained in the period before the crisis which was sacrificed in the later period.

F39|The Analysis Of Inter-Regional Trade And Investment Flows: The Aggregated Net Trade Level In The Spanish Provinces| This study examines the relationship between trade and potential determinants: GDP, FDI, unemployment rate in Spanish provinces while incorporting spatial dependence. This methodological paper contributes to the literature because it evaluates trade at a more disaggregated level and includes FDI to explain the trade pattern. The research concludes that: (1) Only considering GDP and unemployment rate; increase in economic growth or a decrease in unemployment rate could motivate trade in the province; likewise trade of the neighbors will increase the competition, which could decrease the province sales. (2) If FDI is included, FDI received by the neighbor provinces could decrease the exports of the province because it makes its rivals more productive and competitive.
F39|Invoice currency: Puzzling evidence and new questions from Brazil|This article for the first time uses Brazilian trade data to draw conclusions about the invoice currency choice — both in general and as it pertains to the Brazilian real (BRL). We find that the Brazil-Argentina policy of providing payment orders associated to an exchange transaction between their currencies has had a significant impact on the currency chosen for invoicing, establishing a link between the availability of financial instruments and the invoice currency choice. Moreover, the evidence does not confirm some previous international results. We identify that in Brazil there is no coincidence regarding the use of BRL for invoicing and its use for making payments. Yet we find that the main exports denominated in BRL are homogenous goods — sugar and tobacco — suggesting that some bargaining power might remain even if goods are traded in international markets. From the BRL-specific perspective, we categorically move away from the idea that the BRL is not used in Brazilian international trade. Although it is used at a limited absolute volume, an exceptional ninefold growth between 2007 and 2011 is observed. New intriguing questions about Brazilian currency usage can therefore be proposed.Classification-JEL: A12; B12
F39|The Sustainability Of Serbia`S External Position: The Impact Of Fiscal Adjustment And External Shocks|This paper studies the impact of fiscal policy and external shocks on the sustainability of Serbia’s external position. The key determinants of Serbia`s current account balance are identified using model averaging techniques and are compared with estimates obtained for other small open economies (Poland, Georgia, Morocco, Ukraine, and Estonia). The paper uses estimated influences of macrovariables on the current account balance to generate a rich set of possible outcomes for the external position of the country. The results suggest the importance of fiscal policy for the reduction of external imbalances in all countries in our sample. In particular, credible and sustained fiscal adjustment can reduce current account deficit and stabilize Serbia’s external position close to its current level over the medium term. The analysis also warns that lack of success in fiscal consolidation coupled with external shocks may easily push the external position onto an unsustainable path.
F39|What Does Bitcoin Look Like?|The paper seeks to address what Bitcoin looks like. Specifically, we attempt to identify the main determinants of Bitcoin price by means of rigorous evaluation through ARDL Bounds Testing method. Our findings reveal the extremely speculative behavior of Bitcoin, its partial usefulness in trade trans- actions without overlooking its dependence to the Shangai stock market and the hash rate. There is no sign of Bitcoin being a safe haven. Taking a step further, we re-investigate the focal link by accounting for the Chinese trad- ing bankruptcy. The results appear fairly robust. Bitcoin is still perceived as speculative foolery and thus far from being a long-term promise.
F39|Corporate international diversification and risk|This study analyzes the effects of corporate international diversification (CID) on risk. Results document a mostly positive relation between CID, as measured by four different empirical proxy variables, and equity risk. I also find that diversification increases the volatility of cash flows and earnings. There is no empirical support of a reduction in correlations between firm-level and domestic market-level cash flows of internationally diversified firms. Finally, this study shows that the risk-increasing effects of CID are stronger for firms that are in more advanced stages of the internationalization process. The latter finding would be consistent with firms expanding to more risky countries in their latter stages of CID.
F39|The U.S. housing price bubble: Bernanke versus Taylor|This paper examines the effects of two major macro-economic forces argued by opposing renowned U.S. economists to have contributed most significantly to the U.S. housing price bubble that preceded the recent global financial crisis. The first force examined, as argued by John Taylor, is the Federal Reserve's loose monetary policy stance from 2002 to 2005. The second force examined, as argued by Ben Bernanke, is the substantial global inflow of capital to the U.S. over the same time period. We develop and estimate a reduced form model for U.S. housing prices, and find evidence consistent with both factors’ contributing significantly to the recent macro-housing price behavior in the U.S.
F39|When firms talk, do investors listen? The role of trust in stock market reactions to corporate earnings announcements|We examine whether the level of trust in a country affects investors' perception and utilization of information transmitted by firms through financial disclosure. Specifically, we investigate the effect of societal trust on investor reactions to corporate earnings announcements. We test two competing hypotheses. On the one hand, corporate earnings announcements are perceived as more credible by investors in more trusting societies and, therefore, elicit stronger investor reactions. On the other hand, societal trust mitigates outside investors' concern of moral hazard and reduces the value of corporate earnings announcements to them, thereby weakening their reactions to these events. We analyze the abnormal trading volume and abnormal stock return variance during the earnings announcement period in a large sample of firm-year observations across 25 countries, and we find that both measures of investor reactions to earnings announcements are significantly higher in more trusting countries. We also find that the positive effect of societal trust on investor reactions to earnings news is more pronounced when a country's investor protection and disclosure requirements are weaker, suggesting that trust acts as a substitute for formal institutions; when a country's average education level is lower, consistent with less educated people relying more on trust in making economic decisions; and when firm-level information asymmetry is higher, supporting the notion that trust plays a more important role in poorer information environments.
F39|Culture, agency costs, and governance: International evidence on capital structure|We examine social characteristics (individualism and risk aversion) and their interaction with firm governance and capital structure across the G20 countries from 1995 to 2009 using roughly 13,000 firms. We show that higher levels of individualism are associated with increased firm use of debt and lower cost of capital, whereas higher risk aversion has the opposite effects. Better firm-level governance substantially reduces these cultural effects, as does larger firm size, and less research-intensity at the firm. The results show that capital structure in emerging markets is considerably less affected by national culture relative to developed countries. To address endogeneity concerns, we show our results hold after using a propensity score matching procedure.
F39|Challenges Facing Bank in Financing International Trade: From an Islamic Perspective|Risk has always existed in business and it is even predominant when business transactions are done across borders. With the intensification of industrialization, it has resulted in risks that are unknown before. In the competitive business environment today, for business firms to compete, they must not only be able to minimize their risks in doing business, but also be able to take advantage of the growth opportunities presented by doing business in other countries. Hence understanding what risk is and what the perception of business firm towards risk is very important to any bank especially Islamic bank. This study investigates the risks that Islamic banks face in particular when dealing with the Islamic bank mode of financing. There are some inherent risks involved when Islamic bank uses the Islamic principle of financing. Managing risk management is a complex discipline even in a very simple commercial transaction. Nevertheless, risk is a core element of business (particularly international business) which is closely related to return. Financing international trade inevitably is complex and involves risks, irrespective of the markets in which business firms chose to conduct their business transactions. Hence, it is pertinent that an analysis on issues of risk management in the Islamic Financial system is undertaken as well. A Shariaâ€™ compliant risk management is analysed and some alternatives to risk management is proposed for Islamic banks in mitigating their risks in financing international trade.
F39|Illicit Financial Flows: concepts and first macro estimates for Belgium and its 18 preferred partner countries|There is a growing awareness that illicit financial flows and the shadow economy might have a substantial impact on the financing of development. This paper provides a disentanglement of the definitions, sources and causes and measurement methodologies used and a first quantitative estimate for the 18 partner countries for development of Belgium. An overview of methodologies for defining the shadow economy, the informal economy, illicit financial flows and capital export has been provided, and based on those secondary sources a first macro estimate of their size has been provided for the 18 preferred partner countries for Belgian governmental development cooperation, together with some core macro-economic indicators. As a benchmark similar information is provided for the ‘Low Countries’ or Benelux. All those studies on the underground economy are in search of a ‘dark figure’ that risks to become, as some scholars call it, ‘facts by repetition’. More than 2 trillion euro undeclared economy in the EU, 1 trillion euro missed tax revenue in the same EU, they became officially quoted figures but they go back to the same, sometimes criticised source of information. Almost 1 trillion USD illicit financial flows worldwide is a similar fact that is cited over and over again. But it remains the best practical starting point to look for further evidence or understanding of those phenomena in the 18 partner countries. 46 billion USD illicit financial flows or 3.5% of their GDP are estimated for the 18 partner countries of Belgium (around 2012). 261 billion USD estimated underground economy or some 31.6% of GDP of those 18 countries (around 2007). Ten times more, as share of GDP. Both figures reveal the massive potential importance for financing of development.
F39|Identifying and addressing gaps in the UNFCCC reporting framework|There are many reasons why the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) reporting framework requests information from countries. These include understanding and tracking progress with individual or collective commitments or pledges, providing confidence and enhancing accountability in quantified information measured and reported, and providing background information on the scope and ambition of national climate responses. This paper highlights the gaps, inconsistencies and uncertainties in the current reporting framework, which was developed for both long-standing obligations and mitigation pledges for the period to 2020. The paper also identifies possible improvements in the UNFCCC reporting framework in the context of the post-2020 transparency framework and nationally determined contributions (NDCs) for the post-2020 period. Recenser et combler les lacunes du cadre de notification d'informations de la CCNUCC La Convention-cadre des Nations Unies sur les changements climatiques (CCNUCC), qui invite les pays à lui communiquer des informations, vise plusieurs objectifs : mieux cerner les progrès accomplis dans la mise en oeuvre des engagements individuels ou collectifs et en assurer le suivi ; accroître la confiance dans les informations chiffrées communiquées par les pays et renforcer la transparence ; et fournir des renseignements sur le champ d’application et le niveau d’ambition des mesures climatiques nationales. Ce document met en évidence les lacunes, incohérences et incertitudes de l’actuel cadre de notification qui a été élaboré pour rendre compte à la fois des obligations de longue date des pays et de leurs engagements d’atténuation jusqu’en 2020. Il identifie aussi les améliorations qui pourraient être apportées au système de notification de la CCNUCC en ce qui concerne le cadre de transparence et les contributions déterminées au niveau national pour la période de l’après-2020.
F39|The road towards the establishment of the European Banking Union|The rising delinquencies in the U.S. subprime mortgage market in 2006 and the succeeding collapse in housing prices had a considerably negative impact on the functioning of the European financial systems and the smooth operation of European economies. Indeed, in the Euro-area, what started as a financial crisis escalated to a twin crisis after being doubled by the eruption of a massive sovereign debt crisis in 2010. The lack of an established set of bank supervision and resolution strategies at the Euro-area level, the vicious circle between banks and European nation-states, the threats for the sustainability of the common currency, and the deterioration of the market conditions were the key factors which lately led to the acceleration of the steps towards the creation of a banking union in Europe. The principal aim of the European Banking Union is to shape the necessary legal and institutional framework and provide the authorities with powers and tools to deal with ailing banks in order to prevent the devastating effects that a future shock may have on the financial system, the real economy, and the society. This paper presents the formal reactions of the sovereigns and the European Central Bank to the twin crisis, and critically discusses the key problems and the inherent weaknesses which led to the establishment of a banking union for the Euro-area member states. The structure of the banking union, the various aspects of its operation, and its future prospects are also presented and discussed.
F39|Corporate Social Responsibility in the context of International Financial Institutions|The term Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is becoming more and more often spelled out in various contexts of the academic and corporate life. The concept of CSR is rather broad and the term CSR could be defined in various ways, as there has been no unified definition established so far. Yet the word ‘corporate’ in the term could indicate that CSR is exclusive matter of private companies. However, as demonstrated in this paper, the non-corporate institutions, in particular the International Financial Institutions (IFIs) are implementing CSR in their strategies as well. The paper provides an overview of different types of the CSR activities undertaken by the IFIs with the two main objectives; (i) to provide an insight into the CSR practices of the IFIs and (ii) to identify the main reasons why the IFIs are socially responsible and why are they promoting their social responsibility. As one of the conclusions of the paper, it is discovered that IFIs are by their CSR activities setting up an example and the best practices to be followed in this field, therefore they act as a responsible leader for both corporate and non-corporate organizations.
F39|The Future Stakes Of Islamic Sukuk (Islamic Bonds)|Islamic finance is considered as type model of ethic finance because of it is based on the single rule of sharing of profits and losses, and its assets came from the real economy. Therefore, transactions in securities and speculation in Islamic financial market are different from all the world's stock markets because those transactions are not based on uncertainty (gharar) like futures or options nor on the interest rate such as bonds but on consent on the price of the goods before any transaction, that should not be in sharia?s prohibited areas.Currently, Islamic finance receives government interest because it is one of the new sources of funding. Moreover, it has led them to review their laws and regulations relating to financial markets to adapt the tax system to capture part of financial flows from the oil economies (Gulf countries).The total of outstanding of Islamic finance in the world at the end of 2012 is estimated at 1.350 billion US dollars of which 94% is concentrated in 10 countries , and although some expectations of Islamic financial market based on Islamic assets (managed by the precepts of Sharia law) from the Islamic banks, insurance companies (takaful) and investment funds established in over 75 countries around the world, those outstanding could reach 4.5 trillion of US dollars in 2020, however, the weight of Islamic finance will remain small because it represents only 1% of the conventional financial markets.As a result, how can these Islamic financial products and structures can attract worldwide investors whatever the place of the transaction?Can we develop standards of comparisons of risk, profitability and indices of Murabaha (represents 60% of all Islamic financial activities), in addition to Mudaraba (speculation) and Musharaka (represent 20% of all Islamic financial activities)? And in the absence of these criteria are there elements for attraction or repulsion of investors in the Islamic financial market?From this angle, with what methodology can we use the classic methods used by researchers to understand the investment returns or profitability of Islamic portfolio?
F39|Tek Fiyat Kanunu ve Satın Alma Gücü Paritesi Hipotezine İlişkin Ampirik Bulgular: Bir Literatür Taraması|This paper aims to survey the literature on concepts of the Law of One Price (LOP) and the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) hypothesis and to present a detailed literature review of the empirical findings. In this paper, starting from the deviations from the LOP and the PPP as well as their main reasons, we briefly overview latest econometric and statistical techniques in general. We also examine the empirical literature on advanced economies in particular. This paper provides a comparative outlook to researchers, who are interested in related subjects in international economics and international finance.
F39|Does the Fisher hypothesis hold for the G7 countries? Evidence from ADL threshold cointegration test|The goal of this paper is to examine the validity of the Fisher hypothesis in G7 countries over the period 1990–2012 by using the Autoregressive distributed lag (ADL) test for threshold cointegration recently introduced in the literature by Li and Lee ( 2010 ). The major advantage of the ADL threshold test is that it enables us to investigate nonlinearity and cointegration simultaneously. The same order of integration of all variables is not necessary with this method of cointegration relationship testing.The findings obtained from this paper indicate that Fisher hypothesis is valid for Canada, Germany, Italy and Japan but is not valid for France, UK and USA.

F39|Virtual Currency, Tangible Return: Portfolio Diversification with Bitcoins|Bitcoin (BTC) is a major virtual currency. Using weekly data over the 2010-2013 period, we analyze a BTC investment from the standpoint of a US investor with a diversified portfolio including both traditional assets (worldwide stocks, bonds, hard currencies) and alternative investments (commodities, hedge funds, real estate). Over the period under consideration, BTC investment had highly distinctive features, including exceptionally high average return and volatility. Its correlation with other assets was remarkably low. Spanning tests confirm that BTC investment offers significant diversification benefits. We show that the inclusion of even a small proportion of BTCs may dramatically improve the risk-return trade-off of well-diversified portfolios. Results should however be taken with caution as the data may reflect early-stage behavior that may not last in the medium or long run.
F39|Climate finance in the Asia-Pacific region: trends and innovative approaches|Asia and the Pacific1 is one of the most disaster-prone regions and the possibility that climate change may exacerbate the frequency and severity of extreme weather events is a real threat to progress made towards achieving sustainable development. To secure sustainable development gains and build resilience in the region, there is an urgent need to undertake climate mitigation and adaptation action. Despite an estimated $391 billion in climate finance flows internationally in 2014, the gap between available climate finance and the financing required to limit global warming to two degrees Celsius and adapt to unavoidable impacts of climate change is growing. The present paper offers an overview of the climate finance landscape with a focus on the Asia-Pacific region, and of finance flows from international climate funds, multilateral development banks and subregional and national climate finance initiatives. The ultimate goal of the discussion is to provide policymakers in the region with an understanding of the state of climate finance and recommendations on approaches for mobilizing climate finance in the light of global efforts, regional trends and successful initiatives.
F39|2015 Global Conjuncture And Expectations|The year 2015 is bringing serious attention to the global economic model and some pertinent evolution which will lead to a repositioning of the economic powers, old and news. It is a sign that the old design of understanding the mighty locomotives of the further economic growth is changing and its perspectives should take care of the evolving in the new motivations which can add to the quality of future growth. We can thing about the change of the paradigm in the existing order and accept that economic thinking should adopt to the new realities.

The article also explores the future responsibilities of the prospective Single Resolution Authority regarding relations between the euro area and third-country resolution authorities.
F39|Estimating Illicit Flows of Capital via Trade Mispricing: A Forensic Analysis of Data on Switzerland - Working Paper 350|This paper assesses the role of Switzerland as the leading hub for global commodities trading, in terms of the patterns of prices received by original exporting countries and subsequently by Switzerland and other jurisdictions. We find support for the hypotheses that (i) the average prices for commodity exports from developing countries to Switzerland are lower than those to other jurisdictions; and that (ii) Switzerland declares higher (re-)export prices for those commodities than do other jurisdictions. This pattern implies a potential capital loss for commodity exporting developing countries and we provide a range of estimates of that loss – each of which suggests the scale is substantial (the most conservative is around $8 billion a year) and that the issue merits greater research and policy attention. An important first step would be a Swiss commitment to meet international norms of trade transparency.
F39|From Beijing to Bentonville: Do multinational retailers link markets?|Four of the world's five largest retailers—Walmart, Carrefour, Tesco, and Metro—entered China after 1995, following new policies that allowed foreign retailers to participate more fully in the Chinese retail market. As each retailer added both stores and global procurement centers, they created unique footprints that caused Chinese cities to be differentially exposed to the activities of these global retailers. We exploit these differences to identify the effect of multinational retailer presence on city–country exports of retail goods. We find robust evidence that increased exposure to multinational retailers was followed by rising exports. Since the export expansions are not limited to the connections formed by the retailers' bilateral networks, our evidence suggests that the growing presence of global retailers operated, at least in part, by enhancing the general export capabilities of the affected cities.
F39|A unified framework for analysing price interdependence, innovative activity and exchange rate pass-through|This paper develops an international oligopoly model in which domestic and foreign firms simultaneously choose their price and innovation strategies under the assumption of non-zero conjectural variations in relation to their competitors’ price changes. The model captures the links between the exchange rate, foreign and domestic firms’ prices and investment in process innovation and provides a unified framework for analysing exchange rate pass-through.

F39|The Effect of the Global Financial Crisis on Transition Economies|This research offers new insights into the effect of the Global Financial Crisis of 2007–2009 on the countries that used to be part of the Soviet bloc by focusing on a cross-regional comparison. Twenty-eight countries are grouped according to different criteria and the corresponding vulnerability of each group is compared. The research links the variability in the groups’ responses to the dependence on trade with the European Union, the degree of the transition and economic freedom, and the sectoral composition of GDP. The research finds that what is considered to be an advantage for a transition economy during “normal” times -- high degree of economic freedom and trade liberalization, financial system sophistication, and a well-developed service sector -- became a disadvantage during the crisis.

F39|An Application of Hedonic Regression to Evaluate Prices of Polish Paintings|As the global financial crisis hit the world-wide stock markets, investors looked for alternative investments to diversify their portfolios. One of the more attractive alternate investment opportunities has been investment in art. However, in order to consider artworks as investment assets, the performance of the artworks must be evaluated in order to compare it to other financial instruments. Therefore, hedonic art price indexes are constructed for different art markets. The art market in Poland is characterized by a limited scale since it has only been developing since 1989. The aim of our research is evaluation of the hedonic art price indexes for Polish paintings. Hedonic regression models are estimated using data from auctions of paintings that took place in Poland in the years 2007–2010. Copyright The Author(s) 2014

F39|The Bitcoin Question: Currency versus Trust-less Transfer Technology|The financial crisis has led to a widespread loss of trust in financial intermediaries of all kinds, perhaps helping to open the way towards the general acceptance of alternative technologies. This paper briefly summarises the crypto-currency phenomenon, separating the ‘currency’ issues from the potential technology benefits. With respect to crypto currencies, the paper argues that these can’t undermine the ability of central banks to conduct monetary policy. They do, however, raise consumer protection and bank secrecy issues. The valuation of Bitcoins and price volatility issues are discussed, as well as electronic theft, contract failures, etc., all of which could result in large losses to users and hence ultimate costs to the taxpayer (e.g. the failure to provide adequate private pensions resulting in increased reliance on public pensions). The anonymity features of the crypto-currencies also facilitate tax evasion and money laundering, both of which are major public policy concerns. The technology associated with crypto-currencies, on the other hand, could ultimately shift the entire basis of trust involved in any financial transaction. It is an innovation that creates the ability to carry out transactions without the need for a trusted third party; i.e. a move towards trust-less transactions. This mechanism could work to eliminate the role of many intermediaries, thereby reducing transactions costs by introducing much needed competition to incumbent firms. The generic issues that policy makers need to examine are summarised.
F39|Choques, instituciones laborales y desempleo en Colombia|Este artículo utiliza la metodología VAR-X estructural para explicar por qué creció el desempleo en Colombia desde niveles cercanos al 7% en 1995:I hasta 19% en el 2000:I, y por qué permaneció en niveles de dos dígitos durante la década siguiente. Se trató de una combinación infortunada de choques y de instituciones laborales mal diseñadas para enfrentarlos. La participación laboral se incrementó fuertemente desde comienzos de los años noventa por motivos demográficos y como respuesta a la crisis de 1998-2000; la demanda cayó abruptamente en esos mismos años, debido a la parada súbita de flujos de capital y a una política fiscal y monetaria procíclica; y la dinámica de laproductividad ha sido excesivamente lenta, principalmente en la década del 2000. Los costos no salariales y el salario mínimo real también han tenido un papel importante en la explicación del nivel y de la persistencia del desempleo.

F39|Financial Conditions Index: Early and Leading Indicator for Colombia|This paper is an attempt at constructing a simple and effective macroprudential tool for policymakers. By integrating the joint occurrences of the main financialmarkets in Colombia into a single Financial Conditions Index (FCI), we hope to synthesize the information embedded in them regarding possible future economicoutcomes. To do this, we use monthly data on 21 variables for the period comprised between July, 1991 - June, 2010 and apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) ontheir correlation matrix. On the one hand, we evaluate the predictive capacity of the FCI in forecasting GDP growth at different time horizons and find that it performs better as a leading indicator of real activity than other individual financial variables and an autoregressive model of GDP growth. Additionally, we are interested in testing the FCI´s long-term capability to correctly anticipate periods of distress in the economy, and find that the index could be used as an effective early-warning indicator. Hence, our FCI seems to represent a useful instrument for both financial stability and macroprudential supervision purposes.

F39|Overcoming the Forecasting Limitations of Forward-Looking Theory Based Models|Theory-consistent models have to be kept small to be tractable. If they are to forecast well, they have to condition on data that are unmodelled, noisy, patchy and about the future. Agents can also use these data to form their own expectations. In this paper we illustrate a scheme for jointly conditioning the forecasts and internal expectations of linearised forward-looking DSGE models on data through a Kalman Filter fixed-interval smoother. We also trial some diagnostics of this approach, in particulardecompositions that reveal when a forecast conditioned on one set of variables implies estimates of other variables which are inconsistent with economic priors.
F39|Confronting divergent interests in cross-country regulatory arrangements|This article was prepared by Professor Kane for a public lecture while he was the Professorial Fellow of Monetary and Financial Economics at Victoria University in 2005. Prudential regulation seeks to assure the safety and soundness of the financial sector. The article considers the regulation of banks operating in both Australia and New Zealand. It discusses differences in the regulatory cultures of the two countries, and identifies preconditions for arriving at a fair and harmonised system of regulation. A harmonised regulatory regime is one that maximises the welfare of the citizens across countries, rather than simply blending together two national regulatory regimes. The article stresses the importance of proper processes for the resolution of incentive conflicts between countries that may arise in regulation and crisis situations.
