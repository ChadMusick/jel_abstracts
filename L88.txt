L88|South Asia: Formulating Services Sector Policies for Development, A Policy Perspective|This paper analyses the current development in trade in services in South Asia. South Asia’s language heritage, strong traditions of higher education, computer savvy diaspora and embrace of modern telecom infrastructure, have all contributed to services being a large part of the region’s GDP, with an increasing contribution to their export baskets. Countries in South Asia have formulated aggressive policies to promote the development of trade in services, with a focus on Information Technology and Communication, Professional services, Tourism and Travel, and Healthcare services. It was found that each country in the region has targeted specific niche markets to develop and to increase global exports and outreach. While some countries have formulated ‘Vision Documents” for their economy, others have devised specialized programs for “Priority Sectors”. This study divides the general policy themes under specific categories: (i) Skill development programs, (ii) nation-wide connectivity and digitization plans, (iii) initiatives to boost technology and entrepreneurship, with a focus on start-ups and intellectual property rights (IPRs), (iv) and export and brand promotion policies. This paper then highlights the best practices in the region and provides recommendations to develop a more competitive services sector. This research was undertaken to obtain an in-depth analysis of current policy making to promote the development of services for domestic and trade purposes, as well as assessing the impact of these policy tools. Such findings were primarily based on desk-based research from publicly available information sources combined with discussions with key stakeholders as well as an informed interpretation of the findings.
L88|“Post-Truth” Schooling and Marketized Education: Explaining the Decline in Sweden’s School Quality|The Swedish school system suffers from profound problems with teacher recruitment and retention, knowledge decline, and grade inflation. Absenteeism is high, and psychiatric disorders have risen sharply among Swedish pupils in the last ten years. In this pioneering analysis of the consequences of combining institutionalized social constructivism with extensive marketization of education, we suggest that these problems regarding school quality are to no small extent a result of the Swedish school system’s unlikely combination of a postmodern view of truth and knowledge, the ensuing pedagogy of child-centered discovery, and market principles. Our study adds to the findings from previous attempts to study the effects of social-constructivist pedagogy in nonmarket contexts and yields the implication that caution is necessary for countries, notably the U.S., that have a tradition of social-constructivist practices in their education systems and are considering implementing or expanding market-based school reforms.
L88|Do rural incentives payments affect entries and exits of general practitioners?|Many countries use financial incentive programs to attract physicians to work in rural areas. This paper examines the effectiveness of a policy reform in Australia that made some locations newly eligible for financial incentives and increased incentives for locations already eligible. The analysis uses panel data (2008–2014) on all Australian general practitioners (GPs) aggregated to small areas. We use a difference-in-differences approach to examine if the policy change affected GP entry or exit to the 755 newly eligible locations and the 787 always eligible locations relative to 2249 locations which were never eligible. The policy change increased the entry of newly-qualified GPs to newly eligible locations but had no effect on the entry and exit of other GPs. Our results suggest that location incentives should be targeted at newly qualified GPs.
L88|The Effect of Risk Assessment Scores on Judicial Behavior and Defendant Outcomes|The use of risk assessment scores as a means of decreasing pretrial detention for low-risk, primarily poor defendants is increasing rapidly across the United States. Despite this, there is little evidence on how risk assessment scores alter criminal outcomes. Using administrative data from a large county in Texas, we estimate the effect of a risk assessment score policy on judge bond decisions, defendant pretrial detention, and pretrial recidivism. We identify effects by exploiting a large, sudden policy change using a regression discontinuity design. This approach effectively compares defendants booked just before and after the policy change. Results show that adopting a risk assessment score leads to increased release on non-financial bond and decreased pretrial detention. These results appear to be driven by poor defendants. We also find risk assessment scores did not increase violent pretrial recidivism, however there is some suggestive evidence of small increases in non-violent pretrial recidivism.
L88|Building a stronger and more integrated Europe|Europe’s economy is finally growing robustly. These positive developments provide an opportunity to renew efforts to meet the long-term challenges facing the European Union (EU). The EU’s record on reducing regional income disparities is mixed and this explains some of citizens’ discontent with the European project. Reforming cohesion policy by focusing spending more on items with long-term growth benefits and clear spillovers across borders, including human capital and infrastructure investment could further support income convergence. Higher co-funding rates and less burdensome administration of the cohesion and structural funds could encourage greater spending effectiveness. Sustained improvements in living standards are held back by weak productivity and investment in many countries. Reviving the single market project, by removing remaining barriers in services, energy, digital and transport can help to spur long-term growth. Deepening the single market and faster adoption of digital technologies will create new jobs but put at risk others, perhaps in lagging regions. The EU can help lagging regions catch up by reforming cohesion policy and facilitating firm creation through the removal of barriers across the single market. It can also support better those who lose out from globalisation and are displaced by technological change by making access to the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund easier and broadening its scope not only to help workers displaced by globalisation or an economic crisis, but also due to other reasons such as automation. This Working Paper relates to the 2018 OECD Economic Survey of the European Union. (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-european-union-and-euro-area.htm)
L88|Explaining Differences In Efficiency: A Meta‐Study On Local Government Literature|This paper reviews the literature on local government efficiency by meta‐reviewing 360 observations retrieved from 54 papers published from 1993 to 2016. The meta‐regression is based on a random‐effects model estimated with the two‐step random‐effects maximum likelihood (REML) technique proposed by Gallet and Doucouliagos. Results indicate that the study design matters when estimating a frontier in local government. We find that studies focusing on technical efficiency provide higher efficiency scores than works evaluating cost efficiency. The same applies when using panel data instead of cross‐section data. Interestingly, studies that use the Free Disposal Hull (FDH) approach yield, on average, higher efficiency scores than papers employing the data envelopment analysis (DEA) method, thereby suggesting that in this literature the convexity hypothesis of the production set is a matter. Finally, the efficiency of local government increases with the level of development of the analysed countries and is positively related to the national integrity of the legal system. The opposite holds when considering the corruption.
L88|Does purchase centralization reduce public expenditure? Evidence from the Italian healthcare system|The introduction of Central Purchasing Bodies within the regional health care systems in Italy during the first decade of 2000s constituted a call for cost reduction and public expenditure restraint in the public health sector. Indeed, regional CPBs operating for local hospitals were introduced to centralize purchases of goods and services, with the aim of reducing prices and facilitate cost reductions, mainly leveraging on economies of scale and larger bargaining power. In this work, we examine this hypothesis adopting a difference-in-difference model to test the causal relationship of the introduction of regional CPBs operating in the health-care systems. Our findings show that per capita total expenditure is reduced to a range of 3-4%, according to the specification of the model, where local hospitals are supplied through a regional CPB. Specifically, this reduction is mainly driven by a subset of supplies, that is health services (e.g., medical and other health-related professional consultancies), while the impact on goods and other non-health services expenditure is not significant. Moreover, the obtained expenditure reduction is achieved without a significant downsizing of local services to citizens.
L88|Regional development in the context of economic reform: The case of Limassol|Regional development occurs in the larger context of national economies. Thus, the elaboration of regional economic development strategies cannot be separated from higher-level economic policy which frames and conditions opportunities and risks for regional development. As a Southern European country undergoing a process of profound structural economic reform, Cyprus provides a case for a policy context aiming towards the emergence of a new model of economic growth. Within this context, the Limassol region as one of the country’s major economic centers with a number of comparatively strong industries can serve as an example of how to promote regional development in the framework of national reform priorities such as moving the national economy closer towards a knowledge- and innovation-driven model. The present study analyses current reform priorities on the national and supra-national level, takes stock of the regional economic structure of Limassol district, and presents some preliminary ideas that could be further explored if and when a comprehensive regional economic development strategy for Limassol were to be elaborated.
L88|Triple Helix Model’s (THM) impact on enhancing creativity and skills within UAE public and private sectors|Organizations and businesses cannot depend completely on their own to generate new ideas for innovation and development in present knowledge based societies. Consequently, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) announced 2015 as the Year of Innovation and excellence awards have been established aiming to boost cooperation between various sectors in the country. Therefore, the concept of the Triple Helix (university–industry–government) was found as a model of innovation. The aim of this research is to establish the impact of a Triple Helix approach on enhancing creativity and skills within UAE public and private sectors. It explores the concept of the Triple Helix Model (THM) in the context of the UAE public and private sectors focusing on its existence, implementation, barriers and drivers. Methods of analysis include both qualitative and quantitative approach in which a conceptual framework was derived from the literature review, a survey was developed and distributed to a sample of employees from different organizations, and follow-up interviews were carried out with key stakeholders (in which their departments are implementing/ involved in the THM). The findings exposed the stakeholders’ perception about the importance of the concept and each actor’s role in the THM, the limited utilization of the concept among the organizations, and the challenges in terms of relational barriers and knowledge sharing. The research findings reveal that TH approach has a positive influence on enhancing creativity and skills within UAE sectors and several recommendations have been proposed such as leadership involvement and support, designing organizational innovation strategy, and the addition of society helix.
L88|The 4th Industrial Revolution and R&D Policy|In this 4th Industrial Revolution, we are facing a range of new technologies that combine the physical, digital and biological worlds. These new technologies will impact all disciplines, economics and industries, and even challenge our ideas about what it means to be human. These technologies have great potential to continue to connect billions more people to the web, drastically improve the efficiency of business and organizations and help regenerate the natural environment through better asset management, potentially even undoing all the damage previous industrial revolution have caused. (Bernard Marr, 2016). And, More than 70% of South Koreans fear that the advent of the 4th industrial revolution will threaten their jobs. In this paper I studied about 4th Industrial Revolution. Especially I surveyed about between Industrial Revolution and R&D policy of Science & Technology.
L88|An analysis of the structure, actors and interrelationships producing Luxembourg's ICT ecosystem|There is substantial analytical value in examining the structure of the ICT sector by deploying the notion of ecosystems, which can help to reveal new insights into the role of key actors and their interrelationships. This paper aims to provide a thorough analysis of Luxembourg's ICT ecosystem, which until now has received limited research attention in the international arena. Key actors comprising and producing the ecosystem are identified and analysed according to a layered model devised by Martin Fransman (2001). The primary output is a detailed mapping of the Luxembourgish ICT ecosystem. The findings indicate that Luxembourg's ICT ecosystem consists of nearly 2000 different actors of which the majority are micro and small software development companies. Nevertheless, some large telecommunications network operators in which the government holds a substantial stake appear to perform a decisive role from an economic perspective. More recently, the role of different types of service providers, particularly subcontractors to financial actors, has grew in prominence, with trends suggesting that this is subject to continue. The research has also identified some limitations to the Fransman model and suggests several extensions as well as a stakeholder analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the issues at stake. It is intended to be of use and interest to policymakers, managers, and decision makers or actors operating within and across different layers of ICT ecosystems.
L88|Effects of Deregulation and Consolidation of the Broadcast Television Industry|This paper exploits deregulation in the 1990s to estimate viewership and revenue effects of consolidation in broadcast television, then finds cost effects that explain the ownership structure given viewership and revenue effects. Results suggest that consolidation greatly increased profitability in an industry with otherwise declining profitability. Groups with broader national coverage attract more advertising per station. Joint ownership of two stations within a market and network ownership both allow for significant cost savings. There is some evidence that within-market consolidation allows stations to achieve local market power. However, both within-market and across-market consolidation appear to have boosted viewership, on net.
L88|Net Neutrality: A Fast Lane to Understanding the Trade-Offs|"The last decade has seen a strident public debate about the principle of ""net neutrality."" The economic literature has focused on two definitions of net neutrality. The most basic definition of net neutrality is to prohibit payments from content providers to internet service providers; this situation we refer to as a one-sided pricing model, in contrast with a two-sided pricing model in which such payments are permitted. Net neutrality may also be defined as prohibiting prioritization of traffic, with or without compensation. The research program then is to explore how a net neutrality rule would alter the distribution of rents and the efficiency of outcomes. After describing the features of the modern internet and introducing the key players, (internet service providers, content providers, and customers), we summarize insights from some models of the treatment of internet traffic, framing issues in terms of the positive economic factors at work. Our survey provides little support for the bold and simplistic claims of the most vociferous supporters and detractors of net neutrality. The economic consequences of such policies depend crucially on the precise policy choice and how it is implemented. The consequences further depend on how long-run economic trade-offs play out; for some of them, there is relevant experience in other industries to draw upon, but for others there is no experience and no consensus forecast."
L88|An Evaluation of the Policies on Repayment of Government’s Trade Debt in Italy|Abstract Since 2012 the Italian Government made several steps to repay its commercial debts. By using a composite dataset, we evaluate the effect of these policies on the financial performances of a representative sample of Italian firms. We distinguish between firms beneficiaries of these repayments, those that were not repaid, although they had a legitimate right, and those that did not have commercial relations with the General Government. We find that receiving money had a significant positive impact on firms’ financial position.
L88|Effects Of The Sunday Shopping Restriction In Korea|" type=""main"" xml:id=""coep12127-abs-0001""> We examine the effectiveness of Korea's Sunday superstore shopping regulation, whose purpose is to protect small- and medium-sized retailers as well as traditional markets. Applying a two-way random-effects regression model to the daily sales data of four megastores and four super supermarkets, we find the net sales decrease of superstores is on average 5.61% of daily sales after taking into account sales increases due to consumers' switching to weekdays. Only about 17%–19% of the reduced superstore sales are transferred to traditional markets. Based on these estimates, the compensating variation per year is predicted to be 2.4–2.5 trillion Korean won (around US $2.1–2.2 billion). (JEL L51, L88)"
L88|Researching song titles, product cycles and copyright in published music: problems, results and data sources|The purpose of this Working Paper is to pass on our experience of research on song titles and product cycles in UK music publishing which was intended to provide evidence of the impact of copyright in a market. The Working Paper relates to the article â€˜Economics of Music Publishing: Copyright and the Marketâ€™, published in the Journal of Cultural Economics, 2016. The context of the research was a project on copyright and business models in music publishing that was part of the AHRC funded project: the â€˜Economic Survival in a Long Established Creative Industry: Strategies, Business Models and Copyright in Music Publishingâ€™. By collecting data on the product cycles of a sample of long-lasting song titles and trying to establish changes in the product cycle as the copyright regime changed we had hoped to produce empirical evidence on the effect changes in the copyright regime, such as term extension, or to those in copyright management organisations. For a variety of reasons, this proved impossible to do (at least in the UK) and the Working Paper explains what we think were the reasons. It may also serve as a possible warning to others attempting the same thing. The paper also suggests that previous research that did not consider the ambiguities of â€˜a song titleâ€™ may be flawed.
L88|Design of Biogas Production using Wastewater from Industrial Plants: Financial Analysis of Various Feed-in-tariff Remunerations in Thailand|In this study, we provide a sample conceptual design and explanation of existing biogas plants that can be attached to various kinds of plants that release wastewater with suitable amounts of chemical oxygen demand. Financial information was collected and analysed in terms of investment costs, operational costs and historical data of electricity generation from biogas. The results show that in order to promote biogas business in Thailand, the government should provide feed-in-tariff (FiT) remuneration of 5 baht/KWh when contract capacity is 0.02-2 MW. When contract capacity is increased to >2 MW, but 4 MW, the government need not provide any FiT remuneration
L88|Dal controllo ex ante al controllo ex post: la rivoluzione della modernizzazione degli aiuti di Stato|Shifting control from ex ante to ex post: the revolution of state aid modernization. In 2012 European Commission started a comprehensive reform of state aid control. The core of the reform is Regulation n. 651/2014, which extends the exemption from notification obligation to a wide number of aid measures. This is not only a quantitative change but a qualitative one as well. Member states are called to verify the respect of the conditions for the exemption should comply with information obligations and in some cases must evaluate the effect of the aid measures adopted. This substantial shift from the traditional ex ante to ex post control should render easier for Member States to grant aids, which are assumed compatible with the internal market. Nevertheless, some fear the danger that an effective control will be weakened.
L88|A brief description of TiSA and the implications of the agreement|This article presents an overview of a new Agreement on Trade in Services, which is still under negotiation. Topics addressed in this paper are as follows: (a) Why is a new agreement on trade in services necessary? (B) What will be the architecture of the new agreement and how it differs from the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) of the WTO? (C) What topics are considered as possible problematic by states participating in the negotiations? The article points out that the necessity of the TiSA agreement has its roots in the failure to complete negotiations on services under the Doha Round, and adopting this plurilateral agreement would simplify business relationships among member countries and set a new global standard for trade in services.
L88|Selecting and Designing European ICT Innovation Policies|"This report analyses the peculiarities of innovation in Information and Communications Technologies (ICT), an ecosystem composed of various layers: from infrastructure to applications and content, and including end users. The report observes that innovation is becoming more open and collaborative in all layers, with various degrees of R&D intensity (greater at lower, physical layers); a prevalence of system goods with platforms and complementors mostly competing ""for"" rather than ""in"" the market; pervasive network effects coupled with relatively low entry barriers; short product life-cycles; and a high degree of co-evolution and co-dependency across and between layers. The nature of the ICT ecosystem determines a growing need for flexible, adaptive regulation, and the adoption of new policy instruments such as prizes and challenges. Policies should aim to create an environment favourable to the development of new, welfare-enhancing business models and avoid hindering the entrance of new players"
L88|The Role of Information Technology in Patient Satisfaction|Competition comes into prominence in health field as it is in all the fields in the world and in Turkey. The companies pursue the recently established information systems and market fit closely in order to increase the competitive power. Turkey is experiencing quite radical transformations in health-care sector during the last 10 years. In this sense, the objective of the study is to determine the usage level of Central Physician Appointment System (CPAS) within the scope of technology acceptance model. When the context of the model is examined, the degree of turning the positive perceptions such as benefits, convenience that the customers perceive from this technology when they came face to face with this technology, to attitudes and behaviors is measured. As a result of the research, the electronic appointment system, which has started to be applied within the health-care sector, was considered positively on the basis of benefits and convenience and in parallel with this the their attitudes behaviors were affected positively.
L88|Crowdsourcing City Government: Using Tournaments to Improve Inspection Accuracy|"The proliferation of big data makes it possible to better target city services like hygiene inspections, but city governments rarely have the in-house talent needed for developing prediction algorithms. Cities could hire consultants, but a cheaper alternative is to crowdsource competence by making data public and offering a reward for the best algorithm. A simple model suggests that open tournaments dominate consulting contracts when cities can tolerate risk and when there is enough labor with low opportunity costs. We also report on an inexpensive Boston-based restaurant tournament, which yielded algorithms that proved reasonably accurate when tested ""out-of-sample"" on hygiene inspections."
L88|Analyzing the Influence of Occupational Licensing Duration and Grandfathering on Labor Market Outcomes|The length of time from the implementation of an occupational licensing statute (i.e., licensing duration) may matter in influencing labor market outcomes. Adding to or raising the entry barriers are likely easier once an occupation is established and has gained influence in a political jurisdiction. States often enact grandfather clauses and ratchet up requirements that protect existing workers and increase entry costs to new entrants. We analyze the labor market influence of the duration of occupational licensing statutes for 13 major universally licensed occupations over a 75-year period. These occupations comprise the vast majority of workers in these regulated occupations in the United States. We provide among the first estimates of potential economic rents to grandfathering. We find that duration years of occupational licensure are positively associated with wages for continuing and grandfathered workers. The estimates show a positive relationship of duration with hours worked, but we find moderately negative results for participation in the labor market. The universally licensed occupations, however, exhibit heterogeneity in outcomes. Consequently, unlike some other labor market public policies, such as minimum wages or direct unemployment insurance benefits, occupational licensing would likely influence labor market outcomes when measured over a longer period of time.
L88|The impact of advertising length caps on TV: Evidence from the French broadcast TV industry| The quantities of advertising on TV are regulated in France, as in many other developed countries. This paper aims at understanding the welfare implication of such regulation. It is the first paper which investigates this issue with a structural econometric model in two-sided market framework. I construct an unique database of per hour data on 12 main broadcast TV stations in France during one year (2014) to estimate structurally the demand and supply in the French broadcast television industry. I identify the shadow prices of regulation caps on advertising quantities, using the difference in estimated marginal costs between the binding and non-binding regulation constraints. A counterfactual experiment is carried out to quantify the exact impact of regulation. The results suggest that the TV channels advertise more without regulation but the overall impact of the current regulatory regime is small. The welfare analysis suggests that the current regulation framework is unnecessary, since it constrained the profit of TV channels without improving significantly the welfare of TV viewers.
L88|Priorities for completing the European Union's Single Market|The EU Single Market remains far from completed: progress in goods and services market integration has stalled, financial markets are still fragmented along national lines and the barriers to labour mobility remain high. Restrictive regulation within countries and regulatory heterogeneity across them hamper the internal market, reducing trade and investment flows. Network sectors, such as energy and transportation, are insufficiently interconnected and open to competition, and inefficient as a result. Reinvigorating the single market is one of the key tools to strengthen the recovery of the European Union and restore faster growth of income per capita. To support the recovery, structural reforms that yield short-run as well as long-run gains should be prioritised. Policies enhancing labour and capital mobility are especially relevant, as they provide channels of adjustment to country-specific shocks and reinforce the effectiveness of stabilisation policies. Policies enhancing capital mobility include improved securitisation, better collection and sharing of credit information regarding smaller firms and the convergence of insolvency regimes. Labour mobility within the European Union would profit from reduced administrative and regulatory burden, such as faster recognition of professional qualifications and better portability of social and pension rights. Product markets reforms also have the potential to deliver benefits swiftly, not least by unlocking investment. Regulatory burdens could be alleviated by better impact assessment for legislative proposals and ex post evaluation of policies. Product market reforms in network sectors should include harmonisation of regulations and technical specifications, with the target of establishing single EU regulators. This Working Paper relates to the 2016 OECD Economic Survey of the European Union (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-european-union-and-euro-area.htm) Priorités pour l'achèvement du marché unique dans l'Union Européenne Le marché unique de l’UE est encore loin d’être achevé : les progrès en matière d’intégration des marchés de produits et services marquent le pas, les marchés financiers demeurent fragmentés par pays et les obstacles à la mobilité de la main-d’oeuvre restent nombreux. La réglementation restrictive dans les pays et l’hétérogénéité des réglementations entre eux entravent le marché intérieur, ce qui provoque une réduction des courants d’échanges et des flux d’investissement. Les industries de réseau, comme l’énergie et les transports par exemple, ne sont pas suffisamment interdépendantes et ouvertes à la concurrence, d’où leur inefficience. La redynamisation du marché unique est l’un des principaux outils pour consolider la reprise dans l'Union européenne et renouer avec une croissance plus rapide du revenu par habitant. Pour stimuler la reprise, les réformes structurelles qui sont à l’origine de progrès à court et long terme devraient avoir la priorité. Les mesures qui renforcent la mobilité de la main-d’oeuvre et des capitaux sont particulièrement importantes puisqu’elles offrent des solutions d’ajustement aux chocs propres à certains pays et améliorent l’efficacité des mesures de stabilisation. Les mesures qui renforcent la mobilité des capitaux englobent une titrisation réactivée, un recueil et un partage améliorés des données sur le crédit concernant les petites entreprises et la convergence des régimes de faillite. La mobilité de la main-d’oeuvre au sein de l’Union européenne aurait tout à gagner d’une réduction de la charge administrative et du poids de la réglementation, par exemple via une reconnaissance plus rapide des qualifications professionnelles et une meilleure transférabilité des prestations sociales et droits à pension. Les réformes des marchés de produits sont aussi susceptibles d’avoir des effets positifs rapides, notamment en facilitant l’investissement. Le poids de la réglementation pourrait être allégé grâce à une analyse d’impact de meilleure qualité pour les propositions législatives et à une évaluation ex post des mesures. Les réformes des marchés de produits dans les industries de réseau devraient inclure une harmonisation des réglementations et spécifications techniques dans le but de créer une autorité de régulation unique à l'échelle de l'UE.

L88|السياحة والنمو الاقتصادي في الجزائر : الأدلة من التكامل المشترك و تحليل السببية<BR>[Tourism and economic growth in Algeria: Evidence of Cointegration and causal analysis]|Tourism is increasingly being recognized as an essential component of economic growth in Algeria. This paper investigates the relationship between economic growth and tourism development in Algeria. The purpose of this research is to test empirically the long-term relationship between economic growth and tourism development for annual data collected between 1995 and 2014. The study uses a multi-variable model that includes gross domestic product and as a proxy of economic growth and a variable reflecting the tourism economy such as arrivals of international tourists, income from expatriate spending. Other relevant variables are added to estimate the econometric model.
L88|A Study of the Engineering Modeling & Simulation Industry in South Korea|Engineering modeling and simulation (M&S) technology is a smart manufacturing technology that replaces physical product manufacturing and test activities with virtual product manufacturing and verification. Engineering M&S is recognized as a core manufacturing technology that determines the manufacturing competitiveness of not only a company but also a country, because it reduces the time and cost of product development, while improving the quality of the product. Even though South Korea recognizes the industrial importance of engineering M&S technology and invests at the national level, supply and demand in the engineering M&S industry is still poor. The market size of engineering M&S in South Korea was 528 million-dollar in 2015, with sustained growth at a compound average growth rate (CAGR) of 11.3%, but this amounted to only 1/10 of the market in the U.S. and 1/3 of the market in the People's Republic of China. The biggest reason for such market-size inferiority appears to be the improper formation of the related ecosystem, due to underutilization of M&S by manufacturing companies and the small size of engineering M&S companies. According to a KISTI (Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information) survey by 2015, only 16 of the 401 engineering M&S companies in South Korea were domestic engineering SW development companies. Additionally, the utilization of engineering M&S SW by manufacturing companies is about 8.2%, with only 9% of those companies using domestic engineering SW. Because the inferiority of the engineering M&S industry could lead to the inferiority of national manufacturing competitiveness in the long term, the national interest mandates an increased investment in development of the engineering M&S industry.
L88|Standortindex DIGITAL: Nützlich zum Erkennen von Handlungserfordernissen im IKT-Sektor?<BR>[Location Index DIGITAL – Useful for Justifying Economic Policy Action Requirements in the ICT Sector?]|Zusammenfassung Beim letzten Nationalen IT-Gipfel der Bundesregierung am 18./19.11.2015 haben die Kanzlerin und der Wirtschaftsminister einhellig hervorgehoben, dass Deutschland hinsichtlich des Digitalisierungsgrades von Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft im internationalen Vergleich allenfalls mittelmäßig abschneiden würde und zudem gegenüber anderen Ländern jüngst auch noch zurückgefallen sei. Diese Urteile wurden mit Ergebnissen einer neuen Studie begründet, in der von einem Marktforschungsunternehmen im Auftrag des Bundeswirtschaftsministeriums ein „Standortindex DIGITAL“ konstruiert und ermittelt wurde. Wie aussagekräftig ist dieses Messinstrument? Der Autor hält diesen Index nicht für geeignet, um darauf wirtschaftspolitische Schlussfolgerungen zu gründen.
L88|Standortindex DIGITAL: Nützlich zum Erkennen von Handlungserfordernissen im IKT-Sektor?|Both the German Federal Chancellor and Minster of Economic Affairs unanimously emphasised at the last “national IT summit” on 18-19 November 2015 that the degree of digitisation in the German economy and society is mediocre when compared internationally, and that in the recent past Germany has even lost ground to other countries regarding the nation’s “ICT isation”. These assessments were justified by the results of a new study commissioned by the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs in which a market research firm construed a so called “location index DIGITAL”. The present article shows that the quality of this measurement instrument is poor. As a consequence, the tenability of the economic policy conclusions drawn from the index by high level government representatives is low. Copyright ZBW and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016
L88|Transparency in parliamentary voting|How does transparency affect voting behavior? To answer this question we exploit a switch from a show of hands to electronic voting in the Upper House of the Swiss Parliament. The change, which took place halfway through the 2011–2015 legislative period, also brought about the online publication of individual voting records. Using the Lower House as a control group, we compare individual voting decisions in a set of identical votes in both chambers. This unique framework makes it possible to estimate the causal effect of increased transparency on legislators' choices.
L88|Spanish Public Policies towards the Promotion of Cloud Computing and Digital Services for SMEs|The paper focuses on the first public programs in Spain to support the introduction of cloud computing services for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and micro-SMEs, and facilitating the digital transformation of SMEs, stimulating e-commerce and encouraging competitiveness. The paper analyses how the programs that the Spanish Government launched in 2015 transcend technology and impact over the digital ecosystem, with influences over supply and demand. The paper identifies the main drivers of SMEs providing cloud services and ICT solutions and other key elements that help to understand the eligible portfolio of cloud solutions and authorised providers that will contribute to the digital transformation of Spanish SMEs and micro-SMEs.
L88|Net Neutrality, Business Models, and Internet Interconnection|We analyze the effect of net neutrality regulation in a two-sided market framework when content is heterogeneous in its sensitivity to delivery quality. We characterize the equilibrium in a neutral network constrained to offer the same quality vis-à-vis a non neutral network where Internet service providers are allowed to engage in second degree price discrimination with a menu of quality-price pairs. We find that the merit of net neutrality regulation depends crucially on content providers' business models. More generally, our analysis can be considered a contribution to the literature on second-degree price discrimination in two-sided platform markets. (JEL D42, D43, D85, L51, L86, L88)
L88|Telecracy: Testing for Channels of Persuasion|We consider the long-lived slant towards Berlusconi in political information on Italian television (TV). We exploit a shock to the slanted exposure of viewers: idiosyncratic deadlines to switch to digital TV from 2008 to 2012, which increased the number of free view channels tenfold. The switch caused a drop in the vote share of Berlusconi's coalition by between 5.5 and 7.5 percentage points. The effect was stronger in towns with older and less educated voters. At least 20 percent of digital users changed their voting behavior after the introduction of digital TV. Our evidence is consistent with the existence of persuasion-biased viewers.

L88|The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act and Its Effects on American Indian Economic Development|The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA), passed by the US Congress in 1988, was a watershed in the history of policymaking directed toward reservation-resident American Indians. IGRA set the stage for tribal government-owned gaming facilities. It also shaped how this new industry would develop and how tribal governments would invest gaming revenues. Since then, Indian gaming has approached commercial, state-licensed gaming in total revenues. Gaming operations have had a far-reaching and transformative effect on American Indian reservations and their economies. Specifically, Indian gaming has allowed marked improvements in several important dimensions of reservation life. For the first time, some tribal governments have moved to fiscal independence. Native nations have invested gaming revenues in their economies and societies, often with dramatic effect.
L88|Net Neutrality, Vertical Integration, and Competition Between Content Providers|This paper investigates the effects of a net neutrality regulation on the competition between content providers and the investment incentives of the internet service provider. We consider a situation where the monopoly internet service provider is vertically integrated with one of the content providers, and content providers compete in prices. Without net neutrality the vertical integrated firm can prioritise the delivery of its own content. We find that, under prioritisation, the integrated internet service provider and consumers as a whole are unambiguously better off. The competing content providers might also be better off under prioritisation if the congestion intensity is high. From a social welfare perspective prioritisation is also desirable unless product differentiation and congestion intensity are low. Contrary to some claims by internet service providers, we find that investment incentives are not always higher under prioritisation.
L88|The Greek Tragedy in the Health Sector: Social and Health Implications|Greece went into recession in 2009, after a decade of flourishing economic growth fluctuating annually around 4 percent; over the same period the average growth for theEU-27 was just about 2 percent. The economic downturn had a series of adverse effects on the economy and the health sector. More specifically, over the 2008–2015 period, GDP was reduced by 29.5 percent, wages were reduced by 35–45 percent, private consumption dropped by 30 percent and health expenditure declined by 41 percent. At the same time income inequality (shares S80/S20) increased by 11 percent and the unemployment rate reached 27.1 percent (an increase of 276.4 percent). The share of population at risk of poverty increased from 27.6 percent in 2009 to 36 percent in 2014. While life expectancy stabilized at about 80 years, infant mortality increased from 2.7 in 2008 to 3.8 in 2010, with a subsequent marginal reduction. The Eurozone countries and the IMF provided three rescue packages to Greece. The first economic adjustment program was signed in May 2010 between Greece and Troika (the European Commission, The European Central and the IMF) was worth 110billion euro. The second adjustment program was signed in February 2012 and worth 130 billion euro, while the third one in June 2015 amounted to 86 billion euro. The terms of these bailouts included a series of required reforms, such as the liberalization of several protected economic and employment sectors, the reduction of public expenditures, the fight against corruption and the underground economy, the control of health expenditures, and the implementation of an austerity package. Consequently, the economic crisis has brought a significant deterioration to the health status and quality of life of the Greek Population. A set of quality of life instruments is used to assess the impact of the crisis on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The quality of life mean scores indicated a significant deterioration of subjective health by 10points. The VAS before the crisis was VAS(Before) = 86.06 (st.d. =15.14) and the corresponding value during the crisis was VAS(During) = 76.72 (st.d. = 20.51). The significant reduction in VAS was also associated with greater inequalities in the distribution of health. In addition low-income individuals declared losses of jobs, fears oflong unemployment, and a significant deterioration of their psychological and emotional status. The findings will help develop better targeted health policies that seek to improvement of the health of the Greek population.
L88|A dynamic analysis of entry regulations and productivity in retail trade|Quantifying possible inefficiencies stemming from regulation is important to both policymakers and researchers. We use a dynamic structural model to evaluate the role of local market entry regulations in the productivity of retail trade. Our model is flexible with respect to how local market regulations influence store productivity and controls for demand in local markets. We combine the structural approach with detailed data on all stores in the Swedish retail industry. The results show that more liberal entry regulations increase future productivity and that the increase in productivity is larger for small stores and small markets than for large stores and large markets.
L88|Faster payments in the United States: how can private sector systems achieve public policy goals?|Consumers and businesses are increasingly expecting faster payments. While many countries have already developed or are in process of developing faster payments, the availability of these payments is fragmented in the United States. The recently released paper by the Federal Reserve encourages private sector participants to provide faster payment services. However, private-sector faster payments systems will face significant challenges in achieving public policy goals of ubiquity, safety, and efficiency unless system governance represents broad public interests. One way to better align private-sector interests with those of the public is for the Federal Reserve to influence governance of the private-sector systems through its leadership role.
L88|“Strong versus Weak Vertical Integration: Contractual Choice and PPPs in the United States”|Public-Private-Partnerships are long-term, relational contracts between a public-sector sponsor and a private partner to deliver infrastructure projects across a range of economic sectors. Efficiency gains may derive from risk transfer and bundling different tasks within a single contract. We study the factors explaining the scope of bundling. We focus on the choice between weak vertical integration, which includes operational tasks alone or construction tasks alone, versus strong vertical integration, which involves the combination of operational and construction tasks. We utilize a new data set that includes 553 PPPs concluded in the U.S. between 1985 and 2013.
L88|The occupations of regulators influence occupational regulation: evidence from the US private security industry|Licensing requirements for US private security firms and guards differ substantially from state to state. State regulatory institutions for this industry also vary considerably. Some states have specialized regulatory boards with industry personnel (guards, firm owners) and/or public police as board members, while others rely on non-specialized regulators such as Departments of Commerce, State, Professional Regulation, or Consumer Affairs. These cross-state variations in licensing requirements and regulatory institutions provide an opportunity to explore relationships between the two. Private security regulation is of particular interest in this context because previous empirical research implies that allocating more resources to private security reduces crime, and that relatively stringent licensing requirements limit entry, thereby increasing crime. A panel of 1991–2010 state data is employed to see if particular regulatory institutions are associated with particular licensing requirements. Empirical results suggest that requirements for entry into this market tend to be relatively strict when active private security personnel are in control of licensing, and that different patterns of regulation generally apply when police or non-specialized agencies control licensing. Therefore, both public-interest and private-interest explanations for the observed relationships between the structure of regulatory institutions and resulting licensing requirements are discussed.

L88|State funeral regulations: inside the black box|This study estimates the effects of state regulations affecting funeral markets. It accounts for multiple major categories of regulations and demand inducement as well as direct price effects. While concurring with prior studies that find ready-to-embalm regulations increase funeral costs and decrease the percentage of cremations, this study finds that several other state regulations are associated with significantly higher receipts per death. The regulation with the largest apparent effect on average funeral costs is the direct disposition license, which is associated with a $1250 reduction in receipts per death. Restrictive regulations affect the revenues of funeral homes and services to a much greater extent than they affect the revenues of cemeteries and crematories, and in some cases the regulations even increase funeral homes and services’ share of industry revenues. Thus, it appears that funeral homes receive most of the benefits of regulation. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015
L88|A study product design of optimal solution for customer requirements|In this paper, the author uses an evaluative criteria model and their associated criteria status, product evaluative criteria software of results and product objective function of optimal values solution, along with product morphological analysis, to synthesize evaluative criteria and optimize product design values. This study focuses on how to use an evaluative criteria model’s imprecise market information by evaluative criteria design software; product mapping relationships between design parameters and customer requirements using product predicted value method; synthesizing design alternative by morphological analysis and plan; realizing the synthesis in multi criterion decision making (MCDM), using its searching software capacity to obtain the optimal solution.
L88|Customer Satisfaction Evaluation Using Multidimensional Item Response Theory Models|In this paper Multidimensional Item Response Theory models, developed in the fields of psychometrics and ability assessment, are discussed in connection with the problem of evaluating customer satisfaction. These models allow us to take into account latent constructs at various degrees of complexity and provide interesting new perspectives for services quality assessment. Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques are considered for estimation and the problem of missing data is faced. An application to a real dataset is also presented.
L88|Analyzing the Labor Market Outcomes of Occupational Licensing|Recent assessments of occupational licensing have shown varying effects of the institution on laborâ€ market outcomes. This study revisits the relationship between occupational licensing and laborâ€ market outcomes by analyzing a new topical module to the Survey of Income and Program Participation. Relative to previously available data, the topical module offers more detailed information on occupational licensing attainment, with larger sample sizes and access to richer sets of personâ€ level characteristics. We find that those with a license earn higher pay, are more likely to be employed, and have a higher probability of employerâ€ sponsored health insurance offers.
L88|Salience, Myopia, and Complex Dynamic Incentives: Evidence from Medicare Part D|The standard Medicare Part D drug insurance contract is nonlinear—with reduced subsidies in a coverage gap—resulting in a dynamic purchase problem. We consider enrollees who arrived near the gap early in the year and show that they should expect to enter the gap with high probability, implying that, under a benchmark model with neoclassical preferences, the gap should impact them very little. We find that these enrollees have flat spending in a period before the doughnut hole and a large spending drop in the gap, providing evidence against the benchmark model. We structurally estimate behavioral dynamic drug purchase models and find that a price salience model where enrollees do not incorporate future prices into their decision making at all fits the data best. For a nationally representative sample, full price salience would decrease enrollee spending by 31%. Entirely eliminating the gap would increase insurer spending 27%, compared to 7% for generic-drug-only gap coverage.
L88|Content aggregation by platforms: The case of the news media|"The digitization of content has led to the emergence of platforms that draw information from multiple sources. Policymakers are concerned that these new platforms threaten incentives for the production of original content. As a result, policymakers are contemplating regulations that would force aggregation platforms to pay or require an explicit ""opt-in"" for content providers. To understand the possible consequences and underlying rationale of such laws, we explore whether aggregation of content by a single platform encourages users to ""skim"" content or to investigate in depth. We study a contract dispute that led a major aggregator to remove information from a major content provider. We find that after the removal, users were less likely to investigate additional, related content in depth, particularly sources that were horizontally or vertically differentiated.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>"
L88|Raising the Potential of the Domestically Oriented Sector in Germany|Germany’s manufacturing sector, which plays an important role for exports, has been performing well over the past decade in terms of labour productivity growth and international competitiveness. However, the services sector has had much slower growth rates. Competition often appears to be hindered by protection of incumbents. Reforming and deregulating the domestically oriented sectors, including network industries, crafts and professional services would release hidden growth potential and prove beneficial to the economy as a whole. It could also help strengthen domestic demand and reduce dependence on exports. This Working Paper relates to the 2014 Economic Survey of Germany (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-germany.htm). Relever le potentiel des secteurs orientés sur le marché intérieur en Allemagne Au cours de la dernière décennie, le secteur manufacturier allemand, qui joue un rôle important dans les exportations, a enregistré de bons résultats, en termes de hausse de la productivité de la main-d’oeuvre comme de compétitivité internationale. Le secteur des services en revanche affiche des taux de croissance bien plus modestes. Il semble que la concurrence y ait souvent été entravée du fait de la protection des entreprises en place. Réformer et déréglementer les secteurs orientés sur le marché intérieur, notamment les industries de réseau, l’artisanat et les services professionnels, permettrait de libérer le potentiel de croissance caché et serait bénéfique pour l’économie dans son ensemble, et contribuerait en outre à renforcer la demande intérieure et à réduire la dépendance par rapport aux exportations. Ce document de travail se rapporte à l’Étude économique de l’OCDE de l’Allemagne, 2014 (www.oecd.org/fr/eco/etudes/etude-economique-allemagne.htm).
L88|Tapering payments in hospitals: Experiences in OECD countries|This study covers “tapering scale” mechanism in hospital payments, i.e. mechanisms linking unit prices to the volume of services produced. This paper begins with an overview of hospital services and hospital payment methods in OECD countries, focusing more specifically on DRG-based payment. It then reviews studies published on economies of scales in hospitals, which is the economic rationale justifying tapering payments. Thereafter, four case studies from Germany, the US State of Maryland, the Czech Republic and Israel offer a detailed insight into the practicalities of introducing this method of controlling hospital volumes and the impacts it has had. Ce rapport porte sur les politiques de dégressivité tarifaire appliquées au paiement des hôpitaux, c’est-à-dire les mécanismes liant les prix unitaires des services hospitaliers au volume de soins produits. Ce document de travail dresse tout d’abord un panorama de l’offre hospitalière et des modes de paiement des hôpitaux au sein des pays de l’OCDE en étudiant plus spécifiquement le paiement à l’activité. Il présente ensuite une revue des études portant sur les économies d’échelle dans le secteur hospitalier, justification principale de la diminution des tarifs au-delà d’un seuil de production. Enfin, quatre études de cas en Allemagne, l’État du Maryland, la République tchèque et Israël sont présentées afin d’étudier finement les modalités d’instauration et l’impact de ce mécanisme de contrôle des volumes hospitaliers.

Bollywood can be used as a paradigmatic showcase for the improvement of ideas in the development of industries of emerging economies. This paper, via an extensive review in several articles, describes Bollywood as an economic factor for Indian’s growth. The reasons that led to this growth are described in an extended way, as well as the role of globalization and Indian’s Diaspora on this development. Finally, it compares the two largest film industries in the world, Hollywood and Bollywood.
L88|Developing Myanmar’s Information and Communication Technology Sector toward Inclusive Growth|Myanmar’s recent socioeconomic and political reforms have signaled a readiness to reintegrate into the world economy. To leapfrog the economy and accelerate growth, the country should take advantage of digital technology. This paper assesses Myanmar’s information and communication technology sector, identifies constraints the sector faces, and recommends policies that will help the government overcome them. Given limited public resources, Myanmar will need help translating its information and communication technology infrastructure needs into financially viable and bankable projects that can attract private sector financing.
L88|Effects of Mergers in Two-Sided Markets: The US Radio Industry|This study examines mergers in two-sided markets using a structural supply-and-demand model that employs data from the 1996-2006 merger wave in the U.S. radio industry. In particular, it identities the conflicting incentives for merged firms to exercise market power on both listener and advertiser sides of the market, and disaggregates the effects of mergers into changes in product variety and advertising quantity. Specifically, it finds 0.2% listener welfare increase (+0.3% from increased product variety, and -0.1% from decreased ad quantity) and 21% advertiser welfare decrease (-17% from changes in product variety, and -5% from decreased ad quantity).
L88|Superstars in politics: the role of the media in the rise and success of Junichiro Koizumi|This paper explores the role of mass media in people’s perceptions of charismatic leaders, focusing on the case of Junichiro Koizumi, Prime Minister of Japan from 2001 to 2006. Using survey data collected immediately after Koizumi’s 2005 landslide electoral victory, this study empirically assesses the influence of television (TV) and newspapers on individuals’ support for Koizumi and for the most distinctive policy action he announced during his campaign—the privatization of the postal service. The major findings are: (1) the frequency of exposure to mass media is positively related to the support for Koizumi but not for his principal policy and (2) a significant impact of TV is only observed among women. The habit of reading newspapers only slightly correlates with men’s support for Koizumi.. Our study’s results suggest that compared to a political platform, charisma and attractiveness wield a greater influence on TV watchers of the opposite sex. Television apparently works as a powerful amplifier of leaders’ appealing attributes. The resulting superstar effect may allow a charismatic candidate to win an election, even though his main agenda item (i.e., postal privatization) is strongly opposed by special interest groups and members of the ruling party.
L88|Determinants of the Cost of Starting a Business in Mexico|We construct a panel data at the state level in Mexico for the years 2006, 2008 and 2011 in order to investigate the impact that entry deregulation efforts have on the cost of opening new businesses in Mexico, where this cost is taken from the Doing Business in Mexico report of the World Bank. Using a model that the controls for the financial strength of the states, market profitability, regional fixed effects, and considering endogenous effects, we find that the measures of entry deregulation are strongly associated with a reduction in the cost of opening a new business.
L88|Statistical methods for evaluating satisfaction with public services|Contrary to private enterprises, public enterprises can be unaware of the impact of their performance when providing services to the public. This is often the case when a small array of choices is in citizens’ hands or coercion is the only possibility and a public service must be received and accepted as it is. In these situations where citizens cannot switch to other providers, customer churn cannot occur, or the use of the service cannot be reduced, the assessment of users’ satisfaction for public services becomes a very important topic. At the same time, this is also a tricky task, since satisfaction may vary among citizens according to their personal needs and expectations. Using proper statistical methods to assess and explain the level of satisfaction for services provided by public enterprises can be useful to face these issues. In this paper we analyse some of these statistical methods and suggest how to use them to improve citizens’ satisfaction.

L88|The role of sustainability policy in influencing service innovation. a case study of Changzhou BRT system|Purpose. The main aim of this paper is to assess and analyze the role of sustainability policy in influencing service innovation practices in the context of public transport. The intension is to understand the critical dimensions related to sustainability policy driven service innovation. The critical dimensions mainly focus on the relationship between innovation and policy, the challenges, competences and opportunities driven by sustainability policy. Design/methodology/approach. The paper is of an explorative nature. Critical case study method is adopted in this paper to understand the role of sustainability policy in service innovation. Findings. The study reveals that national sustainability policy framework drives the formulation and implementation of sustainable service innovation as a tool to achieve sustainable public transit system. The sustainability policy context in terms of responsibility, power and resource integration creates shared-platform that induces service innovation, which create value co-creation opportunities to the customers and other stakeholders. Research limitations/implications. The single case-study design of the present research does not enable empirical generalizations to be made. Contribution/value. The paper makes an original contribution to the study of sustainable and innovative public transit by explicitly linking the adoption of sustainability policy and its role in service innovation and value co-creation embedded on social and environmental perspectives. Practical implications. National policies often cannot influence local/urban transport directly, but become effective tool towards service innovation and value co-creation.
L88|Negotiating a Plurilateral Agreement on Trade in Services|This paper analyses the ongoing plurilateral negotiations for a new Agreement on Trade in Services. Its aim is to answer to the following set of questions: (1) What are the motivations behind these negotiations as well as the objectives of the new plurilateral trade in services agreement? How will the architecture of the new agreement look like? (2) What are the interests involved in negotiating this new plurilateral agreement on trade in services? and (3) How will it fit into the multilateral trading system revolving around the WTO? According to the findings of the paper, the new deal that is promoted by 23 like-minded WTO Members, including the EU, is a policy response to disappointment over the protracted multilateral talks and the very impasse of the Doha Round. Yet, the stakes on negotiating an ambitious market opening for services are quite high, given the importance of services in international trade and particularly their crucial role in global production networks, that dominate nowadays global production, trade and investments.
L88|India’s Foreign Trade with China Since Economic Reforms in India|The comparison of the key features of trade integration processes and the economic outcomes in China and India reveals that while much has already been achieved in both these economies, the Chinese reforms, especially with respect to manufacturing trade, have gone further and that this is likely one of the key determinants of better economic performance of China. Still, China’s integration process so far remains characterized by a certain duality. On the one hand the opening up of trade and FDI in manufactured goods has spurred the emergence of a largely private sector. On the other hand the high level of public ownership and important regulatory barriers continue to dominate the services sectors. India has gone a long way in reducing its tariffs on non-agricultural products as well as selected non-tariff barriers but moderate protection still persists which likely adds to the hurdles faced by the Indian manufacturing sector. India has revealed a comparative advantage in certain segments of the services sector but its services trade policy is still very restrictive, even as compared to China. More generally the extent of liberalisation achieved so far in India and the outcomes it brought about suggest that the remaining goods and services trade barriers are just but one item on the list of reforms that India needs to tackle in order to promote trade-led expansion of more labour-intensive activities. India has gone a long way in reducing its tariffs on non-agricultural products as well as certain non-tariff barriers but moderate protection still persists which likely adds to the costs of intermediate inputs and, thus, to the hurdles faced by the Indian manufacturing sector. India has revealed a comparative advantage in certain segments of the services sector but its services trade policy is still very restrictive, even as compared to China. The extent of liberalisation achieved so far and the outcomes it brought about suggest that the remaining goods and services trade barriers are just one item on the list of reforms that India needs to tackle in order to promote trade-led expansion of labour-intensive activities.
L88|Role of Industrial Relations in Public Sector Enterprises-The Indian Scenario|The relationship between labour and management became very complex and neither party had any faith or confidence in each other. The big business concerns growing at a fast pace, the labour problems demanded an intelligent solution. Now, we have different labour enactments and judicial decision, which play a major role in regulating industrial relations. For maintaining harmonious labour management relations and for creating a climate of mutual confidence and trust between management and employees, public sector was expected to serve as a model employer and pace maker for rest of the economy. For long, the Indian industry had enjoyed the parental affection of the government under various pleas of socialism, welfare state, economic and industrial development, etc. Now it had to fight for itself for its very survival against the global giants on its own. Against this backdrop, we can proceed to analyse the significance of the present study. With the winds of change sweeping across the length and breadth of our country, the industrial relations (IR) situation cannot possibly remain a mute spectator to such nation-wide transition Thus, the author has chosen the topic “Role of Industrual Relations in Public Sector Enterprises : The Indian Scenario.” IR in future may move in the direction of com radeship between the two main IR protagonists — management and trade union. With the terms of debate already showing signs of drastic change, IR in future will be governed by a totally new set of parameters. There is gradual realization by both the partners that to survive, both have to surrender their sectional interests at the alter of the superordinate interest of the economy.
L88|Competitive bidding for Medicare Part B clinical laboratory services|The traditional Medicare fee-for-service program may be able to purchase clinical laboratory test services at a lower cost through competitive bidding. Demonstrations of competitive bidding for clinical laboratory tests have been twice mandated or authorized by Congress but never implemented. This article provides a summary and review of the final design of the laboratory competitive bidding demonstration mandated by the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. The design was analogous to a sealed bid (first price), clearing price auction. Design elements presented include covered laboratory tests and beneficiaries, laboratory bidding and payment status under the demonstration, composite bids, determining bidding winners and the demonstration fee schedule, and quality under the demonstration. Expanded use of competitive bidding in Medicare, including specifically for clinical laboratory tests, has been recommended in some proposals for Medicare reform. The presented design may be a useful point of departure if Medicare clinical laboratory competitive bidding is revived in the future. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014
L88|The Stakes on Negotiating a Plurilateral Agreement on Trade in Services|In March 2013, a group of 23 like: minded WTO Members, including the EU, started negotiations for a plurilateral Agreement on Trade in Services. This paper aims to address the ongoing talks from several angles. First, it explores the motivation behind these negotiations and highlights the objectives and structure of the new plurilateral trade in services agreement. Secondly, it sheds light on the stakes involved in these negotiations. And thirdly, it analyses the future plurilateral agreement through the lens of the multilateral trading system. According to the findings of the paper, the new deal is a policy response to disappointment over the protracted Doha Round multilateral talks. But it also stems from a need for more ambitious market opening and deeper trade integration in services on the part of advanced economies, given the crucial role of services along global production networks, which dominate nowadays production, trade and investment.
L88|"Bulgarian Film Industry: ""Sun and Shadow"" of the Transition. Markets, Policies, Deficits"|Object the present study is the Bulgarian film industry, the subject of the analysis are the crises in its genesis during the transition. The main research hypothesis is that crises have a form of market and non-market failures, and are a reflection of the specificity of the product, the national cinema market and cultural policy during the period under review. And part of the defects are a reflection of the global crises of the emergence of new business models related to digitalization. In the course of the study outlined the paradox in the Bulgarian film industry: a serious economic contribution of macro level (value added, employment, number of firms), in combination with the instability of micro producer companies and monopolized and integrating markets of distribution and exhibition. As a result-limited access of the audience and the low efficacy of film production. Output from this harrowing development through crises are transformations-transformations to new business models through new sectorial policies.
L88|Services Trade Restrictiveness Index (STRI): Financial Services|This paper presents the services trade restrictiveness indices (STRIs) for financial services. The STRIs are composite indices taking values between zero and one, zero representing an open market and one a market completely closed to foreign services providers. The indices are calculated for 40 countries, the 34 OECD members and Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Russia and South Africa. The STRIs capture de jure restrictions. This report presents the first vintage of indicators for commercial banking and insurance services and captures regulations in force in 2013. The scores in commercial banking range between 0.06 and 0.55, with a sample average of 0.19. The scores in insurance services range between 0.05 and 0.63, with a sample average of 0.20. The results are mainly driven by restrictions on market entry, where significant impediments remain in the form of foreign equity limits, restrictions on legal form, discriminatory licensing criteria and restrictions on cross-border transactions. Barriers to competition, including regulation of products and prices and preferential treatment granted to state-owned financial institutions, also make a substantive contribution to the index values. The paper presents the list of measures included in the indices, the scoring and weighting system for calculating the indices and an analysis of the results.
L88|Governing Knowledge for Development: Knowledge Clusters in Brunei Darussalam and Malaysia|With the dwindling of natural resources, like oil and gas, even resource-rich countries like Brunei Darussalam and Malaysia have to re-adjust their development strategies. Governing knowledge for development (K4D) is seen as a way out of the dilemma of reduced revenues from natural resources. This paper analyses the attempts to create knowledge clusters as a strategy to move Brunei and Malaysia towards knowledge-based economies. Our study shows that several knowledge clusters have already been established in Peninsular Malaysia and are starting to emerge in Brunei Darussalam. The paper is structured as follows: the first section explains the dangers of falling into a “knowledge trap” and the strategies a country may adopt to govern knowledge. The second section looks at the epistemic landscapes in Peninsular Malaysia. Two knowledge clusters are the focal points of analysis, namely the North Corridor-Penang Knowledge Cluster and the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC-Cyberjaya) Knowledge Cluster. We then provide empirical evidence of knowledge cluster formation in Brunei Darussalam as an effort to build up knowledge institutions and to diversify its economy. The paper ends with recommendations how to build the basis for a move towards a knowledge-based economy.
L88|Superstars in politics: the role of the media in the koizumi regime|This paper explores the role of mass media on people’s perceptions of charismatic leaders, focusing on Japan’s Koizumi regime. We conduct an empirical assessment, looking at the influence of television and newspapers on the support for Koizumi and his principal policy. This study uses individual-level data collected immediately after Koizumi’s 2005 landslide win. The major findings are: (1) frequency of exposure to mass media is positively related to support for Koizumi but not to support for his principal policy and (2) the effect of watching television is only observed for women and that of reading the newspaper only for men. Thus, a charismatic male leader on television has a greater influence than his policy on female voters. The psychological effect of an “attractive” male leader on female voters is amplified through television. Despite no support from special interest groups, Koizumi won the election because of a televised superstar effect.

L88|Private Services as a Source of Growth?|Abstract There are almost 200,000 enterprises operating in the Finnish service sector, combined. However, not all of the service industries are the same. Some services have become independent of geographical locations, meaning that they can be exported, much like physical products. Other services still require that they are produced and consumed in the same place. Significant differences also exist between the scalability of different services. Since 2007, employment growth has been the fastest in the location-dependent services. The real growth of value added and the increase of productivity, however, have been concentrated in the service industries which do not depend on geography, and where the economies of scale apply the most.
L88|Drivers of fixed and mobile broadband infrastructure adoption and quality|The benefits of advanced information and communication services are increasingly dependent on the quality of the available connectivity. This paper examines the factors that influence the quality of fixed and mobile broadband access in OECD countries. Drawing on institutional economics, the study provides an integrated conceptual framework that allows analyzing the interaction of supply, demand, policy, and contextual factors. We explore the drivers of broadband access and quality and potential interdependencies between them. Our focus is on the role of public policy decisions as a determinant of quality and quality upgrades of fixed and mobile access networks. We also find evidence that regulatory interventions such as unbundling or open access provision do have a positive contribution in markets with limited competition. However, the findings also provide evidence that the best policy approach is dependent on the specific context of a country so that no single best practice model emerges from the observations.
L88|Adoption et modèles de diffusion régionale de l’innovation dans les gouvernements locaux: le cas du développement de l’e-Gouvernement en Lorraine|Cette recherche analyse les déterminants à l’origine de l’adoption de l’e-Gouvernement par les communes. Comme le met en évidence la littérature empirique, la mise en place d’une offre de services numériques est conjointement déterminée par les caractéristiques internes aux communes et par un effet d’apprentissage informationnel par l’observation des communes géographiquement voisines ou similaires en taille de population. Comme contribue à le montrer le présent article, analysé au niveau des communes d’appartenance départementale similaire, l’influence de ces déterminants sur le choix d’adoption de l’e-Gouvernement local est spécifique au territoire. L’adoption de l’e-Gouvernement par les communes peut en effet être expliquée par une logique de diffusion verticale, en plus d’une logique d’imitation par apprentissage observationnel des communes géographiquement voisines. L’adoption de l’e-Gouvernement par les communes relève en effet de modèles de diffusion régionale différents selon la taille des communes.
L88|The Potential of Digital Games for Empowerment and Social Inclusion of Groups at Risk of Social and Economic Exclusion: Evidence and Opportunity for Policy|This report addresses the potential of digital games to support social inclusion and empowerment (DGEI). It is based on a range of theoretical and empirical data, brought together for the first time in this and associated reports. The aim of the report, commissioned by DG CNECT, is to provide a better understanding of the industrial, market, social opportunities and limitations of digital games for empowerment and as a tool for socio-economic inclusion of people at risk of exclusion (such as youth at risk, migrants, elderly people, the unemployed, and the low-educated). A review of the literature, 12 original short case studies, workshops, and contributions from experts and stakeholders were used to identify both opportunities and challenges for deployment of digital games and gaming in fields such as wellness and aging, education and employability of poor learners, improved quality of training and skill development in industry, and civic participation. It concludes that there is sufficient evidence and activity to foresee positive impacts in terms of social inclusion, public service improvement, and employment and growth, but significant activity is still required in research, innovation, and especially in practice, before clear conclusions on large scale impact could be drawn. The report finishes by suggesting a range of actions related to the video game and 'serious game and gamification'' industry, research, skills, and application sectors that could be taken by stakeholders and policy makers in order to exploit the opportunities of DGEI.
L88|The New Political Economy of EU State Aid Policy|Despite its importance and singularity, the EU’s state aid policy has attracted less scholarly attention than other elements of EU competition policy. Introducing the themes addressed by the special issue, this article briefly reviews the development of EU policy and highlights why the control of state aid matters. The Commission’s response to the current economic crisis notably in banking and the car industry is a key concern, but the interests of the special issue go far beyond. They include: the role of the European Commission in the development of EU policy, the politics of state aid, and a clash between models of capitalism. The special issue also examines the impact of EU policy. It investigates how EU state aid decisions affect not only industrial policy at the national level (and therefore at the EU level), but the welfare state and territorial relations within federal member states, the external implications of EU action and the strategies pursued by the Commission to limit any potential disadvantage to European firms, and the conflict between the EU’s expanding legal order and national.

L88|Balancing Market and Government Failure in Service Delivery|Whether to provide services by the public or the private sector has been at the center of debates within governments and those in the international aid industry for decades. Unfortunately, this debate has often been cast in terms of absolutes with the private sector either as savior or demon. Casting the issue in this light simply can’t be correct. It cannot be the case that either is appropriate for every service and with every government regardless of its capability to the exclusion of the other. In every case, policy makers need to ask “how can the government improve the well-being of citizens with the constraints and tools at hand?” Those constraints include the ability to implement and monitor policy. This paper outlines how limitations of the market can be matched to appropriate interventions by government as it actually performs, not as it is hoped to perform. This matching will, by necessity,vary with country circumstance. While pure public goods must be provided by government regardless of its weaknesses and pure private goods should generally be left to the market, most serious policies operate in between. The balance of the limitations of the sectors needs careful analysis. The welfare costs of private market failure are rarely measured and the difficulties of implementing different policies are rarely discussed let alone quantified. Policies that are sensitive to deviations from perfect implementation should be avoided in preference to those that are more robust to circumstances. Further, every policy will generate interest groups that will constrain future decisions through political pressure.

L88|Gravity Model by Panel Data Approach: Empirical Evidence from Nigeria|Gravity trade model continue to be coveted for analysis of determinants trade flows among countries despite its lack of theoretical foundations. The main aim of the paper is to assess the determinants of flow of Nigeria’s exports using longitudinal data from 1999 to 2012. Extrapolating from the empirical literature, the paper constructs Nigeria’s gravity trade model comprising of 9 EU countries, BRICS countries, Canada, Japan and the US. Results from POOL and panel regressions – fixed and random effects show that market size, price index of destination countries positively drive trade flows in Nigeria, while relative factor endowment, economic similarities and geographical distance negatively affect Nigeria’s trade flows. Furthermore, the paper found evidence in support of positive trade flows with the EU countries and negative trade flows with BRICS and on account of cultural difference. Findings show that Nigeria’s exports follow Linder hypothesis. These have important implications for economic, socio-cultural and bilateral trade negotiations for better trade performance in Nigeria in the future.
L88|The Service Sector in India|The service sector is the largest and fastest growing sector in India and has the highest labor productivity, but employment has not kept pace with the share of the sector in gross domestic product and has not produced the number or quality of jobs needed. There is no policy leading to inclusive growth, and multiple, uncoordinated governing bodies adversely affect the growth of the sector. Many regulations are outdated, and there are restrictions and barriers on foreign direct investment. While India is among the top 10 World Trade Organization members in service exports and imports, the growth and export of services is less than that of the People’s Republic of China, and exports are competitive in only a few services and are concentrated in a few markets. Most of the poor in India do not have access to basic services such as healthcare and education, and infrastructure is weak so the cost of service delivery is high. Although India wants to be a knowledge hub, there is no uniformity in the quality and standards of education, and formal education does not guarantee employability. Policy measures are suggested for inclusive growth that will also enhance India’s global competitiveness in services.
L88|Doha Round Sectoral Negotiations: A Study on Health-care Sector in India|This article is an attempt to analyze the need for negotiations (if any) for India, in the sector of â€˜Enhanced Healthcareâ€™ which is one of the 14 sectors in the Sectoral Negotiations (a component of Non Agricultural Market Access) of the ongoing Doha round. This is done by looking at various components of the Doha Round Sectoral Proposals specifically from Indiaâ€™s context. We have compared Indiaâ€™s competitiveness with the four countries, i.e., US; Singapore; Switzerland and the Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu, which have proposed 25 product categories (i.e., 25 chapters in HS nomenclature) in this sector for free trade and hence are called as â€˜the proponentsâ€™ of this sector. We have used two trade indicators, growth rate of exports and revealed comparative advantage, for analyzing the Indiaâ€™s relative competitiveness. Both the trade indicators show that India does have a comparative cost advantage to be one of key players in this sector. However, this opportunity has to be reaped judiciously by Indian government so as to make best use. Also, at same time the need of the hour is that the government should invest in this sector so as to meet the basic international standards and thereby helping not only the Indian populace but also the industry as a whole.
L88|Which qualifications does a minister of the German Federal Government need to be reoccupied?|The objective pursued by this study is to raise the question whether there exists a correlation between the reoccupation of ministers of the German Federal Government and their particular socio-demographic characteristics or human capital. Therefore, this paper depicts the decision of the German Federal Chancellor of reoccupation for all ministers between 1949 and 2012 by running several ordinal regression analyses. The results reveal that the age, the years of membership in the German Bundestag or in the party, as well as previous leaderships of German non-partisan non-profit organisations or business corporations significantly increase the probability of reoccupation. In addition, this analysis points out that the comparably prominent position of the vice chancellor also raises the chance to be reappointed.
L88|Las políticas públicas y las cooperativas|This paper aims to address the theoretical basis of public policies related to cooperatives and to social economy in general. To this end, strong justifications are found in the economic theory of market and institutional failures and externalities. On the other hand, it assesses and classifies the objects and instruments available. This paper also seeks to analyse and assess the deployment in Spain of two groups of public policies aimed at cooperatives: the first is of an institutional nature for evaluating the participation of cooperatives on the policy-making organs and the second, of structural nature, is aimed at boosting business competitiveness.
L88|Towards Validation of Key Success Factors of E-government Initiatives|One of the emerging areas on which researchers are trying to build some theoretical framework relates to realization of IT value in public sector in general and in the field of E-government in particular. As to what factors can generally be associated with success of E-government is not an easy job. Nevertheless, contemporary researches have been able to generate a framework of success factors for E-government initiatives. In this paper, an attempt has been made to capture the trend in research towards this end followed by an attempt to validate if such a framework is indeed capable of explaining success of E-government initiatives and if so what kind policy and operational insight can be derived for the benefit of decision makers and project managers responsible for formulating and implementing E-government initiatives.
L88|Rise of E-Governance|E-Governance in its present form and coverage has seen several levels of evolution both in concepts as well as applications. Notwithstanding a serious impetus provided by advent of internet, E-Governance has its origin to a systematic thinking on developing certain performance yardsticks for the government departments, particularly, with respect to the Information Resource Management (IRM) and its various nuances. That E Governance was truly a response to make the government departments more efficient than mere technology is well established by the sequence of events that unfolded. In this paper, an attempt has been made to trace the rise of E-Governance from its early days and deliberate on various issues that came by as the momentum picked up. In India, there was no such event where concern to improve public services was linked to performance of government departments and institutions. However, that did not prevent E-Governance to make its presence felt though in a very limited scale and coverage. The initial E-Governance efforts in India were more sporadic attempts on the part of some enterprising/IT savvy government officers/IT professionals. Gyandoot, the celebrated community E-Governance, of Dhar district of Madhya Pradesh was not part of any planned IT policy of the State. It was conceived by an enterprising and technology savvy district collector. The GIS based system of tracking police control room vans at Gautambudh Nagar of Uttar Pradesh, was nothing but a creative experimentation by a technology savvy police officer. Nevertheless, the success of these early isolated attempts truly made the foundation for subsequent growth of E-Governance. The National Informatics Centre (NIC), set up in 1985, quickly grew into as an application service provider and it could collaborate with many State governments as well as Central Government Departments and institutions to roll out many E-Governance initiatives. The advent of WWW made it possible in all government departments and institution to have their websites and portals. Today, there is hardly any government institution where EGovernance in some form or other is not practiced. The trend that is evident is increasing focus on efficient delivery of services as well as process re-engineering. The story of growth of E-Governance in India may not be same as that of USA or Europe but nevertheless one can say that E-Governance in India is not a mere hypes, it is very much real and for government departments, it is no longer an option Governance has preceded with several levels of evolution in concept and applications of IT in government. The early phase is mostly devoted to issues relating to information Resource Management (IRM), Strategic Information Management (SIM), performance yardsticks in terms of Best Practices. At this stage the broad strategic issues related to information Management by the government departments. The second phase saw the rise of the World Wide Web and a whole range of issues connected with the management of WWW_ design of websites, assessment and evaluation of websites, a new public information model based on WWW etc. Then came the third phase, i.e., E-Governance which led to issues relating to organization, legislations, accountability, security, reliability,participation tools.
L88|The Industry and Policy Context for Digital Games for Empowerment and Inclusion: Market Analysis, Future Prospects and Key Challenges in Videogames, Serious Games and Gamification|The effective use of digital games for empowerment and social inclusion (DGEI) of people and communities at risk of exclusion will be shaped by, and may influence the development of a range of sectors that supply products, services, technology and research. The principal industries that would appear to be implicated are the 'videogames' industry, and an emerging 'serious games' industry. The videogames industry is an ecosystem of developers, publishers and other service providers drawn from the interactive media, software and broader ICT industry that services the mainstream leisure market in games, The 'serious games' industry is a rather fragmented and growing network of firms, users, research and policy makers from a variety of sectors. These actors are trying to develop knowledge, products, services and a market for the use of digital games and products inspired by digital games for a range of non-leisure applications. This report provides a summary of the state of play of these industries, their trajectories and the challenges they face. It also analyses the contribution these actors could make to exploiting digital games for empowerment and social inclusion. Finally, it explores existing policy towards activities in these industries and markets, and draws conclusions as to the future policy relevance of engaging with them to support innovation and uptake of effective digital game-based approaches to empowerment and social inclusion.
L88|“The determinants of contractual choice for private involvement in infrastructure projects in the United States”|Reliance on private partners to help provide infrastructure investment and service delivery is increasing in the United States. Numerous studies have examined the determinants of the degree of private participation in infrastructure projects as governed by contract type. We depart from this simple public/private dichotomy by examining a rich set of contractual arrangements. We utilize both municipal and state-level data on 472 projects of various types completed between 1985 and 2008. Our estimates indicate that infrastructure characteristics, particularly those that reflect “stand alone” versus network characteristics, are key factors influencing the extent of private participation. Fiscal variables, such as a jurisdiction’s relative debt level, and basic controls, such as population and locality of government, increase the degree of private participation, while a greater tax burden reduces private participation..
L88|“Beyond pure public and pure private management models: Mixed firms in the European Airport Industry”|increasing trend in airports. The literature has not paid enough attention to the mixed management models in this industry, although many European airports take the form of mixed firms or Institutional PPP, where ownership is shared between public and private sectors. We examine the determinants of the degree of private participation in the European airport sector. Drawing on a sample of the 100 largest European airports we estimate a multivariate equation in order to determine the role of airport characteristics, fiscal variables and political factors on the extent of private involvement. Our results confirm the alignment between public and private interests in PPPs. Fiscal constraints and market attractiveness promote private participation. Integrated governance models and the share of network carriers prevent the presence of private ownership, while the degree of private participation appears to be pragmatic rather than ideological.
L88|“Recovery Risk and Labor Costs in Public-Private-Partnerships: Contractual Choice in the U.S. Water industry”|We use an ordered logistic model to empirically examine the factors that explain varying degrees of private involvement in the U.S. water sector through public-private partnerships. Our estimates suggest that a variety of factors help explain greater private participation in this sector. We find that the risk to private participants regarding cost recovery is an important driver of private participation. The relative cost of labor is also a key factor in determining the degree of private involvement in the contract choice. When public wages are high relative to private wages, private participation is viewed as a source of cost savings. We thus find two main drivers of greater private involvement: one encouraging private participation by reducing risk, and another encouraging government to seek out private participation in lowering costs.
L88|Regulators and Redskins|We examine the correlation between federal government activity and performance of the capital’s National Football League team, the Washington Redskins. We find a positive, non-spurious, and robust correlation between the Redskins’ winning percentage and bureaucratic output, measured by pages published in the Federal Register. Because the Redskins’ performance is prototypically exogenous, we give this result a causal interpretation and provide a plausible, causal mechanism: bureaucrats must make “logrolling” deals to expand their regulatory power, and a winning football team offers a shared source of optimism to lubricate such negotiations. We do not find the same correlation when examining congressional activity. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012

L88|Japan’s Education Services Imports: Branch Campus or Subsidiary Campus?|On the one hand, trade in tertiary education is highly regulated; on the other hand, it is a considerably liberalized area of services. This is especially true in the case of Mode 3 of international services trade, namely oversea campuses. In the case of Japan, foreign universities are/were free to open campuses in Japan to supply tertiary education services, but those were regarded informal education that was not recognized by the Japanese government until 2004. For campuses in Japan established by foreign universities to supply formal education services in Japan, they are required to satisfy the criteria set by the government to be examined by the University Council and the Minister; but no foreign university campus in Japan actually obtained a formal school status. Moreover, program at the campuses in Japan were not regarded as an equivalent to the program provided at the home campuses abroad. It was only in 2004 when the Japanese government introduced a new scheme called “Japanese Branches of Foreign Universities”, under which they can receive the treatment similar to formal Japanese universities except taxation, though only four campuses obtained this status so far. This paper reviews the development of regulatory status of services trade in tertiary education services, especially education through oversea campuses, and considers the policy implications on two critical issues regarding the regulation of services industry: (i) who between the government and the University Council the regulator is; and (ii) who between the home country and host country has the jurisdiction over the oversea branches of universities.
L88|The Welfare Impact Of Reducing Choice In Medicare Part D: A Comparison Of Two Regulation Strategies|Medicare’s prescription drug benefit (Part D) has been its largest expansion of benefits since 1965. Since the implementation of Part D, many regulatory proposals have been advanced in order to improve this government-created market. Among the most debated are proposals to limit the number of options, in response to concerns that there are “too many” plans. In this paper we study the welfare impact of two feasible approaches (of similar magnitude) toward limiting the number of Part D plans: reducing the maximum number of plans each firm can offer per region and removing plans that provide doughnut hole coverage. To this end, we propose and estimate a model of market equilibrium, which we later use to evaluate the impact of regulating down the number of Part D plans. Our counterfactuals provide an important assessment of the losses to consumers (and producers) resulting from government limitations on choice. These losses must be weighed against the widely discussed expected gains due to reduced search costs from limiting options. We find that the annual search costs should be at least two thirds of the average monthly premium in order to justify a regulation that allows only two plans per firm. However, this number would be substantially lower if the limitation in the number of plans is coupled with a decrease in product differentiation (e.g., by removing plans that cover the doughnut hole). For validation purposes, we also assess the impact of a recent major merger, and find that our model performs very well out of sample.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L88|The Effects of Gasoline Price Regulations: Experimental Evidence|Economic theory suggests that gasoline retail markets are prone to collusive behavior. Oligopoly market structures prevail, market interactions occur frequently, prices are highly transparent, and demand is rather inelastic. A recent sector inquiry in Germany backed suspicions of tacit collusion and suggested to adopt regulatory pricing rules for gas stations similar to those implemented in Austria, parts of Australia, Luxembourg or parts of Canada. In order to increase consumer welfare these rules either restrict the number of price changes per day or they limit the mark‐up for gasoline retail prices. As theoretical predictions about the impact of these measures are mixed and empirical studies rare, we analyze the effects, using an experimental gasoline market in the lab. Our results reveal that two of the suggested rules rather decrease consumer welfare: The Austrian rule which only allows one price increase per day (while price cuts are always possible) and the Luxembourg rule which introduces a maximum markup for retailers. While no rule tends to induce lower retail prices, the Western Australian rule which allows at most one daily price change (no matter whether up or down) does at least not harm consumers.
L88|Asymmetry of mobile termination rates and the waterbed effect|This paper empirically analyzes the relationship between asymmetric regulation on mobile termination rates and mobile retail prices, using panel data collected from 20 OECD member countries for 22 quarters. In addition to the asymmetry of mobile access charges, the authors also focus on the impact of a number of variables, such as churn rates, mobile penetration rates, and the market concentration index on mobile operators' retail prices. The results reveal that pricing asymmetry in access services has a positive correlation with mobile retail prices. Therefore, this study supports the assumption that the waterbed effect between the asymmetry of mobile termination rates and retail prices may occur.
L88|Socio-demographic characteristics and human capital of the German federal government's members|Currently, background, qualification and training of German top politicians are widely discussed by scholars and media. This paper provides new insights to this discussion by analysing significant differences between the chancellors, vice chancellors as well as ministers of the inner residual cabinets of the German federal governments between 1949 and 2009 with respect to their socio-demographic backgrounds and educational, economic and political human capital. Applications of different statistical methods reveal that the ministers of the inner cabinet habe the most advantageous social background and the best education. Vice chancellors score highest with regard to their economic human capital, measured here by board seats before their current offices. The average tenure in the federal government as well as the expertise in the actual headed department is highest for chancellors.
L88|A supply side story for a threshold model: Endogenous growth of the free and open source community|The study of social institutions producing and disseminating knowledge has mainly concentrated on two main concepts: Science and Technology. This paper examines a recent institutional form that seems not to resemble either of the other two; that is, knowledge-intensive communities, where individuals freely exchange knowledge through information and communication technology. Using free and open source software as an example, we develop a model where this phenomenon is confronted with Technology with respect to its ability to attract researchers.

L88|Services-led industrialization in India: Assessment and lessons|This paper provides an integrated analysis of the role of the service sector in recent Indian economic development. It discusses the nature of services, their distinction from products, and their categorization. It provides an overview of India’s overall growth experience, and a detailed examination of the contribution of the service sector to growth. It includes an examination of the potential for spillovers from IT, ITES and other service sectors such as financial services, to the rest of the economy, drawing on econometric work, as well as input-output analysis of linkages to understand these possible spillovers and growth potentials. Based on this evidence, it appears that India’s manufacturing sector development may have been constrained in part by weaknesses in key service sectors such as transportation and electricity. The paper also considers the particular role of international trade in services, which is of growing importance. It discusses the consequences for employment of different growth paths, the challenges of education and manpower training to support and sustain India’s development path, and social and environmental issues, including regional inequality issues. The Indian experience is related to recent discussions of industrial policy, and development policy more generally.
L88|Is using regular flexible leave associated with employee wellbeing?| The use of flexible arrangements will likely increase with the Labour government’s introduction of the National Employment Standards which provide employees with caring responsibilities the right to request flexible arrangements. Data come from a sample of public servants (n=2168) surveyed in 2008, providing a unique setting to investigate the implementation process associated with work life balance policy. Results showed that employees who regularly used flexible leave compared with non users reported lower work interference in home life. The study found some interesting differences among men and women. Men appeared to benefit more than women from these arrangements. Mothers benefit but not when they work long hours. Users compared to non users perceived a more supportive and equitable workplace culture, which were stronger predictors of wellbeing than utilisation alone, highlighting the importance of creating an inclusive workplace culture to obtain positive outcomes.
L88|economic impact of the Olympic Games|The Olympic Games are among the largest and most visible sporting events in the world. Every twoyears, the world’s best athletes from some 200 countries come together to compete in lavish new venues in front of thousands of spectators. Hundreds of millions of sports fans worldwide watch the Games on television. Although Pierre de Coubertin, who founded the modern Olympics in the late 19th century, may have had altruistic, idealistic notions of pure amateur competition, unsullied by financial motivations, the Olympic Games have become a big business. The participants are effectively professional athletes; the organizers are highly compensated, professional bureaucrats; hosting the Games involves huge construction and renovation projects that take nearly a decade to complete, and these expenditures are usually justified by claims of extraordinary economic benefits that will accrue to the host city or region as a direct result of hosting the Games. This article examines the financing of the Olympic Games, explores how the awarding of the Games has become a high-stakes contest, and analyzes the costs of running the Games and their economic impact on the host city and nation.
L88|Romanian seismic design code: benchmarking analyses with reference to international codes and research needs for future development|The paper presents conclusions from a technical benchmarking study, performed in order to analyze the performance of the provisions concerning seismic design of reinforced concrete frame structures, as specified by the Romanian seismic code (P100-1/2006). The Romanian code is analyzed with respect to the European standard EN 1998-1:2004, including its National Annex, and with the U. S. codes IBC 2009 and ACI 318 08. The benchmarking analyses were performed by designing a standard reinforced concrete structure according to each of the considered codes and by evaluating the seismic behavior of the structural designs thus obtained. Comparative assessments are made, as well as suggestions concerning potential future research directions, aimed to the improvement of the Romanian provisions in the field.

L88|Green Services and Emergence and Recovery from the Global Economic Slowdown in Developing Asian Economies|The global economic slowdown has again highlighted the vulnerability of export-led development models and economies to downturns in export markets. Economic deepening or rebalancing with an emphasis on service-sector development should beand is becomingone long-term response to the crisis by Asias emerging economies. In the long run, sustainable economic development will depend in part on achieving a green trajectory of service sector development, in which services help green the product economy. In the short run, however, can services help address short- and medium-term challenges of emergence and recovery from the crisisparticularly those of at least resuming historic rates of poverty alleviation and inclusive growth? Meeting these challenges will require that export sectors deal successfully with challenging market conditions. There is a class of closely related business-to-business services which act to green the product economy, and which would improve the competitiveness of export sectors and husband scarce public resources by optimizing the efficiency of infrastructure utilization. These are functional procurement/efficiency services, which transform procurement of environmentally problematic goods and servicessuch as waste disposal, energy, chemicals, and transportinto performance-based services in which service providers profit by increasing the customers eco-efficiency. Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) are the best-known of these service models. These services appear to have strong potential among the larger, more sophisticated institutions and commercial and industrial enterprises in developing Asian states, particularly in Asias more advanced developing economies.
L88|Sports Retailing in India : Opportunities, Constraints and Way Forward|Sports retail is a small but fast growing segment of modern retail in India. Recently, the country has been hosting many international sports and this has given a boost to this sector. Many foreign and domestic corporate retailers have entered sports retail. Sports goods manufacturing is a focus area in the Foreign Trade Policy (2009-2014) and the government is taking a fresh look at the current foreign direct investment policy in retail. In the above context, this paper provides an overview of the sports retail sector in India. Specifically, it presents the different retail formats, consumer profile, retailers supply chain and sourcing. It also examines the retail and sports policies and their implications for this segment of retail, analyses the barriers faced by this sector and suggests policy reforms. The study found that the policy of allowing 51 per cent FDI in the single-brand format has not benefited this sector. The FDI ban on multi-brand retail is not an entry barrier since foreign retailers can establish their presence in India through other routes. The study found that since this is a niche segment of retail, FDI would not have an adverse impact on traditional retailers. It concludes that government should allow 51 per cent FDI in multi-brand sports retail. This will increase sourcing from India, lead to diffusion of technology, proliferation of brands, investment in sports and sports promotion, among others.
L88|Addressing New Service Sectors in WTO/FTAs : Express Delivery and India|The service sector is evolving. New services and new modes of delivering existing services have increased the complexities of services negotiations in the WTO and in FTAs. The WTO negotiations focus on market access but FTAs tend to go beyond market access to seeking regulatory commitments from trading partners. India is a proponent of services liberalisation both in the WTO and through bilateral/regional agreements. In this context, this paper examines how new service sectors like express delivery services (EDS) are addressed in WTO/FTAs and its implications for India. Express delivery services are one of the fastest growing sectors in India. It plays a crucial role in trade facilitation and in enhancing the global competitiveness of Indian industries. At present, there are no FDI restrictions and the country can undertake market access commitments in WTO and in its FTAs. The proponents of liberalisation of express delivery services also seek commitments in complementary services like transport and warehousing. The study found that since the autonomous liberalisation is more than Indias offers in the Doha Round of the WTO negotiations, India is in a position to broaden its commitments in the WTO. One of the core issues for India is that domestic regulation of postal services is evolving. India Post offers courier/EDS services. The Department of Posts is in the process of framing a new regulation that is likely to affect the courier/EDS industry. Based on a primary survey, this study found that the regulation should be transparent and fair; it should clearly define the reserved area and distinguish between Universal Service Obligation (USO) and competitive services. It should also mention how the USO will be funded. The regulation should encompass global best practices like removal of cross-subsidisation and should facilitate competition. The need for a postal regulatory regime will arise if the public postal service provider is privatised. The regulator should be independent. The objective of the new regulation should be to lay down a reform path for India Post and the primary role of the regulator should be to monitor the USO.
L88|The effect of learning varies according to locality: Micro data analysis of the lawyer market in Japan|Using individual level data, this paper examines how and to what extent the behavior and perception of those bringing lawsuits differ between large district courts (competitive lawyer market) and medium or small district ones (less competitive lawyer markets). The major findings are: (1) in medium and small, but not large districts, trial experience discourages people from employing a lawyer. (2) A natural person is less likely to employ a lawyer than a legal entity in medium and small districts, but not in large ones. (3) The self-rated cost of searching for a lawyer is lower in large districts than small ones. It follows from these results that the lower competitive pressure in the lawyer markets in medium and small districts results in higher costs to employ a lawyer than is found in large districts.
L88|Green Services and Emergence and Recovery from the Global Economic Slowdown in Developing Asian Economies|The global economic slowdown has again highlighted the vulnerability of export-led development models and economies to downturns in export markets. Economic deepening or “rebalancing” with an emphasis on service-sector development should be—and is becoming—one long-term response to the crisis by Asia's emerging economies. In the long run, sustainable economic development will depend in part on achieving a “green” trajectory of service sector development, in which services help green the “product economy.” In the short run, however, can services help address short- and medium-term challenges of emergence and recovery from the crisis—particularly those of at least resuming historic rates of poverty alleviation and inclusive growth? Meeting these challenges will require that export sectors deal successfully with challenging market conditions. There is a class of closely related business-to-business services which act to green the product economy, and which would improve the competitiveness of export sectors and husband scarce public resources by optimizing the efficiency of infrastructure utilization. These are functional procurement/efficiency services, which transform procurement of environmentally problematic goods and services—such as waste disposal, energy, chemicals, and transport—into performance-based services in which service providers profit by increasing the customer's eco-efficiency. Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) are the best-known of these service models. These services appear to have strong potential among the larger, more sophisticated institutions and commercial and industrial enterprises in developing Asian states, particularly in Asia's more advanced developing economies.
L88|L’esperienza francese nel processo europeo di liberalizzazione del mercato dell’energia|La liberalizzazione del mercato elettrico e del gas in Francia ha urtato contro la tradizionale e condivisa cultura francese che fa affidamento sull’intervento diretto dello stato e dei monopoli pubblici per la fornitura di molti servizi pubblici. Questo spiega la resistenza contro l’apertura del mercato energetico imposta dall’UE. Tuttavia la liberalizzazione ha avuto il benefico effetto di rimettere in causa alcune rendite, l’organizzazione istituzionale e lo stesso concetto di servizio pubblico. In prospettiva però la liberalizzazione è destinata anche ad aumentare la complessità tecnica, istituzionale, finanziaria ed organizzativa del settore energetico.
L88|Dynamic Simulation for Government Policy Effects of the Mobile Telecom Industry in Taiwan|"The applying, cancelling and changing of the radio channel licenses and the radio base station establishment need to be managed by the government because radio channel has scarce characteristic of resource. In order to carry out ""Mobil Taiwan"" plan and telecom liberalization, Taiwan official opened the business licenses of the third generation (3G) mobile phone in 2002 and the business licenses of the fourth generation (4G) WiMAX in 2007. The telecom market of mobile phone leads to a diversified service circumstance. Radio base station is the foundation of communication quality for the mobile phone. In order to shoot for mobile phone customers, all private enterprises apply and set up mobile base station, and then causes radio base station number to increase fast in Taiwan. Furthermore, being afraid of the radio wave the populace protest the radio base stations (BTS). The results not only made mobile phone operators hard to build and maintenance BTS, but also made the network communication quality attenuation. This paper utilizes the system dynamics to study the causality among the franchise operation license, base station number, communication quality, customer and the other factors, and makes relevant policy simulation."
L88|Evaluating the Effectiveness of National Labor Relations Act Remedies: Analysis and Comparison with Other Workplace Penalty Policies|The goal of this paper is to examine the implied penalty policies underlying the remedies created by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) in terms of the policies' impact on employer and union behaviors. We present a simple model of deterrence as a means of evaluating workplace penalty policies in terms of their influence on employer behavior, particularly through deterrence effects. We also compare the remedies for violations embodied in the NLRA with penalty policies under other workplace legislation, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Occupational Safety and Health Act. We then evaluate the size of financial costs for violations against individuals of specific provisions of the NLRA by firms and unions for the period 2000-2009. We show that the implied penalties are modest, particularly in terms of providing sufficient incentives to comply with the law in a timely manner. Given this finding, we examine other potential remedies available under the NLRA, in particular, methods to address the impact of delays (the length of time from the filing of the charge or the issuance of the charge to the time of its adjudication before an administrative law judge at the National Labor Relations Board or through the federal courts) on workplace representation through unionization.
L88|"Achieving Sustainable Security Â€"" Vulnerable Public Good In The Context Of A Nonpolar Security Environment. Shifts In The Concept Of Security"|It is important to start our assumptions from the fact that, from some economistsâ€(tm) point of view, most of the cases which were considered examples of actual public goods were found to be wrong. So, what we want to find out is whether, considering the fact that security must not be provided only through private means, we can still talk about an equal distribution of it, or it has shifted to a selective distribution of security. In order to answer the question whether security can still be provided by the state in an equal distributional system, we will use it as a premise and try to prove it. Beginning with the theoretical characteristics of a public good and with the definitions of the present concept of security we will try to find out if one can still speak of security as a public good, and moreover, as a global public good.

L88|Local Structures And Social Policies: Design And Use Of Services In The Case Of A Typical Urban Greek Municipality|Local Authorities constitute the statutory expression of the local state. Amongst the policies they implement, social interventions are of particular importance, as they aim at the welfare and development of local society. The aim of this study is to examine the restrictions of social interventions carried out by Local Authorities, as dictated by central social policy. In relation to the study of the Greek institutional framework in force, those factors are examined which bring about the successful provision of social services by the local state. According to a model of logistic regression that interprets the factors of satisfaction among those benefiting from the social services in the Municipality of Keratsini Attica, it was discovered that the problems in planning local social actions are similar to those in central systems.
L88|Determinants of Participation in Global Volunteer Grids: A Cross-Country Analysis|Volunteer Grids, in which users share computing resources altruistically, play a critical role in fostering research. Sharing and collaboration in Volunteer Grids is determined by many factors. These determinants define the participation in Grids and the amount of contribution to such Grids. Whereas previous studies focused on explaining researchers¡¯ and countries¡¯ willingness to share resources in Volunteer Grids based on social sharing theory, this research argues that without the appropriate technological capabilities, countries or researcher cannot implement their willingness. Based on the literature review, this paper defines the influential determinants for participating in global Volunteer Grids. Besides, this research employs a multiple regression analysis of these determinants, using a total of 130 observations collected from international data repositories. Our results show that R&D and Internet connection type (broadband or dial-up) are significant determinates for participating in Volunteer Grids. This result explains why developed countries are active and enjoy the benefits from Volunteer Grids, while developing countries still lag behind. Therefore, an increased participation in Grids cannot be solely achieved by interconnecting with developing countries through high-speed Internet backbones.
L88|Crucial contributors? Re-examining labour market impact and workplace-training intensity in Canadian trades apprenticeship|Canadian apprenticeship policy has recently turned to direct subsidies for participants, including a federal tax incentive for employers. Some assumptions underlying the employer subsidy are: that apprenticeship training is a principal contributor to the skilled trades labour supply; that employers of apprentices typically incur high training cost and risks; and that in the absence of offsetting incentives, these would deter their participation. These assumptions are tested, using an analysis of 2006 census data and a series of 33 employer interviews. The census data reveal that, in 74 â€œskilled tradesâ€ occupations (NOC-S group H), the proportion of the labour force reporting an apprenticeship credential is 37%. When certificates granted to â€œtrade qualifiersâ€ are excluded from the total, registered apprenticeship certification is found to contribute roughly 25% of the skilled trades labour supply. A closer examination of the census data reveals strong inter-occupational differences in the certification rate and in the ratio of certified to less-than-certified workers, suggesting a de facto hierarchy of trades occupations. The interviews reveal sharp variations in employersâ€™ workplace training efforts, challenging the twin suppositions that employers of apprentices are uniformly high contributors to skill formation, and that high training-related costs risks generally deter their participation. Differences in training behaviour are attributed to high-skill versus low-skill business strategies that in turn reflect differing product markets and regulatory constraints. Whatever the level of their training effort, all of the participating employers are able to minimize the training-related risks that have been cited as the principal rationale for employer subsidies. The paper argues for a more nuanced approach to skills policy and research in Canada, with greater attention to the diversity of actorsâ€™ strategic interactions with the training system.
L88|Public-Private Partnerships for E-Government Services: Lessons from Malaysia|Implementation of e-government is seen as a tool to improve government service delivery to citizens, businesses and within government agencies. The benefits could be more transparency, greater convenience, less corruption, revenue growth and cost reduction. However, lack of financial resources, and low levels of skills and limited capacity of governments are some of the main obstacles faced in pursuance of e-government nationwide. The introduction of Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) is seen as a solution to overcome many of the obstacles and challenges faced by governments in realizing the objectives of e-government projects. PPP model is expected to increase opportunities for both the public and private sectors to serve their customers more effectively and efficiently. The main aim of this paper is to explore the need for PPP in e-government service delivery. This is done by discussing some success stories and looking at lessons learned by the Malaysian government to serve the stakeholders better in line with its vision and mission.
L88|Markets: Red Light States: Who Buys Online Adult Entertainment?|This paper studies the adult online entertainment industry, particularly the consumption side of the market. In particular, it focuses on the demographics and consumption patterns of those who subscribe to adult entertainment websites. On the surface, this business would seem to face a number of obstacles. Regulatory and legal barriers have already been mentioned. In addition, those charging for access to adult entertainment face competition from similar content available without a fee. In the context of adult entertainment, free access offers consumers an extra benefit: online payments tend to create records documenting the fact of a customer's purchase; consumers of free content may feel more confident that their purchases will remain confidential. More broadly, measured levels of religiosity in American are high. On the other hand, social critics often argue that the rise of Internet pornography is contributing to a coarsening of American culture. Do consumption patterns of online adult entertainment reveal two separate Americas? Or is the consumption of online adult entertainment widespread, regardless of legal barriers, potential for embarrassment, and even religious conviction?
L88|Subsidizing Creativity through Network Design: Zero-Pricing and Net Neutrality|"This paper focuses on the pricing aspect of the ""net neutrality"" debate -- in particular, the de facto ban on fees levied by Internet service providers on content providers to reach users. This ""zero-price"" rule may prove desirable for several reasons. Using a two-sided market analysis, we suggest that it subsidizes creativity and innovation in new content creation -- goals shared by copyright and patent laws. The rule also helps to solve a coordination problem: since Internet service providers do not completely internalize the effects of their own pricing decisions, lack of regulation may lead to even higher fees charged by all. Finally, allowing for such fees runs the risk of creating horizontally differentiated Internet service providers with different libraries of accessible content, thereby foreclosing consumers and leading to Internet fragmentation."

L88|The benefits of introducing a mandatory state hurricane insurance scheme in Florida|As a result of its hurricane exposure, Florida is probably the part of the industrialised world most prone to natural catastrophes. Over the last 20 years the Florida legislator has tried to maintain a situation, where the private insurance sector plays a major role in providing hurricane-insurance. Its attempts to keep such insurance affordable have, however, led to a situation, where the public sector still ends up bearing a large part of the risk. Drawing on the experience of various European countries with mandatory state run catastrophe insurance schemes, we argue that the cost of hurricane insurance for the population could be substantially reduced, if Florida created a similar institution. The massive reduction in sales costs, loss adjustment costs and general administrative costs would allow such a system to work with premiums that are on average 25% lower. The problems of adverse selection which plague the current situation would of course (by definition) be eliminated.

L88|Emerging Pattern of India's Outward Foreign Direct Investment Under the Influence of State Policy: A Macro View|Emerging growth dynamism of Indian economy in rapidly globalising world is highly recognised and commented by a large body of researchers during the recent period. In fact, the Indian planning has made long concerted effort to develop strategic and competitive capabilities in the agents of production. During the recent periods, these capabilities have started paying. Such trends became more lucid with the strengthening of Indian capital especially abroad as the Indian capital has initiated collaborations and mergers with the global players. This study provides insights into such achievement of the Indian economy. Besides providing a review of theory and practice of emerging multinationals from developing countries, this paper examines India’s outward foreign direct investment in an evolutionary perspective. In its endeavor, the study besides tracing the emerging pattern of India’s outward foreign direct investment, hints at the facilitating role of state policy to encourage the outflow of foreign direct investment.
L88|Paikkatietojen yhteiskäyttö ja jakeluperiaatteet - Hinnoitteluperiaatteiden analyysi ja kansantaloudellisten vaikutusten simulointi|Julkisen sektorin organisaatiot ovat tärkeitä keskeisten paikkatietoaineistojen tuottajia. Tietojen yhteiskäyttöisyyttä haittaavat mm. vaihtelevat luovutus- ja hinnoittelukäytännöt. Korkea hinnoittelu rajaa käyttöä etenkin innovatiivisessa pienyritystoiminnassa sekä tutkimus- ja kehitystoiminnassa. Vaikka paikkatietojen hinnoittelusta onkin keskusteltu verraten laajasti, hinnoittelutapojen kansantaloudellisista vaikutuksista ei ole aikaisempaa tutkimustietoa. Tämä tutkimus pyrkii täyttämään tätä aukkoa ja analysoi, millä tavalla aineistojen erilaiset hinnoittelutavat näyttävät vaikuttavan kansantalouteen. Suoritimme kyselyn 23 organisaatiolle, sekä yrityksille että julkisen sektorin toimijoille, jotka hyödyntävät paikkatietoja. Paikkatietotoimintaansa kuvaavien vastausten lisäksi kerättiin taloudellisia tunnuslukuja vuosilta 2001-2005 sekä ennusteita vuodelle 2010. Haastatteluilla selvitettiin paikkatietoon liittyvän toiminnan merkitystä, hyötyjä, esteitä, liiketoiminnan tuloja sekä mielipiteitä ja suosituksia julkisen sektorin tuottaman paikkatiedon hinnoittelukäytäntöihin. Organisaatioiden koko ja budjettitekniset käytännöt (esim. paikkatiedon tuottajien kohdalla mahdollisuus käyttää itse tulot omassa toiminnassaan) sääntelivät voimakkaimmin näkemyksiä hinnoittelukäytännöistä. Pääkomponenttianalyysin avulla pystyttiin selittämään 82 prosenttia suosituksiin ja organisaation ominaispiirteisiin liittyvien muuttujien vaihtelusta. Kyselyaineiston tuloksista johdetun ennustesimulaation avulla tutkittiin erilaisten hinnoittelumallien vaikutusta kansantalouteen. Mikäli nykyisenkaltaista hinnoittelua jatketaan, on paikkatietotoiminnan bruttokansantuotetta kasvattava vaikutus 6-12 miljoonaa euroa vuoteen 2010 mennessä. Keskeisten aineistojen jakelu irtiottokustannuksin tulisi tutkimuksen mukaan kasvattamaan bruttokansantuotetta 16-24 miljoonaa euroa samassa ajassa. Kasvun merkitystä vuotuiseen bruttokansantuotteeseen olisi noin 0,0021-0,0031 prosenttiyksikköä. Jos paikkatietojen hyödyntäminen liiketoimintojen tehostami-sen ym. integroinnin kautta lisääntyy, voi yhteiskäytöstä muodostua arvioitua suurempi kasvu. Erityisesti innovatiivisten käyttötapojen ja uusien sovellusalojen löytymiseksi sekä alan kehitystyöhön liittyvän pienyritystoiminnan tukemiseksi olisi tärkeä poistaa aineistojen hinnoittelun muodostamia käytön esteitä.
L88|Globalization of Innovations: Changing Nature of India’s Science and Technology Cooperation Policy|The present paper is an attempt to focus on the international dimensions of innovation policies that are likely to affect technological change and development process. Recently, a new dimension of innovation has been added by the offshoring of R&D services in India. This phenomenon was mainly confined to the triad countries but recently a number of firms from China, Korea and Taiwan have also figured in this process. Many theoretical and empirical studies are proving to be inadequate to explain this process of globalization of innovation. The present paper attempts to analyze the role of new actors, learning process and its impact on India’s innovation system and discontinuity in India’s cooperation policy if any. It is contended here that due attention on the interactions between ‘national’ and ‘international’ innovation systems can no longer be ignored for evolving balanced S&T policies.(Please Puchase For Further Reading)

L88|Competition and Truth in the Market for News|"In this essay, we evaluate the case for competition in news markets from the perspective of economics. First, we consider the simple proposition that when more points of view are heard and defended, beliefs will converge to the truth. This concept of ""competition"" is several steps removed from market competition among actual media firms, but it has played a prominent role in the legal arguments for a free press. We then explore three mechanisms by which increasing competition, or more precisely increasing the number of independently-owned firms, can limit bias or distortions that originate on the supply-side of the media market: First, when governments attempt to manipulate news, competition can increase the likelihood that the media remain independent. Second, when news providers have an interest in manipulating consumers' beliefs, diversity in such incentives can reduce the risk of information being suppressed or distorted. Third, competition may drive firms to invest in providing timely and accurate coverage. Overall, we argue that there are robust reasons to expect competition to be effective in disciplining supply-side bias. Next, we ask how the effect of competition changes when distortions originate on the demand side of the market -- when consumers themselves demand biased or less socially relevant news. We find that increased competition may or may not improve welfare in these cases, though we caution against using this as a justification for concentrating media power in the hands of state-controlled or regulated firms."
L88|Gain or Pain: Does Consumer Activity Reflect Utility Maximisation?|Competition Authorities are introducing new informational remedies to help consumers search and switch more actively. Using a specially commissioned data set, and unique direct estimates of the gains, search and switching time which consumers anticipate, we examine the determinants of consumer activity in eight markets. We find that expected costs (and to some extent gains) do influence consumers as a utility maximising model would predict; but that their role is small, and other factors, particularly experience of switching in other markets, are also influential. We conclude that consumers’ confidence in their own estimates is crucial in encouraging market activity.
L88|Tourism as a driver of economic development: The Colombian experience|The current paper analyzes the importance and potentials of the tourism sector for economic development. It is divided into four major parts. After a short introduction, section two presents some theoretical insights into the topic of economic development. Commenting on the most relevant components of the catching-up theory by Abramovitz (1986) and the structural change theory by Baumol (1967) and others, it could be realized that growth and the accompanying structural changes in the distribution of employment and GDP have their sources in the sector industry. But at the moment of incorporating the demand side explanation of structural change, the service sectors offer growth potentials as well. Furthermore, the basic characteristics and importance of the tourism sector for economic development and employment are emphasized, examining the so-called 'social capabilities' and the innovation potential within the process of economic growth of any nation. A short survey of literature concerning the contribution of this sector to economic growth makes clear that tourism should be considered not just from the perspective of the benefits, but also from the costs associated with it. Section three provides an analysis of the economic impact of tourism in a developing country, namely Colombia, based on time-series analysis and data gathered supported on the 'Tourism Satellite Account' Methodology. Some relevant indicators produced by the World Economic Forum through its 'Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report', are also evaluated. Finally, some conclusions are drawn with respect to the potentialities, as well as the challenges identified for the Colombian case.

This paper attempts to find out the major constraints faced by the SMEs in Bangladesh selected from five sub-sectors using varimax normalization method based on primary questionnaire survey and rank the factor constraints according to their level of severity. It identified seven major factors comprised of 12 variables working as impediments to SME growth and development, amongst which high lending rate, government regulatory constraint, small domestic market size, collateral requirement for financing and lack of technically skilled workers are on the top.

L88|Competition and Participation in Religious Markets: Evidence from Victorian Scotland| In 1885, the largest churches in Scotland were engaged in a dispute about state funding. We use data generated in the course of that dispute to test two related hypotheses. First, as market size (proxied by population) increases, the competitiveness (or complexity) of the religious market structure will not decrease. Second, religious activity, as measured by giving per member, church income and participation, will not decrease as market competitiveness (or complexity) increases. Empirical evidence lends support to the first hypothesis, but casts doubt on the second, and the supply-side theories underpinning it, which posit a causal link between increased competitiveness (complexity) and higher levels of religious activity. In interpreting the results the importance of a rich understanding of institutional arrangements—particularly market structure, governance and financing—is underlined.

Or How to Design the Perfect Regional Tourist Board?|The principal scope of this paper is to reconstruct the chain-of-command that regards the implementation of a regional tourism development strategy, in particular the tourism marketing policy. Starting point of the analysis was the assumption that the quality of the governance of these organisations is one of the factors that may explain the success of a tourist destination. Thereto, an international comparative study into the role of the organizational structure, of organizing capacity and of governance on the effectiveness of tourism promotion and territorial marketing was organised. By comparing four different case studies, Catalunya (E), Rhone-Alpes (F), Scotland (UK) and Trentino (I), worst and best practices have been identified, and an answer to the question whether there exists such a thing as an ideally structured organisation that deals with territorial and tourism marketing at the regional level has been sought.

L88|Preliminary issues in preparing a national strategy regarding services|Without insisting on arguments brought in a different paper in favor of such an idea (Tachiciu and Popescu, 2007), here one should take as a premise the fact that for Romania it is not only possible, but also necessary to combine the catch-up process aiming at reducing the development gap, with a modernization process fostering a competitive knowledge based economy. The present article presents five challenges faced in designing a national strategy for services sector development in Romania: overcoming the weakness of our policy design capacity, assuming the development gap, understanding the long run competitive potential, managing the heterogeneity of the services sector and taking into account the cultural barriers.
L88|Recent trend of village and small enterprise sector: exploring and exploiting its opportunities in the North Eastern Region of India touching upon its profile and barriers|Development of village, micro and small enterprises in India has a special significance with regard to bridging up the disparities between urban and rural sectors of the economy on the one hand and the more industrialized and the less industrialized states on the other. It would also channelize to the mainstream the forces of development in the rural and remote areas presently strewn with the immense possibilities of manufacturing and service activities. Mahatma Gandhi had envisioned this long back, but Indian planners exhibited their preference to development of large-scale industries first. However, after having taken a step further to globalization and liberalization, India has recognized the relevance of small enterprises. Enactment of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 is an instance of the action taken in the wake of this recognition. The North Eastern Region (NER) of India comprises eight states: Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura, all well known for their handicrafts. The Schedule Tribes form the majority of population there. Most of these states are hilly and have remained agriculturally as well as industrially backward. Promotion of small enterprises is most suitable for their timely development. In this paper we present a statistically detailed profile of small enterprises in the NER. We explore the possibilities of development of the small enterprises sector and discuss the constraints on the same.
L88|Small Business Tenant Legislation in Australia: Does it Provide a Solution to Part of the UK Lease Reform Debate?|This paper addresses the commercial leases policy issue of how to deal with small business tenants. The UK has adopted a voluntary solution to commercial lease reform by using Codes of Practice which is in contrast to the legislative approach adopted by Australia to attempt to solve its perceived problems with small business retail tenancies. The major aim of the research was to examine the perceptions of the effectiveness of the legislation in Australia and discuss any implications for the UK policy debate but the results of the research also raise questions for the Australian regime. The research used a combination of literature and legislation review and a semi structured interview survey to investigate the policy aims and objectives of Australian Federal and State Governments, identify the nature and scope of the Australian legislation and examine perceptions of effectiveness of the legislation in informing small business tenants. The situation is complicated in Australia due to leases being a State rather than Federal responsibility therefore the main fieldwork was carried out in one case study State, Victoria. The paper concludes that some aspects of the Australian system can inform the UK policy debate including mandatory information provision at the commencement of negotiations and the use of lease registrars/commissioners. However, there are a number of issues that the Australian legislation does not appear to have successfully addressed including the difficulties of legislating across partial segments of the commercial property market and the collection of data for enforcement purposes.
L88|Liberalising Gambling Markets : Lessons from Network Industries?|This paper, based on my concluding remarks at the “Colloquium on the Economic Aspects of Gambling Regulation: EU and US Perspectives” held at Tilburg in November 2006, discusses the question why, in Europe, some service sectors (such as network industries) are liberalised, while others (like the gambling sector) are not. In both, the discussion appears to be one-sided. In the former, the focus is on consumer benefits, where in the latter, only the possible consumer harm associated with liberalisation is discussed. A proper balancing of costs and benefits can, and should, be subsumed under the ECJ’s proportionality test, as formulated in Gambelli. If this more economic approach is taken, the result might very well be less restrictive policy towards gambling and games of chance.
L88|Quantifying equilibrium network externalities in the ACH banking industry|We seek to estimate the causes and magnitudes of network externalities for the automated clearinghouse (ACH) electronic payments system, using a panel data set on individual bank usage of ACH. We construct an equilibrium model of consumer and bank adoption of ACH in the presence of a network. The model identifies network externalities from correlations of changes in usage levels for banks within a network, from changes in usage following changes in market concentration or sizes of competitors and from adoption decisions of banks outside the network with small branches in the network, and can separately identify consumer and bank network effects. We structurally estimate the parameters of the model by matching equilibrium behavior to the data, using simulated maximum likelihood and a data set of localized networks, and use a bootstrap to recover confidence intervals. The parameters are estimated with high precision and fit various moments of the data reasonably well. We find that most of the impediment to ACH adoption is due to large consumer fixed costs of adoption. The deadweight loss from the network externality is moderate: the optimal number of ACH transactions is about 16% higher than the equilibrium level.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

In this context of evolutionary intellectual property rights, the markets of the agricultural genetic resources are based on goods and services related to the management of agro biodiversity. The markets related to the genetic resources will depend on the way in which the actors will jointly reach: technologies; biological and genetic material; information and knowledge as well on the material as on technologies; agricultural markets that it is on a local, national, regional or world level.

L88|Une analyse économique de la protection contractuelle des bases de données|What is the best protection, from an economic point of view, for the investments in databases? This is the general question addressed in this article. In particular, one asks whether a database producer can, and should, use contractual arrangements to obtain an additional protection on top of the protection already given by IP law. Combining an economic and a legal approach, the article examines to which extent IP law and contract law are complements or substitutes, and how they should be combined so as to promote the optimal level of investment in database creation.

L88|Les DRMs : entre protection légale et protection technique des biens culturels à l'ère numérique|The protection offered by the exclusive copyright is based on two distinct and complementary pillars: legal protection and technical protection through private measures. Copyright law in the digital environment has modified the balance of this system by putting in place a legal protection of the technical measures of protection. What is the economic rationale behind this modification? What are the consequences on the organization of cultural industries? The article addresses these two questions.

L88|Évolution du marché de la musique préenregistrée à l'ère numérique|The article examines to which extent downloading on peer-to-peer (P2P) networks is responsible for the crisis in the music industry. Using the most recent empirical studies, the goal is to estimate the relevance of the two contrasting explanations usually put forward. On the one hand, it is claimed that P2P networks induce piracy and, thereby, reduce the consumption of legal music. On the other hand, it is also argued that P2P networks allow their users to sample a larger and new musical supply, which tends to increase the demand for legal music.

L88|Services-Led Industrialization in India: Assessment and Lessons|This paper provides an integrated analysis of the role of the service sector in recent Indian economic development. It discusses the nature of services, their distinction from products, and their categorization. It provides an overview of India’s overall growth experience, and a detailed examination of the contribution of the service sector to growth. It includes an examination of the potential for spillovers from IT, ITES and other service sectors such as financial services, to the rest of the economy, drawing on econometric work, as well as input-output analysis of linkages to understand these possible spillovers and growth potentials. Based on this evidence, it appears that India’s manufacturing sector development may have been constrained in part by weaknesses in key service sectors such as transportation and electricity. The paper also considers the particular role of international trade in services, which is of growing importance. It discusses the consequences for employment of different growth paths, the challenges of education and manpower training to support and sustain India’s development path, and social and environmental issues, including regional inequality issues. The Indian experience is related to recent discussions of industrial policy, and development policy more generally.
L88|Media industry facing biggest upheaval since Gutenberg. Media consumers morphing into media makers|The advance of innovative information and communication technologies has triggered a fundamental upheaval in the media industry. The technology is reforming the conventional media model. The media mix will become more varied; interactive and personalised offers are taking root and finding their ideal milieu on the web. Newspapers, radio stations and TV broadcasters will have to reposition themselves if they want to remain attractive in the media industry with the arrival of the Web 2.0. This will include seeking new distribution channels and considering e.g. pay-per-view programming and innovative forms of advertising.
L88|Bundles and Range Strategies: The Case of Telecom Operators|"Against a background of competition and the generalisation of IP that characterises the field of electronic communications, the concept of the ""bundle"" has resulted in the emergence of ""triple play"", and even ""quadruple play."" This paper offers an overview of the growth of this phenomenon by introducing a distinction between the basic components of multiplay strategies and the diverse range of functions that can be linked to these strategies."
L88|Triple Play Time|Abstract: Digital convergence thrusts telephony, television and the internet into the socalled 'triple play' offerings, creating new forms of rivalry between cable operators and telephone companies. Markets participants feel compelled to enter new industries to survive, even though their core competencies are limited to their primary market. The outcome of triple play competition is likely to depend on the speed of the development of new technologies and the adaptation of the regulatory environment. In the short run, telephone companies will enjoy an advantage attributable to switching costs. However, this advantage will erode as younger subscribers switch to telephony on the internet.
L88|Neighborhood Effects on Barriers to Employment: Results From a Randomized Housing Mobility Experiment in Baltimore|The Moving To Opportunity randomized housing voucher demonstration finds virtually no significant effects on employment or earnings of adults. Using qualitative data from in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 67 participants in Baltimore, we find that although the voucher and control groups have similar rates of employment and earnings, respondents' relationship to the labor market does differ by program group. Our analysis suggests that the voucher group did not experience employment or earnings gains in part because of human capital barriers that existed prior to moving to a low-poverty neighborhood. In addition, employed respondents in all groups were heavily concentrated in retail and health care jobs. To secure or maintain employment, they relied heavily on a particular job search strategy - informal referrals from similarly skilled and credentialed acquaintances who already held jobs in these sectors. Though experimentals were more likely to have employed neighbors, few of their neighbors held jobs in these sectors and could not provide such referrals. Thus controls had an easier time garnering such referrals. Additionally, the configuration of the metropolitan area's public transportation routes in relationship to the locations of hospitals, nursing homes, and malls posed additional transportation challenges to experimentals as they searched for employment - challenges controls were less likely to face.
L88|¿La política industrial de cluster/redes mejora realmente la competitividad empresarial? Resultados de la evaluación de dos experiencias en la Comunidad Autónoma de Euskadi|Driven in part by the desire to maximize the use of public resources in policy assistance, interest in developing and testing new methodological approaches to evaluate such industrial policies has been steadily rising. This interest is even higher in policies devised through clusters and networks where, in general, there has been a lack of evaluation, mainly because of the difficulties in defining the object to be evaluated. We will contrast our method in two cases: the first one is a cluster association in the Basque Country, the second case is Ezagutza Gunea, for qualification and knowledge management integrated by seventeen agents and launched by the municipalities of Azkoitia and Azpeitia.

Bu nedenle, Ulusal Programda da belirtildiği gibi, Türk posta mevzuatı yeniden yapılandırılarak AB direktifleri ile uyumlaştırılmalıdır.
L88|I contributi dello Stato all'attività di ricerca e sviluppo delle imprese<BR>[Public grants for the firms' R&D activities]|In the Lisbon strategy, Member States committed to making structural reforms to their economies. Within this context, the European Council called for R&D investment to approach 3% of GDP by 2010, of which 2% should come from private sector. At the moment, in Italy R&D investment represents 1,2% of GDP, of which about 50% comes from the private sector. In Italy, public support to the private R&D's activities is basically built on fundings' allocation from the public sector to the private firms. The two main funds to this purpose are the FAR (fondo per le Agevolazioni alla Ricerca) and the FIT (Fondo per l'Innovazione Tecnologica). The aim of this paper is to analyze teh italian institutional and economic framework of the public incentives to the private R&D activity. Forst of all, the institutional framework is depicted (beneficiaries, typological classification of public fundings, allocation's rules). Using data from the Ministry of Productive Activities, the Italian Association for the Industrial Research and the national Accounts Department, the trend of the fundings allocations is the time span 1985-2002 is depicted. The analysis in terms of demand and supply of funds shows a relevant excess of the demand and a greater flow of resources towards big enterprises. The sector-based distribution of funding is analyzed calculating an index of funding concentration. While the FIT presents a quite uniform distribution (except for transports and communications), the FAR is characterized by a greater sector-based concentration.Finally, the analysis of the effects of public spending on the private R&D expenditure shows that further support more incentive-based is needed such as, for example, tax credit.
L88|Postal Reform|This essay examines the published views of vital economists regarding postal reform. I define a vital economist as one who has produced scholarly research on this issue, and who has expressed an opinion about the direction reform should take. The ten vital economists surveyed here express surprisingly similar opinions on the proper direction for postal reform. The vast majority advocate some combination of privatization and elimination or relaxation of the delivery monopoly. Those opinions are in stark contrast to the published views of economists who have not carefully examined this issue.
L88|Order Flow and the Formation of Dealer Bids: An Analysis of Information and Strategic Behavior in the Government of Canada Securities Auctions|"Using data on Government of Canada securities auctions, this paper shows that in countries where direct access to primary issuance is restricted to government securities dealers, Order-flow"" information is a key source of private information for these security dealers. Order-flow information is revealed to a security dealer through his interactions with customers, who can place bids in the auctions only through the security dealer. Since each dealer interacts with a different set of customers, they, in effect, see different portions of the market demand and supply curves, leading to differing private inferences of where the equilibrium price might."

The paper focuses on three aspects: 1) the increase in the quantum and variety of the production versus the evolution of the cultivated area and the agricultural productivity analysis; 2) the structure of the sector, in terms of size and land tenure, throughout the country and in the agricultural zone, 3) the public policies towards the sector: the failure of a comprehensive land reform promoted by the batllismo and the promotion of technological innovation, specific credit and support to improve the market conditions.

L88|Política de comercio interior. Balance para una década|The domestic trade is a basic sector in the economic and social performance of the different countries. Its own dynamics has been, during the past years, the exponent of the Basque Country evolution. Although the analysis of its data does not result encouraging, the accumulated experience should help us to reorganiza our commercial structures, facing a pressing, future. Our commercial firms should be endowed with enough flexibility to confront the present decade, when the market of the Basque Autonomous Community, among others, lose its domestic condition, at least in the present terms.
L88|Inflation as Prisoner's Dilemma: The Case for Mandatory Wage-Price Controls|Behavior toward uncertain future inflation gives rise to large diffuse externalities which result in market failure and require introduction of legal restraints -- mandatory wage-price controls. Models of wage-profit conflict and consumer vs. consumer rivalry are set out in which individual rationality leads to collective ruin (the so-called Prisoner's Dilemma). Evidence from national sample surveys indicates broad-based support for controls, and suggests some people do perceive the externalities generated by inflation.

L88|Sports Retailinf in India: Opportunities, Constraints and Way Forward|Sports retail is a small but fast growing segment of modern retail in India. Recently, thecountry has been hosting many international sports and this has given a boost to thissector. Many foreign and domestic corporate retailers have entered sports retail. Sportsgoods manufacturing is a focus area in the Foreign Trade Policy (2009-2014) and thegovernment is taking a fresh look at the current foreign direct investment policy inretail.In the above context, this paper provides an overview of the sports retail sector in India.Specifically, it presents the different retail formats, consumer profile, retailers’ supplychain and sourcing. It also examines the retail and sports policies and their implicationsfor this segment of retail, analyses the barriers faced by this sector and suggests policyreforms.The study found that the policy of allowing 51 per cent FDI in the single-brand formathas not benefited this sector. The FDI ban on multi-brand retail is not an entry barriersince foreign retailers can establish their presence in India through other routes. Thestudy found that since this is a niche segment of retail, FDI would not have an adverseimpact on traditional retailers. It concludes that government should allow 51 per centFDI in multi-brand sports retail. This will increase sourcing from India, lead todiffusion of technology, proliferation of brands, investment in sports and sportspromotion, among others.
L88|Addressing New Service Sector in WTO/FATs: Express Delivery and India|The service sector is evolving. New services and new modes of delivering existingservices have increased the complexities of services negotiations in the WTO and inFTAs.The WTO negotiations focus on market access but FTAs tend to go beyond marketaccess to seeking regulatory commitments from trading partners. India is a proponentof services liberalisation both in the WTO and through bilateral/regional agreements.In this context, this paper examines how new service sectors like express deliveryservices (EDS) are addressed in WTO/FTAs and its implications for India.Express delivery services are one of the fastest growing sectors in India. It plays acrucial role in trade facilitation and in enhancing the global competitiveness of Indianindustries. At present, there are no FDI restrictions and the country can undertakemarket access commitments in WTO and in its FTAs. The proponents of liberalisationof express delivery services also seek commitments in complementary services liketransport and warehousing. The study found that since the autonomous liberalisationis more than India’s offers in the Doha Round of the WTO negotiations, India is in aposition to broaden its commitments in the WTO.One of the core issues for India is that domestic regulation of postal services isevolving. India Post offers courier/EDS services. The Department of Posts is in theprocess of framing a new regulation that is likely to affect the courier/EDS industry.Based on a primary survey, this study found that the regulation should be transparentand fair; it should clearly define the reserved area and distinguish between UniversalService Obligation (USO) and competitive services. It should also mention how theUSO will be funded. The regulation should encompass global best practices likeremoval of cross-subsidisation and should facilitate competition. The need for a postalregulatory regime will arise if the public postal service provider is privatised. The regulator should be independent. The objective of the new regulation should be to laydown a reform path for India Post and the primary role of the regulator should be tomonitor the USO.
