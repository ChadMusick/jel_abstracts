Q13|Les performances économiques de l’élevage européen : de la « compétitivité coût » à la « compétitivité hors coût »|"The European Union (EU) has, since a long time, an important role in the international livestock industry chains, both in terms of production and trade. In spite of a strong restructuring movement, mainly due to factor productivity gains, European livestock brings together farms that are still very heterogeneous in terms of productive combinations, size, social structuring, intensification and economic performance. To report on it, and based on data issued from the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN), an analysis of the diversity of structural and economic situations is conducted for farms specializing in the production of milk, beef and pigs/poultry, for the ten most productive EU Member States in animal production. This stage is a necessary prerequisite for reflection which begins after on the main levers of the economic performance of European animal productions. Two types of levers are then distinguished. The first concerns ""cost competitiveness"". It successively discusses the substitutions between factors of production, the economies of scale, the geographical concentration of production, the structuring of sectors and the influence of agricultural policies. The second concerns « non-cost competitiveness ». It deals with the sanitary quality of animal productions, the differentiation of products and production processes, and the conditions for the capturing of added value induced by producers."
Q13|L’internationalisation des marchés en productions animales|[paper in French] Animal production accounts for 16% of international agri-food trade. The growing imbalance between supply and demand for animal products in Asian countries, where consumption is growing, particularly in China, stimulates trade for the benefit of the major exporting countries: the European Union (EU), the United States, New Zealand, Brazil and Australia. While this development offers trade opportunities for countries with a structural surplus, purchases fluctuate from year to year and price competition is very strong, despite the qualitative requirements of some countries. The EU, which has a positive trade balance in dairy products and pork, but a negative one (in monetary terms) in beef and poultry meat, is the world's largest exporter of animal products (with 22% of the extra-EU trade in 2016). This article analyses the evolution of trade in animal products using customs statistics data (BACI and COMEXT) from 2000 to 2016. It presents the evolution of international trade for different types of goods (dairy products, beef, pork, poultry meat) and highlights the trade trajectories (patterns) of the main net importing countries (China, Japan and Russia) and net exporting countries (India, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, the United States and the EU).
Q13|AGMEMOD outlook for agricultural and food markets in EU member states 2018-2030|Policy, administration and industry need medium-term projections of the expected developments in the agri-food markets for their decision-making processes. The EU Commission presents such projections for the EU as a whole in December of each year. Those projections and their assumptions regarding policy and macroeconomic developments are depicted to the level of individual EU Member States with the exception of Luxembourg, which is included in the figures of Belgium, by applying the partial equilibrium model AGMEMOD. The working paper briefly describes the approach to establish projections for the EU Member States. The projections cover the markets of main agricultural products, in particular for cereals and oilseeds (rapeseed and sunflower seed), livestock (cattle, pigs, goats and sheep), meat (beef, pork, and poultry), milk and dairy products (drinking milk, butter, cheese, skimmed milk powder, whole milk and semi-skimmed milk powder). The outcomes comprise items like areas, livestock numbers, yields, production, trade and use, as well as prices. The individual projection results are displayed in tables.
Q13|Demand and supply of infrequent payments as a commitment device: evidence from Kenya|Despite extensive evidence that preferences are often time-inconsistent, there is only scarce evidence of willingness to pay for commitment. Infrequent payments for frequently provided goods and services are a common feature of many markets and they may naturally provide commitment to save for lumpy expenses. Multiple experiments in the Kenyan dairy sector show that: (i) farmers are willing to incur sizable costs to receive infrequent payments as a commitment device, (ii) poor contract enforcement, however, limits competition among buyers in the supply of infrequent payments. We then present a model of demand and supply of infrequent payments and test its additional predictions.
Q13|Agriculture in 2018: decline or growth?|Over recent years, agriculture – if we choose to look at available data prior to their adjustment based on the results of the All-Russia Agricultural Census – has been growing at a sufficiently high rate: in 2013 – by 5.8 percent, in 2014 – by 3.5, in 2015 – by 2.6, in 2016 – by 4.8, and in 2017 – by 2.5 percent3. Overall, growth over the course of 5 years amounted to 20.7 percent. Based on Rosstat’s current statistics, managers on both the federal and regional levels describe the development pattern of the agroindustrial complex (AIC) as a breakthrough and a leap forward. We likewise mentioned this fact in our overviews released over several previous years2. However, in 2018, there were some problems involved in the estimation of the growth rate both for 2018 and for the previous years.
Q13|A flexible approach to age dependence in organizational mortality. Comparing the life duration for cooperative and non-cooperative enterprises using a Bayesian Generalized Additive Discrete Time Survival Model|This paper proposes a new estimation model to capture the complex effect of age on organization survival. Testing various theoretical propositions on organizational mortality, we study the survival of French agricultural cooperatives in comparison with other firms with which they compete. The relationship between age and mortality in organizations is analyzed using a Bayesian Generalized discrete-time semi-parametric hazard model with correlated random effects, incorporating unobserved heterogeneity and isolating the various effects of time. This analysis emphasizes the specificity of the temporal dynamics of cooperatives in relation to their special role in agriculture.
Q13|Agrarian distress in India: Possible solutions|Agrarian distress in India, built-up over time, has further deteriorated recently. At the height of the farm output, Indian farmers are a disappointed lot. Despite spectacular rise in agricultural production, they continue to languish in poverty. The underlying reasons for agrarian distress in India are: a) unviable agriculture; b) ineffective Minimum Support Prices (MSP) system; c) adverse terms of trade; d) rural indebtedness; and e) inefficient value chain in agriculture. There is a need to provide medium term solutions to the problem so that sub-optimal solution like loan waiver can be avoided. Among available solutions, government procurement operation covering all major crops may not be feasible, while price-hedging mechanism through derivative instruments like forward/future trading in farm products is yet to be popular among farmers. There is a great potential to protect farmers from distress sale through a composite insurance scheme, which can cover risks arising out of both crop failure and market failure. The value chain of agricultural products needs to be completely revamped to integrate farmers directly to the ultimate consumers. Long-term solution of the agrarian distress lies in improving farm productivity by a series of measures like mass irrigation programme through inter-linking of rivers, diversification of agriculture, smart farming by using latest technology. A scheme of exit route for distress farmers may go a long way in alleviating the situation.
Q13|Value Chain Development as Public Policy: Conceptualization and Evidence from the Agri-Food Sector in Bangladesh|Value chain development (VCD) has become a popular policy instrument to help farmers in developing countries access markets. While VCD initiated by the private sector has received much attention in the literature, there is yet little research on public-led VCD. This paper provides a conceptualization of public-led VCD and discusses in what context it can be a relevant policy instrument. As an illustration, the paper then describes the project “SAFAL”, which directly intervenes in the aquaculture, horticulture, and dairy sector of South-West Bangladesh. Using a matched difference-in-difference methodology, it is estimated that SAFAL increased farmers’ output market participation, food production, and smallholder welfare, and reduced the number of days in which participating households were food insecure.
Q13|Consumers’ Perception of Food Safety Risk From Vegetables: A Rural - Urban Comparison|Rapid urbanization brings challenges to managing food safety in Vietnam. Today, consumers pay more attention to the safety of food, particularly vegetables. This paper investigates the impact of consumer perception of food safety risk on self-reported vegetable consumption and then compares the determinants of risk perception between the rural and the urban region. We conducted a survey and observe a decline in self-reported vegetable consumption as a consequence of heightened risk perception among residents in the Hanoi area. The differences, as well as the similarities in the underlying drivers of risk perception, were identified across regions. In both regions, information about food incidents and perceived consequence of hazards associated with vegetables shaped risk perception of vegetables. Respondents’ age, education, and trust in food retailers at wet markets determined risk perception in the rural area, but not in the urban region. Personal experience with vegetable poisoning, whether the household was growing vegetables, perceived control over hazards, and trust in responsible institutions only influenced risk perception in the urban region. We suggest that these spatial disparities in behaviours should be taken into account in designing and implementing risk communication programs and food safety policies in Vietnam.
Q13|Cheap Talk and Coordination in the Lab and in the Field: Collective Commercialization in Senegal|Coordination is central to social interactions. Theory and conventional lab experiments suggest that cheap talk/communication can enhance coordination under certain conditions. Two aspects that remain underexplored are (1) the interaction between the number of players (group size) and communication and (2) how existing findings might play out in the field. We address both of these by studying a typical naturally-occurring setting that requires coordination; that is, one where members of agricultural cooperatives seek to jointly sell their output. Combining artefactual/lab-in-the-field experiments (LFEs), natural field experiments (RCTs), surveys, and cooperative records, we find that (1) revealing farmers' intended sales (i.e., cheap talk/communication) yields enhanced collective commercialization (i.e., coordination), particularly in larger groups; (2) such cheap talk may lead to higher incomes for small-scale farmers; (3) participants transfer learning from the LFEs thus affecting subsequent behavior in the RCTs (i.e., the day-to-day environment). Our results contribute to existing literature by highlighting the potential for cheap-talk institutions to (1) boost coordination, particularly in settings with greater strategic uncertainty (e.g., larger farmer cooperatives), and (2) promote collective entrepreneurship and development.
Q13|Digital Opportunities for Trade in the Agriculture and Food Sectors|How are new opportunities to create and share information shaping the digital transformation of the agriculture and food system, and thus potentially fostering its reorganisation? This report focuses on cross-border trade aspects along the global agriculture and food value chain, and looks at how changes brought about by digital technologies can influence who participates in the value chain, where value added is created, and how value is distributed between actors in the chain. However, it is not only changes in the agriculture and food sector from digital technologies that matters, but also the digital transformation of other actors in the global value chain (GVC) such as support services, logistics and governments. Digital technologies present a potential to reduce trade and transaction costs, including those related to identifying and negotiating a deal, proving compliance with standards and to delivering products across borders quickly and efficiently.
Q13|Market Power and Spatial Competition in Rural India|In this paper, I argue that market power of intermediaries plays an important role in contributing to low incomes of farmers in India. I study the role of spatial competition between intermediaries in determining the prices that farmers receive in India by focusing on a law that restricts farmers to selling their goods to intermediaries in their own state. I show that the discontinuities in market power generated by the law translate into discontinuities in prices. Increasing spatial competition by one standard deviation causes prices received by farmers to increase by 6.4%. To shed light on spatial and aggregate implications, I propose and estimate a quantitative spatial model of bargaining and trade. Using this structural model, I estimate that the removal of the interstate trade restriction in India would increase competition between intermediaries substantially, thereby increasing the prices farmers receive and their output. Estimates suggest that average farmer prices and output would increase by at least 11% and 7% respectively. The value of the national crop output would therefore increase by at least 18%.
Q13|Competition and Relational Contracts in the Rwanda Coffee Chain|How does competition affect market outcomes when formal contracts are not enforceable, and parties' resort to relational contracts? Difficulties with measuring relational contracts and dealing with the endogeneity of competition have frustrated attempts to answer this question. We make progress by studying relational contracts between upstream farmers and downstream mills in Rwanda's coffee industry. First, we identify salient dimensions of their relational contracts (unenforceable provision of services in both directions before, during and after harvest) and measure them through an original survey of mills and farmers. Second, we take advantage of an engineering model for the optimal placement of mills to construct an instrument that isolates geographically determined variation in competition. Conditional on the suitability for mills within the catchment area, we find that mills surrounded by more suitable areas: (i) face more competition from other mills; (ii) use fewer relational contracts with farmers; and (iii) exhibit worse performance. In contrast to conventional wisdom, an additional competing mill also (iv) makes farmers worse off; (v) reduces the aggregate quantity of coffee supplied to mills by farmers; and (vi) conditional on the farmer's distance from the mill, lowers relational contracts more for farmers close to the competing mill, suggesting that competition directly alters farmers temptation to renege on the relational contract. The finding that increased competition downstream leaves all producers -- including upstream producers -- no better-off suggests a potential role for policy in a second-best environment in which contracts are hard to enforce.
Q13|Buyer-Driven Upgrading in GVCs: The Sustainable Quality Program in Colombia|This paper studies the Sustainable Quality Program in Colombia - a quality upgrading program implemented on behalf of a multinational coffee buyer. The Program is a bundle of contractual arrangements involving farmers, intermediaries, exporters and the multinational buyer. We tackle three questions. First, we investigate the impact of the Program on the supply of quality coffee. Eligible farmers upgraded their plantations, expanded land under coffee cultivation, increased quality and received higher farm gate prices. Second, we quantify how the Program gains are shared between farmers and intermediaries along the chain. In regions in which the Program was rolled out surplus along the chain increased by 30%. Eligible farmers kept at least half of the gains and their welfare increased by 20%. Finally, we examine how the Program works conducting counterfactual exercises and comparing the Program price premia along the chain against two prominent non-buyer driven certifications. The Program achieved a better transmission of the export gate price premium for quality to the farm gate and curbed market failures that stifled quality upgrading. Contractual arrangements at the export gate significantly contributed to higher farmers welfare in rural areas.
Q13|New Trends in the Social and Solidarity Economy Regarding Agriculture and Food: A Comparison between France and India|On the question of food and livelihood, international institutions and States call for efforts towards food security under the form of help in subsidies or better access to the market for farmers. Such efforts rely on large scale solutions and make food security depend on tall vertical institutions aiming at bringing change in a very large area at a time. On the other hand, small initiatives are born everywhere and take up on the question of access to healthy sustainable food. Farmers’ self-help groups, shared gardens, community supported agriculture, cooperative supermarket and other organisations make up this landscape and are being born everywhere. Such initiatives are often missed by observers as case studies of single organisations can not bring into light the global effort of such initiatives. Nevertheless, they can be put together and showed as being part of the same global movement. If their juridic forms, organisations, and goals are somewhat different, some trends can be established in the justification they offer to their action (Boltanski, Thévenot, 1991). In order to discover these justifications and establish trends, a study of the discourse and practices of such initiatives is offered in the following article. Namely, our study takes 20 initiatives dealing with agriculture and food. In order to find out trends, this article elaborates on the fieldwork of about 500 hours spent within said initiatives, and 50 interviews with project planners, coordinators, and motnitors. In order to show global trends, these initiatives have been chosen in two vastly different social and economic contexts: one takes place in Nancy, a medium French town, the other takes place in Ahmedabad, a very large Indian city. The results of the study show three major common trends between France and India, and between initiatives pertaining with small farmers, shared gardens, cooperatives and other social and solidarity initiatives. Firstly, there is a general call for localized, short food circuits, namely producers and consumers ask for a direct connection to each other, and even to grow the food they eat and eat the food they grow. Secondly, participants in said initiatives do not claim to be part of a recent innovative wave, but rather fall back on traditional ways to grow, sell, and cook food. Thirdly, despite the small size of such initiatives – with 200 participants at most and sometimes as small as 2 members – the ambition of these organisations is to change things on a global scale, make people from every path of life ask themselves questions and change their behaviour, and even, struggle against global climate change through small localized actions.
Q13|Оценка На Устойчивостта На Българското Селско Стопанство<BR>[Sustainability Level of Bulgarian Agriculture]|This paper assesses the integral, governance, economic, social and environmental sustainability of Bulgarian agriculture. On the base official aggravate (statistical, etc.) and survey data approbation is made of elaborated holistic framework and evaluated sustainability level at different levels - national, sub sector, region, (agro)ecosystems, and farm. Website of the project: https://zem.alle.bg
Q13|Устойчивост На Селското Стопанство В България<BR>[Sustainability of Bulgarian agriculture]|"This paper gives answer to topical and debated research and practical questions at the current stage of development of Bulgarian agriculture - „what is sustainability of agriculture"", „how to assess sustainability of agricultural in the conditions of EU CAP implementation in the country“, and „which are critical factors for improvement of socio-economic and environmental sustainability in the sector“. Evolution of the „concept“ of agrarian sustainability and the major approached for its assessment are discussed More precise definition of sustainability of Bulgarian agriculture is suggested and the requirements for the system of its assessment are characterised. For the first time a new „governance“ pillar of agrarian sustainability is included along with the universally accepted economic, social and environmental pillars (aspects). Practically applicable for the specific conditions of Bulgarian agriculture holistic framework for assessing sustainability level of agrarian systems of different types (sector, sub-sector, region, ecosystem, agricultural farm) is suggested. The later included 25 principles, 66 criteria, and 163 indicators and reference values for assessing integral, governance, economic, social and environmental sustainability as well as approach for their calculation, integration and interpretation. Approbation of the elaborated framework in assessment of agrarian sustainability at various levels (national, sub-sector, region, (agro)ecosystem, and farm) is made on the base of official statistical, etc, information and original farm surveys. Critical factors for improving sustainability of Bulgarian agriculture are identified, and recommendation made for amelioration of research and assessment practices, public policies and farming strategies for sustainable development.

Q13|Multilevel assessment of agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria|The goal of this study is to unpack sustainability in terms of understanding and evaluation using as a case Bulgarian agriculture. A hierarchical system for assessing agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria at national, regional, sub-sectoral, ecosystem and farm level is proposed. It includes 3 aspects(pillars), 17 principles, 35 criteria, and 46 indicators and reference values for evaluating sustainability as well as approach for their integration and interpretation. Assessment is made of agrarian sustainability in the country at various level using aggregate macro and farm level micro data. The assessment has found out that there is a considerable differentiation in the level of integral and aspects sustainability of different type of farms, ecosystems, subsectors and regions. Nevertheless, results on the integral agrarian sustainability based on macro aggregate and micro farm data are quite similar. The later indicates that both approaches are reliable and could be simultaneously used according to the level of analysis, needs of decision makers, and available data. Major factors encouraging improving economic sustainability are market demand and price; direct state subsidies; market competition; financial capability; participation in public support programs; possibility of benefitting immediately; possibility of benefitting in the near future; tax preferences; possibility of benefitting in the long term; and integration with buyers of farm products. Main factors encouraging the enhancement of social sustainability are personal convictions and satisfaction; social recognition of individual contribution; immediate benefits for other people and groups; regional community initiatives and pressure; access to advisory services; European Union policy; and existing regional problems and risks. Important factors encouraging environmental sustainability are problems and risks existing at the global scale; official regulations, standards, and norms; existing regional problems and risks; and European Union policies. Public policies and instruments that improve economic sustainability of Bulgarian agriculture include: direct area-based payments; national top-ups for products and livestock; modernization of agricultural holdings; green payments; support for semi-market farms. At the same time the impact of national and European policies on social and environmental sustainability is relatively weak. Having in mind the importance of holistic assessments of this kind for improving agrarian sustainability, farm management and agrarian policies, they are to be expended and their precision and representation increased. The latter requires a closer cooperation between and participation of all interested parties as well as improvement of the precision through enlargement of collected statistical data, number of surveyed farms, and incorporating more “objective” data from field tests and surveys, monitoring, expertise of professionals in the area, etc.
Q13|Sustainability of agricultural sub-sectors in Bulgaria|In Bulgaria, like in most countries, the comprehensive assessments on agrarian sustainability are mostly at sectoral or farm levels while there is practically no in-depth study on sustainability at sub-sector (industry) level. This paper tries to fill the gap and assess the sustainability of different sub-sectors in Bulgarian agriculture. First a holistic hierarchical framework for assessing integral, economic, social and ecological sustainability of Bulgarian agriculture is suggested including 17 principles, 35 criteria, and 46 indicators and reference values. After that, an assessment is made on the overall and aspects sustainability of major crop, livestock and mixed subsectors of Bulgarian agriculture. The assessment is based on first-hand information collected though in-depth interviews with the managers of “typical” farms in analysed industries. The study has found out that there is a considerable differentiation in the level of integral and aspects sustainability in individual sub-sectors in Bulgaria, with mixed livestock-breeding, mixed crop-growing, and perennial crops sub-sectors having the highest integral sustainability, while pigs, poultry and rabbits; vegetables, flowers and mushrooms, and mixed livestock-crops subsectors the lowest one. There are also substantial variations in the levels of economic, social and ecological sustainability of different agricultural sub-sectors and individual indicators with the highest and lowest values showing (critical) factors enhancing and deterring particular or overall sustainability of evaluated agro-industries. Results on the integral agrarian sustainability level of this study based on the micro sub-sector (farm) data are similar to the previous assessment based on the aggregate sectoral (statistical, etc.) data.
Q13|Confidence and loyalty for agrotourism brands: The Lesvos paradigm|It has been established that strong brands are important in the agrotourism industry. Agrotourism brands provide the link between visitors and the agrotourism firms and tourists may or may not develop a degree of loyalty to relevant brands. The present study suggests that confidence in an agrotourism brand has high influence in development of brand loyalty. Based on hypotheses developed, confidence in an agrotourism brand is influenced by brand characteristics, agrotourism company characteristics and visitor characteristics. The present survey took place in Greece and examined the attitudes of visitors in agrotourism firms at the island of Lesvos. Survey results demonstrate that agrotourism firm brand characteristics appear more important in their impact on a visitor’s confidence in a brand. It was also established that confidence in a brand is positively influencing loyalty. Recommendations are developed for agrotourism marketers in relation to building and maintaining visitor confidence in a brand.
Q13|Complex assessment of Ukrainian agroholdings’ economic security|Retrospective diagnostics of main financial results of activity (profit, earnings and yield of shares); business capital, market capitalization, EBITDA, operating margin and net profit margin, P / E, ROA, ROE, ROC as of 2018 and an average of 5 years; Consideration of Montier C-Score and Piotroski F-Score indicators on financial issues of companies; liquidity of the balance of agroholdings on the criterion of the ratio of assets and liabilities; the coefficient analysis of enterprises and the diagnosis of bankruptcy probabilities using models of multiple discriminant analysis (MDA model), logistic regression (Logit-model) and rating methods (Beaver's indicators and definition of the class of the potential beneficiary of the investment prokect) helped to formulate a generalized conclusion on the probability of bankruptcy according to models and a general assessment of the financial condition of agricultural companies. Based on the analysis, it has been determined that, according to all methods of the agroholding, the sample collectively generates a series from the highest to the lowest: MHP / Kernel, IMC, Agroton and Avangard. In view of this, it is necessary to formulate and continuously improve integrated risk management systems (integrated systems of enterprise economic security), rather than separate procedures at the level of different departments of the company.
Q13|Комплексне Оцінювання Економічної Безпеки Агрохолдингів України<BR>[Complex assessment of Ukrainian agroholdings’ economic security]|У статті на основі даних фінансової звітності, консолідованої інформації на сайтах фондових бірж тощо здійснено аналіз фінансового стану 5 агрохолдингів України. Проведено оцінювання фінансових показників та діагностику стану системи економічної безпеки холдингового підприємства агробізнесу (за МСФЗ та НПСБО) за 5 параметрами: загальний фінансовий стан, основні індикатори, ліквідність балансу, коефіцієнтний аналіз, ймовірність банкрутства. Проблема. У контексті забезпечення національної безпеки поряд з її політичною та воєнною важливими складовими частинами є економічна та продовольча. Агросектор України, маючи унікальні ресурси, разом з розвитком інноваційних інформаційних технологій в змозі забезпечити якісне економічне зростання країни. В Україні найбільшими та найвпливовішими представниками агросектору є аграрні холдинги. Тому необхідним є оцінювання стану економічної безпеки цих економічних суб’єктів. Утім, у цій предметній області є ряд проблемних моментів: серед дослідників відсутня єдність поглядів на широке коло питань економічної безпеки, існує брак досліджень про систему економічної безпеки підприємств конкретних галузей (зокрема аграрної), не сформовано єдиної методики щодо оцінювання стану економічної безпеки суб’єктів господарювання, агрохолдинги практично не вивчаються в контексті економічної безпеки. У зв’язку з цим, актуалізується вироблення вітчизняних напрацювань, прилаштованих до умов сучасної української економіки. Мета статті – здійснити комплексний аналіз економічної безпеки агрохолдингів України у рамках розробки теоретико-методичного базису й обґрунтування практичних рекомендацій щодо вдосконалення систем економічної безпеки агрохолдингів в Україні та визначення головних напрямів інноваційного розвитку цих систем. Методи дослідження. Економічний та фінансовий аналіз, коефіцієнтний метод, методи комплексної оцінки (для оцінювання економічної безпеки та фінансового стану досліджуваних агрокомпаній); табличний та графічний (діаграми) – для візуалізації результатів дослідження та систематизації статистичних даних. Результати. Коефіцієнти використано для оцінювання фінансового стану і банкрутства як найнадійніші і найважливіші показники – найбільші проблеми агрохолдингів в останні роки були саме з фінансового складника системи економічної безпеки підприємства. Для подальшого аналізу обрано 5 агрокорпорацій: Авангард, Агротон, ІМК, Кернел, МХП. Критеріями вибору компаній були географічна представленість (діяльність в різних областях України) та інформаційна доступність (в т.ч. фінансової звітності, звітів для інвесторів, дані про системи ризик-менеджменту). Три агрохолдинги вибірки за розміром земельного банку входять одночасно і до рейтингу топ-35 найбільших латифундистів світу за підсумками 2017 року: Uklandfarming (Авангард входить до його складу), Кернел, Миронівський хлібопродукт. Крім того, за різними рейтингами якості управління, репутації і т.п. ці компанії зазвичай є лідерами. Фінансові прорахунки відповідно до проведених оцінок присутні в усіх аналізованих агрокомпаніях, під час діагностики ймовірності банкрутства навіть вітчизняні методи (що зазвичай показують найприйнятніші результати) показали необхідність санаційних процедур чи антикризового управління. Наукова новизна. У статті на основі даних фінансової звітності, консолідованої інформації на сайтах фондових бірж тощо здійснено аналіз фінансового стану 5 агрохолдингів України. Проведено оцінювання фінансових показників та діагностику стану системи економічної безпеки холдингового підприємства агробізнесу (за МСФЗ та НПСБО) за 5 параметрами: загальний фінансовий стан, основні індикатори, ліквідність балансу, коефіцієнтний аналіз, ймовірність банкрутства. Висновки. Ретроспективна діагностика основних фінансових результатів діяльності (прибутку, виторгу та дохідності акцій); показників вартості підприємства, ринкової капіталізації, EBITDA, маржі операційного та чистого прибутку, P/E, ROA, ROE, ROC станом на 2018 рік та в середньому за 5 років; розгляд індикаторів Montier C-Score та Piotroski F-Score щодо фінансових проблем компаній; ліквідності балансу агрохолдингів за критерієм співвідношення активів та пасивів; коефіцієнтний аналіз підприємств та діагностика ймовірності банкрутства з використанням моделей множинного дискримінантного аналізу (MDA-моделі), логістичної регресії (Logit-моделі) та рейтингових методик (показники Бівера та визначення класу потенційного бенефіціара інвестиційного проекту) допомогли сформувати узагальнений висновок щодо ймовірності настання банкрутства згідно моделей і загальну оцінку фінансового стану агрокомпаній. На основі проведеного аналізу визначено, що за всіма методиками агрохолдинги вибірки загалом формують ряд від найвищих до найнижчих показників: МХП/Кернел, ІМК, Агротон та Авангард. З огляду на це необхідне формування та постійне вдосконалення систем комплексного управління ризиками (інтегрованих систем економічної безпеки підприємства), а не окремі процедури на рівні різних відділів компанії.
Q13|Market awareness and profitability: case study of Mango production in Karnataka, India|This article presents a case study of mango farmers in the Kolar district of Karnataka to understand the determinants of profitability and constraints faced by the horticulture industry in India in general. The mango value chain is analysed in-depth to understand the market choices of farmers and the role of market intermediaries and is based on data collected from a primary survey of 131 farmers. The study uses an instrumental variable approach to model the profitability of farmers as a function of market awareness, distance from markets, farming practices, and control variables. It finds that in addition to age and education, distance to markets and farming practices are significant factors influencing the profitability of mango cultivators.
Q13|L’internationalisation des marchés en productions animales| Animal production accounts for 16% of international agri-food trade. The growing imbalance between supply and demand for animal products in Asian countries, where consumption is growing, particularly in China, stimulates trade for the benefit of the major exporting countries: the European Union (EU), the United States, New Zealand, Brazil and Australia. While this development offers trade opportunities for countries with a structural surplus, purchases fluctuate from year to year and price competition is very strong, despite the qualitative requirements of some countries. The EU, which has a positive trade balance in dairy products and pork, but a negative one (in monetary terms) in beef and poultry meat, is the world's largest exporter of animal products (with 22% of the extra-EU trade in 2016). This article analyses the evolution of trade in animal products using customs statistics data (BACI and COMEXT) from 2000 to 2016. It presents the evolution of international trade for different types of goods (dairy products, beef, pork, poultry meat) and highlights the trade trajectories (patterns) of the main net importing countries (China, Japan and Russia) and net exporting countries (India, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, the United States and the EU).
Q13|Property rights, market access and crop cultivation in Southern Rhodesia: evidence from historical satellite data|Agriculture plays a central role in the efforts to fight poverty and achieve economic growth. This is especially relevant in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where the majority of the population lives in rural areas. A key issue that is generally believed to unlock agriculture potential is the recognition of property rights through land titling, yet there is no overwhelming empirical evidence to support this in the case of SSA (Udry, 2011). This paper investigates access to markets as an important pre-condition for land titles to result in agricultural growth. Using the case of Southern Rhodesia, we investigate whether land titles incentivised African large-scale holders in the Native Purchase Areas (NPAs) to put more of their available land under cultivation than their counterparts in the overcrowded Tribal Trust Areas (TTAs). We create a novel dataset by applying a Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning algorithm on Landsat imagery for the period 1972 to 1984 - the period during which the debate on the nexus between land rights and agricultural production intensified. Our results indicate that land titles are only beneficial when farmers are located closer to main cities, main roads and rail stations or sidings.
Q13|An Axiomatic Characterization of a Generalized Ecological Footprint|The purpose of this paper is to propose an axiomatic characterization of ecological footprint indices. Using an axiomatic approach, we de?ne a set of axioms to represent the properties considered appropriate to ecological footprint measures in general. It can be shown that there exists a generalized index which is unique up to a strictly increasing function of the world land area appropriated to satisfy human needs. As an implication, the well-known compound-based footprint index used by the Global Footprint Network can be characterized as a speci?cation of the generalized index, only if proportionality in world land area use is additionally assumed and the norm is arbitrarily ?xed, in terms of global hectares. Instead, we ?nd that the applied methodology of normalization and standardization in the aggregation procedure of footprint indices is completely dispensible. In this respect, the proposition of generalized and axiomatically characterized indices for the measurement of the ecological footprint of human activity may be considered as the main contribution of the paper.
Q13|Mobile Phones and Mozambique Traders: What is the Size of Reduced Search Costs and Who Benefits?|We investigate to what extent the roll-out of the mobile phone network in Mozambique reduced transport costs and search costs, and thereby decreased spatial price dispersion and improved market efficiency. Estimations are based on data of transport costs of maize grain and maize market prices. The mobile phone rollout explains a 10%-13% reduction in maize price dispersion. Around half of this reduction is associated with search costs related to transport, the other half with other search costs, for example for the collection of maize in source markets. Search costs are substantial and also a substantial component of total transport costs. Benefits of increased market efficiency are biased towards consumer markets. Results are robust for non-random rollout of the mobile phone network and several other threats.
Q13|AGMEMOD Outlook for Agricultural and Food Markets in EU Member States 2018-2030| Policy, administration and industry need medium-term projections of the expected developments in the agri-food markets for their decision-making processes. The EU Commission presents such projections for the EU as a whole in December of each year. Those projections and their assumptions regarding policy and macroeconomic developments are depicted to the level of individual EU Member States with the exception of Luxembourg, which is included in the figures of Belgium, by applying the partial equilibrium model AGMEMOD. The working paper briefly describes the approach to establish projections for the EU Member States. The projections cover the markets of main agricultural products, in particular for cereals and oilseeds (rapeseed and sunflower seed), livestock (cattle, pigs, goats and sheep), meat (beef, pork, and poultry), milk and dairy products (drinking milk, butter, cheese, skimmed milk powder, whole milk and semi-skimmed milk powder). The outcomes comprise items like areas, livestock numbers, yields, production, trade and use, as well as prices. The individual projection results are displayed in tables.
Q13|Growth factors in the agriculture of Russia|In 2017, the harvest of cereals, including wheat, Russia’s top agricultural export commodity, hit its record high. This happened mostly due to a significant rise in wheat harvest against the three previous years (Tables 34, 35). At the same time, the record-high harvest caused problems with the transportation of grain from the regions of the Siberian Federal District. Agricultural producers also note a decline in the profitability of agricultural production (on the average, by 8.4 percent, to 12-14 percent[1]) due to the accelerated growth in the prices of inputs by comparison with that of the sales price of grain, which lagged behind because of the record-high harvest.
Q13|Working Paper 295 - Politique de prix dans la filière coton au Cameroun|Cette étude cherche à apporter une réponse à une préoccupation actuelle des pouvoirs publics camerounais sur la modification des mécanismes de fixation de prix d’achat du coton graine au producteur et d’abondement du fonds de gestion risque prix du coton au Cameroun (FGRPC-C). Au regard de la théorie économique et des informations recueillies auprès de la SODECOTON et de la CNPCC (Confédération Nationale des Producteurs de Coton du Cameroun) pour le compte de la campagne cotonnière 2014/2015, nous avons trouvé que ces 2 instruments de gestion de risque prix actuellement mis en œuvre présentent un coût énorme pour les différents acteurs de la filière. Le mécanisme de fixation du prix d’achat du coton graine doit prendre en compte les coûts de production supportés par les cotonculteurs. L’État du Cameroun doit supprimer les subventions octroyées à cette filière et respecter les prix arrêtés par le nouveau mécanisme. Il faut supprimer le principe de plafonnement du fonds de gestion risque prix.Classification JEL : Q13, Q18, Q19, 013.

Q13|Working Paper 306 - Asymmetric Price Transmission of Rice in Togo|In this paper, we investigate the extent and the speed of adjustment of six domestic markets of imported rice and the local market of processed rice to rice price changes on the global market and how local paddy markets respond to changes in processed rice prices in Togo and we test for asymmetry in the adjustment process using both standard and threshold co-integration analyses. We estimate symmetric and asymmetric error correction models with respect to the linear and threshold cointegration relationships to investigate the short-run price dynamics. The results indicate that prices of central–local market pairings are co-integrated with relatively low-price transmission elasticities. Threshold cointegration analyses reveal that, in the long run, the local paddy market adjusts asymmetrically to price changes for processed rice and the Cinkasse and Lome domestic markets adjust asymmetrically to price changes on the global market. In the short run, there is asymmetric adjustment only between global and imported rice price dynamics. The results imply that oligopolistic middlemen in rice marketing in Togo are more sensitive to—and react quickly to— rice price changes on the global market that squeeze their margins than to changes that stretch them.JEL classification: Q13; D43; C24. Keywords: Agricultural markets and marketing, Asymmetric price transmission, threshold cointegration, Togo.
Q13|Reality of Food Losses: A New Measurement Methodology|Measuring food loss, identifying where in the food system it occurs, and developing effective policies along every stage of the value chain are essential first steps in addressing the problem of food loss in developing countries. Food loss has been defined in many ways, and disagreement remains regarding proper terminology and measurement methodology. Although the terms “post-harvest loss,” “food loss,” and “food loss and waste” are frequently used interchangeably, they do not refer consistently to the same aspects of the problem. In addition, none of these classifications includes pre-harvest losses. Figures regarding food loss remain highly inconsistent, precise causes of food loss remain undetected, and success stories of decreasing food loss remain few. We improve over this measurement gap on food losses by developing and testing the methodology traditionally used with three new methodologies that aim to reduce the measurement error in assessing the magnitude of food loss. The methods account for losses from the pre-harvest stage through product distribution and include both quantity loss and quality deterioration. We apply the instrument to producers, middlemen, and processors in seven staple food value chains in five developing countries. Throughout the different estimation methodologies, losses at the producer level represent between 60 and 80 percent of total value chain losses, while the average loss at the middleman and processor level lies around 7 and 19 percent, respectively. Differences across methodologies are salient, especially at the producer level. While the estimation results from the three new methods implemented are close and the differences are mostly not statistically significant, the aggregate self-reported method reports systematically lower loss figures. Finally, our results show the major reasons behind the losses identified for each commodity and country. Specifically, we find that they included pests and diseases and lack of rainfall. When looking at the produce left in the field, the major reason for the loss is a lack of appropriate harvesting techniques. Finally, the loss reported at the post-harvest level is due mostly to damage done during selection, as a result of workers’ lack of training and experience in selecting the produce. Therefore, technology, improved seeds and the proper soil management techniques together with better market access could help to substantially reduce the losses at the producer level.
Q13|Measuring the financial efficiency of agricultural cooperatives in South Africa: An application of the Simar-Wilson methodology| The SA government has favored cooperatives over other types of corporate entities in its programmes for rural development. This study examines financial efficiency and its determinants for 387 agricultural cooperatives in SA using a two-stage double bootstrap approach. Bias-corrected Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) efficiency estimates are obtained in the first-stage for the agricultural cooperatives. Next, a Double Bootstrapped Truncated Regression model was estimated to obtain bias-corrected scores. The model was designed to obtain DEA scores for financial efficiency. First-stage results indicate that many agricultural cooperatives are relatively inefficient. Results of the second-stage analysis identified significant determinants of efficiency as age of cooperatives, size, gender of management, governance indicators and training. Governance indicators negatively influencing efficiency indicate institutions that prioritize non-financial goals and consequently compromise on governance quality. The deviation from institutional control mechanisms most likely emerges in a weak institutional environment. Various types of training influenced financial efficiency meaning that an understanding of training needs across institutions is crucial for equipping and empowering cooperatives towards financial efficiency. The study shows that the design and implementation of suitable training programs are prerequisites for addressing financial efficiency of agricultural cooperatives.

Q13|The effect of drought on consumer welfare| South Africa is characterised by frequent drought periods with 2015 receiving the lowest annual average rainfall of 403mm since 1904. This has a negative impact on physical agricultural production with maize being the most affected by the recent 2015 drought. The effect of drought on maize production also influences its price formation along the maize marketing chain. This paper with the use of Cointegration and Error Correction Model (ECM) attempts to estimate the effects of drought on price formation in the white maize marketing chain. Maize meal is a staple food for most South Africans and it constitutes a large share of consumer�s expenditure on food, particularly poor consumers. The study found that drought plays a significant role in the price formation of the white maize marketing chain. During a drought period, any price changes from the producers are transmitted faster than a recovery period. However, during the latter period, any cost savings from the producer price are not passed onto the consumers. This results in consumers paying more for maize meal during a recovery period when prices are expected to decline, with poor consumers being affected the most. JEL Classification: D11, Q13, Q54
Q13|Effects of agricultural commercialization on multidimensional poverty: Evidence from smallholder farmers in Kenya| While previous studies have examined the impacts of agricultural commercialization on farm household welfare in terms of income, the implications on multidimensional poverty have rarely been analyzed. We examine the impacts of commercialization on farm household welfare measured in terms of multidimensional poverty, with income-based poverty indicators as robustness checks. Using data from a sample of 805 farm households in Western Kenya and various econometric models, we measure average treatment effects, continuous treatment effects, and impact heterogeneity. Commercialization significantly reduces multidimensional poverty headcount by 35% and share of multiple deprivations in education, healthcare, and living standards by 39% and income poverty gap by 86% above the mean of less commercialized households. The impacts on per capita income are positive and significant. Generalized propensity score estimates show that commercialization continuously reduces multidimensional and income-based poverty. Quantile regressions results show that the absolute gains in per capita income are larger for the better-off, suggesting that commercialization may contribute to higher inequality. The effects of commercialization on multidimensional poverty are significant across different quantiles, but are largely homogeneous. The policy implications are discussed.

Q13|A Study on Taiwan s Food Dollar Series| Abstract For understanding the distribution of food dollar which we pay for our expenditure and how much Taiwanese farmers will earn from food dollar in the value added agriculture of Taiwan, this paper examines, with a filter of U.S. ERS food dollar series, Taiwan s food dollar series, including marketing bill series, industry group series, and primary factor series using Input-Output accounts of Taiwan. For sustainable development in Taiwan, it is better to transform from traditional agriculture to value-added agriculture. Since enhancing the competitiveness of agriculture and pursuing inclusive growth, it would be necessary to pay attention to farmers value and consider both farmers and agricultural supply chain to implement the effective and comprehensive agricultural policy.

Q13|The impact of producer organisations on farm performance: A case study of large farms in Slovakia|This report estimates the farm level impact of producer organizationsâ€™ (PO) membership in Slovakia and the effectiveness of support provided to POs under the EU Rural Development Programme (RDP). We employ the PSM-DID econometric approach on a database of large Slovak commercial farms for 2006 and 2015. Our results show that belonging to a PO improves the economic performance of farms in Slovakia. In the short-run the support granted under RDP 2007-2013 to newly established PO does not improve the farm performance; only established and older POs (and potentially supported in the past) generate benefits to their members. Third, the estimates provide indirect evidence that the disbursement of PO support granted in the financial period 2007-2013 was rather ineffective in selecting POs with the highest potential to generate benefits to its members. Our analysis confirms that many POs were created for the sole purpose just to benefit from the support. This result is reinforced by the observed high closure rate of supported POs.
Q13|Les relations commerciales agroalimentaires de la Russie avec l’Union européenne, l’embargo russe et les productions animales|[paper in French] Russia has been for many years an important outlet for the European Union (EU) in the agri-food sector. Following the break-up of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1991, Russian agriculture, which until then had been dominated by sovkhozes and kolkhozes, had suffered a drastic fall in domestic production, in particular in animal production. Over the past fifteen years, and due to a policy encouraging investment in agriculture, especially in agro-industrial complexes where the integration model prevails, agricultural production progressed rapidly, at least in certain sectors, including cereals, poultry meat and pork. This development of domestic supply and the diversification of supplier countries (including the United States, Brazil, etc.) had, even before the embargo imposed since August 2014, led to a substantial loss of European exports to Russia. Since the embargo was effective, Russia is no longer a privileged partner for European animal productions. Thanks to the growth of imports in several Asian countries, especially in China, several European animal sectors have nevertheless managed, despite the closure of the Russian market, to increase their exports. This paper deals, first of all, with the main stages of the Russian agricultural and trade policy, the development of agricultural production in this country, and the implementation of the embargo. Using customs statistics data (from BACI and COMEXT databases) over the period 2000 to 2016, it then discusses the evolution of trade flows following the implementation of the embargo, with particular emphasis on Russia's bilateral relations with the EU in four animal sectors: milk and milk products, beef and veal, poultry meat, and pork.
Q13|Rice Seed System in Thailand|Thailand’s rice has set a supreme quality standard in the world market. Seed is one of the important factors contributing to good quality grains. As the competition for quality rice in the world market is becoming intensive, rice seeds play a significant role not only to ensure food and income security but also to retain quality and competitiveness of Thai rice in the world market. This paper reviews policies and regulations related to rice seed industry in Thailand, current situations of rice seed system, the supply and demand of rice seeds, and implications for future rice seed industry development. It is found that some of current regulations and business environment do not create much incentive for investments for the private sector. The imports and exports of rice seeds are practically prohibited. Thus, most of existing rice seeds in the market comprise of mainly public varieties produced by formal seed sector with a few exceptions of privately developed varieties by Thai companies, farmers’ groups and research institutes. None of the foreign stakeholders is in rice seed industry in Thailand presently. As seed producers do not hold exclusive rights to reproduce public varieties, and because all of the varieties are not hybrids, informal seed system is the major source of rice seeds. The systems of rice seed suggest that formal and informal systems can be integrated and linkages between both systems should create incentives for business opportunities.
Q13|How Much Wine Is Really Produced and Consumed in China, Hong Kong, and Japan?|Statistics on the wine market in countries where it is not traditionally produced or consumed are estimates using simple methods. In northeast Asia those statistics are exaggerated for a combination of several reasons. One is a labelling issue: imported bulk wine is able to be added to domestically produced wine without the front label having to declare the bottle may contain foreign product. Similar freedom applies to wine made from imported grape juice concentrate. A second (particularly in China) is a double-counting issue: domestic wine produced in one region of the country may be blended with wine produced in and packaged for final sale from another region, with both regions claiming it as their contribution to national wine output. A third possibility is a smuggling issue: some wine imports are unrecorded. These possibilities of the wine market being exaggerated are significant for firms seeking to sell in such countries, especially in the fast-growing ones of northeast Asia. This paper shows the extent to which estimates for the region could change for such indicators as per capita wine consumption, wine self-sufficiency and the region’s share of global wine consumption, when alternative assumptions are made in response to these issues.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Q13| ¿Semillas mejoradas como escape de la pobreza? Evidencia cualitativa y cuantitativa para la sierra sur del Perú| El presente trabajo tiene como finalidad esclarecer y cuantificar los potenciales efectos de la adopción de tecnologías agrícolas ―semillas mejoradas― en la reducción de la pobreza rural, enfocándose en los hogares productores a pequeña escala en los Andes peruanos del sur. Para ello se emplea un método de análisis basado en el ‘propensity score matching’ para hallar las relaciones causales del tratamiento. Los resultados indican que existe una relación robusta y significativa entre la adopción de dichas tecnologías y el bienestar de los agricultores, aunque estos resultados dependen en gran medida del tamaño de la parcela y de la proporción regada de la misma. Asimismo, la evidencia cualitativa indica que la asistencia técnica y capacitación (semillas y tecnificación del riego) deben de ser implementadas tomando en cuenta las características idiosincráticas y culturales de los poblados andinos, además de hacerlos parte del planteamiento de la solución al problema de la baja productividad agrícola. El reto de mitigar la pobreza debe pasar por un acompañamiento no solo durante el proceso de producción agrícola, sino también en el proceso de articulación al mercado y organización empresarial de los productores.

Q13|Управление И Оценка На Аграрната Устойчивост – Опит, Предизвикателства И Уроци От България И Китай<BR>[Governing and assessment of agrarian sustainability - experiences, challenges, and lessons from Bulgaria and China]|This paper applies interdisciplinary approach and assesses the system of governance and the level of agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria and China. The first part presents a holistic and practically applicable for the contemporary conditions of development of Bulgarian and Chinese agriculture framework for assessing the system of governance and the level of agrarian sustainability. The suggested approach is broadly experimented in Bulgaria for assessing the governance system of agrarian sustainability and the sustainability level of Bulgarian agriculture. In the second part the system of governance of agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria is analyzed and the efficiency of institutional environment and diverse market, private, collective, public and hybrid modes are evaluated. In the third part an assessment is made on the economic, social, environmental and integral sustainability of Bulgarian agriculture at national, sectoral, regional, ecosystem and farm levels. Factors for improving agrarian sustainability are also identified and the innovation activity and sustainability of alternative agriculture estimated. In the fourth part the governance and sustainability in Chinese agriculture at national, regional and local levels is analyzed, and results of a number of in-depth studies from Shanghai area are presented. Comparative study is also made on the systems of governance and the levels of agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria and China. Finally, the experiences and challenges in the governance and assessment of agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria and China are summarized and directions for improvement of research, management and assessment practices suggested.
Q13|Effects if Fertilizer Subsidies in Zambia: A Literature Review|Fertilizer subsidies are again part of the policy agenda in Sub-Saharan Africa since the 1990s. Governments spend large shares of their agricultural budgets and their means to fight poverty on such programmes, but economists formulated doubts whether these investments will pay off. This paper reviews the existing literature on effects of fertilizer subsidies in Zambia, presents an analytical framework on input subsidies and compares the empirical evidence to the goals of the fertilizer subsidy. Major findings are that the subsidy programme has failed to substantially reduce poverty and to improve food security via decreased maize prices. Farm incomes have increased moderately, but the overall costs exceed the benefits by far. Reasons for this are identified as poor targeting, diversion and leakage. The paper concludes with a review of policy recommendations, mainly focused on improved targeting and diversification away from pure fertilizer subsidies.
Q13|Efficiency of sustainability management in Bulgarian agriculture|This paper applies a holistic framework for assessing efficiency of environmental and sustainability management in Bulgarian agriculture. Initially the multiprinciple, multictiteria and mulriindicator framework for assessing environmental and sustainability management in agriculture is outlined. After that environmental sustainability of Bulgarian agriculture at national and farms levels is evaluated. Finally, factors for improving environmental and sustainability management in agricultural farms in the country are identified. Our assessment at national and farm level have found out that there are significant discrepancies in efficiency levels based on aggregate national data and assessment (perception) of farm managers. Therefore, in management practices all kind of data have to be used in order to be able to take efficient decision at different managerial levels. Having in mind the importance of holistic assessments of efficiency of environmental and sustainability management in agriculture, and the enormous benefits for the farm management and agrarian policies, such studies are to be expended and their precision and representation increased.
Q13|Assessment of the Contribution of Cooperative Societies in the Development of the Youth: A Case Study of Selected Cooperative Societies in Dunukofia Local Government Area, Anambra State, Nigeria|This study is centered on the assessment of the contribution of cooperative societies in the development of the youth in Dunukofia Local Government Area of Anambra State Nigeria. It is believed that cooperative societies are veritable tool for youth development. The study specifically ascertain and describe the corporate profile of cooperative societies; identifying the activities the cooperative societies are engaged in and its bearing on youth development; compare the exposure of the youth to development activities before and after joining the cooperative societies; find out the perception of the youth and the influence of their cooperative on their development; ascertain the challenges the cooperative societies and their youth-members face in advancing their goals. Respondents were drawn from members of six selected (6) cooperative societies. Primary data were sourced through questionnaires administered on 159 members, while secondary data were gotten from literary works and documents. Data was analyzed descriptively using means; percentage, 5-point likert scale, chi-square, z-test techniques and two hypotheses were tested. The study found that there is a positive relationship between the effect of the activities of the cooperative societies and youth development. There is also a significant change in the exposure of youth to development activities before and after their membership of cooperative society. Several constraints were identified to be affecting the cooperative societies in effectively meeting and enhancing youth development, prominent among them are weak financial strength of the society, Poor management of the society, lack of basic infrastructures, Fraud and financial malpractice. The society is also found to be providing limited loans and savings. Recommendations were made on how cooperatives can effectively contribute to youth development. These includes(partial listing):Members should show participation and being more active for a stronger and stable society, There should be judicious use of funds to strengthen the financial level of the society, The youth should be encouraged to join cooperative society which will attract the attention of the government. There should be diversification of the cooperative business to enhance it reserve, Management should be more serious in dealing with the affairs of the society. Government should provide enabling environment for cooperative societies to strive through policies and programmes.
Q13|Impact of governing modeson agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria|Specific system of governance in different countries, regions, subsectors, etc., eventually determines the speed and type of socio-economic development. Despite its big academic and practical importance, in Bulgaria and other countries in East Europe, there are very few empirical studies on dominating governing structures in agriculture, and their impact(s) on agrarian sustainability. In this paper the interdisciplinary New Institutional Economics framework is incorporated, and the impact of diverse market, private, collective, public and hybrid modes of governance on agrarian sustainability at the current stage of development in Bulgaria assessed. First, the methodological framework of the study is outlined. After that dominating governing modes in Bulgarian farms of different juridical type, size, specialization, ecological and geographical location are identified, and their impacts on agrarian sustainability and its economic, social, and environmental pillars evaluated. In conclusion implications for further research, public policy improvement, and private managerial strategy formation are presented. Agricultural producers of different use quite unlike mixture of effective market, private, collective and hybrid modes for governance of their activities and relations. Individual factors and modes most contributing to improvement of agrarian sustainability at the current stage of development are: manager’s personal convictions and initiatives, farms resources and innovation potential, near future profit and benefits strategies, market prices levels and dynamics, area-based EU subsidies, and informal agreements. Research on relations between the governing structure and agrarian sustainability is to continue though increasing representation, and the spectrum of specific governing modes used by farms of different type as well as assessments of the impact of institutions on agrarian sustainability and the impact of the governance at different hierarchical levels. The latter however, requires a new kind of micro and macro data, and a close cooperation between all interested parties.

The report analyzes agrotechnical conditions for bean production, including data on bean-related phytosanitary safety and the situation with bean-related food safety standards when exporting it and marketing problems in foreign markets. Findings of the study include the main barriers and constraints to increasing domestic production, improving bean quality and processing, and improving the phytosanitary situation and food safety standards; recommendations on Kyrgyz bean market improvement are also included.
Q13|Efficiency of agrarian governance in Bulgaria|Empirical studies on efficiency of the governance system in agriculture are very rare. That is a consequence of both theoretical and practical challenges. The criteria and approach for assessing social efficiency are still debated while appropriate statistical, accountancy, etc. data for evaluation diverse mechanisms and modes of governance are not readily available. This is a first attempt for a comprehensive empirical study on the efficiency of the system of agrarian governance in Bulgaria. Since there is a social “contract” about sustainable agrarian development in EU and Bulgaria, the impact to sustainability is taken as a criterion for assessing the social efficiency of the governance system. The interdisciplinary New Institutional Economics framework is incorporated, and the impact of institutional environment and diverse market, private, collective, public and hybrid modes of governance on agrarian sustainability at the current stage of development in Bulgaria assessed. First, the methodological framework of the study is outlined. After that impact of major components of institutional environment of agrarian sustainability evaluated. Following, dominating governing modes in Bulgarian farms of different juridical type, size, specialisation, ecological and geographical location are identified, and their impacts on agrarian sustainability assessed. In conclusion implications for further research, public policy improvement, and private managerial strategy formation are presented.
Q13|Institutions and sustainability – insights from Bulgarian agriculture|The specific system of governance is a critical factor, which to a great extent (pre)determines the type and speed of development in different countries, industries, regions, communities, etc. This article tries to fill the gap and assesses the impact of institutional environment on agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria. The interdisciplinary New Institutional Economics framework is applied and assessment made on specific effects of major components of the “external” institutional environment on agrarian sustainability level in different administrative, geographical and ecological regions, subsectors of agriculture, and farms of various juridical type and size. Our study has found out that individual elements of external institutional, market and natural environment affect quite unequally farms of different types, individual subsectors of agriculture, and specific ecological and geographical regions. This type of studies is to be expended and their precision and representation increased. The latter however, requires a close cooperation between all interested parties, and participation of the farmers, agrarian organisations, local and central authorities, interest groups, research institutes and experts, etc.

Q13|Role of Cold Chain in fostering Agribusiness in India: Prospects and Policy Insights|The prospects of agribusiness in the context of an emerging economy such as India are primarily subject to the degree of integration between farm activities on the one hand and secondary processing of farm produce in food processing units on the other. The diversification of farm activities and market for processed food items are greatly influenced by several economic and institutional factors. In this context, this study attempts to bring in to focus the critical role of cold chain (CC) which, as an infrastructural pre-requisite, has the potential of enhancing the degree of integration between the agricultural sector and the food processing industry (FPI). The performance of the FPI and cold storage (CS) sector in the Indian context is thus assessed using Annual Survey of Industries data at the four- and five-digit level respectively. Based on the empirical assessment of the performance of FPI over the period 1998-99 to 2014-15 and that of CS sector from 2003-04 to 2013-14, the study argues that one of the crucial factors behind the worsening structural and technical coefficients for the FPI is the existing capacity gaps in the infrastructural components constituting integrated CC and their lopsided development. The study thus highlights the limitations of the prevailing policy perspective that uses scheme-based incentives for securing private sector participation in the CC sector. Further, it underscores the need for a holistic policy framework and a national blueprint for the long-term development of CC sector given its far-reaching implications for the dynamics of a primarily agrarian rural economy in general, and in promising reasonable returns to the small and marginal farmers in particular.
Q13|Trading Channel Pattern of Cassava Commodity: Double Roles for the Farmers – Is It a Benefit?|The results of presented study showed that farmers in addition to being producers also become a trading agency where they sell commodities directly to the nearest factory. Based on the tracing of cassava commodity trading channel pattern, two cassava channel modelling pattern in Bangka Regency of Indonesia was established: first channel, consisting of farmers, wholesaler and factories; second channel, consisting of farmers and factories. The size of the price received by farmers and the value of the cost-benefit ratio differs in each trading channel pattern.

The result of this study shows that several brands of chemical compound fertilizer that are preferred by white pepper farmers in South Bangka Regency are Yaramila, Wayang, and Phonska. Brand Image variable and Distribution variable influence on Purchase Decision. On the other hand, Promotion variable doesn’t influence Purchase Decision.
Q13|Пољопривреда Краснодарске Покрајине И Агрохолдинг Кубањ<BR>[Agriculture of Krasnodar Krai and Agroholding Kuban]|Serbian. У раду се анализира пољопривреда Краснодарске покрајине, једног од мањих, али економски развијенијих субјеката сложено уређене Руске Федерације (РФ). Најпре је дат географски и друштвеноекономски приказ Краснодарске покрајине. По величини територије и броју становника упоредив с мањим европским земљама, попут Аустрије, Чешке или Републике Ирске, односно Данске, Финске и Словачке, овај регион је нешто мањи и слабије насељен од Србије. Разноврсност рељефа, климатских услова и велика природна богатства чине повољне услове за његов економски и друштвени развој. Посебно су развијени агроиндустријски комплекс и туризам, што и представља знак распознавања региона не само у оквирима Русије, већ и ван њених граница. У производњи низа пољопривредних култура Краснодарска покрајина заузима водеће, или једно од водећих места у оквирима Руске Федерације. Дат је кратак приказ Агрохолдинга Кубањ, највећег и најзначајнијег пољопривредно-прехрамбеног предузећа у Покрајини и једног од највећих у РФ, чије је седиште у г. Уст-Лабинск, и који има активе у више од 20 агропредузећа у неколико рејона Краснодарске покрајине. Земљишни фонд АгроХолдинга чини 112 хиљада ха, број запослених је око 5 хиљада људи. Привредна сарадња Србије с Русијом у целини знатно заостаје за оном из времена СФРЈ и СССР, али ће у будућности свакако бити повећана, а у оквиру тога и сарадња с Краснодарском покрајином, која се неће заснивати само на трговинским односима. English. This article analyzes the agriculture of the Krasnodar Krai, one of the smallest but economicaly most developed subjects of complexly organized Russian Federation. At the beginning it was provided a geographic and socio-economic description of Krasnodar Krai. Its size and population are comparable to the ones of smaller European countries, such as Austria, Czech Republic, Republic of Ireland or Denmark, Finland and Slovakia. In comparison to Serbia, this region is somewhat smaller and less densely populated. Its landscape and climate diversity, as well as an abundance of natural resources make a good starting point for a further economic and social development of the region. The agro-industrial complex and tourism are especially developed in this region and are considered its strong points both within Russia and outside its borders. In the production of many agrarian products Krasnodar Krai is leader, or at the top in the Russian Federation. It is also given the short survey of the AgroHolding Kuban, greatest and most important agriculture and food enteprises in the Krasnodar Krai, and one of the greatest in Russia. The level of industrial cooperation between Serbia and Russia is considerably lower than in the times of SFRY and USSR. However, it will certainly increase in the future, leading to an intensification of cooperation with Krasnodar region which will not only be based on trade relations.
Q13|Cassava Price Competitiveness and Cultivation Interest|This study aims to determine how much the price influence toward interest in the cultivation of cassava. The price is determined by price suitability with product quality and price competitiveness. Meanwhile, the interest in cassava cultivation determined by the level of happiness, production costs, and technology in Bangka Regency, Bangka Belitung Province, Indonesia. Respondents in this study were cassava farmers with a total of 153 respondents selected by using the snowball sampling technique. The analysis used in this research is descriptive statistics and multiple regressions. The result of the research is descriptively known that price conformity with product quality according to the respondents is considered unsuitable. Price competitiveness according to the respondents is relatively normal there are no price differences. In the indicators of interest in cultivation, the level of happiness and technology is responded to on a low scale, while production costs are met on a high scale. The knowledge of most cassava farmers in Bangka Regency regarding cassava cultivation should be questioned because they consider the quality of their products is the best, whereas the varieties of seedlings they plant are cassava seeds that have an average quality when compared with the Province of Borneo in Indonesia.
Q13|Free-on-board and uniform delivered pricing strategies in pure and mixed spatial duopolies: the strategic role of cooperatives|The present work analyzes free-on-board against uniform delivered strategic prices in pure and mixed duopolistic spatial markets with reference to the food sector. Along with investor owned firms (IOFs) that maximize profits, we introduce member welfare maximizing cooperatives (COOPs) and examine their impact on the strategic pricing choices. Demand is price responsive. We use a two stage game between two IOFs, between an IOF and a COOP, and between two COOPs. The findings indicate that the introduction of COOPs acts as a disciplinary factor regarding the pricing behavior of the IOFs. As competition in the spatial market escalates, we move from the quasi--collusive (FOB,FOB) Nash equilibrium, where there are only IOFs in the market, to the more aggressive (UD,UD) strategic pricing configuration where COOPs replace one or both IOFs in the market.
Q13|Digital Agriculture: Mobile Phones, Internet & Agricultural Development in Africa|This study examines the non-linear relationship between mobile phones, internet and agricultural development in Africa for the period 2001–2015 using system generalized method of moments. The empirical results show a non-linear relationship between mobile phones, internet and agricultural development. Mobile penetration and squared mobile penetration have significant positive effects on agricultural value added, implying that mobile penetration has an increasing effect on agricultural value added. In contrast, internet usage has significant negative effects on agricultural value added, but squared internet usage has significant positive effects. This suggests a U-shaped pattern and a quadratic relationship: as internet usage increases, agricultural value added decreases, but after a certain level of internet usage which is the turning point, agricultural value added starts to increase. The causality analysis suggests the existence of uni-directional causality from mobile penetration and internet usage to agricultural value added. However, there is bi-directional causality between squared mobile penetration, squared internet usage and agricultural value added. This indicates that mobile phones and internet stimulate agricultural development which, in turn, boosts mobile penetration and internet usage even further in these countries. The results therefore provide evidence that mobile phones and internet play significant roles in agricultural development, as agricultural development also plays important roles in the expansion of mobile phones and internet.

Q13|Reinvigorating Cambodian agriculture: Transforming from extensive to intensive agriculture|In this paper we analysis to identify the factor constraining on Cambodian agriculture in transforming from extensive to intensive agriculture. The objective of this study was to examine the general situation of Cambodian agriculture by comparing with neighboring countries in Southeast Asia from a period of 22 years (1996 – 2018) through cultivate areas, technical using, technologies using, fertilizer using, agricultural infrastructure system, agricultural production cost, agricultural output, agricultural market and climate change. The results show that the Cambodian agriculture sector is still at a level where there is significant need to improve the capacity of farmers, the new technologies use and the prevention of climate change. However, the production cost is still high cost and agricultural output has been in low prices. It also causes for farmers to lose confidence in farming and they will be stop working in the sector. Moreover, we also have other policies to improve agriculture sector in Cambodia.
Q13|Инфраструктура Сельского Хозяйства Казахстана: Динамика Аграрного Производства, Взаимодействие Производственной И Социальной Сферы|The article deals with the problem of infrastructure development of agriculture as a condition for the interaction of industrial and social spheres, sustainable positive dynamics of agricultural production, development of rural areas of Kazakhstan. The main tendencies of development of agro-industrial complex in the Republic of Kazakhstan on the temporary stages based on statistical data are presented. The study showed that the level of endowments as an important parameter of social capital formation in the social and industrial infrastructure of agriculture in Kazakhstan remains extremely unstable. This circumstance can form a tendency to decline and degradation of Kazakh villages. This, in turn, will have a negative impact on production volumes. The endowment, in this case, will form an unstable dynamics in the production of agricultural raw materials. Thus, the formation and development of agro-industrial infrastructure is considered as a necessary condition for effective interaction of subjects of primary and secondary production, contributing to the development of common prerequisites for the growth and development of agricultural products. The results of the study can be used by the state to invest in social, transport and industrial development of the village to ensure food security. Agricultural development of rural areas of Kazakhstan on the basis of infrastructure improvement will increase the welfare of rural workers, solve the problem of quality food for the population of the country, as well as take an active part in solving the global problem of eradicating hunger on the planet.
Q13|Cost-Benefit Analysis of Zimbabwe’s Livestock Development Program for the Reduction of Rural Poverty and Increasing of Income and Food Security on Beef, Dairy by Improving Hygiene in their Nutritional Practices and Building of Capacity|The Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) conducted in this program was aimed at reducing rural poverty and that will increase the incomes and food security looking at the value chain on beef and dairy for farmers producing in small scale and also to improve their hygiene and nutritional practices and building the capacity that will enhance agricultural development. The results of the cost- benefit analysis (CBA). It shows that annual income for beef cattle farmers would increase by USD419. The financial returns are driven by the significant increase in the costs associated with adopting Good Animal Husbandry Practices (GAHPs). The Veterinary Costs will increase by 475% while feeding and labor costs increased by an estimated to be 169% and 148% respectively. There also will be an increase in employment as a result of the increase in labour cost in the Value Chain.
Q13|Cost Benefit Analysis of Agricultural Interventions to Enhance the Production of Cowpea, Groundnuts, Maize and Soybeans Value Chains in Nigeria|This report presents the results of the cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of a series of agriculture production and productivity enhancing interventions in Nigeria. More than 20,000 impoverished farmers have received assistance under this program. A CBA was undertaken to assess the financial and economic benefits of adopting best agricultural practices by these farmers in growing crops. While these interventions do improve the households’ incomes across all VCs, the assistance alone will not allow the households to move above the poverty line threshold. Households need to rely on other economic activities, including livestock husbandry, or non-farm employment to graduate from extreme poverty. Acknowledgements This analysis was completed through the financial support of USAID’ through their “Learning, Evaluation, and Analysis Project (LEAP II). And its contract with the International Development Group. Contract Number: AID-OAA-I-12-00042/AID-OAA-TO-14-00046. The assistance of Abdoul Murekezi, during the completion of this report is greatly appreciated.
Q13|Cost- Benefit Analysis of Zimbabwe for a Sustainable Poverty Reduction and Improvement of Food, Security, Nutrition and Hygiene Practices|The primary objective of this project is to enhance a sustainable reduction of rural poverty, and to improve the food security, nutrition, and hygiene of households on irrigation schemes and dry land sites. Trainings were provided for farmers to increase agricultural productivity to increase the volume of marketed surplus of cash and food crops, and improve the nutrition and hygiene of beneficiary households. The project concentrated on maize, groundnuts, green mealies, and tomatoes value chains. The CBA of these four crops cover two high- value crops of green mealies and tomatoes; and two staple food crops of maize and groundnuts. The project targeted doubling crops yields of horticultural produce.
Q13|The Cost- Benefit Analysis for Resilience in the Sahel Enhanced on Vulnerable households in Burkina Faso and Niger|The CBA for Burkina Faso and Niger, evaluated the projects for the interventions implemented in agriculture, poultry, and small ruminant value chains (VCs). The interventions, investment costs, and the number of beneficiaries in the VC for this CBA were such that agricultural VC interventions, Resilience and Economic Growth in the Sahel – Accelerated Growth (REGIS-AG’s) beneficiaries were 41,224 and 61,254 farmers respectively. This program assessed the “Sustainable Livelihoods Component” with a focus on Conservation Farming (CF). This encompasses the use of an assortment of climate-adapted farming practices to intensify agricultural productivity in the cowpea, millet, and sorghum VCs, with the objective of increasing the income of households and access to food. CF was introduced to 58,670 farmers in Burkina Faso and 24,280 farmers in Niger. The beneficiaries from the cowpea VC were 21,700 and 23,322 for the poultry VC, which was on chicken production the intervention reached 13,157 and 13,801 beneficiaries in Burkina – Faso and Niger, respectively.
Q13|Vertical integration and health control measures in the French young beef bull sector|The French young beef bull sector presents a complex organisation. The more animals are mixed and subjected to long transports, the more likely they will be to develop bovine respiratory disease (BRD). We aimed to understand the vertical integration patterns in the young beef bull sector and how they influence public health issues (BRD and antibiotic use). Transaction costs analyses revealed a diversity of vertical integration patterns, from spot market to vertical integration. The “health issues” parameter is involved in different categories of transaction costs (risk, uncertainty, quality). When vertical integration is strong (weak), the risk of BRD is low (high), which thus have an indirect effect on antibiotic use.
Q13|Les relations commerciales agroalimentaires de la Russie avec l’Union européenne, l’embargo russe et les productions animales| Russia has been for many years an important outlet for the European Union (EU) in the agri-food sector. Following the break-up of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1991, Russian agriculture, which until then had been dominated by sovkhozes and kolkhozes, had suffered a drastic fall in domestic production, in particular in animal production. Over the past fifteen years, and due to a policy encouraging investment in agriculture, especially in agro-industrial complexes where the integration model prevails, agricultural production progressed rapidly, at least in certain sectors, including cereals, poultry meat and pork. This development of domestic supply and the diversification of supplier countries (including the United States, Brazil, etc.) had, even before the embargo imposed since August 2014, led to a substantial loss of European exports to Russia. Since the embargo was effective, Russia is no longer a privileged partner for European animal productions. Thanks to the growth of imports in several Asian countries, especially in China, several European animal sectors have nevertheless managed, despite the closure of the Russian market, to increase their exports. This paper deals, first of all, with the main stages of the Russian agricultural and trade policy, the development of agricultural production in this country, and the implementation of the embargo. Using customs statistics data (from BACI and COMEXT databases) over the period 2000 to 2016, it then discusses the evolution of trade flows following the implementation of the embargo, with particular emphasis on Russia's bilateral relations with the EU in four animal sectors: milk and milk products, beef and veal, poultry meat, and pork.
Q13|What’s in the annual database of Global Wine Markets, 1835 to 2016?|This paper documents a new, unique annual database of global wine markets covering 1835 to 2016. The database expands enormously the opportunities for conducting studies on wine production, consumption and trade from an historical perspective for the world as a whole and for most relevant countries. The combination of this basic information with other economic variables such as real GDP, population, total merchandise trade, total crop area and the consumption of other alcoholic drinks has enabled us to generate myriad derived variables that are helpful for comparative analyses as well as for studying the two waves of globalization.
Q13|Value-Added Analysis Of Selected Branches Of Food Industry In Poland|Value-added is understood as an increase of the value of goods as a result of a specific production process. It means the difference between the retail selling price of a product and the material cost. It is calculated on the basis of financial statements. The objective of this paper is to assess the level and structure of value--added on an example of the selected branches of the food industry in Poland. The authors carry out comparative analysis of these branches and also indirectly refer to the assessment of the level of their modernity. The results show that remuneration plays a significant role in the value-added structure. Remunerations represent approx-imately 50 percent of the value. Structure of the value creation depicts the level of innovation of the sector.
Q13|Pork Market in Poland after the EU Accession|Pork production in Poland has a significant economic, social and environmental impact. Favourable natural conditions as well as the tradition and consumption patterns have made Poland, producing 2.5-2.8 million tonnes of pig livestock (in liveweight), one of the biggest producers in the EU. The pig sector is not only one of the most important branches of the Polish agri-food economy, but is also considered one of the most sensitive ones (Rowinski, Tereszczuk 2008). What makes it so important is its large share in commercial production and agricultural income, sales revenue and employment, as well as a high level of pork consumption and its share in consumers? food spending. Following Poland?s accession to the EU, the development of the pig sector has been more hindered than the production and processing of poultry, milk and beef. Poland has become a shortage country in pork production, the share of imports in the supply of the domestic market has increased to 40%, and the negative balance of foreign trade in pork reached in 2016 220 thousand tonnes in a meat equivalent and EUR 342 million. The article presents the changes taking place on the pork market in Poland in 2004-2016 and indicates the factors determining them. Problems relating to pork production are mainly due to: fragmented farm structure compared to those in EU-15 Member States, decreasing share of pork in agricultural commercial production und in the total meat production, low price competitiveness, problems with ASF in the eastern regions of Poland and hindered exports due to an embargo imposed by Russia.
Q13|Influences of Entrepreneurial Competencies on Product Development Decision: Longan Processing Enterprises in Thailand|This research aims to evaluate the entrepreneurial competencies of longan processing entrepreneurs and analyze the impacts of entrepreneurial competencies on new product development decision. The 165 samples of longan processing entrepreneurs are selected by a purposive sampling method. The results of entrepreneurial competencies show that risk taking orientation and competitiveness orientation are the two lowest score competencies in which the longan processing entrepreneurs should be interested in. Moreover, the age of the entrepreneur and pro-activeness orientation of the entrepreneur have some negative impacts on the decision making probability of the new product development. The entrepreneurial competencies on risk taking, innovativeness and competitiveness have positive influences on new product development decision. The findings lead to a discussion about whether the longan processing entrepreneurs are ready to develop the new product, or not.
Q13|Goose market from global and domestic perspective in the years 2012-2017|The main objective of the article is to present changes in the Polish goose meat market in the years 2012-2017 in the context of changes in the global goose meat market. Poland is one of the largest producers and exporters of goose meat in the world. In the analysed period, the production and sale of goose meat in Poland was of seasonal change, which, most probably in the case of availability of goose meat in retail trade will change, since buyers? preferences are changing and the demand for niche types of poultry meat is growing. At the turn of 2016/2017, Poland was affected by avian influenza which had a negative impact on the production of and trade in goose meat. In 2013, Poland was the fifth largest global producer of goose meat. The structure of the global export of goose meat and offal (total) is very concentrated. In the analysed period, its largest global exporter was Hungary with the share ranging from 34% to 47% while Poland was ranked second with the share ranging from 31% to 37%.
Q13|The Dynamics of Dependencies between the World Grain and Oilseed Markets|The paper analyses relations between world grain and oilseed markets in the period from the beginning of 2000 to the middle of 2018. The study covered the period of drastic hikes and drops of cereal grain and oilseed prices during the economic and financial crisis. The study assessed the strength and dynamics of dependencies between rates of return from grain and oilseed sub-Indexes of the International Grains Council. For this purpose copula-based multivariate GARCH models were used, and dynamic Kendall's tau coefficients and dynamic tail dependence coefficients were calculated. Among the analysed markets the strongest (weak or moderate) relationships were found between the maize and soybean markets, and between the wheat and maize markets, with the linkages changing in time. The greatest probabilities of extreme events transfer were recorded for the maize and soybean markets.
Q13|Competitiveness of the Polish meat industry against selected European Union countries within the framework of transatlantic trade|The aim of the paper was to assess the competitive capacity of the Polish meat industry in trade with the US in relation to major EU producers of meat and meat preparations. Referring both to the growth and trade theories in research on international competitiveness and based on the methodological approach proposed by Wijnands, van der Meulen and Poppe (2006) to estimate the competitive capacity of the meat industry in the analysed countries the study used a set of economic and trade indicators appropriately adapted to the requirements of the analysis of bilateral relations. The indexes based on the market and trade shares included shares in exports to the target market and indexes of relative trade advantage, while the applied economic indexes included the real value added and its share in the total value added of the food industry and real labour productivity. The time frame for the analyses covered the years 2007-2016. The study is based on data from the European Statistical Office (Eurostat). Summing up the analyses it may be stated that in the years 2007-2016 the competitive position of the Polish meat industry in trade with the US in comparison to the leading EU producers of meat and meat preparations was strengthened both thanks to an improved trade position (measured by the share in the EU exports to the US market and relative trade advantages) as well as economic indicators connected with an increase importance of the analysed sector in the generation of real value added of the food industry and labour productivity.
Q13|Innovation for Inclusive Structural Change. A Framework and Research Agenda|The paper proposes the foundations of an analytical framework to map different innovation pathways and explain how innovation leads to inclusive structural change in low-income countries. Innovation pathways depend on how actors, interactions, and variables affect the origin of innovation; the uptake of the innovations (adoption and diffusion); the impact of this diffusion on upgrading, structural change and inclusion; the complementarity between these processes; the potential trade-offs between structural change and inclusion. The paper offers a set of novel applications to test the proposed framework, through different examples of innovation pathways: (a) international technology transfer, based on an extensive systematic literature review; (b) product and process innovation in the dairy sector in Kenya, based on a secondary case study; (c) an organisational innovation in the provision of antiretroviral treatment in Mozambique, also a case study; (d) a systematisation of metrics and indicators of innovation, structural change and inclusion and an empirical exploration of their relationship. The learning generated will support a multidisciplinary, multi-methods research agenda to map the dynamics around innovation, structural change, and inequality and generate an integrated platform of evidence on these processes. In doing so, we respond to the recently increasing demand coming from international institutions, inter-departmental research funds, NGOs and national ministries, for better knowledge to shape a more effective innovation policy for sustainable and inclusive development in low income countries.
Q13|An Axiomatic Foundation of the Ecological Footprint|The objective of this paper is to provide an axiomatic foundation to the ecological footprint developed and refined by the authors in the Global Footprint Network, among others. For this purpose, five axioms are proposed which represent general properties any ecological footprint measure should fulfill. We show that an index exists which is unique up to a coefficient to be chosen arbitrarily. As an implication, footprints have to be measured on a ratio scale. This result supports the conventional unit of measurement (land area) which itself is represented by a ratio scale. In this respect, our index differs from the compound-based ecological footprint index in which the norm is missing and, therefore, it is implicitly set equal to one. Apart from that we find, as the most important result, that the ad-hoc design of the commonly applied ecological footprint index has been given an axiomatic foundation.
Q13|Intertemporal choice and income regularity: Non-fungibility in a lab-in-the-field experiment| Motivated by evidence of mental accounting, this paper tests whether the choice of when to be paid depends on the income type. A lab-in-the-field experiment in Kenya asked dairy cooperative members to allocate both their regular milk payments and an irregular windfall between two dates. We find that participants allocated milk payments to the later of the two dates but allocated the windfall to the earlier date. Most participants self-reported deferring their milk payments in order to save for lump-sum expenses. Those planning to use milk payments for smaller, more frequent purchases were less likely to defer payments. Farmers hence appeared to earmark regular milk payments, but not the irregular windfall, for bulky expenditures. This behavior potentially explains why discount rates elicited using experimenter money are often higher than those inferred from observed choices over regular income. Given that compliance with informal contracts depends on whether the timing of payments aligns with recipient preferences, these findings also have implications for contract design in rural value chains.
Q13|Mobile Phones and Mozambique Farmers: Less Asymmetric Information and More Trader Competition?|We investigate the impact of search costs of farmers and traders on prices, by measuring to what extent the introduction of mobile phones in Mozambique has affected the margin between recorded maize producer prices and retail market prices, and by exploring who benefits from possible margin changes. Estimations are based on weekly producer and retail market prices of white maize grain, from July 1997 to December 2009, for 15 major producer markets in Mozambique. We find a margin increase varying from 4.5% to 9.6%, supporting a bias of benefits towards traders. Hence, not less asymmetric information and more trader competition, but rather the reverse. Estimation results are robust for non-random rollout of the mobile phone network and various other threats. Impacts can be traced towards improved information on terminal market prices and are also significantly correlated with network density. Household survey data yield a mostly insignificant impact for farmers, consistent with the key result of this study. Several farmer characteristics are in line with lower farmer benefits.
Q13|Resistant grape varieties and market acceptance:an evaluation based on experimental economics|We analyze consumers’ evaluations of white wines from resistant varieties, produced in the Languedoc winegrowing region of France (2016 vintage). We use the results from a laboratory experiment performed in Paris in June 2017, where a panel of more than one hundred and sixty consumers, regular buyers of this type of wine, were asked to evaluate a wine of the Bouquet 3159 grape variety (monogenic variety resistant to mildew and powdery mildew and optimized for quality) and compare it with two conventional wines of different quality levels, and with a certified organic wine of similar type and price. The environmental and health performances and the production methods of the different wines were quantified according to several indicators: treatment frequency indicator (TFI) and pesticide residue analysis.\r\nThe consumers first evaluated the wines after tasting, having been given only a minimum amount of information about the region of origin and the vintage, then again after receiving information on production methods and the levels of our indicators. The method used to lend credibility to individual valuations used experimental economics, via a mechanism based on direct disclosure of their willingness to pay (maximum purchase price for a bottle of wine according to available information). The results showed that, on a purely sensory level, consumers had difficulty in accepting wine from a resistant variety. We were then able to see that communication focusing on environmental and health performances very much improved the position of the resistant variety of wine, putting it ultimately at the top of the average qualitative evaluations. In economic terms, we show that this promotion results in high market share, gained from conventional wines. Market share losses were lower, however, for the premium conventional wine, suggesting that the higher quality wines would be less directly challenged by wines produced from resistant varieties.
Q13|Coordination and information sharing about pest resistance|We develop a dynamic oligopolistic Cournot model of a pesticide market where resistance to pesticides can develop. We first study firms' incentives for resistance management through pricing and we distinguish two cases of demand for pesticides; one where users are able to coordinate their pesticide use and one where they are not. We show that users benefit from coordination, but that this gain is at the expense of firms facing a lower demand. When firms are allowed to obtain scientific information on the likelihood of pest resistance and, possibly, to share this information among themselves, we find that they have an incentive to acquire information and to share it with competitors. They also benefit from transmitting this information to users if the latter are coordinated. In the case of uncoordinated users, transmission of information to users is not necessarily profitable for firms if it favors their coordination. Finally, we discuss the policy implications for existing information sharing committees in the pesticide industry.
Q13|Toward generalization of futures contracts for raw materials: A probabilistic answer applied to metal markets|In this paper, we aim at identifying root causes linked to presence or absence of futures contracts for raw materials. Unlike previous analyses focused on the success of futures contracts via exchange volume and open interest, we offer an alternative logit model applied to the presence or absence of futures contracts for 53 metal markets. We use different factors (price and physical quantities produced, geographical concentration…) and several combinations of variables in order to explore the root causes of futures contracts. The model shows both great explaining capability and a good prediction power which are robust to data resampling. According to the model, it is unlikely that minor metals successfully introduce futures contracts in the coming years. We also discuss the use and interest of this model by institutions and financial authorities devoted to the development of futures contracts for raw material markets.
Q13|Les « upgradings stratégiques » des firmes subordonnées dans les CGV : le cas des éleveurs investissant dans des unités de méthanisation|?This article considers the analysis of upgrading strategies, focusing at the level of subordinate firms themselves, with a more classical study at the GVC level. This approach develops the concept of ?strategic upgrading,? studies the institutional environment of subordinate firms, and draws on concepts from industrial economics, such as differentiation, diversification, and specialization, in order to understand these firms? strategies. It thus reexamines the category of inter-chain upgrading, i.e., the improvement of the position of actors of a GVC by integrating a new GVC. We confront this proposal with a territorialized case study on the development of biogas production by farmers in the Ardennes. We observe that these farmers are part of the emerging GVC of biomass energy based on their experience as ?captive? actors in the agro-industrial GVC. In particular, they have sized their biogas production units to be autonomous regarding agro-industry. This new activity also has feedback effects on their positioning in the agro-industrial GVC. ? ?JEL classification: ? ?L22, L23, Q13, Q16, Q42.?
Q13|Farmland Rental Values in GM Soybean Areas of Argentina: Do Contractual Arrangements Matter?|We study the determinants of rental prices of farmland in the Argentinean Pampas. In particular, we examine the value of lease contract characteristics within a hedonic price framework, while controlling for other potential sources of variation. Using first-hand data for 255 parcels, our results indicate that both short-term contracts and contracts with sowing pools push rental prices upwards. We also find that soybean yields have a significant impact on land rental rates. These results suggest that if Argentina intends to protect the enormous natural advantage it has for agricultural production, it should consider strictly regulating land rental contracts.
Q13|Is GM Soybean Cultivation in Argentina Sustainable?|This paper explores the long-term sustainability of Argentina’s specialization in genetically modified (GM) soybean cultivation. We perform an evidence-based assessment of the most relevant economic, social, and environmental implications of the “soybeanization” of Argentinian agriculture. Our diagnostic relies on a combination of published sources and a unique data set drawn from a field survey carried out in 2011 in two provinces of the Argentinian Pampas. This data set allows us to evaluate with a reliable empirical base the socio-economic impacts of GM soybean cultivation. Our analysis suggests a conflict between the success of the “soybeanization” of Argentinian agriculture measured in terms of production and profit records, and the social, economic, and environmental sustainability of this new model of production. On the one hand, GM soybean technological package adoption has increased farm productivity, and reduced the costs per unit produced, resulting in a dramatic increase in profits. On the other hand, the specialization of Argentinian agriculture on soybean cultivation has increased the dependence of public finances on the foreign exchange revenue generated by exports earnings. We also find a mixed empirical picture of changing land distribution patterns and labor displacement resulting from GM soybean expansion. Finally, we find that the environmental implications of agricultural biotechnology appear alarming and the long-term sustainability of GM crops highly questionable. Promoting sustainable agricultural growth has become not only desirable but necessary.
Q13|Hortinlea Baseline Survey Report 2014|This report summarizes major findings from the HORTINLEA survey conducted in 2014 under the framework of HORTINLEA project. The HORTINLEA project is an inter-disciplinary research project addressing food security in East Africa, particularly in Kenya. The project targets to improve the livelihood and nutritional situation of the rural and urban poor. To achieve this, it focuses on production and consumption of horticultural crops, especially of African indigenous vegetables (AIVs). The HORTINLEA survey, conducted in rural, peri-urban and urban areas of Kenya focused on AIV actors along the value chain namely: producers, traders and consumers. The survey was carried out in September and October, 2014 where data was collected at the household, plot and community levels. It was administered using structured questionnaire with Geo-codes where more than 1500 actors were interviewed along the AIV value chain. Various topics were covered in the survey including household composition, education, health, assets, expenditure, credit and saving, agricultural and AIV production, agricultural and AIV marketing, nutrition, shocks and coping strategies. The most widely produced African Indigenous vegetable is African nightshade produced by about 72 procent of respondents followed by cowpeas produced by about 48 procent of respondents. AIVs are traditionally considered as â€œwomenâ€™s cropâ€ where almost 60 procent of the producers stated that women are responsible for producing AIVs and in about 57 procent of the sample women are also responsible for marketing of AIVs. Most of the sampled households sell their AIV produce where African nightshade is the most marketed one. However, most producers do not have contract with the buyer, but rather sell their produce directly to consumers. Most AIV producers sell their produce either at the farm gate or at a stand on weekly markets while less than two percent of respondents sell their AIVs via supermarkets. Even though the AIV value chain has many challenges, it has as well opportunities to improve. First, the link between producers to retailers and consumers could be expanded and formalized so that producers could benefit from marketing of these products. Second, post-harvest handling and transportation system of AIVs should be improved to ensure good quality and timely delivery of AIVs to consumers. Third, processing and value-addition activities could be introduced, which on the one hand improve the quality of the AIV product, while on the other hand create employment opportunity at different segments of the value chain.
Q13|‘Getting to Denmark’: the Role of Elites for Development|We explore the role of elites for development and in particular for the spread of cooperative creameries in Denmark in the 1880s, which was a major factor behind that country’s rapid economic catch-up. We demonstrate empirically that the location of early proto-modern dairies, so-called hollænderier, introduced onto traditional landed estates as part of the Holstein System of agriculture by landowning elites from the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein in the eighteenth century, can explain the location of cooperative creameries in 1890, more than a century later, after controlling for other relevant determinants. We interpret this as evidence that areas close to estates which adopted the Holstein System witnessed a gradual spread of modern ideas from the estates to the peasantry. Moreover, we identify a causal relationship by utilizing the nature of the spread of the Holstein System around Denmark, and the distance to the first estate to introduce it, Sofiendal. These results are supported by evidence from a wealth of contemporary sources and are robust to a variety of alternative specifications.
Q13|2018 Iowa State University Land Value Survey: Overview|"Farmland represents over 80 percent of all U.S. farm assets, and is arguably often a farmer's single largest investment item, a major source of collateral, and a key component of the farmer's debt portfolio. Since 1950, the Iowa State University Land Value Survey has been the only data source that provides a county-level land value estimate for each of the 99 counties in Iowa. The 2018 Iowa State University Land Value Survey reported a 0.8 percent decrease to $7,264 per acre in average Iowa farmland values from November 2017 to November 2018. This modest drop is the fourth decline in Iowa farmland values over the past five years and represents a 17 percent decline from the 2013 peak in nominal land values, or a 24 percent drop in inflation-adjusted values. The recent decline is largely attributable to lower commodity prices, higher interest rates, and to some extent the trade disruptions. On the other hand, the magnitude of this decline is still very modest and overall the land market is largely stable. In general, the results from the 2018 Iowa State University Land Value Survey echo results from other surveys, which all showed relatively stable farmland market trends.

Q13|The impact of producer organisations on farm performance: A case study of large farms in Slovakia| This paper estimates the farm level impact of producer organizations (PO) membership in Slovakia and the effectiveness of support provided to POs under the EU Rural Development Programme (RDP). We employ the PSM-DID econometric approach on a database of large Slovak commercial farms for 2006 and 2015. First, our results show that belonging to a PO improves the economic performance of farms in Slovakia. Second, in the short-run the support granted under RDP 2007-2013 to newly established PO does not improve the farm performance; only established and older POs (and potentially supported in the past) generate benefits to their members. Third, the estimates provide indirect evidence that the disbursement of PO support granted in the financial period 2007-2013 was rather ineffective in selecting POs with the highest potential to generate benefits to its members. Our analysis confirms that many POs were created for the sole purpose just to benefit from the support. This result is reinforced by the observed high closure rate of supported POs.

Q13|Unfair trading practices in the dairy farm sector: Evidence from selected EU regions|This report examines the incidence of unfair trading practices (UTPs) in the dairy food supply chain. Drawing insights from data collected through a field survey among dairy farmers in five selected EU regions (France, Germany, Poland and Spain) we seek to understand the presence of UTPs across different stages of contract development. The survey data were collected in 2017 and in total it includes 1248 observations. We identify a total of 17 UTPs across all different phases of contract development. Results show that 98% of surveyed farmers have reported at least one UTP.
Q13|Why cooperative wineries produced poor quality wine and why they were set up: Evidence from Spain (1895-1935)|Since the 1950s a substantial part of all European wine has come from cooperative wineries, which since their appearance around the year 1900 have mostly produced cheap, poor quality wine. This paper discusses whether this has been a consequence of their inability to solve a collective action problem. After showing that this is not so, it examines why cooperatives concentrated on the production of bad wine and studies why their market share was small before the 1950s. Lastly, it uses data from Spain to analyse the factors determining the creation of cooperative wineries in the early twentieth century.
Q13|Rice Seed System In Thailand| Thailand’s rice has set a supreme quality standard in the world market. Seed is one of the important factors contributing to good quality grains. As the competition for quality rice in the world market is becoming intensive, rice seeds play a significant role not only to ensure food and income security but also to retain quality and competitiveness of Thai rice in the world market. This paper reviews policies and regulations related to rice seed industry in Thailand, current situations of rice seed system, the supply and demand of rice seeds, and implications for future rice seed industry development. It is found that some of current regulations and business environment do not create much incentive for investments for the private sector. The imports and exports of rice seeds are practically prohibited. Thus, most of existing rice seeds in the market comprise of mainly public varieties produced by formal seed sector with a few exceptions of privately developed varieties by Thai companies, farmers’ groups and research institutes. None of the foreign stakeholders is in rice seed industry in Thailand presently. As seed producers do not hold exclusive rights to reproduce public varieties, and because all of the varieties are not hybrids, informal seed system is the major source of rice seeds. The systems of rice seed suggest that formal and informal systems can be integrated and linkages between both systems should create incentives for business opportunities.
Q13|Rural Non-Farm Engagement and Agriculture Commercialization in Ghana: Complements or Competitors?|We used an endogenous switching probit and a generalized structural equation model (GSEM) to assess the effect of non-farm participation on householdersâ€™ decisions to sell and on the level of commercialization of agricultural goods in Ghana. For this study, we used the Ghana Living Standards Survey for the years 2012-2013 and found that non-farm participation consistently increased both the probability of selling crops and quantities sold. We concluded that non-farm engagement by farmers boosts market participation and commercialization in Ghana, implying that non-farm engagement and agricultural commercialization are complementary. Developing the agricultural sector requires the government to create the conditions necessary to stimulate farmersâ€™ participation in non-farm activities.
Q13|Regional differences in willingness to pay for organic vegetables in Vietnam|The concern about vegetable safety, together with a booming population and the rise of the middle class has made Vietnam become a potential market for organic vegetables. This paper investigates the determinants of willingness to pay (WTP) for organic vegetables in Hanoi, Vietnam with a particular attention to regional differences and the effect of risk perception. Using Contingent Valuation Method to analyze the data from a sample of 498 consumers in Hanoi, the paper shows that the perceived use values of organic vegetables, trust in organic labels, and disposable family income increased WTP for organic vegetables in both urban and rural regions. Though risk perception of conventional vegetables was high in both regions, such heightened risk perception just translated into the WTP in the rural region. In addition, the percentage of home-grown vegetables in the total vegetable consumption of the family influenced the WTP in the rural region only. Moreover, being an organic purchaser was positively related to the WTP in the urban region but not in the rural region. The paper also discusses three policy implications for Vietnam to boost the demand for organic food.
Q13|Agriculture, Food and Jobs in West Africa|The food economy is the biggest employer in West Africa accounting for 66% of total employment. While the majority of food economy jobs are in agriculture, off-farm employment in food-related manufacturing and service activities is increasing as the food economy adapts to rapid population growth, urbanisation and rising incomes. Given the importance of the food economy in generating employment, its current structure and projected changes have major implications for the design of jobs strategies. This paper quantifies and describes the structure of employment in the food economy across four broad segments of activities: agriculture, processing, marketing and food-away-from home. It also examines some of the emerging spatial implications, in particular rural-urban linkages and rural employment diversification, which are related to the transformations that are reshaping this sector. Finally, it looks at policy considerations for designing targeted employment strategies that leverage the links between agricultural productivity, off-farm employment and rural-urban areas and ensure inclusiveness, particularly for youth and women.
Q13|Agriculture, alimentation et emploi en Afrique de l’Ouest|L’économie alimentaire est le premier employeur en Afrique de l’Ouest, avec 66% de l’emploi total. Bien que la majorité de ces emplois soient encore dans l’agriculture, les activités non agricoles liées à l’alimentation progressent à mesure que le secteur s’adapte à l’évolution démographique, à l’urbanisation et à la croissance des revenus. Compte tenu du nombre d’emplois concernés, disposer d’une vision claire des perspectives de l’économie alimentaire est essentiel. Cette Note vise à quantifier et décrire la répartition de l’emploi dans les segments de l’agriculture, de la transformation, de la commercialisation et de la restauration hors domicile. Elle analyse les implications spatiales des transformations en cours, en particulier les interactions urbain-rural et la diversification de l’emploi rural. Enfin, elle propose des pistes politiques pour des stratégies d’emploi ciblées qui optimisent les synergies entre productivité agricole, emploi non agricole et interactions urbain-rural, et garantissent l’inclusion, en particulier des jeunes et des femmes.

Q13|Innovators and Innovations in High Quality Wines of Argentina|How does the process of applying knowledge to the economy work? How do people innovate? What is inside the innovation black box? Can the process be stylized? We apply an economic approach to creativity which provides a general analytical framework to innovation to answer these questions by distinguishing two types of innovations: conceptual and experimental. The development of quality wines which in Argentina began in the 1990s was a process that involves both types of innovations. We analyze two cases of successful winemakers and we characterize their process of innovations to derive lessons with potential managerial and public policy implications. Resumen: ¿Cómo funciona el proceso de aplicar conocimiento a la economía? ¿Cómo innova la gente? ¿Qué hay dentro de la caja negra de la innovación? ¿Cómo puede estilizarse el proceso? Aplicamos un enfoque económico de la creatividad que provee un marco analítico generalpara responder estas preguntas, distinguiendo dos tipos de innovaciones: conceptuales y experimentales. El desarrollo de los vinos de alta calidad en Argentina comenzó en los 1990s y fue un proceso que tuvo ambos tipos de innovaciones. Analizamos dos casos de bodegueros exitosos y caracterizamos sus procesos de innovación para derivar lecciones con potenciales implicaciones gerenciales y de política pública.

Q13|Conectando mercados: vías rurales y producción agrícola en el contexto de una economía dual|Las economías en desarrollo se caracterizan por la coexistencia de sectores tradicionales y modernos, resultado de fallas de mercado, principalmente, costos de transacción. Las vías rurales son uno de los mecanismos para suavizar estas fricciones pues facilitan el acceso a mercados. Estudio el efecto que cambios en la calidad de las vías rurales tienen sobre las decisiones de producción agrícola de los hogares colombianos y encuentro efectos heterogéneos según la distancia a los mercados nacionales y locales. Los hogares centrales reducen su producción mientras los hogares periféricos la expanden, se vuelven más productivos e intensifican el uso de insumos. Este trabajo se une a la literatura que analiza el impacto de vías rurales sobre la productividad agrícola y el cambio estructural.

Abstract This paper identifies the determinants of supply of live cattle for fattening identified in the department of Sucre, Colombia, 2007—2015, under the approach of the Autoregressive Distributed Lag model. The primary supply responds negatively to risk—climate and risk—price in the long and short term; positively to the raw milk price and to the regional slaughter; unlike the final supply, there is no inverse relationship in the primary supply with the short term price which would show the ‘short—term’ vision of marketers, or structural changes in the cattle cycle by the generalization of dual purpose production system.

INTRODUCCIÓN La industria de la carne bovina se divide en tres etapas de acuerdo con la fase de crecimiento del ganado: 1) la producción de la vaca con el ternero; 2) el levante y la ceba; 3) el sacrificio de ganado cebado y embalaje de la carne. En la primera, los productores ganaderos crían una vaca para producir y venden un ternero; el levante es la etapa que transcurre entre el destete y el período de ceba o el primer servicio, que debe producirse cuando el animal alcanza un peso equivalente al 55 o 60% del peso adulto; la ceba es el engorde, en la que el productor ganadero asume la alimentación de los ganados jóvenes por varios meses hasta que estén listos para llevarlos a sacrificio con un peso entre 400—450 kilogramos; la tercera etapa es el sacrificio del ganado gordo, el embalaje y la distribución de la carne. El modelo empresarial de producción de carne vacuna predominante en el departamento de Sucre no es homogéneo: algunas unidades productivas integran dos etapas de la producción: la cría y la ceba, proveyéndose de la materia prima principal —el ternero— con la producción de la misma unidad productiva procedente de la primera etapa. Otras, compran la materia prima principal en mercados organizados, o en explotaciones de cría para hacer ceba intermedia, o completa. La principal fuente de provisión del ganado de levante de estas últimas han sido las subastas ganaderas. En una gran proporción —alrededor del 81% en promedio, según OPCA (2016)—, el ganado vendido en las subastas fueron animales machos de primera calidad de menos de 1 año hasta 1¾ de año, con peso medio entre 120—240 kilogramos, procedente del productor y/o del comercializador. Sobre cuáles son los factores que influyen el comportamiento de esta oferta primaria de ganado vacuno en pie para cebar en la región, se ha indagado poco. El objetivo de este artículo es identificar factores relacionados con su evolución a largo y corto plazo durante el período 2007—2015, mediante la estimación de un modelo econométrico de series de tiempo que los asocie. Abordar este tema proporciona evidencia empírica adicional para contrastar la relación teórica entre la oferta del principal insumo para cebar y sus factores determinantes; por tanto, ayuda a comprender la dinámica del mercado de ganado vacuno regional de levante, y contribuye a evaluar los posibles impactos que podrían generar cambios de dichas variables en la oferta final de ganado para sacrificio. Con tal propósito, luego de esta introducción, el presente informe se estructura de la siguiente manera: se presentan elementos teóricos y empíricos existentes del tema en forma general; se evalúa las características del proceso estocástico generador de los datos, y en la parte final se estima un modelo econométrico autorregresivo con retardos distribuidos, ARDL, para identificar la presencia de relaciones de largo y de corto plazo entre la oferta primaria y las variables que la influyen. 2. ELEMENTOS TEÓRICOS Y EMPÍRICOS La función de oferta total agraria se refiere a la relación analítica existente entre la oferta de un producto agrario y los factores determinantes de esta. Los factores considerados teóricamente como tales son: el precio de los factores o insumos de producción; los cambios en la rentabilidad de actividades competentes; el precio de los productos conjuntos o co—productos; el riesgo, asociado a la variación del clima y de los precios, y factores institucionales (Tomek y Robinson, 2005, pp. 68—78; Castillo, 2015, pp. 197—201). El precio pagado al productor agrario influye la oferta del producto, pues es de esperar que —si los otros factores que afectan la oferta permanecen constantes, y si el costo marginal de producción es creciente—, entre mayor (menor) sea el precio mayor (menor) es la disposición del productor a ofrecer una cantidad mayor de producto. Los principales hallazgos empíricos de la literatura internacional en este tema de la sensibilidad de la oferta agraria al precio han sido resumidos por Mundlak (2000, p. 394; 2001, p. 48). La investigación de orden nacional sobre oferta ganadera destinada a sacrificio ha sido abordada por Kalmanovitz (1982), Lorente (1978), UEA—DNP (1980), Hertford y Nores (1982), García (1983), Jaramillo y Caicedo (1996), bajo el influjo de Jarvis (1974). Estos autores utilizan como indicador la oferta interna final o de consumo (sacrificio + exportaciones), o una medida relativa: la tasa de extracción. Como Jarvis, identifican una relación positiva de largo plazo con el precio, y una relación inversa de corto plazo, como expresión del ciclo ganadero de la ceba. El riesgo se refiere a una situación de aleatoriedad peligrosa para el agricultor: una sequía intensa, una inundación, un ataque de plagas y/o de enfermedades a plantas y animales, la inestabilidad de los precios, cambios de políticas, etc. (OECD, 2009, pp. 15—25). El riesgo—precio y el riesgo—clima están asociados a la naturaleza biológica de la producción agraria y a su dependencia del clima, a la vez que juegan un importante papel en la determinación de la oferta en el corto plazo. La evidencia empírica en el examen del impacto del riesgo sobre la oferta agraria ha sido resumida en Moschini y Hennessy (2001 pp. 87—153), en el que destacan: primero, que la incertidumbre en la producción agraria es una de las razones para el estudio de la producción bajo riesgo; segundo, como lo predice la teoría, se espera que el productor averso al riesgo produzca menos que el productor neutral al riesgo, ceteris paribus; por ende, existe una relación inversa entre riesgo y oferta; tercero, la inclusión del riesgo en los modelos econométricos de estimación de la función de oferta sugiere que el impacto del precio se vuelve más importante, es decir, cuando se tiene en cuenta el riesgo, la oferta es más sensible al precio. La técnica de producción ganadera predominante en la región es la del pastoreo en praderas naturales, en el cual el animal es alimentado con pasturas. Bajo estas condiciones, el riesgo—clima tiene efectos importantes sobre las pasturas y los animales: (i) la precipitación afecta la distribución y cantidad de pasto, los déficits hídricos disminuyen la oferta de alimento, lo cual retarda el crecimiento físico de los animales y les hace perder peso, y (ii) la ausencia o el exceso de la lluvia afecta la predisposición del animal al contagio o ataque de enfermedades y/o plagas, lo cual aumenta la tasa de morbilidad y mortalidad (Herrera, 1995). En ambas situaciones, la variabilidad climática puede generar impactos adversos sobre la producción y la oferta ganaderas. La orientación productiva de la ganadería vacuna en la región es el doble propósito (Dane, 2014). Este sistema es un caso de producción múltiple o conjunta, esto es, se obtienen varios productos utilizando los mismos insumos y factores de producción o, al menos, factores e insumos comunes. La leche es un co—producto de la carne de ganado pues son creados en el mismo proceso y al mismo tiempo. La teoría económica sugiere que el precio del co—producto influencia la oferta del otro producto en sentido directo: el aumento del precio de la leche representa un estímulo para los ganaderos, que optarían por aumentar su inventario o mejorar la nutrición y la salud de las reses, lo cual se traduciría en aumento del número de terneros. La oferta primaria de ganado de levante para cebar es afectada por el ciclo ganadero. La demanda para sacrificio del ganado cebado está influenciada por el diferencial o margen entre el precio de la carne vacuna y el precio del ganado cebado en pie. Entre mayor sea el diferencial de precio, es de esperar una mayor demanda de ganado cebado para sacrificio (Parra y Gómez, 2008, pp. 10—11). En el corto plazo, sin embargo, dada una expectativa de mayor rentabilidad futura por el incremento del precio de la carne, el productor de ganado cebado tiende a retener, especialmente hembras y machos jóvenes (Jarvis, 1974) esperando que se valoricen en el mercado. En esta fase de retención disminuye el sacrificio; al escasear el ganado cebado para sacrificio, se acentúa la demanda por ganado de levante, lo cual lo valoriza relativamente, y ello afecta a la oferta primaria vía precio. La respuesta del productor—cebador conduciría a reducir ventas de machos y hembras jóvenes, pero la de un comercializador podría conducir a aumentarlas para ganar un diferencial de precios alto entre el de la subasta y el del sitio de compra en campo. El precio de los insumos es determinante de la oferta agraria. Teóricamente, a nivel del productor individual, la reducción del precio de un insumo implica una reducción de su costo medio, lo cual significa que, si todo lo demás permanece constante, se reduce el costo medio de producción, desplazándose la curva de costo medio hacia abajo. La curva de costo marginal se desplaza hacia adelante como expresión de que la nueva relación precio del insumo—precio del producto ha disminuido; esto es, se ha abaratado el precio relativo del insumo, lo cual incrementa la cantidad usada de este y la cantidad de producto óptima, como lo indica la teoría microeconómica clásica del productor (Hudson, 2007:43—44). Esta nueva curva de costo marginal intercepta a la nueva curva de costo medio disminuida en su nivel más bajo, que constituye la curva de oferta de largo plazo. Como la oferta de mercado es la suma de las ofertas individuales, aumenta la oferta total. Por tanto, la relación entre el precio del insumo y la oferta es inversa. 3. METODOLOGÍA Para estimar el modelo econométrico que relaciona las variables en estudio se procedió así: Primero, se examinó las propiedades subyacentes del proceso que genera las variables de series de tiempo. Esto es, se determinó si el proceso estocástico (aleatorio) subyacente que generó la serie de tiempo de las variables en cuestión es estacionario o no en media y varianza. Para ello se aplicó la prueba de raíz unitaria de Dickey—Fuller con mínimos cuadrados generalizados destendencializados, propuesta por Elliot, Rothemberg y Stock, ERS (1996), conocida por su sigla en inglés como DF—GLS. Básicamente, esta prueba implica la estimación de la ecuación del test de Dickey—Fuller, aumentada después de sustituir los valores originales de las variables en investigación, yt, por los valores destendencializados de la regresión mínimo cuadrática generalizada, ytd: Donde ytd es la serie examinada destendencializada. La hipótesis nula de existencia de una raíz unitaria en las primeras diferencias de la serie se rechaza si la estimación de ? en la ecuación (1) cae por debajo de los valores críticos propuestos por ERS (1996). Segundo, ya que se trata de estimar relaciones de largo y corto plazo mediante un modelo econométrico dinámico, se realizó la prueba de causalidad de Granger (1969). Esta prueba parte de la idea de que el futuro no puede predecir al pasado; de este modo, si una variable x causa a otra variable y, los cambios en la primera deben preceder a los cambios en la segunda. Por consiguiente, en una regresión de la variable y sobre x , si se incluyen valores pasados de x esto mejora significativamente la predicción de y. Se dice entonces que x causa a y (a la manera de Granger). Aplica una definición similar si y causa a x. La dirección de la causalidad puede incluso ir en ambas direcciones (Gujarati y Porter, 2009). Tercero, el establecimiento de relaciones empíricas entre la oferta y sus determinantes se hizo utilizando el modelo autorregresivo con retardos distribuidos, ARDL (por sus siglas en inglés Autoregressive Distributed Lag). Este enfoque es apropiado para investigar la existencia de relaciones de largo plazo en muestras pequeñas (menos de 80 observaciones) y entre series de tiempo de diferente orden de integración, a diferencia de las técnicas de cointegración de enfoque bivariado de Engle y Granger (1987) y multivariado de Johansen (1995), las cuales exigen que las variables sean integradas todas de orden uno. Este enfoque fue desarrollado por Pesaran y Shin (1999) y Pesaran, Shin y Smith (2001); sin embargo, es necesario que ninguna de estas sea integrada de orden dos, ya que estos datos anulan la metodología. En este sentido, el modelo ARDL utilizado es: ?Q = variación de la oferta de ganado macho para ceba; P = el precio del ganado vivo en el mercado; S = sacrificio de vacunos en el Caribe colombiano; Rc = el riesgo—clima; Pl = el precio de la leche; Rp= riesgo—precio. Las expresiones t — j, t — k, t — l, t — i, t — h, t — u, representan la longitud máxima del número de retardos apropiados para las variables1. ?j, ?k, ?l, ?i, ?h, ?u son los coeficientes de corto plazo a estimar. ?1, ?2, ?3, ?4, ?5, ?6, son los coeficientes de largo plazo. ?1t es el término de error; ln = logaritmo natural. Dado que las variables se expresan en logaritmo natural, los coeficientes a estimar son elasticidades y tasas de crecimiento. Seleccionada la estructura del modelo, se aplica la prueba Multiplicador de Lagrange, LM, de Breusch—Godfrey (1978) con el fin de probar la ausencia de correlación serial en los errores de la ecuación (2). Comprobado lo anterior, se realizó la prueba Límites (Bounds Test), propuesta por Pesaran, Shin & Smith (2001), basada en un estadístico estándar. Esta es una prueba de cointegración que contrasta la ausencia de una relación de largo plazo, esto es, prueba la hipótesis nula: H0: ?1 = ?2 = ?3 = ?4 = ?5 = ?6 = 0 en la ecuación (2), contra la alterna HA: no es cierto. Un rechazo de H0 implica que se tiene una relación de cointegración de largo plazo. Si los resultados dan evidencia de una relación de largo plazo, se estima la función de cointegración de largo y corto plazo, las cuales se definen, respectivamente, así: La ecuación (4) es estimada con las variables en diferencias, y el coeficiente ? de zt—1 indica la velocidad del ajuste hacia el equilibrio de largo plazo, que se espera sea significativo y negativo. Para medir la repuesta de la oferta agraria a distintos factores, este enfoque ha sido utilizado por Muchapondwa (2009) en el caso de la oferta agregada de los cultivos en Zimbawe; Ogundari (2016) del maíz a los precios en Nigeria; Ozkan y Karaman (2011) del área de algodón en Turquía; Wyk y Treurnicht (2012) en la oferta de carne de oveja; Maleki et al. (2012) en la oferta de exportación de carne en Irán. En cuanto a la información, la oferta primaria se midió como la cantidad mensual vendida de ganado vacuno macho en pie de primera calidad entre las edades menos de 1 a 1¾ de año en subastas comerciales en el departamento de Sucre, procedente de la unidad productiva ganadera y/o de un comercializador. El precio del producto es un promedio ponderado por las cantidades de las edades consideradas; la unidad de medida es pesos corrientes por kilogramo de ganado vivo, obtenido del Observatorio de precios y costos agrarios del noroccidente del Caribe colombiano, OPCA, de la Universidad de Córdoba, Colombia. La información de las precipitaciones pluviales proviene del Instituto de Hidrología, Meteorología y Estudios Ambientales, IDEAM (2016); a partir de ella se construyó el coeficiente de variación de las precipitaciones mensuales, como proxy al riesgo—clima. El riesgo—precio se midió como la desviación típica de una media móvil de tres meses del precio por kilogramo, propuesto por Behrman (1968). El sacrificio de vacunos en el Caribe colombiano, medido en número de animales, se utilizó como una variable proxy al ciclo de la ceba en la región, y proviene de las encuestas de sacrificio de ganado vacuno del DANE (2015). El precio del co—producto es el precio de la leche cruda pagada al productor por la industria en el departamento de Sucre, obtenido del Ministerio de Agricultura y Desarrollo Rural (MADR, 2015), y expresado en pesos corrientes por litro de leche cruda. Para medir la incidencia del precio del insumo se tomó la relación precio de la úrea/precio del ganado en pie. Como una aproximación a la rentabilidad de productos competentes se utilizó el precio relativo del arroz. Ninguna de estas dos últimas variables resultó significativa. La periodicidad de las variables utilizadas es mensual durante el periodo 2007M1—2015M12. Se utilizó el software Econometric—Views, Versión 9.5, para los cálculos del modelo. 4. RESULTADOS Y ANÁLISIS 4.1. Estacionariedad y causalidad a lo Granger La tabla 1 muestra el cálculo del estadístico de la prueba DF—GLS en la ecuación (1). El resultado de las variables originales en niveles permite rechazar la hipótesis nula de la existencia de raíz unitaria en las series Q, Rc y Pl, por tanto, son integradas de orden cero, I(0) . En el caso de las variables P, Rp, y S, la hipótesis nula se rechaza en primeras diferencias, lo que significa que son integradas de orden 1, I(1). Los resultados de la prueba de causalidad a lo Granger2 indican que se rechaza al 1% de significación la hipótesis nula: las variaciones de P, Rc, Rp y S no causan las variaciones de la oferta con 2, 2,3 y 6 retardos, respectivamente; en el caso de Pl se aceptó la hipótesis nula. 4.2. Modelo de la oferta del ganado vacuno macho en pie para cebar Estructura del modelo La especificación del número de retardos de la variable dependiente oferta de ganado macho de primera calidad, Q, tuvo un máximo apropiado de 3 retardos, y 4 para las demás variables regresoras. La estructura seleccionada es: (1, 2, 2, 4, 4, 2); es decir: 1 retardo para Q; Pl = 2; P = 2; Rc = 4; Rp = 4 y S = 2. Los resultados de la prueba LM sobre los errores de la estimación de la ecuación (2) con 4 retardos incluidos para la oferta mostraron un p—valor mayor al nivel de significancia del 5% (p—valor = 0,9184). Por tanto, se acepta la hipótesis nula de no correlación en los residuos. Prueba Límites (Bounds Test) La tabla 2 muestra los resultados de la prueba Límites. Indica que existe una fuerte evidencia para rechazar la hipótesis nula de que los coeficientes de largo plazo son cero (?1 = ?2 = ?3 = ?4 = ?5 = ?6 = 0) pues el F calculado, igual a 10,34 con 5 grados de libertad (k=5), supera los valores críticos de los límites superiores en el nivel de significancia del 1%. El modelo de largo y corto plazo de oferta de ganado para ceba La estimación del modelo de oferta de largo y corto plazo del ganado macho para cebar comercializado en las subastas del departamento de Sucre, con las variables en niveles y en primeras diferencias respectivamente, se muestra en la tabla 3. La relación de cointegración de largo plazo muestra que la oferta primaria responde de manera negativa y significativa al riesgo—clima: un aumento o una disminución del 10% en la desviación estándar de las precipitaciones con respecto a su media mensual genera una disminución en el largo plazo de la oferta de ganado macho del 4,9% en promedio. Para el conjunto de la producción agraria en Colombia, Jaramillo y Junguito (1993) identificaron esa relación inversa. En el corto plazo, la tabla 3 indica que las ventas de ganado macho para cebar está influenciada en sentido positivo y de manera significativa (al 1% de significación) por las siguientes variables: (i) Las variaciones de su precio: un aumento (o disminución) del 5% en el precio por kilo del mes anterior aumenta (o disminuye) en 9,2% la oferta del mes siguiente. (ii) los cambios en el sacrificio regional de ganado vacuno en el mes corriente y en el anterior: un aumento del 10% en el sacrificio de ganado vacuno en el mes pasado y en el de hoy produce un aumento contemporáneo de las cantidades ofertadas de ganado macho de 6,5% y 5,6%, respectivamente. (iii) Las variaciones del precio de la leche cruda (aunque con menos rigor estadístico, significativa al 5%): una variación del 1% en su precio en el mes anterior provoca que la oferta corriente de ganado de levante varíe en 0,6%. El primer resultado3, señalado como (i), contrasta con la relación que se ha encontrado en la investigación a nivel nacional cuando se considera la oferta final de ganado cebado para sacrificio en la que, como se señaló antes, la relación de corto plazo entre la oferta y el precio es inversa. Una primera explicación de este hecho estaría relacionada con lo siguiente: (a) La lógica económica del comercializador es más de corto plazo y su objetivo inmediato es vender rápido para ganar la máxima diferencia entre el precio de venta en subasta y el precio de compra en la unidad productiva, especialmente en época de retención4. (b) La intensificación del componente de leche en el sistema de producción doble propósito ha producido modificaciones en el ciclo de la ceba de manera que precios más altos de la leche, aún con bajos precios de la carne o del cebado vivo, conducen a retener la hembra para producir más leche, y vender más crías (Suárez, 2005, p. 41). (iv) En sentido inverso, los cambios en el riesgo—clima afectan en el corto plazo la oferta: variaciones del 1% en la desviación estándar de las precipitaciones con respecto a su media del mes en curso y la de tres meses atrás provoca, en promedio, una disminución de la oferta en cuestión del 0,19% y 0,13% en el mes corriente. (v) Los productores y comercializadores son aversos al riesgo—precio: una desviación de $100 COP con respecto a la media móvil trimestral del precio por kilo dos meses atrás disminuye la oferta corriente en 0,12%. El coeficiente del término de corrección de errores, z—1 , el cual representa la velocidad de ajuste hacia el largo plazo, tiene el signo esperado y es significativo; el resultado de este coeficiente es menor a la unidad e indica que, aproximadamente, el 80% del error de largo plazo en la oferta del ganado macho con la presencia de lluvias se corrige en el mes siguiente. 5. CONCLUSIÓN En este informe de investigación se analizó la oferta primaria de ganado macho en pie para ceba en Sucre y sus determinantes durante el periodo 2007—2015 mediante la estimación de un modelo ARDL. Los resultados destacan la sensibilidad de productores y comercializadores a dos factores importantes de la producción ganadera: el clima, en particular en un sistema de pastoreo natural; y el precio, en un sistema de mercado. Ante la amplia variabilidad de estos factores, tienden a reducir la cantidad de producto ofrecido en el corto y largo plazo. En esta etapa de la producción de ganado no se evidenció una relación inversa de corto plazo entre la oferta y su precio, lo cual parece ser un resultado de la lógica económica de ganancia cortoplacista que subyace en el comercializador, pero también podría ser que la intensificación del componente leche, en el sistema de producción doble propósito regional, probablemente haya modificado las características estructurales del ciclo de la ceba, que es más evidente como un fenómeno nacional. Una implicación de política derivada de este estudio: primera, tener una política de manejo de agua que reduzca la dependencia de dicha actividad, pues las desviaciones de largo plazo del nivel de oferta se corrigen rápidamente con la presencia de este factor. Segunda, en un contexto de reducción anual del hato vacuno departamental durante el período de estudio, sería recomendable políticas de apoyo para repoblamiento bovino en la etapa de vaca—cría con el productor directo de ganado. Tercera, avanzar en mecanismos financieros que contribuyan a reducir el riesgo—precio y riesgo—clima ante productores aversos al mismo Notas 1 El número de retardos máximos se define utilizando el criterio de información Akaike, AIC. 2 Por razones de espacio no se incluyen los resultados, pero están disponibles para los editores y lectores. 3 Con menos contundencia estadística, Arrieta y Bracamonte (2016) hallaron esa misma relación directa entre la oferta de ganado hembra de levante con el precio y el sacrificio. 4 Contribuye a explicar este hecho también que durante 2007—2015 se encontró una correlación inversa entre la variación del inventario ganadero anual y la de la oferta de ganado macho y hembra de levante vendida en subasta, aunque no es estadísticamente significativa la correlación. La correlación entre inventario y ventas debe esperarse directa. BIBLIOGRAFÍA Behrman, J. (1968). Supply response in underdeveloped agriculture: a case study of four mayor crop in Thailand.

Q13|How Large Are the Contributions of Cities to the Development of Rural Communities? A Market Access Approach for a Quarter Century of Evidence from Chile|This article estimates the impact of cities on the economic development of rural communities in Chile, following a market access approach. The effect of the proximity to cities on the development of rural communities is analyzed by estimating the impact of market access on the population, and farm and non-farm employment of rural communities. Using population censuses and remote sensing data, we find, in our preferred estimations, that a 10% higher market access induced a 10%–14% increase in the population of rural communities. Additionally, higher positive elasticities are found in the non-farm sector rather than in the agricultural one. These results widely support the hypothesis of structural change and the diversification of the rural economy for rural communities with better access to markets. Notwithstanding, the evidence also suggests that the farm sector took important advantages from market access in places with better agro-ecological conditions.
Q13|Operationalizing the SAARC Food Bank: Issues and Solutions|The SAARC Food Bank (SFB) embodies collective effort of South Asian countries to ensure food security at times when emergencies lead to largescale disruptions in food production, transportation, accessibility and availability. In view of the urgent need for an appropriate institutional architecture to address the ever-rising food security concerns in South Asia, issues of proper operationalization of the SFB have assumed critical importance. This paper enquires into the underlying reasons why this regional arrangement has failed to deliver the expected results and how to raise the efficacy of the SFB in order for it to service its stated mandate of deploying food reserves to affected areas during food emergencies. Based on a comparative study of select international best practices and primary surveys, the paper offers concrete recommendations for determination of thresholds that should define food emergency situations, modalities of distribution of food from the SFB, design of pricing strategies, maintenance of the food stock and ensuring quality of the reserves, derestriction of trade in food grains during emergencies, establishment of a dispute settlement mechanism, and options for institutional tie-ups with similar outfits.
Q13|The Welfare Economics of Dismantling Dairy Quota in a Confederation of States| Supply-restricting marketing boards shift the costs of agricultural support payments from the treasury to consumers. Canada, Australia and the European Union adopted quota regimes in dairy, but Australia and the EU subsequently dismantled their programs, while providing milk producers with compensation, but the dairy quota system remains entrenched in Canada. In this paper, dairy policies in the aforementioned jurisdictions, plus the U.S. and New Zealand are reviewed, and a stylized description of the EU reform is provided. An applied welfare economics framework based on the EU experience is then used to investigate potential mechanisms for reforming Canada’s dairy quota regime. The main issue regards producers’ compensation. The analysis shows that one has to be careful not to overcompensate producers, which could make a reform program prohibitively expensive on the treasury. The analysis provides a framework within which policy discussions regarding compensation can take place.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Q13|Cooperative Wineries and Wine Marketing in Spain|Cooperative wineries emerged with a double objective: on the one hand, the common production ofwine, to reduce production costs and at the same time to increase the quality of the product; on the other hand, the common sale of wine, with a reduction of intermediaries and an improvement of the position of winegrowers in the marketing process. Both objectives had to lead to a higher remuneration for the product and, consequently, for producers’ income. In the wine sector producers were mainly small family farmers who faced a context of tendential fall in wine prices and, consequently, a decrease in their income. If the advantages of winemaking in common seem obvious, success in the second objective seems more doubtful. In this article we want to analyze the marketing of wine in Spain through the cooperative wineries: What was their role in the wine trade? What types of sales did they adopt and why? How did they adapt to changes in the wine consumption patterns?
Q13|Impacto del crédito sobre los productores de café en Colombia|Utilizamos una extensa base de datos de panel del período 2006-2014, proveniente de múltiples fuentes de información, entre las que están el Fondo para el Financiamiento del Sector Agropecuario (Finagro), el Sistema de Potenciales Beneficiarios para Programas Sociales (SISBEN) y el Sistema de Información Cafetera (SICA). Con ésta, evaluamos el impacto del crédito en el sector cafetero, considerando dos conjuntos de variables de resultado: de la finca (como área de café, edad de los cafetales y densidad); y del nivel de vida de los cafeteros (el Índice de Calidad de Vida y cada uno de sus componentes). Por medio de un modelo de datos de panel con efectos fijos e instrumentos, junto con un soporte común dado por propensity scores estimados, encontramos que el crédito tiene un efecto beneficioso y significativo sobre ambos conjuntos de variables de resultado. Argumentamos que nuestros resultados no se deben solo al cumplimiento de la ejecución (enforcement), sino al efecto causal del crédito sobre las variables. Los hallazgos son robustos a cambios en la especificación y a variaciones en la metodología de estimación.
Q13|Vertical Integration and Relational Contracts: Evidence from the Costa Rica Coffee Chain|This paper compares integrated firms, long-term relationships and markets, and how they adapt to shocks in the Costa Rican coffee chain. The industry is characterised by significant uncertainty. Supply failures responses to unanticipated increases in reference prices reveal that integration and relationships reduce opportunism. Trade volumes responses to weather-induced increases in supply reveal that relationships provide demand assurance, although less than integration does. This benefit of integration is offset by costs when trading outside of the integrated chain. The evidence supports models in which firms boundaries alter temptations to renege on relational contracts and, consequently, the allocation of resources.
Q13|Supply Uncertainty and Foreign Direct Investment in Agri-food Industry|We investigate whether and to what extent agricultural uncertainty drives the location of capital in the food processing industry. We show that when a risk-neutral food company has the possibility of exercising market power as both seller and buyer, the impact of agricultural uncertainty on the decision of producing abroad depends on whether the multinational makes the pricing/production decision before or after uncertainty is revealed. An econometric study is then needed to identify the mechanisms at work. The theoretical implications are tested by using a gravity model on European countriesÕ and the United StatesÕ outward FDI stock, detailed by destination country in the agri-food industry. Overall, our results suggest that a higher agricultural volatility in the home country triggers investments abroad and that a host country exhibiting low agricultural uncertainty attracts relatively more foreign capital. Moreover, international differences in agricultural uncertainty generate incentives for Vertical disintegration by food companies, especially when trade costs are sufficiently low.
Q13|Oil palm development and forced displacement in Colombia: Causal or spurious?|This article analyses whether forced displacement in the Magdalena Department (Colombia) between 2000-2010 was caused not only by the intensity of the armed conflict but also by the growth of the palm agribusiness. We find that a seven percentage point increase in the area used to produce palm per municipality caused an increase of a third of a standard deviation in the rate of forced displacement. These calculations were made on average and after controlling for armed conflict. We rationalize this finding by the fact that the development of the palm oil agribusiness caused displacement due to its land-intensive technology, increasing international prices combined with government subsidies, and the process was aided by paramilitary activities in the region. ***** Este artículo analiza si el desplazamiento forzado en el departamento del Magdalena (Colombia) entre los años 2000-2010 tuvo como causa no solo la intensidad del conflicto armado sino también el crecimiento del agronegocio de la palma. Encontramos que un aumento del 7% en la zona utilizada para la producción de palma por municipalidad causó un aumento de un tercio de una desviación estándar en el índice de desplazamiento forzado. Dichos cálculos se hicieron por término medio y tras el control del conflicto armado. Racionalizamos este hallazgo por el hecho de que el desarrollo del agronegocio del aceite de palma provocó desplazamiento debido a su tecnología intensiva en tierra, aumento de precios internacionales combinado con subsidios gubernamentales y que al proceso contribuyeron actividades paramilitares en la región.
Q13|Las grandes empresas agropecuarias en Argentina: los casos de Cresud y El Tejar|En este artículo se analizan las “historias de vida” de las dos empresas que aparecen en la prensa y la literatura como las más grandes de la producción agraria pampeana: Cresud y El Tejar. Con ello, se procura aportar evidencia empírica y elementos de análisis para evaluar si las llamadas “grandes empresas agropecuarias”, que irrumpieron en la producción agraria pampeana en las últimas décadas, constituyen capitales agrarios equiparables a los capitales concentrados dominantes en el resto de la economía nacional. Las conclusiones a las que se arriba desafían varias concepciones dominantes en la literatura especializada. ***** This article presents an in-depth study of the ‘life story’ of the two companies described by the press and the literature as the largest in Pampas agricultural production: Cresud and El Tejar. The objective of this study is to provide empirical evidence and elements of analysis to assess whether the so-called ‘big agricultural enterprises’, which have sprung up over recent decades in Pampas’ agricultural production, are comparable to the concentrated capitals that dominate the rest of the national economy. The study’s conclusions challenge several of the dominant ideas in the relevant literature.
Q13|Producers to Markets Alliance. Informe Final. Estudio de Línea de Base|Este documento presenta los principales resultados del Estudio de Línea de Base para el Programa Producers to Markets Alliance –PMA- financiado por la Agencia para la Cooperación Internacional del Gobierno de los Estados Unidos –USAID- y elaborado por FEDESARROLLO. The Producers to Markets Alliance (PMA) pretende aumentar la competitividad y los ingresos sostenibles de por lo menos 75.000 productores localizados en 40 municipios de 10 departamentos en 7 corredores e incluidos en las cadenas productivas de cacao, cafés especiales, caucho, leche y frutas y hortalizas, mediante el aumento en el valor de las exportaciones y de las ventas de las organizaciones de productores a los compradores finales del sector privado en alianzas al interior de las cadenas productivas seleccionadas y superando obstáculos derivados de las deficiencias en infraestructura, especialmente en mantenimiento de vías terciarias y sistemas de riego, con especial énfasis en jóvenes, mujeres y minorías étnicas, con una visión de aprendizaje y gestión del conocimiento. Para realizar el Estudio de Línea de Base del Programa Producers to Markets Alliance –PMA- se llevó a cabo un análisis cuantitativo basado en la aplicación de 94 encuestas a asociaciones de productores (censo), 653 encuestas a productores de 7.363 productores asociados a ellas, y 34 encuestas a municipios incluidos en el Programa; los instrumentos de recolección se diseñaron con base en Talleres de Expertos (TE) en cada una de las cadenas. Igualmente, se realizó un análisis cualitativo basado en la realización de 60 Entrevistas a Profundidad (EP): 30 a funcionarios municipales, 15 a presidentes de asociaciones y 15 a técnicos de campo, y en la realización de 15 Grupos Focales con productores (3 en cada una de las cadenas), con base en los cuales se realizó una codificación en Atlas.ti que permitió construir matrices HCR (Hallazgos, Conclusiones, Recomendaciones) para cada una de las cadenas bajo estudio. Finalmente, se aplicaron Métodos Mixtos (QCA). Todo lo anterior, se aplicó para las cinco cadenas bajo estudio: cacao, café, caucho, leche y frutas-hortalizas. La línea de base contiene una batería de indicadores para medir el desempeño de las asociaciones, de los productores y de los municipios que serán beneficiados por la estrategia del PMA. En esta sección se presenta un resumen de los indicadores que miden aspectos que son transversales a todas o a varias de las 5 cadenas productivas focalizadas. Todos los indicadores de desempeño de las asociaciones se pueden consultar en el Anexo No 1, los indicadores de desempeño de los productores en el Anexo 2 y los indicadores de desempeño de los municipios.
Q13|An intermediary’s optimal geographical expansion choice under uncertainty|High transport costs to reach markets and obtaining low prices on these markets make it difficult for small-scale farmers in developing countries to market their production. Geographically isolated farmers therefore often have to rely on intermediaries to transport and sell their output on markets. To collect output from farmers, these intermediaries have to make investments while facing uncertainty due to the volatility of agricultural prices on world markets. Using real options, we establish the optimal investment strategy for an intermediary in terms of when to invest and with how many geographically dispersed farmers to contract with. We also establish how, after the initial investment, the intermediary should optimally further expand its collection area. We determine what public authorities could do to encourage the emergence of intermediaries who collect production from isolated farmers. Finally, we apply our framework to analyze investment decisions made by intermediaries in the milk sector in Senegal.
Q13|Vertical Integration and Relational Contracts: Evidence from the Costa Rica Coffee Chain|This paper compares integrated firms, long-term relationships and markets, and how they adapt to shocks in the Costa Rican coffee chain. The industry is characterised by significant uncertainty. Supply failures responses to unanticipated increases in reference prices reveal that integration and relationships reduce opportunism. Trade volumes responses to weather-induced increases in supply reveal that relationships provide demand assurance, although less than integration does. This benefit of integration is offset by costs when trading outside of the integrated chain. The evidence supports models in which firms boundaries alter temptations to renege on relational contracts and, consequently, the allocation of resources.
Q13|Competition in Agricultural Markets: An Experimental Approach|This paper presents an experimental approach to measure competition in agricultural markets, based on the random allocation of subsidies to competing traders. We compare prices of subsidized and unsubsidized crop traders to recover the key market structure parameter in a standard model of imperfect competition. By combining the experimental results with quasi-experimental estimates of the pass-through rate, we also estimate market size, or the effective number of traders competing for farmers' supply. In the context of the Sierra Leone cocoa industry, our results point to a competitive agricultural trading sector and suggest that the market size is substantially larger than the village. The methodology developed in this paper uses purely individual-level treatment to shed light on market structure. This approach may be useful for the many cases in which market-level randomization is not feasible.
Q13|The Ethiopian Commodity Exchange and spatial price dispersion|In this article, we study the impact of an institutional intervention on market efficiency in Ethiopia. More specifically, we analyze to what extent the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange (ECX) in combination with regional warehouses have contributed to a reduction in price spreads between regional markets. Our hypothesis is that warehouses connected to the ECX reduce the dispersion between export prices and local retail prices in different coffee growing areas, as well as the dispersion between export prices and local retail prices in different coffee growing areas. By doing so, the ECX has the potential to improve the market efficiency. To identify the causal effect, we combine retail price data with information on the gradual rollout of warehouses connected to the ECX from 2007 to 2012. Our results suggest that, when two markets both have access to an operating warehouse, the average price spread is 0.86–1.78 ETB lower than it is for markets where at least one part lacks warehouse access. This is a substantial reduction considering that the average price spread over the full period is 3.33 ETB. The main results are robust to various econometric specifications, and our analysis thus suggests that local warehouses connected to the ECX have indeed improved market efficiency.
Q13|Consumer preferences before and after a food safety scare: An experimental analysis of the 2010 egg recall|In August 2010, more than half a billion eggs were recalled in the U.S. because of a Salmonella outbreak. This study examines the effect of the recall with a unique pair of auction experiments investigating willingness to pay (WTP) for conventional and organic eggs, one conducted shortly before and one right after the recall with the same participants. In addition to the before and after bids, participants bid again after a negative information or balanced information treatment about the event. Accompanying surveys showed consumers had a high level of awareness of the recall but less knowledge of specific details, and viewed information on egg farm conditions as very important in their WTP. While there were no significant before and after differences, WTP for organic eggs significantly increased in the negative information treatment, and balanced information had a positive effect on consumer WTP for conventional eggs.
Q13|Farmers’ preferences for supermarket contracts in Kenya|With the modernization of global agri-food systems, the role of contract farming increases. This also involves smallholder farmers in developing countries. While previous studies have looked at economic impacts of contract schemes on smallholder farmers, little is known about farmers’ preferences for contracting in general, and for specific contract design attributes in particular. Better understanding farmers’ preferences and constraints is important to make smallholder contract schemes more viable and beneficial. This article builds on a choice experiment to analyze farmers’ preferences and preference heterogeneity for contracts in Kenya. In the study region, supermarkets use contracts to source fresh vegetables directly from preferred suppliers. However, farmer dropout rates are high. Mixed logit models are estimated to examine farmers’ attitudes towards critical contract design attributes. Having to deliver their harvest to urban supermarkets is costly; hence farmers require a significant output price premium. Farmers also dislike delayed payments that are commonplace in contract schemes. The most problematic contract attribute is related to unpredictable product rejection rates, substantially adding to farmers’ risk. Designing contracts with lower transaction costs, more transparent quality grading, and fairer risk-sharing arrangements could enhance smallholder participation in supermarket procurement channels.
Q13|MBNQA Approach in Quality Management Supporting Sustainable Business Performance in Agribusiness|Despite attention being paid to quality management in the literature, little empirical research has been conducted on developing the link between adoption of quality management approach and business performance in agricultural enterprises, and moreover, only a few empirical studies have investigated this issue in Central and Eastern Europe. The conducted empirical survey examines the relationship between adopting the quality management approach and business performance from the perspective of agricultural enterprises in Slovakia. The empirical findings are based on 70 responses from agribusinesses in Slovak Republic. To measure the adopting of quality management approach the MBNQA model was used. The authors have used linear regression as an evaluation method. Based on the results it can be concluded the adopting of quality management approach is determined by ownership. The enterprises owned by the owner from abroad adopt the quality management approach more readily than the domestic ones. The size of the enterprise and type of production do not determine the adopting of quality management approach in the agricultural enterprises in the Slovak Republic. This study contributes to the European research that studies the relation between quality management and business performance of agribusinesses by means of an empirical investigation in agricultural organizations in a transition economy such as Slovakia.
Q13|Best Practices for Integrating the Romanian Small Farmers into the Agri-Food Chain|In the modern market economy, agri-food chains were imposed and strengthened due to unprecedented evolving recorded by supply and demand of food in recent decades, dynamic driven by market fragmentation, on the one hand, and specific processes of consumption and consumer emancipation, on the other hand. The objective of the paper aims to bring to the fore the best practices for support the Romanian small farmers to facilitate their access to the market, which is often dominated by large distribution networks. Reality has shown that financial support is not enough, even if farmers use modern and efficient technological systems, and that it is a need for an efficient integration of small producers in the agri-food sector. To highlight the best practices that can be used by Romanian small farmers were used information derived from: literature study on problems regarding the food sector; analysis of studies conducted by the consulting companies specialised in this field; analysing the consequences of recent legislation concerning the marketing of food products, namely its implementation in our country, especially in terms of small agricultural producers and their access to the Romanian market.

Q13|Trading off nutrition and education? A panel data analysis of the dissimilar welfare effects of Organic and Fairtrade standards|Millions of smallholder farmers in developing countries participate in different types of sustainability standards. A growing body of literature has analyzed the welfare effects, with mixed results. Yet, there are important knowledge gaps. First, most existing studies have looked at the effects of one standard in one country. When comparing between studies it is unclear whether dissimilar outcomes are the result of different standards or different local conditions. Second, most studies have used cross-section data, so that selectivity issues remain a challenge. Third, existing work has primarily analyzed effects in terms of purely economic indicators, such as prices and income, ignoring other dimensions of household welfare. We address these shortcomings using panel data from small-scale coffee producers in Uganda and comparing the effects of two of the most popular sustainability standards, namely Organic and Fairtrade. Welfare effects are analyzed in terms of household expenditures, child education, and nutrition. Results show that Organic and Fairtrade both have positive effects on total consumption expenditures. However, notable differences are observed in terms of the other outcomes. Organic contributes to improved nutrition but has no effect on education. For Fairtrade it is exactly the other way around. We explore the mechanisms behind these differences.
Q13|Impact of agricultural technology adoption on market participation in the rural social network system|This paper provides empirical evidence regarding the impact of agricultural technologies on smallholders’ output market participation. The analysis is based on Farmer Innovation Fund impact evaluation survey collected by the World Bank in 2010-2012 covering 2,675 households in Ethiopia. Endogenous treatment effect and sample selection models are employed to account for the self-selection bias in technology adoption and market participation. Regressions based on matching techniques are employed for robustness check. The estimation results show that the use of improved agricultural inputs significantly affects farm households marketable surplus production. We found evidence that application of high-yielding varieties increases surplus crop production by 7.39 percent per year, whereas chemical fertilizer use increases surplus by 2.32 percent. When farmers apply the two inputs jointly, marketed surplus increases by 6 percent which establish the complementarity of the two technologies. Marketable surplus crop production and market participation of farmers are determined by access to modern inputs, crop price, farm size, availability of labor, and infrastructure. Access to credit and training fosters technology adoption. Therefore, agriculture and rural development policy need to focus on supporting agricultural technology adoption.
Q13|Trains, Trade, and Transaction Costs: How Does Domestic Trade by Rail Affect Market Prices of Malawi Agricultural Commodities?|We measure the impact of low-cost transport by rail in Malawi on the dispersion of agricultural commodity prices across markets by exploiting the quasi-experimental design of the nearly total collapse of domestic transport by rail in January 2003 due to the destruction of a railway bridge at Rivirivi, Balaka. Estimations are based on monthly market prices of four agricultural commodities (maize, groundnuts, rice, and beans) in 27 local markets for the period 1998–2006. Market pairs connected by rail when the railway line was operational are intervention observations. Railway transport services explain a 14 to 17 percent reduction in price dispersion across markets. Geographical reach of trade varies by crop, most likely related to storability and geographical spread of production. Perishability appears to increase impact, reflecting limited scope for arbitrage. Overall, impacts are remarkably similar in size across commodities.
Q13|Collaborative networks and export intensity in family firms: a quantile regression approach|This paper examines if collaborative networks affect the export status and intensity in family firms. We suggest that the network effect is more relevant when the firm has low export intensity because when the firm is in the first stages of internationalization, networks are very useful to provide export resources and to solve common problems. However, this role becomes less relevant when firms show higher export intensity. For the empirical analysis, we use a dynamic Heckman-Probit model, using in the second stage a quantile regression model.
Q13|One-stop shopping behavior, buyer power, and upstream merger incentives|We analyze how consumer preferences for one-stop shopping affect the (Nash) bargaining relationships between a retailer and its suppliers. One-stop shopping preferences create 'demand complementarities' among otherwise independent products which lead to two opposing effects on upstream merger incentives: first a standard double mark-up problem and second a bargaining effect. The former creates merger incentives while the later induces suppliers to bargain separately. When buyer power becomes large enough, then suppliers stay separated which raises final good prices. We also show that our result can be obtained when wholesale prices are determined in a non-cooperative game, under two-part tariffs and when products are substitutable.
Q13|The excessive choice effect meets the market: A field experiment on craft beer choice|Research in psychology suggests that, somewhat paradoxically, providing consumers more choices can reduce the likelihood of making a purchase, producing the so-called excessive choice effect (ECE). To the extent an ECE exists, firms have an incentive to alleviate the effect through a variety of institutional nudges that promote consumers to make a choice. This study empirically tests the effectiveness of two institutional nudges on the ECE in a field experiment at a bar. Focusing on craft beer sales, we manipulate the number of options on the menu and use institutional nudges (a control menu, a menu with a special prominently displayed, and a menu with Beer Advocate scores). In the field experiment, the ECE was alive and well using the control menu, but the effect reversed itself when the menu included Beer Advocate scores. Our results suggest the ECE might be turned on and off by manipulating search costs.
Q13|The welfare effects of coffee price volatility for Ethiopian coffee producers|Purpose - This paper aims to estimate the welfare effects for Ethiopian coffee producers from eliminating coffee price volatility. Design/methodology/approach - To estimate volatility, the generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity technique is applied to monthly coffee prices in Ethiopia for the period 1976-2012. To distinguish between the unpredictable and predictable components of volatility, we obtain separate estimates of the conditional and unconditional variance of the residual. This is combined with estimates of the coefficient of relative risk aversion to measure the welfare effects from eliminating the unpredictable component of price volatility. Findings - A key finding is that the welfare gain from eliminating coffee price volatility is small; the gain per producer comes to a meagre US$0.76 in a year. Originality/value - This has important policy implications for the efficacy of price stabilisation mechanisms for coffee producers, i.e. any attempt to eliminate coffee price volatility at a cost may not be a preferred outcome for Ethiopian producers. The contribution of the paper lies in using the unconditional variance, as it more truly reflects price risk faced by coffee producers without overestimating it.
Q13|Chained to Sustainable Development Goals? The Changing Role of Entities for Enhanced Resilience along Agriculture Food Value Chains in Thailand|The operation period of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) ended in 2015, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will be in operation in 2016-2030. The sustainable development agenda contained 17 goals and covered a broad range of quantitative and qualitative objectives across social, economic, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. These include (i) ending poverty and hunger, (ii) sustainable consumption and production, (iii) improving health and education, (iv) making cities more sustainable, (v) combating climate change, and (vi) protecting oceans and forests. Sustainable food production, marketing, and other post-harvest management practices are important to achieving majority of the SDGs. This paper examines the required changing roles of private and public organisations, as well as international organisations, in 2016-2030 to enhance resilience of agricultural food value chains in Thailand. The Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP) of Thailand is a growth and development model characterised by its universality and inclusiveness; people-centred approach; moderation, moral values, and reasonableness; and knowledge and integrity. The SEP encourages a holistic farm management system to promote sustainability, food security, water conservation and biodiversity, development of human resources, risk management, investment, and expansion of businesses, thereby creating self-sufficiency at the household, community, organisational, and national levels. These objectives of the SEP are somewhat consistent with Goals 1, 2, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, and 15 of the SDGs. The required roles of organisations to enable Thailand to achieve the SDGs towards enhancing the resilience of agricultural food value chains are presented, and the policy implications are highlighted.
Q13|Assessing the Competitive Advantage of Public Policy Support for Supply Chain Resilience|This paper deals with the supply chain resilience of agricultural products in Japan. First, the food flow of Japan is explained. Japanese farmers and fishers produce and sell their products, receiving 9.4 trillion Japanese yen (¥). At the same time, Japan imports raw products and processed food. The fresh products move through the market to the eating out sector, the processing sector, and consumers. During this process, the value of agricultural products increases and consumers pay ¥73.5 trillion. Food flow sometimes suffers disasters, such as heavy rains, flooding, low temperatures, strong winds, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and tsunamis. In April 2016, a strong earthquake hit the Kumamoto area, severely affecting the production and supply of watermelons. To increase the resilience of the agricultural supply chain, the sixth industrialisation is effective and well established. Japan's sixth industry contains 60,000 businesses. Most of them are food processing and direct shop businesses. Direct shops are operated by farmers, farmers' groups, farmers' companies, municipalities, cooperatives, and producers' groups. They sell mostly vegetables, fruits, and processed food. Direct shop K is located on the urban fringe of Chiba prefecture. Since it was established in 2004, the shop has become very popular in the region. However, it has had to overcome two crises: the effect of the radioactive fallout from the Fukushima nuclear power plant accident and contamination by residual agricultural chemicals. The manager had a large role in the recovery, but Japan's agricultural policy also provided direct and indirect support at the national and local levels. Public policy supports the resilience of the agricultural supply chain through measures such as agricultural land use planning, agricultural improvement projects, rapid reconstruction following damage, and improvement of agricultural resources.
Q13|The Long road to transformation of agricultural markets in India: Lessons from Karnataka|This paper examines Karnataka's pioneering agricultural output marketing reforms with the twin goals of assessing the state and challenges of implementation and to glean lessons from Karnataka's experience for India's e-National Agricultural Market (e-NAM). Through a field study of ten mandis across the state, we find that while Karnataka has been consistently pushing through with reforms, in the context of deeply entrenched relationships between farmers, traders and com- mission agents, the challenges of deeper reforms are significant. We argue that Karnataka's experience suggests that agricultural market reform in India rests on three pillars - institutions that establish the rules of the game, incentives for agents to participate actively in the market and infrastructure to support the modernised trading platform. Unless reforms address all these three issues simultaneously, they are unlikely to succeed.
Q13|Impact of India's demonetization on domestic agricultural markets|In this paper we estimate the impact on domestic trade in agricultural commodities of India's demonetization exercise that invalidated 86 of the currency in circulation. Using data on arrivals and prices from close to 3000 regulated markets in India for 35 major agricultural commodities for the period 2011-2017, we focus on short term effects up to 3 months after demonetization, tracking both the impact and recovery. These 35 commodities account for an overwhelming share of land under cultivation and value of production and hence are representative of Indian agriculture in more than one sense. Using earlier years as comparison years, we use a combination of difference in differences techniques and synthetic control methods to identify the causal impact of demonetization. We find that demonetization has displaced domestic agricultural trade in regulated markets by over 15 in the short run settling at 7 after recovery at the end of the 90 day period after demonetization. Trade in perishables was displaced to the extent of 23 in the week following demonetization. It recovered slightly by the end of 90 days, but was still 18 lower than the usual. Most of this decline is on account of the significant decline in prices rather than of arrivals, which appear to have recovered over a period of three months. There are significant differences across commodities but almost all of these are in expected ways. The impacts are sharpest for kharif crops where government intervention is minimal or absent and for perishables and least for crops where farmers are well organized or commodities which governments actively procure. Robustness checks and falsification tests support our findings to a large extent. Overall, it seems to be the case that the monetary contraction embodied in demonetization significantly impacted arrivals and prices, though the price impacts are perhaps more lasting. The findings from this analysis and anecdotal evidence from field visits suggest that the impacts of demonetization potentially have effects that could last beyond the immediate impact.
Q13|Can a Repeated Opt-Out Reminder remove hypothetical bias in discrete choice experiments? An application to consumer valuation of novel food products|Recent papers have suggested that use of a so-called Repeated Opt-Out Reminder (ROOR) might mitigate hypothetical bias in stated Discrete Choice Experiments (DCE), but evidence so far has only been circumstantial. We provide the first comprehensive test of whether a ROOR can actually mitigate hypothetical bias in stated DCE. The data originates from a field experiment concerning consumer preferences for a novel food product made from cricket flour. Utilizing a between-subject design with three treatments, we find significantly higher marginal willingness to pay values in hypothetical than in nonhypothetical settings, confirming the usual presence of hypothetical bias. Comparing this to a hypothetical setting where the ROOR is introduced, we find that the ROOR effectively eliminates hypothetical bias for one attribute and significantly reduces it for the rest of the attributes. Our results further suggest that these reductions of hypothetical bias are brought about by a decrease in the tendency to ignore the price attribute.

Q13|Growth factors in the agriculture of Russia|In 2016, record-high yields of grain, including wheat, maize, sunflower, soya and sugar-beet were received. A new record in poultry meat production was set. Despite economic recession, gross agricultural output has been growing in the past few years. Such results are attributed by many experts to the effect of the embargo on imports of food from some countries and import substitution measures. However, neither the embargo nor import substitution was a decisive factor behind growth in agriculture. The most important factors were the interest of the business in developing agriculture, depreciation of the ruble and favorable weather conditions of the past few years.
Q13|Can Phosphate Salts Recovered from Manure Replace Conventional Phosphate Fertilizer?|Pig farming produces more manure than can reasonably be spread onto surrounding fields, particularly in regions with high livestock densities and limited land availability. Nutrient recycling offers an attractive solution for dealing with manure excesses and is one main objective of the European commission-funded project “BioEcoSIM”. Phosphate salts (“P-Salt”) were recovered from the separated liquid manure fraction. The solid fraction was dried and carbonized to biochar. This study compared the fertilizing performance of P-Salt and conventional phosphate fertilizer and determined whether additional biochar application further increased biomass yields. The fertilizers and biochar were tested in pot experiments with spring barley and faba beans using two nutrient-poor soils. The crops were fertilized with P-Salt at three levels and biochar in two concentrations. Biomass yield was determined after six weeks. Plant and soil samples were analysed for nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium contents. The P-Salt had similar or even better effects than mineral fertilizer on growth in both crops and soils. Slow release of nutrients can prevent leaching, rendering P-Salt a particularly suitable fertilizer for light sandy soils. Biochar can enhance its fertilizing effect, but the underlying mechanisms need further investigation. These novel products are concluded to be promising candidates for efficient fertilization strategies.

Q13|Development and Testing of a Device to Increase the Level of Automation of a Conventional Milking Parlor through Vocal Commands|A portable wireless device with a “vocal commands” feature for activating the mechanical milking phase in conventional milking parlors was developed and tested to increase the level of automation in the milking procedures. The device was tested in the laboratory and in a milking parlor. Four professional milkers participated in the experiment. Before the start of the tests, a set of acoustic models with speaker-dependent commands defined for the project was acquired for each milker using a dedicated “milker training procedure”. Two experimental sessions were performed by each milker, with one session in the laboratory and a subsequent session in the milking parlor. The device performance was evaluated based on the accuracy demonstrated in the vocal command recognition task and rated using the word recognition rate (WRR). The data were expressed as %WRR and grouped based on the different cases evaluated. Mixed effects logistic regression modeling was used to evaluate the association between the %WRR and explanatory variables. The results indicated significant effects due to the location where the tests were performed. Higher values of the %WRR were found for tests performed in the laboratory, whereas lower values were found for tests performed in the milking parlor (due to the presence of background noise). Nevertheless, the general performance level achieved by the device was sufficient for increasing the automation level of conventional milking parlors.
Q13|Practices for Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Rice Production in Northeast Thailand|Land management practices for rice productivity and carbon storage have been a key focus of research leading to opportunities for substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. The effects of land management practices on global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) from rice production within the farm gate were investigated. For the 13 study sites, soil samples were collected by the Land Development Department in 2004. In 2014, at these same sites, soil samples were collected again to estimate the soil organic carbon sequestration rate (SOCSR) from 2004 to 2014. Surveys were conducted at each sampling site to record the rice yield and management practices. The carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ), and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions, Net GWP, and GHGI associated with the management practices were calculated. Mean rice yield and SOCSR were 3307 kg·ha −1 ·year −1 and 1173 kg·C·ha −1 ·year −1 , respectively. The net GWP varied across sites, from 819 to 5170 kg·CO 2 eq·ha −1 ·year −1 , with an average value of 3090 kg·CO 2 eq·ha −1 ·year −1 . GHGI ranged from 0.31 to 1.68 kg·CO 2 eq·kg −1 yield, with an average value of 0.97 kg·CO 2 eq·kg −1 yield. Our findings revealed that the amount of potassium (potash, K 2 O) fertilizer application rate is the most significant factor explaining rice yield and SOCSR. The burning of rice residues in the field was the main factor determining GHGI in this area. An effective way to reduce GHG emissions and contribute to sustainable rice production for food security with low GHGI and high productivity is avoiding the burning of rice residues.
Q13|State Support in Brazil for a Local Turn to Food|The local turn to food is often claimed to be a way to increase the value-added component retained by primary producers and to provide healthy, fresh and affordable food to consumers. Rio do Grande do Sul in Brazil has several governmental support programs that aim to empower family farmers and open up new market opportunities for them. This article examines these programs, investigates how small-scale farmers engage with them and the resultant changes in farming and marketing practices that ensue. The article uses cluster and content analysis to identify and interpret the extent, and the different ways, in which these farmers engage with and make use of the local knowledge and innovation system. The results provide useful insights into how policy instruments improve the performance of family agribusinesses, helping them to make better use of the resources available to them, encouraging farm diversification, and strengthening local interrelations between producers and consumers.
Q13|Beyond Food Provisioning: The Transformative Potential of Grassroots Innovation around Food|The newly-emerged ethical foodscape includes multiple expressions of innovation around food. With reference to the Italian context, this paper focuses on the transformative potential of the experiences of social innovation, innovative grassroots initiatives, which have been significantly contributed to shaping the food culture and production-consumption practices during the last two decades. While still consolidating their fundamentals and facing the challenge of growth, the networks behind them continue to be engaged in an effort of innovation, inside and outside their niche. The paper explores these dynamics. Understanding how these networks are managing their transformative capacity and what are the opportunities and challenges arising in the relation with the mainstream system may help to better capture and value the potential of this innovation niche, drawing useful lessons for fostering its expression and for a broader transition to more equitable and sustainable food systems.
Q13|Rice Cultivation and Greenhouse Gas Emissions: A Review and Conceptual Framework with Reference to Ghana|Rice is an essential crop in Ghana. Several aspects of rice have been studied to increase its production; however, the environmental aspects, including impact on climate change, have not been studied well. There is therefore a gap in knowledge, and hence the need for continuous research. By accessing academic portals, such as Springer Open, InTech Open, Elsevier, and the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology’s offline campus library, 61 academic publications including peer reviewed journals, books, working papers, reports, etc. were critically reviewed. It was found that there is a lack of data on how paddy rice production systems affect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly emissions estimation, geographical location, and crops. Regarding GHG emission estimation, the review identified the use of emission factors calibrated using temperate conditions which do not suit tropical conditions. On location, most research on rice GHG emissions have been carried out in Asia with little input from Africa. In regard to crops, there is paucity of in-situ emissions data from paddy fields in Ghana. Drawing on the review, a conceptual framework is developed using Ghana as reference point to guide the discussion on fertilizer application, water management rice cultivars, and soil for future development of adaptation strategies for rice emission reduction.
Q13|Efflux of Soil Nitrous Oxide from Applied Fertilizer Containing Organic Materials in Citrus unshiu Field in Southwestern Japan|Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions from agricultural fields are an important source of the increasing atmospheric N 2 O concentration. We conducted a two-year investigation of soil N 2 O emissions induced by the application of combined organic and synthetic fertilizer (COS) and distilled silage waste (DSW). Three experimental treatments were applied to a Citrus unshiu field in January 2013 in Ehime, Japan: no fertilizer (NF), COS, and DSW. The applied nitrogen (N) from DSW was 192 and 244 kg N ha −1 in the first and second years, respectively, although the N application in COS was 192 kg N ha −1 in both years. The main N forms in COS and DSW were ammonium- and nitrate-N, respectively. Soil N 2 O and carbon dioxide fluxes, soil chemical properties, and mineral N leaching from topsoil were measured. The soil N 2 O flux increased after fertilization in COS and DSW, and a higher N 2 O efflux after supplemental fertilization was induced by warm and wet soil conditions. The emission factor of N 2 O was higher in COS (2.02%) than in DSW (1.18%), while N leaching was higher in DSW than in COS. The organic materials remaining after the application possibly increased the N 2 O emissions in the summer season. Therefore, to mitigate N 2 O emissions in citrus orchards, fertilizer containing organic materials should be applied during a cool and dry season.
Q13|Small-Scale Vegetable Farmers’ Participation in Modern Retail Market Channels in Indonesia: The Determinants of and Effects on Their Income|The rise of supermarkets in Indonesia since the end of the 1990s have been transforming the food retail sector and providing further market opportunities for small-scale farmers, in which most of Indonesia’s farmer falls into this category. The aim of this paper is to examine the supermarket participation and its effect on the well-being of small-scale farmers. We compare the differences between participants and non-participants in supermarket channels in order to explore the constraints on supermarket participation. By applying a treatment effects model which allows capturing the possibility of selection bias, we examine the factors that determine farmers’ participation as well as the effect on their income. The results show that younger farmers with higher levels of education, irrigated land, who have packaging equipment and storage facilities, and are located near paved roads, are more likely to participate in the supermarket channels. On the other hand, farmers who have sprayer equipment are more likely to participate in the traditional market channels. The effect analysis shows that small-scale farmer participation in the supermarket channels can boost their income.
Q13|Durum Wheat Cover Analysis in the Scope of Policy and Market Price Changes: A Case Study in Southern Italy|Agricultural land systems are the result of human interactions with the natural environment, and subjective evidence of socio-economic and environmental interactions has been demonstrated. Nevertheless, it is still difficult to analyze empirically the link between agricultural market and policy, as well as the environmental response due to changes in crop management by local stakeholders. In this study, we propose a cross investigation and analysis to bring the link between vegetation cover, policy, market and farmer’s behavior to light. Our methodology is a combination of a rational positive and analogical approach between the quantifiable and non-quantifiable agents on a temporal basis. The method is applied to a dominant mono-crop agricultural watershed in Southern Italy that has been dedicated to durum wheat cultivation. In this region, we studied the relationship between the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), durum wheat market price, vegetation cover and land allocation. As a first step, we conducted a separate analysis for each factor, exploiting Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite observed Leaf Area Index (LAI) to analyze the land vegetation space–time distribution over the period 2000–2014 and three Land Satellite (Landsat) validated images as check-points for the agricultural pattern and CAP’s reforms. We used the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) and Eurostat data to investigate the on-farm accountancy and the durum wheat market price changes, respectively. Based on the study period, we developed a storyline of the major relevant CAP’s policy changes. In a second step, we conducted a comparative analysis where the CAP’s reforms were used as interpretational support, the land allocation and the on-farm accountability for CAP’s implementation, the price of durum wheat and the LAI for analytical comparison. We found interesting insights regarding the non-agronomic driving forces of LAI dynamics. The behavior of the individual farmers is influenced by the CAP policy that has been implemented by using profitability as the stimulus for the decision making of the farmer. This explains the correlation of the trend between the market price, the LAI of durum wheat and their associated dynamics.
Q13|Mitigating Global Warming Potential and Greenhouse Gas Intensities by Applying Composted Manure in Cornfield: A 3-Year Field Study in an Andosol Soil|A 3-year study was conducted in cornfield to evaluate how composted cattle manure application affects net global warming potential (GWP; the sum of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and methane (CH 4 ) minus net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB)) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI; net GWP per unit of plant biomass yield). In the first experiment, conducted from 2010 to 2012, five fertilization strategies that included an unfertilized control plot, inorganic fertilizer-only plot, two plots with inorganic fertilizer plus composted cattle manure, and composted cattle manure-only plot were established. In the second experiment composted cattle manure was applied in autumn 2012 and the field was subdivided into three plots in spring 2013, with one plot receiving additional composted cattle manure, the second plot received additional inorganic fertilizer and the third plot did not receive any additional fertilization. Fluxes of N 2 O, CH 4 and CO 2 were measured using the static closed chamber method. NECB was calculated as carbon (C) inputs minus C output (where a negative value indicates net C loss). In experiment 1, manure application significantly increased NECB and reduced net GWP by more than 30% in each of the three years of the study. GHGI in the manure-amended plots was lower than in other plots, except in 2012 when the manure-only plot had higher GHGI than fertilizer-only plot. Application of inorganic fertilizer alone increased GWP by 5% and 20% in 2010 and 2011, but showed a 30% reduction in 2012 relative to the unfertilized control plot. However, due to higher net primary production (NPP), fertilizer-only plot had lower GHGI compared to the control. Application of inorganic fertilizer together with manure showed the greatest potential to reduce GWP and GHGI, while increasing NPP and NECB. In experiment 2, additional manure or inorganic fertilizer application in spring increased NPP by a similar amount, but additional manure application also increased NECB, and decreased GWP and GHGI. Manure application, as a partial substitute or supplemental fertilizer, shows potential to mitigate GWP and GHGI.
Q13|Advances in Eco-Efficient Agriculture: The Plant-Soil Mycobiome|In order to achieve a desirable ecological and sustainable agriculture a thorough understanding of the plant-soil mycobiome is imperative. Commercial industrial agriculture alters greenhouse gas emissions, promotes loss of plant and soil biodiversity, increases pollution by raising atmospheric CO 2 , and releases pesticides, thus affecting both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Diversified farming systems, including perennial cultivated pastures, are among worldwide strategies that aim to reduce terrestrial greenhouse gas emissions and deal with threats to global sustainability. Additionally, stimulation of soil microbes and appropriate soil management can influence soil interactions as well as the rates of organic matter decomposition and the release of gases. Agricultural soil microbial communities play a central role in ecosystem processes and are affected by biocontrol agents, biofertilizers, and exposure to pesticides, the extent to which is yet to be fully elucidated. Intercropping different plant species is beneficial, as this can increase carbon fixation by plants, transferring carbon to the soil, especially via mycorrhizas, thus modifying interplant interactions. This review focuses on agro-ecosystems, showing the latest advances in the plant-soil interface (the mycobiome) for an eco-efficient agricultural production.
Q13|Achieving Sustainability: Insights from Biogas Ecosystems in India|This paper focuses on how the use of renewable energy technologies such as biogas can help to achieve environmental and socio-economic sustainability. It combines research on sustainable consumption and production, natural and industrial ecosystems and renewable energy adoption to develop a framework for an industrial ecosystem for biogas for bottom-of-the-pyramid and rural populations. The framework suggests that three dimensions of industrial ecosystems and a meta-dimension can be embedded in the design of a new industrial ecosystem for biogas to facilitate environmental and socio-economic sustainability. Case studies of an organization engaged in using biogas to create a sustainable bioenergy ecosystem for rural populations and two organizations producing biogas in urban India provide support for the framework.
Q13|Assessment of Photosynthetic Pigment and Water Contents in Intact Sunflower Plants from Spectral Indices|Under water-limited conditions, monitoring water and chlorophyll status is essential to avoid restrictions in crop growth and yield. This study was carried out to assess water and chlorophyll contents from spectral indices in sunflower plants. The hybrid Sunbright Supreme was cultivated inside a non-acclimatized greenhouse until the start of the flowering stage, and later was maintained in a growth chamber with the purpose of submitting the plants to a slow and progressive dehydration rate for 12 consecutive days. Spectral (reflectance and transmittance), leaf masses (fresh and dry), and total chlorophyll measurements were accomplished in sunflower plants. The water stress caused a reduction in the water and chlorophyll contents, resulting in linear and nonlinear decreases for the spectral indicators Water Index (WI) and Chlorophyll Content Index (CCI), respectively. The low scattering of the average values around the fitted models indicates that WI and CCI were effective in representing changes in water and chlorophyll status for sunflowers ( R 2 = 0.912 and R 2 = 0.905). The benefits of using hand-held optical meters for reflectance and transmittance are that they enable rapid, accurate, and nondestructive assessments of water and chlorophyll contents in sunflower plants from radiometric indicators.
Q13|Changes in the Polyphenolic Profile, Carotenoids and Antioxidant Potential of Apricot ( Prunus armeniaca L.) Leaves during Maturation|Apricot ( Prunus armeniaca L.) leaves were studied to assess the potential of apricot leaves for future studies and their applications in nutraceutical and bioactive functional ingredients. The changes in the phenolic profile, carotenoids, pigments and antioxidant potential were studied at four maturation stages. Polyphenols and carotenoids were studied using reversed-phase HPLC-DAD. Pigments, total phenolic contents and radical scavenging activity were also measured. Results revealed twelve phenolic compounds in the apricot leaves. The major phenolic compounds were 3- O -caffeoylquinic acid (14.6–49.6 mg/g), 4- O -caffeoylquinic acid (0.56–7.5 mg/g), 5- O -caffeoylquinic acid (5.6–25.7 mg/g) and quercetin-3- O -glucosides (8.6–19.9 mg/g), while others include caffeic acid and derivatives of coumaric acid and kaempferol. Significant changes were observed in polyphenolic compounds during maturation. Lutein (56.7–65.7 µg/g), neoxanthin (0.66–4.79 µg/g), 5,6-epoxy-α-carotene (5.89–7.9 µg/g), and β-carotene (12.3–26.9 µg/g) were the major carotenoids. There were significant variations in the carotenoids, pigment contents, total phenolic contents and radical scavenging activity during maturation. In conclusion, significant variation occurred in the polyphenolic profile, carotenoids contents and antioxidant potential of apricot leaves under the studied conditions.
Q13|Ammonia and Methane Emission Factors from Cattle Operations Expressed as Losses of Dietary Nutrients or Energy|The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of published literature on ammonia (NH 3 ) and enteric methane (CH 4 ) emissions from beef and dairy cattle operations to obtain statistically representative emission factors based on dietary intakes of nutrients or energy, and to identify major causes of emission variations. NH 3 emissions from lagoon or other manure storage facilities were not included in this review. The NH 3 and CH 4 emission rates, expressed as a percentage losses of dietary nutrients or energy, demonstrated much less variation compared with emission rates expressed in g/animal/day. Air temperature and dietary crude protein (CP) content were identified as two major factors that can affect NH 3 emission rates in addition to farm type. Feed digestibility and energy intake were identified as two major factors that can affect CH 4 emission rates expressed as a percentage losses of dietary energy. Generally, increasing productivity and feed efficiency represented the greatest opportunity for mitigating NH 3 or CH 4 emissions per unit of livestock product. Expressing CH 4 loss on a digestible energy basis rather than a gross energy intake basis can better represent the large variation among diets and the effects of varying dietary emission mitigation strategies.

Q13|Effect of Organic and Inorganic Fertilizers on Soil Properties and the Growth, Yield and Quality of Tomato in Mymensingh, Bangladesh|Field trials were conducted on tomato for yield and quality of fruits using different types of organic and inorganic fertilizers at the horticulture farm of Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU), Mymensingh. Fertilizer treatments were tested on two varieties of tomato ca. Roma VF and BARI 15. The fertilization treatments were T1, vermicompost (12 t/ha); T2, compost (10 t/ha); T3, integrated plant nutrient system (IPNS) or mixed fertilizers (organic 2/3 part and inorganic 1/3 part); T4, inorganic fertilizers; and a control (T5). Results showed growth and yield (20.8 t/ha) in tomato were higher in the IPNS treatment. A higher number of fruits per plant (73.7) and plant height (73.5 cm) were obtained from mixed fertilizers (organic 2/3 + inorganic 1/3) or IPNS (integrated plant nutrient system) in Roma VF than other treatments. Fruit yield and diameter were found statistically significant. No significant difference was observed in the quality (total soluble solids) of tomato fruits in both varieties’ response to the treatments. The electrical conductivity and pH of the soil were improved by the application of organic manure.
Q13|Guest Editorial: Conservation Tillage for Organic Farming|There is interest in reducing or even eliminating tillage in organic production systems. In this special Issue, research teams in Europe and North America summarize recent and on-going efforts to develop conservation-tillage systems that can be used on commercial organic farms. While progress is being made in the development of organic no-tillage (no-till) systems, considerable work still needs to be done before there will be wide-spread adoption by organic farmers.
Q13|The Impact of a Warming Micro‐Climate on Muooni Farmers of Kenya|Rainfed agriculture has become highly vulnerable to the depleting water resources in most arid and semi‐arid tropics (ASATs) under the effect of climate change. The impact has certainly been very high in Muooni catchment where more than 99% of the natural forest has been cleared. The warming micro‐climate is accelerated by extended deforestation, unsustainable irrigation, and water over‐abstraction in the catchment by eucalyptus and other exotic trees. The dwindling crop yields add to the farmer’s suffering. Farming communities have created various innovative ways of coping with a warming environment to increase their agriculture resiliency. These include, among others, rain water management, reforestation and agro‐forestry. To what extent have these practices been disturbed by the increasing temperatures, and decreasing rainfalls and river discharges in Muooni catchment? This study used statistical forecast techniques to unveil the past, current and future variations of the micro‐climate in Muooni catchment, and relevant factors determining farmers’ vulnerability to drought. Muooni catchment is warming by 0.8 to 1.2 °C in a century as a result of a changing micro‐climate. These changes are mainly driven by deforestation due to the high urbanization rate and agricultural practices in Muooni catchment. Centennial rainfall is subsequently plummeting at 30 to 50 mm while discharges are decreasing from 0.01 to 0.05 m3∙s−1, with unmet water demands of 30% to 95% and above. In view of the current trends of the population growth and urbanization in Muooni, agricultural expansion is seriously threatened if no appropriate policy, extension service and science based emergency measures are put in place by the Government of Kenya.
Q13|Suppression of CH4 Emission by Rice Straw Removal and Application of Bio‐Ethanol Production Residue in a Paddy Field in Akita, Japan|To elucidate the effects of rice straw removal and rice straw‐based bio‐ethanol production residue application on rice growth and methane (CH4) emission from a paddy field, a lysimeter experiment with three treatments (application of rice straw after harvesting (the rice‐straw plot); removal of rice straw and the application of bio‐ethanol production residue (the Et‐residue plot); removal of rice straw (the no‐application plot)) was conducted over three years. Though the grain yields in the Et‐residue and no‐application plots tended to be slightly higher than that in the ricestraw plot, there were no significant differences among the plots (530–546 g∙m−2). Suppression of CH4 emission by the treatments was found clearly in the early part of the growing season. The total CH4 emissions during the rice‐growing season (unit: g∙C∙m−2∙period−1) followed the order of the noapplication plot (11.9) < the Et‐residue plot (14.6) < the rice‐straw plot (25.4), and a significant difference was found between the no‐application and rice‐straw plots. Consequently, bio‐ethanol production from rice straw and a following application of its residue to paddy fields is considered to be a promising technology which can obtain new sustainable energy and suppress CH4 emission without any inhibition on rice growth.
Q13|Development and Evaluation of Poly Herbal Molluscicidal Extracts for Control of Apple Snail ( Pomacea maculata )|Golden Apple Snail (GAS) is the most destructive invasive rice pest in Southeast Asia. The cost of synthetic molluscicides, their toxicity to non-target organisms, and their persistence in the environment have propelled the research of plant-derived molluscicides. Most research efforts have focused on individual plant extracts for their molluscicidal potency against GAS and have not been proven to be entirely effective in rice field conditions. Selective combination of synergistically acting molluscicidal compounds from various plant extracts might be an effective alternative. In this direction, ethanolic extracts from six different plants (Neem, Tobacco, Nerium, Pongamia, Zinger, and Piper) were evaluated against Pomacea maculata Perry. Of the various combinations studied, a binary extract (1:1) of nerium and tobacco (LC 90 177.71 mg/L, 48 h), and two tri-herbal extract formulations (1:1:1) of (nerium + tobacco + piper) and (nerium + tobacco + neem) were found to be most effective, with LC 90 values of 180.35 mg/L and 191.52 mg/L, respectively, in laboratory conditions. The synergistic effect of combined herbal extracts resulted in significant reduction in LC 90 values of the individual extracts. The findings of this study demonstrate that the selective combinations of potent molluscicidal herbal extracts are effective for management of P. maculata under laboratory conditions.
Q13|Fusarium Wilt Affecting Chickpea Crop|Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) contributes 18% of the global production of grain legume and serves as an important source of dietary protein. An important decrease in cropping area and production has been recorded during the last two decades. Several biotic and abiotic constraints underlie this decrease. Despite the efforts deployed in breeding and selection of several chickpea varieties with high yield potential that are tolerant to diseases, the situation has remained the same for the last decade. Fusarium wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceris (Foc) is the major soilborne fungus affecting chickpeas globally. Fusarium wilt epidemics can devastate crops and cause up to 100% loss in highly infested fields and under favorable conditions. To date, eight pathogenic races of Foc (races 0, 1A, 1B/C, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) have been reported worldwide. The development of resistant cultivars is the most effective method to manage this disease and to contribute to stabilizing chickpea yields. Development of resistant varieties to fusarium wilt in different breeding programs is mainly based on conventional selection. This method is time‐consuming and depends on inoculum load and specific environmental factors that influence disease development. The use of molecular tools offers great potential for chickpea improvement, specifically by identifying molecular markers closely linked to genes/QTLs controlling fusarium wilt.
Q13|Phytochemistry and Agro-Industrial Potential of Native Oilseeds from West Africa: African Grape ( Lannea microcarpa ), Marula ( Sclerocarya birrea ), and Butter Tree ( Pentadesma butyracea )|Ethnobotanical investigations on local oilseed species in Burkina Faso revealed that oils from tree oilseeds are frequently used for food, cosmetics and traditional medicine by local people. To test the bio-preservative capacity, the effect of the oilseed extracts on the stabilization of Shea butter was evaluated. Levels of bioactive phyto-components were evaluated through several methods. Some aspects of the quality of oilcakes were evaluated based on their inhibitory capacity on the endogenous digestive enzymes of cattle. For fat stabilizing quality, the extract from Lannea microcarpa Engl. & K. Krause has showed the largest increase (91.47%) in the Rancimat induction time (TIR) of Shea butter. Using DPPH and FRAP methods for prevention or scavenging of free radicals, the results evidenced the highest activity with extracts of L. microcarpa . With respect to the feed quality of the oilcakes, the IC 50 obtained with α-amylase and trypsin have showed that the ethanolic extracts of Pentadesma butyracea Sabine (1824) is less toxic for cattle. These results suggest that phenolic compounds extracted from these native oilseeds, especially those of Lannea microcarpa , can be used as biological antioxidants for bio-preservation of edible fats. In addition, the by-products of the oil-extraction can be valorized as nontoxic and protein-rich oilcakes for livestock feed.
Q13|Changes in Carbon Cycling during Development of Successional Agroforestry|Successional agroforestry systems (SAFS) mimic the structure of natural forests while providing economical outputs. This study clarifies how carbon cycling and carbon sequestration change during successional development of SAFS. In Brazil, three successional stages of SAFS, 6, 12, and 34 years old, were compared in terms of carbon balance. Aboveground biomass, fruit harvest, litterfall, soil respiration, and soil organic carbon were measured for two years and analyzed. Carbon sequestration expressed by net primary productivity increased with age of SAFS from 9.8 Mg·C·ha −1 ·year −1 in 6-year-old system to 13.5 Mg·C·ha −1 ·year −1 in 34-year-old system. Accumulation of plant biomass and increased internal carbon cycling in SAFS led to an intensive sequestration of carbon. SAFS can be a sustainable way of agricultural production on vulnerable tropical soils.
Q13|Impacts of Rural Labor Resource Change on the Technical Efficiency of Crop Production in China|This paper probes effects of the evolvement of labor resources on technical efficiency in crop production in rural China. Based on twelve years of data on crop production of 30 provinces in China, a stochastic frontier production function model is used to measure crop production efficiency in three crop-functional areas—the production area, the consumption area, and the balanced area. Then effects of both quantity and quality change in labor force on technical efficiency in different regions of China are analyzed. Results show that rural China generally has an increasing number of employees shifted to non-agricultural sectors and a decreasing trend of the stock of human capital. However, both these two changes in rural labor force have significantly positive effects on improving crop production efficiency. In addition, China’s technical inefficiency is at an average of 22.2%. Dynamically, the technical efficiencies show a tendency to rise steadily throughout China and in three areas, while the consumption area possesses the highest technical efficiency. Those results may lend some experience for other countries that are currently experiencing rural labor force and economic transition.
Q13|Surface and Subsurface Transport of Nitrate Loss from the Selected Bioenergy Crop Fields: Systematic Review, Analysis and Future Directions|Nitrate loss from bioenergy crop fields has attracted considerable attention during the last few years because of its potential negative impact on aquatic and human health. Both controllable and uncontrollable factors for nitrate loss have been the subject of several previous studies. Due to differences in climate, biophysical dissimilarities and land management characteristics in different parts of the world the factors affecting nitrate loss are often inconsistent and hence difficult to generalize. Therefore, reanalyzing the experimental field or plot scale studies to understand the nitrate loss factors in crop fields is useful and necessary in developing management strategies for reducing nitrate loss. This research synthesized and investigated 36 peer reviewed scientific journal articles related to selected bioenergy crop fields that included: continuous corn, corn in rotation with soybean, switchgrass and Miscanthus to conduct a meta-analysis of the available research. In this study, factors such as drain tile spacing, tillage practices, type and timing of the fertilization rate, irrigation and various other factors, which are challenging to represent in regression equations, were also systematically analyzed. In addition, various other agronomic characteristics that are attributed too nitrate loss are caused by perennially planted bio energized crops such as Miscanthus and switchgrass. Results indicated that 49% of nitrate loss through surface runoff from corn fields is directly related to the annual precipitation and fertilization rate. Multiple linear regression equations were developed to estimate the annual subsurface nitrate loss for the continuous corn fields with a R 2 value of 0.65, 0.58 and 0.26 for sandy loam, silty loam and clay loam, respectively. Our analysis resulted in the conclusion that corn has a 2 to 3 times higher nitrate loss in surface runoff compared to switchgrass. Likewise, continuous corn and corn in rotation with soybean contributed more than 9 times the subsurface loss of nitrate compared to the established subsurface loss attributed to the Miscanthus and switchgrass.
Q13|Evaluation of Pectin Extraction Conditions and Polyphenol Profile from Citrus x lantifolia Waste: Potential Application as Functional Ingredients|The citrus by-products pectin and polyphenols were obtained from Citrus x lantifolia residues. The use of acid type, solute-solvent ratio, temperature, and extraction time on pectin yield recovery was evaluated using a factorial design 3 4 ; pectin physicochemical characterization, polyphenol profile, and antioxidant activity were also determined. Results indicated a total polyphenol content of 3.92 ± 0.06 mg Galic Acid Equivalents (GAE)/g of citrus waste flour in dry basis (DB), with antioxidant activity of 74%. The presence of neohesperidin (0.96 ± 0.09 mg/g of citrus flour DB), hesperidin (0.27 ± 0.0 mg/g of citrus flour DB), and ellagic acid (0.18 ± 0.03 mg/g of citrus flour DB) as major polyphenols was observed. All of the factors evaluated in pectin recovery presented significant effects ( p < 0.05), nevertheless the acid type and solute-solvent ratio showed the greatest effect. The highest yield of pectin recovery (36%) was obtained at 90 °C for 90 min, at a ratio of 1:80 ( w / v ) using citric acid. The evaluation of pectin used as a food ingredient in cookies elaboration, resulted in a reduction of 10% of fat material without significant texture differences ( p < 0.05). The pectin extraction conditions and characterization from these residues allowed us to determine the future applications of these materials for use in several commercial applications.
Q13|Nitrous Oxide Emission from Organic Fertilizer and Controlled Release Fertilizer in Tea Fields|A field experiment was conducted for two years in the Green Tea Laboratory of Saitama Prefectural Agriculture and Forestry Research Center, Iruma, Saitama, Japan from March 2014 to December 2015. Controlled release fertilizers (CRF) or organic fertilizers (ORG), which are a mixture of chicken manure and oil cake, were applied with the amount of 450 kg·N·ha −1 ·year −1 in 2014 and 397 kg·N·ha −1 ·year −1 in 2015. Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions from soil in green tea fields were measured by the closed chamber method. The results showed that CRF has significantly lower N 2 O compared to ORG. The cumulative N 2 O emissions from CRF accounted for 51% of N 2 O emissions from ORG fields and 138% of control with no fertilizer treatment. The N 2 O flux from the row was higher than that under the canopy, since fertilizer was applied on the row. However, the total emission from the area between the rows was lower than that under the canopy because the area ratio between the row and canopy was 1:5.
Q13|Impact of Practice Change on Runoff Water Quality and Vegetable Yield—An On-Farm Case Study|Intensive agricultural practices in farming systems in eastern Australia have been identified as a contributor to the poor runoff water quality entering the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). A field investigation was carried out to measure the off-farm water quality and productivity in a coastal farming system in northeastern Australia. Two vegetable crops (capsicum and zucchini) were grown in summer 2010–2011 and winter 2011 respectively using four different management practices (Conventional—plastic mulch, bare inter-row conventional tillage and commercial fertilizer inputs; Improved—improved practice with plastic mulch, inter-row vegetative mulch, zonal tillage and reduced fertilizer rates; Trash mulch—improved practice with cane-trash or forage-sorghum mulch with reduced fertilizer rates, minimum or zero tillage; and Vegetable only—improved practice with Rhodes grass or forage-sorghum mulch, minimum or zero tillage, reduced fertilizer rates). Results suggest improved and trash mulch systems reduced sediment and nutrient loads by at least 50% compared to conventional systems. The residual nitrate nitrogen in soil accumulated at the end-of-break crop cycle was lost by deep drainage before the subsequent sugarcane crop could utilize it. These results suggest that future research into establishing the linkages between deep drainage, groundwater quality and lateral movement into adjacent streams is needed. The improvement in runoff water quality was accompanied by yield reductions of up to 55% in capsicum and 57% in zucchini under trash mulch systems, suggesting a commercially unacceptable trade-off between water quality and productivity for a practice change. The current study has shown that variations around improved practice (modified nutrient application strategies under plastic mulch, but with an inter-space mulch to minimize runoff and sediment loss) may be the most practical solution to improve water quality and maintain productivity. However, more work is required to optimize this approach and thus reduce the size of any potential productivity and profitability gap that would necessitate an expensive policy intervention to implement.
Q13|Effect of Organic, Inorganic Fertilizers and Plant Spacing on the Growth and Yield of Cabbage|The impact of chemical farming and the negative consequences on the environment and human health in Bangladesh are on the rise. Organic farming is gaining attention and increasing globally because it is eco-friendly, safe and has benefits for human health. A field study was conducted at the horticulture farm of Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU), Mymensingh, to evaluate the growth and yield performance of cabbage cv. Atlas—70 using organic and inorganic fertilizers in various plant spacing arrangements. Two factor experiments were conducted on plant spacings of 60 cm × 40 cm (S 1 ), 60 cm × 50 cm (S 2 ) and 60 cm × 60 cm (S 3 ) and fertilizers vermicompost (T 1 ), biogen (T 2 ), integrated plant nutrient system (IPNS) Organic (⅔) + inorganic (⅓) (T 3 ) and inorganic (T 4 ). IPNS (T 3 ) application increased the marketable yield (54.77 t·ha −1 ) of cabbage. The highest marketable yield (48.75 t·ha −1 ) was obtained with a plant spacing of 60 cm × 40 cm (S 1 ). No significant variation was found in plant spacings S 1 and S 2 . The treatment combination of S 2 T 3 recorded the highest plant height (37.81 cm), plant spread (47.75 cm), cabbage head (21.80 cm), stem length (12.31 cm), thickness of the cabbage head (12.53 cm) and marketable yield (65.0 t·ha −1 ). The results suggest that IPNS (T 3 ) combining organic and inorganic fertilizer applications with a 60 cm × 50 cm spacing (S 2 T 3 ) increases the yield performance of cabbage.
Q13|Global Biofuels at the Crossroads: An Overview of Technical, Policy, and Investment Complexities in the Sustainability of Biofuel Development|Biofuels have the potential to alter the transport and agricultural sectors of decarbonizing societies. Yet, the sustainability of these fuels has been questioned in recent years in connection with food versus fuel trade-offs, carbon accounting, and land use. Recognizing the complicated playing field for current decision-makers, we examine the technical attributes, policy, and global investment activity for biofuels (primarily liquids). Differences in feedstock and fuel types are considered, in addition to policy approaches of major producer countries. Issues with recent, policy-driven trade developments are highlighted to emphasize how systemic complexities associated with sustainability must also be managed. We conclude with near-term areas to watch.
Q13|Microfinance for poverty alleviation: Do transnational initiatives overlook fundamental questions of competition and intermediation?|Numerous microfinance initiatives around the world aim to alleviate poverty in developing countries. However, debate persists about their effectiveness and sustainability – a concern for transnational corporations and the international business community, which contribute about $9.4 billion to microfinance funding. In this policy-oriented article we aggregate findings from two studies in Indonesia that help explain why moneylending can still thrive when low-interest microfinance is widely available and why the poorest borrowers benefit less than the less-poor. To avoid methodological debates about validity, we interview market participants and triangulate the perspectives of borrowers with those of formal and informal lenders. Importantly, our research includes current and past borrowing from formal and informal sources, prompting participants to draw comparisons. We find that the importance to borrowers of key characteristics of informal lending is insufficiently recognized and that inappropriate human resource management and informal intermediation are significant problems. The latter can be an unintended consequence of formal microfinance: The availability of formal low-interest microfinance creates informal intermediation opportunities for entrepreneurs, often developing from casual intermediation into systematic deception. We discuss implications for microfinance policy with reference to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and offer suggestions for further research.
Q13|Public Policy As A Tool For Floriculture Development In The Municipality Of Tepetlixpa Mexico State, Politica Publica Como Herramienta De Desarrollo Para La Floricultura Del Municipio De Tepetlixpa Estado De Mexico|One problem facing the flower industry in Mexico, is a low linkage between government sectors responsible for supporting resources to producers. There are shortcomings in the management, dissemination and application of various types of programs that provide financial resources. These programs include national, state and municipal development at the federal level, the public body responsible for implementation is the Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural development, Fisheries and Food (SAGARPA). Such support programs must be permeated by t federal, state and municipal government with the intention of promoting the development of the region. This paper examines these government programs
Q13|Characterization Of The Of Red Fresh Tomato Value Chain In Mexico , Caracterizacion De La Cadena De Valor Del Tomate Rojo Fresco En Mexico|Agriculture is an important activity globally for its contribution to food production for human and livestock consumption. It is important to ensure quality at every stage of the process, from production to marketing, so that healthy products are provided and priced according to quality. Value Chain study becomes more important for its impact on the local economy. Therefore, it is important to study value chains considering the different participants in the chain links. The aim of this study was to perform the characterization of the Value Chain of fresh tomato in Mexico proposed by the National Council of Producers of Tomato NPO (Consejo Nacional de Productores de Tomate A.C.in Spanish). This was done through a documentary analysis that considers this product sector, as well as the identification and characterization of links involved in the production process and marketing. When the analysis of tomato Value Chains was completed, primary activities were identified, as well as support. In the link marketing a high dependence of intermediaries is required to get the product to the consumer
Q13|Impact of India's Demonetization on Domestic Agricultural Markets|This paper estimates the impact on domestic trade in agricultural commodities of India's demonetization exercise that invalidated 86% of the currency in circulation. Using data on arrivals and prices from close to 3000 regulated markets in India for 35 major agricultural commodities for the period 2011-2017, the focus is on short term effects up to 3 months after demonetization, tracking both the impact and recovery. These 35 commodities account for an overwhelming share of land under cultivation and value of production and hence are representative of Indian agriculture in more than one sense. Using earlier years as comparison years, the paper uses a combination of difference in differences techniques and synthetic control methods to identify the causal impact of demonetization.
Q13|Assessing potential coupling factors of European decoupled payments with the Modular Agricultural GeNeral Equilibrium Tool (MAGNET)|"In 2020, decoupled payments will represent about 42% of the CAP budget (green payments excluded). This report assesses potential effects of European decoupled payments on farmers' production decisions, prior to a sensitivity analysis of different coupling factors using the Modular Applied GeNeral Equilibrium Tool (MAGNET). Scientific literature reveals different coupling channels such as capitalisation in land value, farmers' risk behaviour, credit accessibility, uncertainty about future policies and labour allocation through which European decoupled payments influence farm choices and thus output. For each of these channels the relevant literature introducing theoretical and empirical assessments is evaluated with the aim to derive parameters that improve the representation of decoupled payments in economic simulation models. Within MAGNET, the traditional representation of decoupled payments is a subsidy to the land factor. Nevertheless it appears that the most suitable approach seems to split decoupled payments value into two components, capitalized into the land factor on the one hand, distributed across all factors of production on the other hand. A sensitivity analysis concludes that if one assumes a ""degree"" of coupling, it does have some implication for output and price results when conducting policy analysis."
Q13|Analyses of the functioning of Milk Package provisions as regards producer organisations and collective negotiations|This study aims at assessing the effectiveness and potential improvement of the Milk Package provisions, as regards the functioning of producer organisations and their role in collective negotiations with milk processors.
Q13|Unfair trading practices in the food supply chain: A literature review on methodologies, impacts and regulatory aspects|This report constitutes a compilation of the principal issues raised by the speakers at the workshop jointly organised by the Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development and Joint Research Centre on â€˜Unfair trading practices in the food supply chainâ€™ held in Brussels between 17-18 July 2017. The workshop brought together international experts in the field of economic and political sciences, who have authored work of relevance for commercial practices in the food supply chains with a view to discuss the available scientific literature on methodologies, impacts and regulatory aspects of UTPs. The workshop discussions addressed the following four topics, and the present report summarises the presentations on them: 1. The strengths and weaknesses of methodologies applied in the literature to analyse UTPs 2. The empirical evidence on the socioeconomic impacts of UTPs 3. The regulatory aspects and enforcement costs of UTPs 4. The way forward to better understand UTPs in food supply chains
Q13|Effects of standards on tea exports from developing countries : comparison of China and Sri Lanka|Food safety standards have become stricter and are currently major barriers in the international agri-food trade. These standards negatively affect developing countries exports to markets in developed countries. We use tea exports from two major tea exporting developing countries, China and Sri Lanka, as an example to discuss the effects of standards on their tea supply chains. China and Sri Lanka share some similar characteristics in tea production and exports. First, we conduct a general comparison between the two countries’ tea exports based on port rejection data from UNIDO, and then we provide a detailed supply chain analysis. Finally, we summarize our work and discuss the policy implications.
Q13|Products with nutrition and health claims in the Western Balkans: labelling behaviour, regulation and policy implications|Abstract This paper analyses food industry labelling behaviour in regulated and unregulated markets of products with nutrition and health claims (N&H claims) in the Western Balkans. The aim is to find out whether the intervention of the lawmakers in the form of labelling regulation improves transparency of labelling behaviour and facilitates a more informed consumer choice. The analysis is based on a shop survey of 475 products with N&H claims, conducted in six Western Balkan countries (WBC). Statistical inference is derived from the results of the Mann–Whitney and Kruskal–Wallis non-parametric tests as well as the Dunn post-test for all pairwise comparisons as a form of simultaneous nonparametric inference. Differences among the countries constituting the region are significant. In comparison with regulated markets in the region, unregulated WBC markets are characterized by a higher level of “spurious” statements dominated by regional/domestic producers not obliged to use scientifically-approved claims in their corporate practices. In these conditions, differences in labelling behaviour are expected as well, which is only partly confirmed by our testing results.
Q13|Farmers' Preference On Conditions In Manufacturing Pineapple Sale Contract In Rayong Province|This paper aimed to evaluate farmers’ preferences on condition attributes in a manufacturing pineapple sale contract. Data were collected from 300 pineapple farmers in Rayong province in the cropping season 2015 using paper-based questionnaires. Conjoint analysis model was employed to analyze the attribute ranking. Consequently, farmers were grouped by using cluster analysis in order to study attribute ranking for each group. The analytical results revealed that farmers’ preferences were affected respectively by coverage-crop insurance option, price option, contract quantity and input supply arrangement. Finally, the attribute set that was found to obtain the highest total utility included guaranteed minimum prices, total quantity purchase and partial coverage-crop insurance. The farmers were segmented in 2 groups due to their preferences. The first group of farmers mostly had their planted areas between 20-40 rais and attended at least one training program concerning agricultural knowledge. The most important attribute of the first group was coverage-crop insurance option. Most of the second-group farmers had a small area planted and never attended the training. The price option was the most importance attribute for the second group. The suggestion from this study was that farmers, pineapple manufacturers and related government sectors jointly set a reasonably minimum guaranteed price that is consistent to the cost of production. Moreover, coverage-crop insurance could be added in a manufacturing pineapple sale contact in order to increase the farmers' confidence in their production.
Q13|Development and Concentration of Maize Seed Market in Thailand| Today Thailand is the second largest field crop seed exporter in Asia with maize contributing the highest value to seed exports. Hybrid maize is considerably adopted in Thailand mainly due to the demand from feed industry and development of livestock and poultry industry. The success of varietal development of commercial maize hybrids is owed to the investments of international donors during the 1980s and continuous breeding efforts of multinational seed companies even as public institutions played a key role in maintaining genetic resources conservation and pre-commercial lines research. This paper reviews the history of research and development in maize and maize seed market development in Thailand. Furthermore, expert elicitation method is used to reveal the adoption of commercial maize varieties in 2013/2014 cropping seasons. The results of adopted maize varieties were used to estimate market shares and suggested that maize seed market in Thailand is moderately concentrated with tendencies towards oligopolistic competition.
Q13|Do Agricultural Marketing Laws Matter for Rural Growth? Evidence from the Indian States|This article examines effects of the regulatory framework of post-harvest agricultural markets on agricultural growth across Indian states over the period 1970-2008. We propose a new measure that captures various legislative dimensions of a key ‘Act’ - the Agricultural Produce Markets Commission (APMC) Act and Rules - governing the agricultural markets, evolved from the dismal colonial history of India, and use this measure to estimate growth models using panel methods. We have applied Fixed-Effects, Feasible Generalized Least Squares, and Fixed-Effects Instrumental Variable models to the panel data to address the endogeneity associated with the regulatory framework. Our results show that the Act significantly promotes not only agricultural growth but the use and the adoption of agricultural technology. Evidence presented suggests that a policy to remove market regulation rather than advancing effective ones would fail consequentially to draw investments and improve agriculture growth.
Q13|Supply Uncertainty and Foreign Direct Investments in Agri-food Industry|We investigate whether and to what extent agricultural uncertainty drives the location of capital in the food processing industry. We show that when a risk-neutral food company has the possibility of exercising market power as both seller and buyer, the impact of agricultural uncertainty on the decision of producing abroad depends on whether the multinational makes the pricing/production decision before or after uncertainty is revealed. An econometric study is then needed to identify the mechanisms at work. The theoretical implications are tested by using a gravity model on European countries' and the United States' outward FDI stock, detailed by destination country in the agri-food industry. Overall, our results suggest that a higher agricultural volatility in the home country triggers investments abroad and that a host country exhibiting low agricultural uncertainty attracts relatively more foreign capital. Moreover, international di erences in agricultural uncertainty generate incentives for vertical disintegration by food companies, especially when trade costs are suciently low.
Q13|The Cost of High Food Prices in West Africa|West African households were particularly affected by the food price crisis of 2007-08. As these households depend on markets for two-thirds of their food supplies, prices have become a key determinant of access to food. However, food prices are 30-40% higher in sub-Saharan Africa than in the rest of the world at comparable levels of per capita income. These price levels have a negative impact on the purchasing power of households and are a major factor of food and nutrition insecurity. Price monitoring systems need to be updated and strengthened. Increasing productivity, promoting regional trade and supporting food value chain development are three of the policy options available to decision-makers to drive down food prices sustainably.
Q13|Le coût des prix alimentaires élevés en Afrique de l'Ouest|Les ménages ouest-africains sont particulièrement touchés par la flambée des prix de 2007-08. Ils dépendent des marchés pour deux-tiers de leurs approvisionnements. Les prix sont désormais un facteur clé de l'accessibilité économique à l’alimentation. Ils sont plus élevés de 30 à 40 % en Afrique subsaharienne que dans le reste du monde à niveau de revenu par habitant comparable. Ces niveaux ont un impact négatif sur le pouvoir d'achat des ménages et représentent un risque majeur d’insécurité alimentaire et nutritionnelle. Il conviendrait de revoir et de renforcer les systèmes de suivi des prix. L'augmentation de la productivité, la promotion du commerce régional et le soutien au développement des chaînes de valeur sont trois des options stratégiques à la disposition des décideurs politiques pour faire baisser les prix alimentaires de manière durable.
Q13|Objectives’ alignment between members and agricultural cooperatives| Members’ commitment lessens when agricultural cooperatives grow larger. Their organization becomes more complex, and their membership more heterogeneous, which threatens their sustainability and leads them to implement specific mechanisms for collective decisions. We explore how the alignment of objectives between a multi-purpose cooperative and its members influences member commitment. We estimate a multinomial probit model on a cross-section sample of 3205 members from a large agricultural cooperative in France. We assess the determinants of member commitment through four factors: the offer of new agricultural practices, the availability of outlets and supplies to members, the farm distance to the cooperative headquarters and the farm governance. We show that the adoption of new agricultural practices has a small but significant effect. The availability of outlets and supplies has the strongest effect on the economic involvement of the farmers. Other determinants, such as farm governance or geographical distance to the cooperative headquarters, also reinforce member commitment.
Q13|International, European and French trade in dairy products: trends and competitive dynamics|At the international level, the dairy sector is favored by a growing demand, mainly from Asian countries, where dairy consumption per capita remains much lower than that observed in the European Union (EU) and North America. Over the last fifteen years (2000-2015), New Zealand, the country that has most benefited from the growth of international trade in dairy products, especially under the influence of whole milk powdered Chinese imports was far ahead of the USA and the EU. Despite an increase in imports, especially of cheese and butter, France has regularly improved its trade balance which reached €3.75 billion in 2015. This performance was due mainly to the dynamics of trade with the United Kingdom and China. Since 2010, the trade balance of France with non-European countries has been improving while the internal competition with the EU is becoming more difficult. For the European dairy producers, the slight decline in demand for dairy products in the EU and the rapid increase in milk production in several Member States since the abolition of milk quotas in 2015 is a real threat. This should be an additional incentive to, firstly, increase exports abroad and, secondly, better sell the wide variety of dairy products on the domestic market.
Q13|Les échanges de bovins vivants et de viande bovine dans le monde et dans l’UE : trajectoires productives et commerciales des principaux pays impliqués|The increase in beef consumption in several Asian countries is helping to strengthen competitive games between the world's leading beef exporters, including Australia, India, Brazil and the United States. The main importers of beef and veal, including the United States, China (with Hong-Kong), Japan and Russia, have some differentiated trajectories according to changes in domestic demand for beef and veal, sanitary conditions in supplier countries and sometimes geopolitical issues. The European Union, which is experiencing both a decline in its production and consumption of beef, is not a major player in international trade in this sector. Domestic demand is largely satisfied by European products and significant flows of live cattle and beef take place between Member States. Using the available customs databases both on a global scale (Comtrade and Baci) and the European Union (Comext), this article proposes an analysis on the evolution of the productive and commercial situation of the main players in the beef cattle sector for the period 2000 to 2015.
Q13|Development And Concentration Of Maize Seed Market In Thailand|Today Thailand is the second largest field crop seed exporter in Asia with maize contributing the highest value to seed exports. Hybrid maize is considerably adopted in Thailand mainly due to the demand from feed industry and development of livestock and poultry industry. The success of varietal development of commercial maize hybrids is owed to the investments of international donors during the 1980s and continuous breeding efforts of multinational seed companies even as public institutions played a key role in maintaining genetic resources conservation and pre-commercial lines research. This paper reviews the history of research and development in maize and maize seed market development in Thailand. Furthermore, expert elicitation method is used to reveal the adoption of commercial maize varieties in 2013/2014 cropping seasons. The results of adopted maize varieties were used to estimate market shares and suggested that maize seed market in Thailand is moderately concentrated with tendencies towards oligopolistic competition.
Q13|Determinants of the Export Demand of U.S. Distillers Dried Grains with Solubles| The production and utilization of distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS), a co-product of corn ethanol, have surged since the Energy Policy Act of 2005 in the United States. The exports of U.S. DDGS have also rapidly grown more than five folds over the last decade. The objective of this study was to identify the determinants of U.S. DDGS exports and project the growth of DDGS exports to major international buyers. A commodity-specific gravity model was applied to U.S. DDGS exports to 29 countries from 2000 through 2013. Results suggest that importing country meat production, technical barriers to trade, tariffs, and U.S. ethanol production influence U.S. DDGS export quantities.
Q13|Consumer Willingness To Pay For Tennessee Certified Beef| Beef producers in Tennessee have expressed interest in the creation of an in-state certified beef program. Therefore, an online choice experiment was conducted to evaluate Tennessee consumer preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for Tennessee Certified Beef and other beef attributes that are likely to appear on Tennessee beef. Tennessee Certified Beef is defined as beef originating from animals born, raised, finished, and harvested in Tennessee. Results of two treatments, a Control Treatment in which consumers were not given the attribute definitions, and an Information Treatment in which consumers were given the attribute definitions, were compared for both steak and ground beef. Data was analyzed using a random parameters logit model. Results of both treatments indicate steak consumers valued Tennessee Certified Beef more highly than all other individual attributes including Certified Angus Beef, grass fed, no hormones administered, and Master Quality Raised Beef. Results for ground beef showed consumers most highly valued the attributes no hormones administered and Tennessee Certified Beef. Results suggest that Tennessee beef consumers would be willing to pay a premium for Tennessee branded beef.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Q13|Honduran Coffee Trade: Economic Effects of Fair Trade Certification On Individual Producers| Global demand for coffee has increased significantly due to emphasis placed on value creation throughout the coffee supply chain, increased consumption in emerging economies, and changes in consumer preference. The specialty coffee industry, in particular, has highlighted the economic effects on individual participants from producers to consumers. In an attempt to encourage a more equitable income distribution along the supply chain, organizations such as Fair Trade Coffee have emerged to address the welfare of producers. A simple regression analysis can be used to determine the impact of Fair Trade Certification on producer premiums obtained through these non-traditional distribution channels. The Fair Trade Model will also be evaluated based on historical market data related to the evolution of the specialty coffee industry, including similar trade models that have emerged due to increased awareness brought about by Fair Trade Coffee. This preliminary study will serve as a platform for future studies that will determine the overall impact of Honduran Fair Trade Coffee Certification on producer welfare.
Q13|The Impact of Hormone Use Perception on Consumer Meat Preference| Consumers see retail beef products labeled as produced with no added hormones (NAH), but also see similar labels on pork and chicken products on market shelves despite the fact that added hormones are not used in production. This may mislead consumers to think hormones are used in meat production as a whole. This research examines the impact of hormone use perception on consumer preference for meat products. Specifically, we assess consumer perception of hormone use in different livestock species as compared to actual use in production. We then assess whether hormone use perception affects consumer choice for unlabeled meat products. Finally, we identify whether consumer perception of hormone use affects willingness to pay (WTP) premiums for meat products labeled as produced with NAH. Choice experiment data was collected using Oklahoma State University monthly Food Demand Survey. Results indicate that consumers underestimate the rate of hormone use in cattle production, but overestimate the rate of hormone use in pork and chicken production. Results from a conditional logit model suggest that consumer perception of hormone use can affect food preferences for unlabeled meat products. Using a Tobit model, we also found WTP premiums for the NAH label are affected by consumer perception of hormone use and by demographic characteristics.
