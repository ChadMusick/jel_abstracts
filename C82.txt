C82|Measuring Success: Clio and the Value of Database Creation|In a recent article Stefano Fenoaltea (2018) bemoaned the loss of respect and focus on the importance of creating databases, or “measurement” as he referred to it. Cliometrics has made and continues to make valuable contributions not just to the field of economic history, but economics in general. In particular, we focus on the contribution of cliometrics to the creation of datasets. We highlight several important cases in both the past and present, of recognized important contributions of new datasets to the economics discipline. We argue that Clio has continually focused on, and valued, the creation of new data sets and the clever and novel ways they have been exploited to further the frontiers of knowledge, and that these efforts are both appreciated and recognized.
C82|ITER A quarterly indicator of regional economic activity in Italy|This work documents the construction of the new quarterly indicator of regional economic activity (Indicatore Trimestrale dell’Economia Regionale – ITER), which uses a parsimonious set of regional variables and combines them by means of temporal disaggregation techniques to obtain a quarterly index that is consistent with the official data on national and regional GDP and marked by a small lag compared with the reference period. The methodology was implemented to produce quarterly indicators for the economies of Italy’s four macro-areas in the period 1995-2017. With a view to assessing the performance of the quarterly indicator, a forecasting exercise was conducted regarding annual GDP growth in the four macro-areas for the period 2014-17. The forecasting performance of ITER is in line with that of the indicators developed by other national research institutions.
C82|Re-Engineering Key National Economic Indicators|Traditional methods of collecting data from businesses and households face increasing challenges. These include declining response rates to surveys, increasing costs to traditional modes of data collection, and the difficulty of keeping pace with rapid changes in the economy. The digitization of virtually all market transactions offers the potential for re-engineering key national economic indicators. The challenge for the statistical system is how to operate in this data-rich environment. This paper focuses on the opportunities for collecting item-level data at the source and constructing key indicators using measurement methods consistent with such a data infrastructure. Ubiquitous digitization of transactions allows price and quantity be collected or aggregated simultaneously at the source. This new architecture for economic statistics creates challenges arising from the rapid change in items sold. The paper explores some recently proposed techniques for estimating price and quantity indices in large scale item-level data. Although those methods display tremendous promise, substantially more research is necessary before they will be ready to serve as the basis for the official economic statistics. Finally, the paper addresses implications for building national statistics from transactions for data collection and for the capabilities and organization of the statistical agencies in the 21st century.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
C82|Is China Fudging Its GDP Figures? Evidence from Trading Partner Data|We propose using imports, measured as reported exports of trading partners, as an alternative benchmark to gauge the accuracy of alternative Chinese indicators (including GDP) of fluctuations in economic activity. Externally-reported imports are likely to be relatively well measured, as well as free from domestic manipulation. Using principal components, we derive activity indices from a wide range of indicators and examine their fit to (trading-partner reported) imports. We choose a preferred index of eight non-GDP indicators (which we call the China Cyclical Activity Tracker, or C-CAT). Comparison with that index and others indicate that Chinese statistics have broadly become more reliable in measuring cyclical fluctuations over time. However, GDP adds little information relative to combinations of other indicators. Moreover, since 2013, Chinese GDP growth has shown little volatility around a gradually slowing trend. Other measures, including the C-CAT and imports, do not show this reduction in volatility. Since 2017, the C-CAT slowed from well above trend to close to trend. As of mid- 2019, it was giving the same cyclical signal as GDP.
C82|Syria in the Dark: Estimating the Economic Consequences of the Civil War through Satellite-Derived Night Time Lights|The Syrian Civil War has begun in 2011 and is still wrecking enormous damages on the country's economy, with an impressive toll measured in deaths, migration, and the destruction of the Syrian historical heritage and physical infrastructure. This paper examines the impact of the War on Syria's economy from the perspective of outer space, to bypass the issue of data availability due to the inaccessibility of the war-ravaged territory. The estimates obtained in this way are more pessimistic than the ones reported by international organisations. Starting from our estimates, we provide long-term projections for the country's economy, and estimate the window for GDP recovery at the pre-war levels. We discuss geo-political implications which could prevent our projections from happening.
C82|Information Content Of The Russian Services Surveys|The paper explores the information content of surveys of the Russian services sector using the surveys’ results since 2012Q1 to 2018Q4. To summarise entrepreneurial opinions in a one-dimensional index the indicators of confidence and business climate are calculated. To examine the reaction of GDP to impulses in the business climate indicator and to forecast GDP growth by the end of 2019, the Vector Autoregression Model was used. The results of services surveys provide reliable information on the economic sentiment that is essential to measure recession and recovery development of the sector. Since 2013, the survey’s results demonstrate a stable five-year trend of ‘pessimism accumulation’ in the indicators dynamics. The slight increase in entrepreneurial optimism in 2016-2018 did not result in moving confidence to a positive zone. The business climate indicator (BCI) performs better than the traditional confidence indicator in terms of synchronous correlations with GDP growth. A longer observation period needs to draw conclusions about the BCI cyclic properties; however, it can be used now to analyze the development of the Russian services sector.
C82|European NUTS 2 regions: construction of interregional trade-linked Supply and Use tables with consistent transport flows|Economic development is interregional in nature, with economic growth being determined by physical and technological proximity identified by interregional and national cross-border interactions in trade, investments, and knowledge. This report explains the construction of a system of multiregional input-output tables for the EU28 interlinked with trade in goods and services within the same country as well as with regions in other Member States. Taking transhipment locations into account, trade in goods and services is derived from freight transport data, airline data on flights, and business travel data. The methodology is centred on the probability of trade flows and was developed to fit the information available without pre-imposing any geographical structure on the data.
C82|The RHOMOLO-IO modelling framework: a flexible Input-Output tool for policy analysis|This Technical Report describes the features of the RHOMOLO-IO model and demonstrates its flexibility by showing a number of recent policy-relevant applications for which it has been used. Such applications include, for instance, the study of the European Globalisation Fund, of four TEN-T investment projects, of the European research and innovation regional funds, and of regulatory proposals on the energy union in the EU. The paper contains traditional input-output multipliers analyses applied to output, GDP, and employment, as well as consumption redistribution and trade analyses. The flexibility of the RHOMOLO-IO framework makes it useful for a wide range of policy-relevant studies and makes it a perfect complement to the spatial computable general equilibrium RHOMOLO.
C82|Into the heterogeneities in the Portuguese labour market: an empirical assessment|"This paper provides a comprehensive study of the heterogeneity in the Portuguese labour market. We use Labour Force Survey microdata covering a complete business cycle, from 1998:1 to 2018:1, to evaluate the labour market attachment of several labour states and assess the most suitable allocation of individuals across statuses. We also evaluate the adequacy of the conventional unemployment criteria. Following the relevant strand of literature on this topic, we apply an evidence-based categorisation of labour market status by exploiting the information on the results of the behaviour of non-employed. To that end, we use multinomial and binary logit models of the determinants of transitions of workers across labour market states to test for the equivalence between non-employed groups. We conclude that heterogeneity is an evident feature of the Portuguese labour market, both between and within the conventional non-employment states. In particular, we find that the status comprising those inactive workers which want work constitutes a distinct state in the labour market and displays a transition behaviour closer to unemployment than to the group of inactive workers which do not want work. Moreover, the classification as inactive workers of individuals which report ""waiting"" as a reason for not having searched for a job, those individuals who have searched for a job but are still considered to be out-of-the-labour-force, as well as those individuals which are due to start work in more than three months might not be reasonable, since they show considerable attachment to the labour market and we reject the pooling of such states with their counterparts."
C82|A New Tidy Data Structure to Support Exploration and Modeling of Temporal Data|"Mining temporal data for information is often inhibited by a multitude of formats: irregular or multiple time intervals, point events that need aggregating, multiple observational units or repeated measurements on multiple individuals, and heterogeneous data types. On the other hand, the software supporting time series modeling and forecasting, makes strict assumptions on the data to be provided, typically requiring a matrix of numeric data with implicit time indexes. Going from raw data to model-ready data is painful. This work presents a cohesive and conceptual framework for organizing and manipulating temporal data, which in turn flows into visualization, modeling and forecasting routines. Tidy data principles are extended to temporal data by: (1) mapping the semantics of a dataset into its physical layout; (2) including an explicitly declared index variable representing time; (3) incorporating a ""key"" comprising single or multiple variables to uniquely identify units over time. This tidy data representation most naturally supports thinking of operations on the data as building blocks, forming part of a ""data pipeline"" in time-based contexts. A sound data pipeline facilitates a fluent workflow for analyzing temporal data. The infrastructure of tidy temporal data has been implemented in the R package tsibble."
C82|Newspaper-based economic uncertainty indices for Poland|Using text mining and web scraping techniques, we develop newspaper-based economic uncertainty measures for Poland. We build ‘general’ economic and economic-policy uncertainty indices, as well as category-specific ones designed to capture e.g. the economic uncertainty related to fiscal policy or to stockmarket movements. Several types of evidence suggest that these indices do proxy for changes in economic uncertainty in Poland. In particular, our measures spike around uncertainty-laden events or periods, such as the initial phase of Poland’s post-communist economic transition, the global financial crisis or the European debt crisis that followed. Our indices also exhibit correlation with a variety of other indicators of economic uncertainty, such as financial-market data and results of corporate surveys. The newspaper-based indices behave similarly to uncertainty indicators developed using other textual data and are strongly correlated with relevant economic uncertainty indicators developed by other researchers.
C82|Improving the Accuracy of Economic Measurement with Multiple Data Sources: The Case of Payroll Employment Data|This paper combines information from two sources of U.S. private payroll employment to increase the accuracy of real-time measurement of the labor market. The sources are the Current Employment Statistics (CES) from BLS and microdata from the payroll processing firm ADP. We briefly describe the ADP-derived data series, compare it to the BLS data, and describe an exercise that benchmarks the data series to an employment census. The CES and the ADP employment data are each derived from roughly equal-sized samples. We argue that combining CES and ADP data series reduces the measurement error inherent in both data sources. In particular, we infer “true” unobserved payroll employment growth using a state-space model and find that the optimal predictor of the unobserved state puts approximately equal weight on the CES and ADP-derived series. Moreover, the estimated state contains information about future readings of payroll employment.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
C82|A Century of High Frequency UK Macroeconomic Statistics: A Data Inventory|This paper provides an inventory of the available macroeconomic statistics in the UK for the last hundred years or so. The focus is on documenting the higher frequency (daily, monthly and quarterly) macroeconomic data that are available after the World War 1, rather than longer run annual time series which has been the focus of other collections. It discusses some of the challenges that need to be overcome in order to create a continuous historical dataset over this period. The inventory follows the structure of the Economic Trends Annual Supplement (ETAS) that was produced for many years by the Office for National Statistics. It covers statistics on National Accounts, prices, labour market indicators, selected demand and output indicators and financial market data (including money and credit aggregates). Using this structure the paper explores to what extent it is possible to create a consistent, usable and comprehensive high frequency macroeconomic dataset back to the 1920s and earlier.
C82|Classifying de facto exchange rate regimes of financially open and closed economies: A statistical approach|This paper offers a new de facto exchange rate regime classification that draws on the strengths of three popular classifications. Its two hallmarks are the careful treatment of a nexus between exchange rate regime and financial openness and the use of formal statistical tools (the trimmed k-means and k-nearest neighbour methods). It is demonstrated that our strategy minimises the impact of differences between market-determined and official exchange rates on the ‘fix’ and ‘float’ categories. Moreover, it is more suited to assess empirical relevance of the Mundellian trilemma and ‘irreconcilable duo’ hypotheses. Using comparative analysis we find that the degree of agreement between classifications is moderate: the null of no association is strongly rejected, but its strength ranges from low to moderate. Moreover, it is shown that our classification is the most strongly associated with each of the other classifications and as such can be considered (closest to) a centre of a space of alternative classifications. Finally, we demonstrate that unlike other classifications, ours lends more support to the Mundellian trilemma than to the ‘irreconcilable duo’ hypothesis. Overall, our classification cannot be considered a variant of any other de facto classification. It is a genuinely new classification.
C82|Bayesian multivariate Beveridge--Nelson decomposition of I(1) and I(2) series with cointegration|The consumption Euler equation implies that the output growth rate and the real interest rate are of the same order of integration; thus if the real interest rate is I(1), then so is the output growth rate with possible cointegration, and log output is I(2). This paper extends the multivariate Beveridge--Nelson decomposition to such a case, and develops a Bayesian method to obtain error bands. The paper applies the method to US data to estimate the natural rates (or their permanent components) and gaps of output, inflation, interest, and unemployment jointly, and finds that allowing for cointegration gives much bigger estimates of all gaps.

C82|Measuring the Services of Durables and Owner Occupied Housing|This paper provides an update to the chapter on the treatment of durables in the Consumer Price Index Manual (2004). The most important durable is housing, which typically accounts for approximately 20% of total consumption services. A large fraction of total housing services consists of the services of Owner Occupied Housing (OOH). The main approaches to measuring the services of OOH are (i) the acquisitions approach; (ii) the rental equivalence approach and (iii) the user cost approach. Two other approaches are sometimes used: (iv) the opportunity cost approach and (v) the payments approach. A main purpose of this paper is to present the main approaches to the treatment of OOH and to discuss the benefits and costs of the alternative approaches. The paper also discusses the problems associated with forming imputations for the services of â€œordinaryâ€ consumer durable goods.

C82|SSP Long Run Scenarios for European NUTS2 Regions|In this paper we illustrate the development of a modeling framework aimed at producing detailed quantitative estimates for economic variables, consistent with Shared Socio-economic Pathways, and their assumptions about national income and population. Our model not only provides information on industrial production levels, employment, consumption patterns, trade flows and other macroeconomic variables, but disaggregates them further at the sub-national level, for European NUTS2 regions. Estimates are produced by an especially designed dynamic general equilibrium model (G-RDEM), augmented with a regional down-scaling module. The latter takes into account the different sectoral composition of the regional economies, their endowments of primary resources, as well as the possible existence of structural and agglomeration externalities. After describing the methodology, the paper presents an illustrative sample of results produced by the model, focusing on Italian regions and the Shared Socio-economic Pathway 1 in the period 2011-2051.
C82|Foreign Investments Mostly Robust Despite Global Downturn; Shift into Services. FDI in Central, East and Southeast Europe|Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows to Central, East and Southeast Europe (CESEE) declined by 13% in 2018. The decline was almost exclusively on account of lower inflows into Russia, which halved compared with 2017. Inflows to the new EU Member States (EU-CEE11) were largely unchanged from the previous year, despite strong economic growth. By contrast, inflows into the Western Balkans rose by 28%, thanks in particular to rising investor interest in Serbia and North Macedonia. Turkey received a bit more FDI than in 2017, but the overall amount is still very low relative to the size of the economy. The decline in FDI to Russia in 2018 was particularly striking. Russia is becoming more and more inward looking, due to the exchange of sanctions with the West and (related) import-substitution economic policies. Efforts to stimulate the return of capital from abroad do not seem to be working FDI outflows were three times greater than inflows in 2018. Services accounted for the bulk of FDI in most countries in CESEE last year. In particular, producer-related business activities such as ICT, business process outsourcing and shared service centres expanded across the region. Services are not capital intensive, and thus are barely reflected in FDI data. However, the increasing share of services in announced greenfield FDI projects, and of commercial services in total exports, both point to a growing importance for foreign investors in these sectors. Germany and the US are the most important ultimate sources of FDI in CESEE. The share of Austrian outward FDI in CESEE is shrinking, at the expense of Asia and the US. Tax havens, the Netherlands, Cyprus and Luxembourg in particular are among the largest immediate investors but not among the important ultimate investing countries. Several trends shaping the future of FDI that are given special attention in this study. First, we find that the link between FDI inflows and GDP growth has become less strong since the crisis. Second, FDI inflows and participation in global value chains are strongly and positively correlated. Third, using a gravity model we highlight several CESEE countries attracting FDI at a level above their potential, particularly Montenegro and Bulgaria. By contrast, Belarus and Moldova could attract more FDI if business conditions improve. Finally, we note that business sentiment has a significant impact on greenfield investment decisions. Given that economic confidence across EU-CEE11 countries appears to be declining, we expect lower FDI inflows in 2019, which could lead to lower GDP growth. This is owing to faltering global and European economic activity, and restrictive policies in the US, Russia and China. Tax reform in the US will likely continue to have a particularly important negative impact on global FDI activity.

The wiiw FDI Database contains the full set of FDI data with time series starting form 1990 as far as available. Access to wiiw FDI Database

C82|What drives total real unit energy costs globally? A novel LMDI decomposition approach|This paper presents a novel logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) decomposition framework that is tailor-made for unit cost indicators. It adds four new models to the existing LMDI model family. The main novelty of the new framework lies in the separation of quantity and price effects captured in unit cost indicators, while retaining the same desirable properties of traditional models. Four case studies apply the novel LMDI framework to the total real unit energy costs (total RUEC) indicator. Total RUEC represents the sum of direct energy costs (for energy products) and indirect energy costs (energy costs embedded in intermediate inputs and passed on along global value chains) as a fraction of value added. This yardstick allows for monitoring shifts in the burden of energy costs on industries. The first three case studies, based on the World Input-Output Database, cover the period between 1995 and 2009. For an up-to-date analysis, a fourth case study collects additional data for 2009-2016 from energy and economic statistics' institutions. Globally, up until 2009, rising costs for crude petroleum/natural gas and the rise of China in the global economy were the largest drivers of total RUEC. In general, increases of indirect energy costs were more substantial than were those of direct energy costs. The total RUEC of Chinese car manufacturers increased much more strongly than did that of American car manufacturers. After 2009 (until 2016), prices for crude petroleum/natural gas and value added generation were major decelerating factors of global direct RUEC, while increases in energy consumption had offsetting effects. This paper provides a suitable tool to scientists who want to build on unit cost indicators in their research in general and to all policy-oriented institutions concerned with monitoring and analysing the energy transition in particular.
C82|Data revisions to German national accounts: Are initial releases good nowcasts?|Data revisions to national accounts pose a serious challenge to policy decision making. Well-behaved revisions should be unbiased, small and unpredictable. This paper shows that revisions to German national accounts are biased, large and predictable. Moreover, using filtering techniques designed to process data subject to revisions, the real-time forecasting performance of initial releases can be increased by up to 17%. For total real GDP growth, however, the initial release is an optimal forecast. Yet, given the results for disaggregated variables, the averaging-out of biases and inefficiencies at the aggregate GDP level appears to be good luck rather than good forecasting.
C82|Foreign Direct Investments: A Comparison of EAEU, DCFTA and Selected EU-CEE Countries|Foreign direct investment (FDI) has been the main driver of restructuring and modernisation in Central and Eastern Europe. This paper looks into FDI stocks and flows in a dynamic and cross-country perspective, comparing the key EAEU countries (Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia) as well as DCFTA countries (Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine) with selected EU-CEE peers (Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia) in the neighbourhood. The study shows that EAEU and DCFTA countries have not been particularly attractive for foreign investors taking out round tripping inflows from offshore destinations, the accumulated FDI would be even lower. This explains a lot why restructuring in the region stalls. This pattern can change only with marked improvements in the domestic regulatory environment and investment climate.
C82|Methods and applications of the IW business survey|Surveys of businesses provide important data for an analysis of economic development. In addition to the statistical offices in the respective states, private sector institutions such as re-search institutes or associations provide a diverse range of economic data. The following article presents the business survey conducted by the German Economic Institute (Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft, IW). It provides comprehensive information on the current situation and the outlook of German companies and serves as an important basis for the half-year economic forecast by the German Economic Institute (Grömling, 2005).
C82|Revisionen der Volkswirtschaftlichen Gesamtrechnungen: Revisionspraxis des Statistischen Bundesamtes und ihre Auswirkungen auf Prognosen|Eine wesentliche Grundlage für makroökonomische Analysen sind die Volkswirtschaftlichen Gesamtrechnungen (VGR). Für Deutschland werden diese vom Statistischen Bundesamt vierteljährlich veröffentlicht. Die erste Veröffentlichung basiert noch auf unvollständigen Daten, so dass die Angaben noch mehrfach revidiert werden, bis etwa dreieinhalb Jahre nach Ende eines Jahres der endgültige Wert vorliegt. Überlagert werden diese laufenden Revisionen von sogenannten Generalrevisionen, mit denen systematische Änderungen in den VGR umgesetzt werden. Beobachten lassen sich nur die Revisionen insgesamt, während mit Blick auf die Arbeit der statistischen Ämter und den Gesetzgeber eher das Ausmaß der laufenden Revisionen von Interesse ist. Der vorliegende Beitrag isoliert mit Hilfe eines einfachen Ansatzes die laufenden Revisionen und untersucht deren Ausmaß sowie, ob sie Systematiken folgen. Dabei lassen sich für eine Reihe preisbereinigter Verwendungsaggregate der VGR wie auch für die Erwerbstätigkeit Systematiken wie Verzerrung, Autokorrelation der Revisionen und Korrelation von Ausmaß der der Revision mit der Zuwachsrate der betreffenden Größe finden. Dies weist auf Möglichkeiten hin, durch bessere Datennutzung die Revisionsanfälligkeit der VGR zu verringern. Dies ist auch mit Blick auf die Genauigkeit von Prognosen wünschenswert, denn die Arbeit zeigt am Beispiel der Gemeinschaftsdiagnose, dass die Fehler der im Herbst veröffentlichten Prognosen eng mit den Revisionen der Daten für das erste Halbjahr des betreffenden Jahres korrelieren.
C82|Patents in the Long Run: Theory, History and Statistics|This paper examines the structural and spatial dynamics of patents in France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. The time series are extracted from an international, comparative and historical database on the long term evolution of patents in 40 countries from the 17th century to 1945 and in more than 150 countries from 1945 to present (Diebolt and Pellier, 2010). We found strong proof of infrequent large shocks resulting essentially from the major economic and political events formed by the two World Wars in the twentieth century. Our results question the autonomous process, i.e. the internal dynamic of the patent systems. Wars seem to push innovation and finally the economic growth process itself. We further investigated the role of innovation in economic growth through a causality analysis between patents and GDP per capita. Our major findings support the assumption that the accumulation of innovations was a driving force only for France, the United Kingdom and the United States during the post World War II period.
C82|GDP by Industry in Real Time: Are Revisions Well Behaved?|The monthly data for real gross domestic product (GDP) by industry are used extensively in real time both to ground the Bank of Canada’s monitoring of economic activity and in the Bank’s nowcasting tools, making these data one of the most important high-frequency time series for Canadian nowcasting. This note documents the series’ real-time properties using the reference period August 2007 to September 2017. It shows that revisions to headline GDP-by-industry growth are generally well behaved; that is, they have a zero mean and low variance and are not revised predictably. Therefore, the signal for overall growth from the first GDP-by-industry release can be received with a good deal of confidence. This analysis suggests, however, that while this result is true on average, there are times when revisions can be important. Two examples discussed are when the economy begins to contract or expand and when end-of-quarter revisions are made. Further, revisions to the industrial sectors are not as well behaved. Revisions to some sectors do not have a zero mean and are generally much larger and more volatile than those for headline growth. In addition, revisions for most sectors exhibit predictability. As a result, the monthly signal from the sector data should be considered more cautiously than should the headline growth series.
C82|G-RDEM: A GTAP-Based Recursive Dynamic CGE Model for Long-Term Baseline Generation and Analysis|We motivate and detail the new GTAP-based recursive dynamic economic model (G-RDEM), a computable general equilibrium tool for long-term counterfactual analysis and baseline generation from given gross domestic product (GDP) and population projections. It encompasses an implicitly directly additive demand system (AIDADS) demand system with non-linear Engel curves, debt accumulation from foreign saving and introduces sector specific productivity changes, endogenous aggregate saving rates, as well as time-varying cost shares for value added and individual intermediates. Parameters for these relationships are econometrically estimated or taken from published work. The core of the model is derived from the Global Trade Anaylsis Project (GTAP) standard model and seamlessly incorporated into the modular and flexible CGEBox modelling platform, allowing for combined applications with various other extensions, such as GTAP-agro-ecological zones (AEZ) or GTAP-Water. G-RDEM maintains the flexible aggregation from the GTAP Data Base. It is open source, encoded in General Algebraic Modelling System (GAMS) and can be steered by a Graphical User Interface, which also encompasses a tool to analyse results with tables, graphs and maps. Existing GDP and population projections from the Socio-Economic Pathways (SSP) 1-5 can be directly incorporated for baseline construction. A comparison of the generated long-term structural composition of the economy against a simple recursive-dynamic variant, derived from the standard GTAP model, shows that G-RDEM brings about much more plausible results, as well as a more realistic, internally consistent representation of the economic structure in a hypothetical future.
C82|The Irish GDP in 2016. After the disaster comes a dilemma|The paper examines the disruption of statistics with the publication of the 2015 Ireland GDP at +26.3 per cent year on year. The figure was greeted by international disbelief. Ireland’s statistical authorities reacted with the publication, for the main aggregates, of modified data in parallel with the official one, much less affected by the bias on value added. The bias resulted from the relocation in Ireland of a huge amount of intellectual property capital, of the dimension of the GDP itself.To fix the link between statistical representation and economic fact means to depart from the legal form to let the substance prevail, i.e. depart from the description given by business reports and administrative data.
C82|Lost in translation: What do Engel curves tell us about the cost of living?| The Hamilton method for estimating CPI bias is simple, intuitive, and has been widely adopted. We show that the method conflates CPI bias with variation in cost-of-living across income levels. Assuming a single price index across the income distribution is inconsistent with the downward sloping Engel curves that are necessary to implement the method. We develop and implement the Translated Engel curve (TEC) method that disentangles genuine CPI bias from differences caused by comparing changes in the cost of living across different income levels - non-homotheticity. The TEC method gives substantially different estimates of CPI bias prior to major reforms to the CPI in 1999 (post-Boskin), but both methods suggest very little CPI bias thereafter.
C82|MegBec - Un modèle d’équilibre général calculable multirégional du Québec|This document presents the MegBec multiregional model of Quebec, a recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model with 16 “analytic” regions. The model is based on a social accounting matrix (SAM) with 44 industries and 63 products. The first part of the document describes how the SAM was constructed. First, a SAM for Quebec as a whole was elaborated, using the 2011 Statistics Canada supply and use tables. Regional SAMs were built from that one by distributing values across regions following several key indicators, particularly the regional GDP estimates of the Institut de la statistique du Québec. The resulting discrepancy in each region between salaries received and paid is attributed to worker commuting; origin-destination flows were estimated using cross-entropy minimization from Statistics Canada’s 2011 Census commuting data. Discrepancies between regional absorption and production are attributed to interregional trade; bi-lateral flows are generated by simulation using a gravity model. Attraction factors – key parameters in the gravity model – are obtained by aggregating attraction factors constructed at the finer Municipalité Régionale de Comté (MRC) spatial scale, according to network distances, in minutes, between population-weighted centroids. The second part of the document persents the model itself, whose specification is more or less standard for dynamic multiregional CGE models. In particular, trade between regions follows the Armington imperfect substituability hypothesis: supply is apportioned according to constant-elasticity-of-transformation (CET) functions, and demand according to constant-elasticity-of-substitution (CES) functions. Regional labor markets are characterized by the presence of unemployment, the rate of which depends on the level of wages, following a wage curve. Interregional worker commuting flows are logistic functions of regional wage rates. The document includes several appendices, one of which describes the reference scenario and the closure rules that are applied by default in the model. Ce document présente le modèle multirégional du Québec MegBec, un modèle d’équilibre général calculable (MEGC) dynamique séquentiel où l’on distingue 16 régions dites « régions analytiques ». Il s’appuie sur une matrice de comptabilité sociale (MCS) avec 44 industries et 63 produits. La première partie du document décrit le processus d’élaboration de la MCS. D’abord on a élaboré une MCS du Québec dans son ensemble, à partir des tableaux de ressources-emplois de 2011 de Statistique Canada. À partir de cette MCS, les matrices régionales ont été construites en répartissant les valeurs entre régions selon plusieurs clés, en particulier les estimations du PIB des régions de l’Institut de la statistique du Québec. L’écart qui en résulte dans chaque région entre salaires reçus et salaires payés est attribué au navettage des travailleurs; les flux origine-destination ont été estimés par la méthode de minimisation de l’entropie croisée à partir de données de navettage du recensement de 2011 de Statistique Canada. Les écarts entre l’absorption et la production régionales par produit sont attribués aux échanges interrégionaux, qui sont générés par simulation au moyen d’un modèle gravitaire. Les facteurs d’attractivité, paramètres critiques du modèle gravitaire, sont obtenus par agrégation de facteurs d’attractivité construits à l’échelle plus fine des MRC, selon les distances réticulaires en minutes entre centroïdes pondérés par la population. La deuxième partie du document présente le modèle lui-même, dont la spécification est grosso modo conforme à la structure classique des MEGC multirégionaux dynamiques. En particulier, le commerce entre les régions suit l’hypothèse de substituabilité imparfaite d’Armington : l’offre se distribue suivant des fonctions de distribution de l’offre à élasticité de transformation constante (CET) et la demande suivant des fonctions de répartition de la demande à élasticité de substitution constante (CES). Les marchés régionaux du travail sont caractérisés par la présence de chômage, dont le taux dépend du niveau des salaires, selon une courbe salaire-chômage (wage curve). Le navettage interrégional des travailleurs suit un modèle de fonction logistique des salaires régionaux. Le document compte plusieurs annexes, dont l’une décrit le scénario de référence et expose les règles de fermeture appliquées par défaut dans le modèle.
C82|The Impact of Microcredit on Farms and Rural Household: A Literature Review of Experimental Studies|In this article, we review the literature on the best ways to identify the causal effects of microcredit, present, and discuss some empirical results of the impact of microcredit on the adoption of innovations, investments, farm incomes, and profits. The results of empirical studies converge toward a positive impact of access to microcredit on the adoption of agricultural technology and investment. In terms of the effect on the technical efficiency of farms, agricultural income and profit, and consumption, the results do not all point in the same direction. The effects of microcredit are likely to vary depending on the context of the study.
C82|Google econometrics: nowcasting euro area car sales and big data quality requirements|Big data” is becoming an increasingly important aspect of our daily lives as the digital sources of information and intelligence that it encompasses become more structured and more publicly available. These sources may enable the generation of new datasets providing high-frequency and timely insights into unconscious digital behaviour and the consequent actions of economic agents, which may, in turn, assist in the generation of early indicators of economic and financial trends and activities. This paper examines the usefulness of Google search data in nowcasting euro area car sales, as a leading macroeconomic indicator, and considers the quality requirements for using these new data sources as a toolkit for sound decision and policy making. The paper finds that, while Google data may have predictive capabilities for nowcasting euro area car sales, further quality improvements in the data source are needed in order to move beyond experimental statistics. If these quality requirements can be met, the resulting advances in theory and knowledge around interpreting big data can be expected to significantly re-shape how we think about and explain both behaviour and complex socio-economic phenomena.

C82|A network-based method to harmonize data classifications|A frequent problem in research is the harmonization of data to a common classification, whether that is in terms of ? to name a few examples ? industries, commodities, occupations, or geograph- ical areas. Statistical offices often provide concordance tables, to match data through time or with different classifications, but these concordance tables alone are often not sufficient to define a clear methodology on how the matching should be performed. In fact, the concordance tables have, in numerous occasions, a many-to-many mapping of classifications. The issue is exacerbated when two or more concordance tables are concatenated. In this Jupyter notebook, I discuss a network- based abstraction of this problem and propose, as a general solution, a method that identifies the network components (or the network communities) to make data converge to a new classification. The method simplifies the issue and reduces greatly conversion errors.
C82|Measuring Aggregate Housing Wealth : New Insights from an Automated Valuation Model|We construct a new measure of aggregate U.S. housing wealth based on Zillow’s Automated Valuation Model (AVM). AVMs offer advantages over other methods because they are based on recent market transaction prices, utilize large datasets which include property characteristics and local geographic variables, and are updated frequently with little lag. However, using Zillow’s AVM to measure aggregate housing wealth requires overcoming several challenges related to the representativeness of the Zillow sample. We propose methods that address these challenges and generate a new estimate of aggregate U.S. housing wealth from 2001 to 2016. This new measure provides insights into some of the disadvantages of other approaches to measuring housing wealth. Specifically, with respect to the owner valuations typically used in survey data, it appears that homeowners were slow to recognize the drop in housing wealth during the financial crisis and that their estimates of this drop were unrealistically small. At the same time, repeat-sales price indexes appear to overstate the extent of the drop in value between 2006 and 2011 and overstate the recovery thereafter.
C82|“Free” Internet Content: Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and the Sources of Economic Growth|The Internet has evolved from Web 1.0, with static web pages and limited interactivity, to Web 2.0, with dynamic content that relies on user engagement. This change increased production costs significantly, but the price charged for Internet content has generally remained the same: zero. Because no transaction records the “purchase” of this content, its value is not reflected in measured growth and productivity. To capture the contribution of the “free” Internet, we model the provision of “free” content as a barter transaction between the content users and the content creators, and we value this transaction at production cost. When we incorporate this implicit transaction into U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), productivity, and household accounts, we find that including “free” content raises estimates of growth, but not nearly enough to reverse the recent slowdown.
C82|EQCHANGE: A world database on actual and equilibrium effective exchange rates|The aim of this paper is to present EQCHANGE, the new database developed by the CEPII on effective exchange rates. EQCHANGE includes two sub-databases containing data on (i) nominal and real effective exchange rates, and (ii) equilibrium real effective exchange rates and corresponding currency misalignments for advanced, emerging and developing countries. More specifically, the first sub-database delivers effective exchange rates for 187 countries that are computed under three different weighting schemes and two panels of trading partners (186 and top 30) over the 1973–2016 period. The second sub-database provides behavioral equilibrium exchange rate (BEER) estimates and corresponding currency misalignments for 182 economies over the 1973–2016 period. We describe the construction of the two datasets and illustrate some possible uses by presenting results concerning the evolution and main characteristics of currency misalignments in the world from 2015 to 2016. By providing publicly available indicators of equilibrium exchange rates, EQCHANGE aims to contribute to key debates in international macroeconomics.

C82|Why 1990 international Geary-Khamis dollars cannot be a foundation for reliable long run comparisons of GDP|Using a large, new dataset of agricultural prices and quantities for many countries and regions, we create five new international Geary-Khamis pounds – for 1870, 1845, 1775, 1705, and a superior chained series. We show that estimated levels and changes in output per worker look very different – more extreme – using 1705 international pounds and 1990 international dollars, compared to all other series; growth rates appear substantially higher using 1990 international dollars. In short, out-of-sample baskets and/or prices create extremely unreliable output estimates. We also show that individual country price indices (rather than international indices) can generate substantially different estimated growth rates.
C82|Seasonal adjustment of time series and calendar influence on economic activity|This paper describes the process of the seasonal adjustment of data time series for Croatia, a process that involves cooperation between the Croatian National Bank and the Croatian Bureau of Statistics. The paper shows individual steps of the process, explains calendar effects, describes the revision policy for seasonally adjusted data and presents the seasonal adjustment of selected main monthly indicators of economic activity in the Republic of Croatia: industrial production, the volume of construction works and retail trade turnover. Working-day effect was identified for all indicators; leap year effect was identified for all but the volume of construction works, i.e. the Easter effect for retail trade turnover only. The described assumptions and limitations of the models applied are useful to end-users for the purpose of a better understanding of the published data and their use in further analysis.
C82|Lost in Translation: What do Engel Curves Tell us about the Cost of Living?|The Hamilton method for estimating CPI bias is simple, intuitive, and has been widely adopted. We show that the method confiates CPI bias with variation in cost-of-living across income levels. Assuming a single price index across the income distribution is inconsistent with the downward sloping Engel curves that are necessary to implement the method. We develop and implement the Translated Engel curve (TEC) method that disentangles genuine CPI bias from differences caused by comparing changes in the cost of living across different income levels - non-homotheticity. The TEC method gives substantially different estimates of CPI bias prior to major reforms to the CPI in 1999 (post-Boskin), but both methods suggest very little CPI bias thereafter.
C82|A structural analysis of Japanese economic development|Japan successfully escaped from poverty after the world war and attained prosperity in a matter of two decades. There were two keys for the success. One was the priority production system – the idea to develop the industries at the bottom of the triangulated input-output table first, and to climb the triangle step by step. The second key for the success was the country’s unique financial system; they deliberately grew both long-term financial institutions for large enterprises and local credit associations for small businesses. When Japanese exporting manufacturers fought the appreciation of yen at the end of the 20th century, their answer was the mass introduction of industrial robots. The exporters won the fight but the country did not. What went wrong; what lesson do we learn from it?
C82|Imputing Away the Ladder: Implications of Changes in National Accounting Standards for Assessing Inter-country Inequalities|Over the last half century, a large literature has developed on both the nature and the drivers of uneven development. While different methodologies and theoretical approaches to the issue of convergence abound, the use of GDP growth as a measure of economic growth has, remarkably, gone unquestioned. This paper reviews the convergence debates to date, and examines what the changes to the System of National Accounts (SNA) - the international standard for constructing macroeconomic indicators such as GDP - imply for assessing economic convergence. The 1993 and 2008 revisions to the SNA include several major changes to how production is measured - including the reclassification of financial intermediation services, R&D, weapons systems and owner-occupied dwellings as productive activities - all areas in which developed countries have had an advantage in recent decades. We argue that these changes to the production boundary constitute a form of ‘kicking away the ladder,’ i.e. redefining the yardstick of development to fit the new strengths of developed economies. We analyze data series for a range of countries concurrently available under the 1968 SNA, 1993 SNA and 2008 SNA standards. The earlier measure shows a larger and faster convergence of most countries in ‘the Rest’ with those of ‘the West’. Going a step further, we build on Basu and Foley’s (2013) Measured Value-Added concept as a proxy of ‘Core GDP’. This indicator omits any sector for which value-added is imputed based on net incomes, in the absence of an independent measure of output. This allows us to examine more countries and a longer, more consistent time series than concurrent SNA data, but the conclusions are the same - developing countries have caught up more in Core-GDP terms than the contemporary imputation-heavy measure of GDP would suggest. These findings suggest that the current measure of GDP has become decoupled from core employment-generating activities, and is therefore a misleading measure of growth in an economy. Furthermore, it is inconsistent with the understanding the Sustainable Development Goals of inclusive and sustainable growth. Finally, the paper considers the political economy implications of the changes in GDP methodology, such as the justification of voting shares in international financial institutions, epistemological consequences, and domestic political economy considerations.
C82|Reconciled Trade Flow Estimates Using an FGLS Estimator|This paper proposes a new method to reconcile countries' reports of their bilateral trade, extracting the optimal amount of information from noisy reports. Reconciled estimates are a weighted average of exporter and importer reports, with weights chosen to minimise the variance of the error in the reconciliation estimate. Reports of countries that appear to report their trade more precisely are given more weight, but non-zero weight is (optimally) given even to relatively noisy reporters.
C82|Including unpaid household activities: An estimate of its impact on macro-economic indicators in the G7 economies and the way forward|The System of National Accounts, which provides information on important macroeconomic indicators such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), household disposable income and final consumption, typically excludes the value of unpaid household activities. Exceptions are made for the production of goods for own final consumption (e.g. subsistence farming), the services from owner-occupied dwellings, and the production from employment of paid domestic staff, but the output from unpaid domestic and personal services, such as the preparation of meals, taking care of children, cleaning, repairs, volunteering, etc., is all excluded. This report deals with the impact of including unpaid household activities on macro-economic aggregates for G7-countries. It builds upon earlier work by Ahmad and Koh (2011) and van de Ven and Zwijnenburg (2016). The report starts off with discussing the pros and cons of including unpaid household activities, or more specifically, the reasons why these activities are currently excluded from the macro-economic aggregates that can be derived from the framework of national accounts. It then discusses how estimates can be compiled using statistics from time use surveys and other available information. Here, also some of the complexities related to the approximate valuation of unpaid household activities are being addressed. Subsequently, results are presented for the level estimates of GDP as well as for economic growth when including the value of unpaid household activities for the G7 economies. The report concludes with a number of recommendations on the way forward, also touching upon some of the (potential) policy implications of the work on valuing unpaid household activities.
C82|Forecasting GDP: Do Revisions Matter?|"This paper investigates the informational content of regular revisions to real GDP growth and its components. We perform a real-time forecasting exercise for the advance estimate of real GDP growth using dynamic regression models that include GDP and GDP component revisions. Echoing other work in the literature, we find little evidence that including aggregate GDP growth revisions improves forecast accuracy relative to an AR(1) baseline model; however, when we include revisions to components of GDP (i.e. C, I, G, X, and M) we find improvements in forecast accuracy. Overall, nearly 68\% of all models that contain subsets of component revisions outperform our baseline model. The ""best"" component-augmented model forecasts roughly 0.2 percentage points better, and a large subset of models improve RMSFE by more than 5%. Finally, we use Bayesian model comparison to demonstrate that differences in forecast performance are unlikely to be the result of statistical noise. Our results imply that component revisions, in particular to consumption, contain important information for forecasting GDP growth."
C82|La mesure du chômage au Maroc : rien n’est moins sûr<BR>[Measuring unemployment in Morocco: a dubious approach]|The Moroccan unemployment figures tell a tale of a statistical misery that hides another one's but more real and painful. First, the purpose of this essay is to highlight the fact that these figures are a product of preemptive arbitrations, in terms of definition and calculation methodology, aimed at putting in perspective their scope and adeptness to cover the subject of unemployment and its multitude of facets. Subsequently, the essay surmises the necessity to strengthen unemployment statistical information with the introduction of the unemployment halo calculation, and its systematic communication, as well as standard simulations of unemployment rates targeted for higher activity levels. The unemployment halo is estimated here at 5.2-11.7 Million people, according to statistical analysis geared towards stay at home wives, and the unemployment rate rises to 30 % for a similar activity ratio that the developed countries. Finally, this essay contends for the right of access to raw survey information, well before the definition, and application, of unemployment criteria in order to allow complementary measures emanating from alternative definitions to emerge.

C82|Statistical quality by design: certification, rules and culture|To achieve and to communicate quality of official statistics, it is essential that national statistical institutes adopt some system of quality by design, i.e. formal quality certification, e.g. ISO or EFQM. International law, international regulations, national law, specific statistical regulations, Code of Practice, Privacy, ISO 27001 (Information security) and ISO 9001 (Quality management systems). These are some of the ‘rules’ that National Statistical Institutes have to work with. In this paper we look at the why and how of these rules: why should we follow these rules, how to manage these rules and how to transform them into practice. Even if an NSI complies with all principles of the Code of Practice for European Statistics, it is still necessary to have external proof of commitment to process and product quality as well as to privacy and security. We argue that to achieve and to communicate quality of official statistics, it is essential that national statistical institutes adopt some system of quality by design, i.e. formal quality certification, e.g. ISO or EFQM. Such an external proof is necessary in order to maintain public trust in statistics. But quality does not come by itself. The statistics that are actually produced, must have sufficient quality. So we also need a quality culture that provides a production and work environment in which quality is embedded. In essence, the quality culture should be based on the principles that the staff of NSIs are professionals and are responsible for the quality of their products. But their main task is to produce statistics, not to understand all those rules mentioned before. Therefore the only way to make them involved is to make them the real owners of quality; this should be our goal for the years to come. It requires embodiment of the quality culture in work processes, management, and guidelines, based on Total Quality Management and plan-do-check-act cycles.
C82|Quality management of methodology and process development for official statistics|"Methodology and process development are cornerstones of official statistics and belong to the major factors that contribute to their quality. This is reflected in the European Statistics Code of Practice, which mentions that ""Sound methodology underpins quality statistics"" and “Appropriate statistical procedures, implemented from data collection to data validation, underpin quality statistics”. However, methodology and processes are hard to explain to the average user, and so we must find other ways to ensure trust in statistical methodology and processes, and to convince users of the quality of official statistical methodology and processes. Important elements of such an approach are independence of the methodological and development units, transparency of methods and process designs, peer reviews, internal reviews and evaluations, and internal quality management. In this paper we look in particular at quality management. We show how quality management of methodological and development units may be based on the Code of Practice. We show how the various elements work together, and how the whole of these elements may lead to certification of the units, for example by EFQM or ISO. In 2017 the department for process development and methodology at Statistics Netherlands was certified according to ISO 9001. As an example, we discuss the various steps that have been taken to achieve this certification. In particular we focus on: the quality procedures for internal and external reports, recommendations and briefs; the quality assurance of statistical development projects in which methodologists and business analysts participate; the quality assurance of methodological courses taught to statisticians; the internal management of the department."
C82|Explaining Differences In Efficiency: A Meta‐Study On Local Government Literature|This paper reviews the literature on local government efficiency by meta‐reviewing 360 observations retrieved from 54 papers published from 1993 to 2016. The meta‐regression is based on a random‐effects model estimated with the two‐step random‐effects maximum likelihood (REML) technique proposed by Gallet and Doucouliagos. Results indicate that the study design matters when estimating a frontier in local government. We find that studies focusing on technical efficiency provide higher efficiency scores than works evaluating cost efficiency. The same applies when using panel data instead of cross‐section data. Interestingly, studies that use the Free Disposal Hull (FDH) approach yield, on average, higher efficiency scores than papers employing the data envelopment analysis (DEA) method, thereby suggesting that in this literature the convexity hypothesis of the production set is a matter. Finally, the efficiency of local government increases with the level of development of the analysed countries and is positively related to the national integrity of the legal system. The opposite holds when considering the corruption.
C82|Development of a two-sector model with an extended energy sector and application to Portugal (1960-2014)|In basic economic growth models, energy is neglected as a production factor, and output is generated from capital and labor in a single-sector process, with most of growth attributed to an exogenous residual. However, alternative approaches argue for a multi-sector system in which the major contribution to growth comes from increased efficiency in the conversion of energy to more productive forms. In this work we develop a two-sector model for the economy, featuring an extended energy sector, including all primary-to-final (energy industries) and final-to-useful (end-use devices) exergy conversion processes. Exergy is a thermodynamics concept, accounting for the potential of energy to perform work. Empirical application of the model for a single country (Portugal) requires decomposition and reclassification of national accounts and energy balances, to match empirical data with the model’s variables. Obtained estimates for the price of useful exergy (an intermediate product) facilitate the construction of gross output measures for more accurate growth accounting. Evidence suggests that declining useful exergy prices act as an engine of growth, as previously suggested in the literature. Additionally, useful exergy and capital inputs to non-energy related production act as complements while capital productivity in useful exergy generation declines slightly in the past decade.
C82|External Debt and Economic Growth in Ghana: A Co-integration and a Vector Error Correction Analysis|This paper employed a co-integration analysis and an error correction methodology to examine the impact of external debt on economic growth in Ghana using annual time series from 1970-2017. Estimates show that our normalized long-run co-integrating growth equation coefficients do not differ from our short-run vector error correction coefficients for our variables of interest. Findings are that external debt inflows stimulate growth in Ghana both in the long-run and short-run. Secondly, our study also confirmed the crowding out effect, debt overhang effect and the non-linear effect of external debt on economic growth in Ghana. From the perspective of policy, we advocate for a judicious allocation of the debt resources such that the cost of servicing the debt will not skew resources away from investment which in a medium to long-term will be inimical to growth.
C82|Nowcasting the Unemployment Rate in the EU with Seasonal BVAR and Google Search Data|Abstract In this paper a Bayesian vector autoregressive model for nowcasting the seasonally non-adjusted unemployment rate in EU-countries is developed. On top of the official statistical releases, the model utilizes Google search data and the effect of Google data on the forecasting performance of the model is assessed. The Google data is found to yield modest improvements in forecasting accuracy of the model. To the author’s knowledge, this is the first time the forecasting performance of the Google search data has been studied in the context of Bayesian vector autoregressive model. This paper also adds to the empirical literature on the hyperparameter choice with Bayesian vector autoregressive models. The hyperparameters are set according to the mode of the posterior distribution of the hyperparameters, and this is found to improve the out-of-sample forecasting accuracy of the model significantly, compared to the rule-of-thumb values often used in the literature.
C82|National accounts for a global economy: the case of Ireland|Globalisation is affecting the way economic activity is reflected in the national accounts. Intellectual property, which is now part of the capital stock, interacts with the choice of global firms as to their legal structure, producing different national accounting outcomes for individual countries. This is but one manifestation of the challenges that a global economy presents for national accounting. Using the example of Ireland, consideration is given to the data needed to meet the needs of users of national accounts. In particular, more information is required to separately identify all the activity of multinational enterprises and domestically owned firms. This paper suggests a set of satellite accounts for Ireland that would show how changes in the economy affect the economic welfare of Irish residents.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

C82|Alternative Methods for Interpolating PPPs|The paper draws on a previous paper by Diewert and Fox which addressed two problems: (i) how to measure aggregate real output and inflation for a group of countries and (ii) how to construct measures of real GDP for a group of countries where the country measures of real GDP are comparable across time and space. In order to address both problems, it is necessary that the group of countries construct Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs). The present paper looks at the related problem of interpolating PPPs between benchmark years when PPPs have been constructed. The paper shows that the method of interpolation that was suggested by Diewert and Fox is equivalent to a variant of the method used by the Penn World Tables to interpolate PPPs between benchmarks. The interpolation methods are compared to actual OECD PPPs for the years 2001-2017.
C82|Patents in the Long Run: Theory, History and Statistics|This paper examines the structural and spatial dynamics of patents in France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. The time series are extracted from an international, comparative and historical database on the long term evolution of patents in 40 countries from the 17th century to 1945 and in more than 150 countries from 1945 to present (Diebolt and Pellier, 2010). We found strong proof of infrequent large shocks resulting essentially from the major economic and political events formed by the two World Wars in the twentieth century. Our results question the autonomous process, i.e. the internal dynamic of the patent systems. Wars seem to push innovation and finally the economic growth process itself. We further investigated the role of innovation in economic growth through a causality analysis between patents and GDP per capita. Our major findings support the assumption that the accumulation of innovations was a driving force only for France, the United Kingdom and the United States during the post World War II period.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
C82|Towards a more comprehensive assessment of fiscal space|The prolonged sluggishness in the world economy since the global financial crisis has led to growing calls for a reorientation of macroeconomic policies toward more supportive fiscal measures. Such calls inevitably invite the question of how much fiscal space governments actually have. This paper provides a systematic review of the most popular definitions and measures of fiscal space. It examines the evolution of fiscal space measures and discusses the pros and cons of each measure. It then outlines several key factors that could help to further strengthen existing approaches and allow a more comprehensive assessment of fiscal space. By illustrating how different measures paint considerably different pictures of an economy’s fiscal space, the paper underscores the need to use a dashboard of indicators.
C82|Sustainable Development Goals indicators: a methodological proposal for a fuzzy Super Index in the Mediterranean area|This paper provides a methodological proposal for the construction of a multidimensional index for sustainability assessment in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In particular, the paper proposes a new methodology to properly estimate the multidimensional nature of sustainable development and the SDGs introducing an innovative fuzzy approach. Specifically, we present a multidimensional methodology to build a Super Index to measure the performance of the Mediterranean countries towards the SDGs with a focus on the agro-food sustainability in line with the Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean Area (PRIMA). For this purpose, drawing on the fuzzy approach developed by Betti et al. (2015), a step by step procedure is provided in the paper: first the underlying dimensions of a set of selected indicators for the SDGs are identified through an exploratory factor analysis and then an innovative weighting methodology is applied for the aggregation of the indicators to calculate the countries’ scores for each dimension and finally the overall index.
C82|Exploring Long Run Structural Change with a Dynamic General Equilibrium Model|In this paper we present a computable general equilibrium model (G-RDEM), specifically designed for the generation of long run scenarios of economic development, featuring a non-homothetic demand system, endogenous saving rates, differentiated industrial productivity growth, interest payments on foreign debt and time-varying input-output coefficients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model of this kind. We illustrate how parameters of the five modules of structural change have been estimated, and we test the model by comparing its results with those obtained by a more conventional recursive dynamic CGE model. Both models are driven by the same GDP and population data, exogenously provided by the IPCC Shared Socio-economic Pathway 3. GDP levels determine the endogenous productivity parameters. Population affects the definition of per capita income, which in turn affects the household demand system and the variation of input-output coefficients. Information on the demographic structure is also employed to modify the aggregate saving rate parameters. It is found that the two models do produce different findings, both globally and at the regional and industrial level. Understanding the origins of such differences sheds some light on how mechanisms of structural change operate in the long run.
C82|Declines due to Disinvestment|This report presents and analyses the basic features of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Central, East and Southeast Europe (CESEE) as reported in the balance of payments, following the directional principle and the international investment position. The data reveal that FDI in the region fell by as much as 25% in 2017 against the previous year, and by 20% in the new EU Member States (EU-CEE). These developments are not in line with buoyant economic growth. It was not that surprising, however, as FDI inflow data have been volatile and not much correlated with the rate of economic growth in individual economies. Part of this volatility is caused by disinvestment – i.e. capital withdrawals by foreign investors – which account for a significant component of (net) FDI inflows in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, where national capital took over foreign subsidiaries in banking, utilities and communications, often with government support. In 2017, for the third year in a row, CESEE received increased greenfield FDI commitments in terms of the number of projects (7.4%), while the amount of capital investment pledged fell only 26% short of the extraordinarily high level of 2016 (data based on fdimarkets.com). In the EU‑CEE, greenfield investments rose both in terms of project numbers and capital investments. The biggest greenfield boom in 2017 was recorded in Poland, where FDI inflows reported in the balance of payments halved due to the domestic takeover of some assets, including a large bank. The strained labour market situation may hinder further FDI in the EU-CEE unless investors successfully cope with new challenges, such as immigrant workers, automation (which would trigger new investments) or moving further to the east (which might lead to a withdrawal of capital from existing locations). Relocation to the potentially promising neighbouring destination, Ukraine, is hampered by poor business conditions. New data allow us to identify the substantial gap between inward FDI stocks by the immediate investor (generally available information) and by the ultimate investing country (information available for five countries). These show that the Netherlands and Luxembourg are usually overrated as immediate investors; Germany and the USA turn out to be the most important ultimate investors. Austria remains the third most important investor in EU-CEE, but with declining shares in both home- and host-country reported stocks. Still, the FDI income gained from the region is high in international comparison, amounting to 1.1% of GDP or 10% of the outward FDI stock. The income earned by Austrian investors in EU-CEE is far larger than Austria’s net contribution to the EU budget (0.79% of its GDP).

C82|Shadow Economies around the World: New Results for 158 Countries over 1991-2015|Using the MIMIC method, this paper is a first attempt to estimate the size of the shadow economy of 158 countries over the period 1991 up to 2015. In addition to performing a variety of robustness tests, this paper explicitly addresses endogeneity concerns to the use of GDP as cause and indicator, by using the light intensity approach as an indicator variable as proxy for the size of the economy. Results suggest that the average size of the shadow economy of these 158 countries over 1991-2015 is 32.5% of official GDP, which was 34.82% in 1991 and decreased to 30.66% in 2015.
C82|The Commitment Role of Equity Financing|Existing theories of a firm’s optimal capital structure seem to fail in explaining why many healthy and profitable firms rely heavily on equity financing, even though benefits associated with debt (like tax shields) appear to be high and the bankruptcy risk low. This holds in particular for firms that show a strong commitment towards their workforce and are popular among employees. We demonstrate that such financing behavior may be driven by implicit arrangements made between a firm and its managers/employees. Equity financing generally strengthens a firm’s credibility to honor implicit promises. Debt, on the other hand, has an adverse effect on the enforceability of these arrangements because too much debt increases the firm’s reneging temptation, as some of the negative consequences of breaking implicit promises can be shifted to creditors. Our analysis provides an explanation for why some firms only use little debt financing. Predictions made by our theory are in line with a number of empirical results, which seem to stay in contrast to existing theories on capital structure. Our findings also carry new implications for how policies (e.g., tax policy) affect firm behavior.
C82|The Demand for Money for EMU: a Flexible Functional Form Approach|Abstract Monetary aggregates have a special role under the “two pillar strategy” of the ECB. Hence, a theoretically consistent measure of monetary aggregates for the European Monetary Union (EMU) is needed. This paper analyzes aggregation over monetary assets for the EMU. We aggregate over the monetary services for the eleven EMU (EMU-11) countries, which include Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Slovakia, and Slovenia. We adopt the Divisia monetary aggregation approach, which is consistent with index number theory and microeconomic aggregation theory. The result is a multilateral Divisia monetary aggregate, in accordance with Barnett (J Econ 136(2):457–482, 2007). The multilateral Divisia monetary aggregate for the EMU-11 is found to be more informative and a better signal of economic trends than the corresponding simple sum aggregate. We then analyze substitutability among monetary assets for the EMU-11 within the framework of a representative consumer’s utility function, using Barnett’s (J Bus Econ Stat 1:7–23, 1983) locally flexible functional form, the minflex Laurent indirect utility function. The analysis of elasticities with respect to the asset’s user-cost prices shows that: (i) transaction balances and deposits with agreed maturity are income elastic and (ii) the monetary assets are not good substitutes for each other within the EMU-11. Simple sum monetary aggregation assumes that component assets are perfect substitutes. Hence simple sum aggregation distorts measurement of the monetary aggregate. The ECB provides Divisia monetary aggregates to the Governing Council at its meetings, but not to the public. Our European Divisia monetary aggregates will be expanded and refined, in collaboration with Wenjuan Chen at the Humboldt University of Berlin, to a complete EMU Divisia monetary aggregates database to be supplied to the public by the Center for Financial Stability in New York City.
C82|User Cost of Credit Card Services under Risk with Intertemporal Nonseparability|This paper derives the user cost of monetary assets and credit card services with interest rate risk under the assumption of intertemporal non-separability. Barnett and Su (2016) derived theory permitting inclusion of credit card transaction services into Divisia monetary aggregates. The risk adjustment in their theory is based on CCAPM under intertemporal separability. The equity premium puzzle focusses on downward bias in the CCAPM risk adjustment to common stock returns. Despite the high risk of credit card interest rates, the risk adjustment under the CCAPM assumption of intertemporal separability might nevertheless be similarly small. While the known downward bias of CCAPM risk adjustments are of little concern with Divisia monetary aggregates containing only low risk monetary assets, that downward bias cannot be ignored, once high risk credit card services are included. We believe that extending to intertemporal non-separability could provide a non-negligible risk adjustment, as has been emphasized by Barnett and Wu (2015). In this paper, we extend the credit-card-augmented Divisia monetary quantity aggregates to the case of risk aversion and intertemporal non-separability in consumption. Our results are for the “representative consumer” aggregated over all consumers. While credit-card interest-rate risk may be low for some consumers, the volatility of credit card interest rates for the representative consumer is high, as reflected by the high volatility of the Federal Reserve’s data on credit card interest rates aggregated over consumers. One method of introducing intertemporal non-separability is to assume habit formation. We explore that possibility. To implement our theory, we introduce a pricing kernel, in accordance with the approach advocated by Barnett and Wu (2015). We assume that the pricing kernel is a linear function of the rate of return on a well-diversified wealth portfolio. We find that the risk adjustment of the credit-card-services user cost to its certainty equivalence level can be measured by its beta. That beta depends upon the covariance between the interest rates on credit card services and on the wealth portfolio of the consumer, in a manner analogous to the standard CAPM adjustment. As a result, credit card services’ risk premia depend on their market portfolio risk exposure, which is measured by the beta of the credit card interest rates. We are currently conducting research on empirical implementation of the theory proposed in this paper.
C82|The Australian Macro Database: An online resource for macroeconomic research in Australia|A website that encourages and facilitates the use of quantitative, publicly available Australian macroeconomic data is introduced. The Australian Macro Database hosted at ausmacrodata.org provides a user friendly front end for searching among over 40000 economic variables, sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Reserve Bank of Australia. The search box, tags and categories used to facilitate data retrieval, are described in detail. Known issues with the website and future plans are discussed in the conclusion.
C82|"The ""Magic Square"" of Economic Policy measured by a Macroeconomic Performance Index"|"The ""Magic Square of Economic Policy"" highlights four main goals of economic policy: growth, full employment, price stability, and balanced trade. A Macroeconomic Performance Index can be used to assign relative weights to the dierent goals within the Magic Square, giving a single index number per year per country. The legitimacy of the simplest weighting scheme that assigns equal weight to all four goals is discussed. The macroeconomic performance of eleven euro zone area countries is evaluated over time and across countries."
C82|Do-it-yourself digital: the production boundary and the productivity puzzle|Part of the debate about the ‘productivity puzzle’ concerns the potential mismeasurement of digital activities. Specific measurement adjustments explored in previous research appear not to make a quantitatively large difference to real GDP or productivity growth estimates. However, although these potential adjustments may be small individually, taken together they could be wide in scope and quantitatively significant. This paper sets out a taxonomy of the range of potential measurement artefacts arising from digital innovations. It also specifically considers digitally-enabled substitutions in activity across the production boundary. I argue that these, along with other substitutions occurring within the production boundary, go beyond the effects of digital considered in earlier research; and may be making a meaningful contribution to the productivity puzzle as measured on existing statistical definitions.
C82|Measuring the Free Digital Economy within the GDP and Productivity Accounts|We develop an experimental methodology that values ”free” digital content through the lens of a production account and is consistent with the framework of the national accounts. We build upon the work in Nakamura, et al. (2016) by combining marketing‐ and advertising‐supported content and find that the impact of ”free” digital content on U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) has accelerated in recent years, particularly since 2005. However, the explosion in ”free” digital content is partially offset by a decrease in ”free” print content like newspapers. Including these, real GDP growth would grow at 1.53 percent a year from 2005 to 2015 rather than the official growth rate of 1.42 percent, a tenth of a percent faster. Thus, there is a substantive impact on 2005 to 2015 real growth, even when we do not measure the full consumer surplus benefits of free goods. In addition, from 1995 to 2005, real GDP growth, including ”free” content, would grow 0.07 percentage point faster, and in the earlier period, from 1929 to 1995, 0.01 percentage point faster. We further find that the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and core PCE deflators would have risen about 0.1 percentage point slower from 2005 to 2015. To analyze the impact of ”free” content on measured private business total factor productivity (TFP) growth, we account for inputs of ”free” content used in production. We find that TFP would grow faster by 0.07 percentage point per year from 2005 to 2014 and faster by 0.07 percentage point from 1995 to 2005.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
C82|Structural policy indicators database for economic research (SPIDER)|This document describes the OECD’s new Structural Policy Indicators Database for Economic Research (SPIDER). The database compiles data from various existing databases. It contains indicators capturing structural policies (including institutions, framework condition policies and policies specifically related to labour markets and drivers of productivity and investment such as trade, skills and innovation). It also contains some basic macroeconomic indicators. The main idea of the database is to provide all the data needed for empirical analysis on structural policies in one place to facilitate empirical investigations. The indicators collected comprise three types of data: data with long-time series covering OECD countries, data covering a larger set of countries for a varying number of years, and finally a set of time-invariant indicators. The paper illustrates the use of the database on the basis of different growth regressions employed in the literature.
C82|Expert Group on Disparities in a National Accounts Framework: Results from the 2015 Exercise|In 2011, an Expert Group was launched to carry out a feasibility study on the compilation of distributional measures of income, consumption and wealth across household groups consistent with national accounts data. This group developed a methodology on the basis of which first experimental results on income, consumption and savings according to income quintiles were compiled and published in 2013. In 2015, the expert group engaged in a second exercise focusing on a more recent year and taking into account a number of adjustments to the methodology used in the previous exercise. This paper describes the sources, methods and results of this second exercise.The results of the exercise show that in general all countries are able to comply with the methodology. Furthermore, countries have micro data available for most of the national accounts items and in case of lacking data, imputations lead to comparable results. However, the results also show that in some cases gaps between the micro aggregates and the national accounts totals are quite substantial, possibly affecting the overall distributional results. Furthermore, more information is needed on how countries link data across various data sources. The experimental results show that Mexico records the highest income and consumption disparities, followed by the United States and Portugal, and that Slovenia records the lowest. The paper also shows that breakdowns into other household groups, such as age group and labour market status reveal very interesting information.
C82|Access to new data sources for statistics: Business models and incentives for the corporate sector|New data sources, commonly referred to as “Big Data”, have attracted growing interest from National Statistical Institutes. They have the potential to complement official and more conventional statistics used, for instance, to determine progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and other targets. However, it is often assumed that this type of data is readily available, which is not necessarily the case. This paper examines legal requirements and business incentives to obtain agreement on private data access, and more generally ways to facilitate the use of Big Data for statistical purposes. Using practical cases, the paper analyses the suitability of five generic data access models for different data sources and data uses in an emerging new data ecosystem. Concrete recommendations for policy action are presented in the conclusions.
C82|Measuring the Distributions of Public Inflation Perceptions and Expectations in the UK|The Bank of England/GfK NOP Inflation Attitudes Survey asks individuals about their inflation perceptions and expectations in eight ordered categories with known boundaries except for an indifference limen. With enough categories for identification, one can fit a mixture distribution to such data, which can be multi-modal. Thus Bayesian analysis of a normal mixture model for interval data with an indifference limen is of interest. This paper applies the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) for Bayesian computation, and estimates the distributions of public inflation perceptions and expectations in the UK during 2001Q1--2015Q4. The estimated means are useful for measuring information rigidity.
C82|Piyasa ekonomisine geçiş süreci ve sonrasında Türkiye'de GINI katsayılarının analizi: Alternatif GINI formülü yaklaşımı<BR>[During and after the process of transition to market economy, an analysis of income distribution in Turkey: An alternative GINI formula approach]|This study considers the Gini 1 and alternative Gini 2 coefficients for households’ % income shares from 1963 to 2015 in Turkey. Throughout regarding calibrations, one might see that, despite the existence of some deviations from trend and some Gini 1 and Gini 2 coefficients’ differences, (a) there exists an improvement in the distribution of income until 2011, except for the year 2009 when the global crisis was experienced, but an average deterioration in the distribution for 2011-2015 period is experienced, (b) the geographical regions of the Turkish economy reveal different outcomes. For the period 2006-2015, it is observed that in the regions of Istanbul, West Marmara, Central Anatolia and North East Anatolia, the Lorenz curve has moved away from full equilibrium line, but in the regions of Aegean, Eastern Marmara and Eastern Black Sea, on the average, a convergence towards the equilibrium from the Lorenz curve has appeared. In other three regions, the Gini coefficients improve on average in Western Anatolia, Mediterranean and Western Black Sea regions. The Gini coefficients are increasing in the period 2006-2011 in the Middle East Anatolia and falling in 2015. In the South East Anatolia Region, there is no progress in the period 2006-2011, but, there happens to be a recovery in income distribution in 2015.
C82|Afghanistan and China Trade Relationship|Purpose: the purpose of the study is describe the trade relationship of China and Afghanistan. China, most populous and rapidly growing industrial country of the world, has shown its strong political, economic and security-based interests in Afghanistan. Afghanistan is rich in terms of natural reserves. China is trying to gain access to these natural resources like Aynak copper and oil reserves, providing economic aid and thus improving political relations. Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) is playing a part in addressing security problems of Afghanistan and China is observer while Afghanistan is a member of SAARC. On the other hand, Afghan government is appreciating and taking this greater role in a positive sense because it is bringing modesty in their relations from bilateral partnership to strategic partnership.
C82|The Programmable Economy: Envisaging an Entire Planned Economic System as a Single Computer through Blockchain Networks|Since the dawn of the concept of nation-states, many nations have been planning their economies to increase people’s prosperity and standard of living. All economies have a centralized feature where decisions are taken. But data collection and plan implementation has been cumbersome because of the manual nature of economic planning. Centralized systems, even when digitized, are prone to single point failures. Controlled Blockchains allow for an economic system to be decentralized, yet having central supervision i.e. quasi-decentralization. This paper deals with shifting a national economy to a network of Blockchains and creating a Programmable Economy (P.E) where the whole economic system behaves like a single computer, taking in certain inputs and providing the desired outputs. We discuss the various factors that are needed to bring about such a transformation. We also analyse the impact this will have on various aspects of the economy and people’s lives. Finally the paper concludes by summarizing the purpose, methodology and impact of a Programmable Economy (P.E).
C82|On the Investigation of Factors Effecting International Tourist Arrivals to Cambodian Market: A Static and Dynamic Gravity Approach|The paper investigates factors influencing international tourist arrivals into the Cambodian market during the period of 1995 to 2015, covered 32 cross-sectional countries by adopting a static and dynamic gravity approach with respect to fixed effects (FE) and random effects (RE) and the GMM estimator of Arellano and Bond (1991). Our analysis shows that mostly economic factors such as travel cost, GDP per capita and population size are the main sources in attracting international tourist arrivals. The country specific dummy variables are found to be associated with the respects to its significant level. The empirical results demonstrate that one and two step GMM with robust standard errors produces better outcomes and improves the estimated accuracy over a static approach.
C82|On the guidelines of good planning : The case of the Arab region|The paper uses a structured database of national planning that ESCWA is compiling to identify the well-known and lesser-known features of development planning in the Arab region. The paper first explores international best practices and reflects on country-specific context to develop a typology of good planning criteria for the Arab region. Based on this typology, the paper offers preliminary stylized facts about planning and compares individual planning initiatives across the region. Above all, the findings indicate the region is suffering with the following difficulties: (1) a lack of structure among individual planning documents, (2) a weak relation to international frameworks, (3) the paucity of specific measurable indicators that would help to effectively monitor achievements, (4) many countries did not publish any planning documents targeting the long-term and medium-term development of their whole economy at all or (5) did not make them readily available on-line, which points towards insufficient transparency and impaired participation. Finally, the paper envisions a way forward for integrative planning in the Arab region while linking it to the 2030 Agenda.
C82|Documentation note ESCWA'S national plans database|The Database of National Planning (DNP) compiled by the Economic Governance and Planning Section at UN-ESCWA provides standardised indicators about development planning practices in the Arab region in order to facilitate policy analysis and scholarly work. The goal of the DNP is to assess current policy practices in the Arab region against international standards of ‘good planning’, and facilitate identification of potential for improvement of planning practices. The database may also be used to monitor countries’ achievements towards their stated goals, mainstream international agendas in Arab countries’ planning thus informing the public debate and contributing toward aligning people’s expectations. The paper describes the framework used to ensure comparability of individual planning initiatives across the region. It provides detailed description of data gathering, and data treatment methodology. It explains the database structure and operations. It exemplifies ways to compute composite assessment indicators, currently based on the degree of ‘quality’ and ‘sophistication’ of planning in the Arab region. Finally, the paper explicitly reports the limitations of the database for meaningful analyses and cross-country comparisons and way forward. Currently, the National Planning Database contains selected planning data series for seventeen of ESCWA’s member states and Algeria; however, there is no information available for Syria, Comoros, Djibouti and Somalia. The qualitative and quantitative information compiled comes from Arab countries’ planning documents readily accessible online. The methodological paper is intended to be a living guide, whereby additional or updated information can be added when available and as appropriate.
C82|Gross Domestic Product – National Income of Romania 1862 – 2010. Secular statistical series and methodological foundations|Starting from the importance and need to investigate one of the most relevant issues regarding the structure and dynamics of the economic and social development of all countries in the world, the book focuses on Romania, from the perspective of certain synthetic indicators, aggregated at macroeconomic level, i.e. the Gross Domestic Product and the National Income, on long data series over the past 150 years, also taking into account the comparative international context, in terms of purchasing power parity. The Part One contains a synthesis, developed and completed, of GDP data for each year of the period 1862 – 2010 and also indicators resulting from the GDP, as Net Domestic Product, Net National Product and National Income. The historical research has adopted and applied, with maximum attention, criteria that substantiated the calculations, through rigorous techniques and methods of data aggregation, in order to remove certain errors that would lead to distorted results, focusing on the accuracy of evaluations, so that they would express, in the most genuine manner, the real dimension of the statistical indicators, allowing for a correct interpretation of the economic phenomena. The operations for compiling the indicators are accompanied by comments regarding the criteria and calculation methods, as well as by methodological explanations, so that the data would be able to be rebuilt in a better format, by the interested authors, should they have a more reliable and relevant statistical information about Romania. The Part Two of the book focuses on the international literature, dedicated to criticisms theoretical and methodological opinions regarding the GDP, as well as a comparative analysis of the GDP evolution in Romania, in various hypotheses, compared to other countries.
C82|Alternative User Costs, Productivity and Inequality in US Business Sectors|Using the new Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) Integrated Macroeconomic Accounts as well as other BEA data, we construct productivity accounts for two key sectors of the US economy: the Corporate Nonfinancial Sector (Sector 1) and the Noncorporate Nonfinancial Sector (Sector 2). Calculating user costs of capital based on, alternatively, ex post and predicted asset price inflation rates, we provide alternative estimates for capital services and Total Factor Productivity growth for the two sectors. Rates of return on assets employed are also reported for both sectors. In addition, we compare rates of return on assets employed and TFP growth rates when the land and inventory components are withdrawn from the asset base. Finally, implications for labour and capital shares from using alternative income concepts are explored.
C82|The Power of Big Data : Historical Time Series on German Education|Numerous primary investigators collected and processed long-termed time series on German educational statistics in the context of their studies. As a result, there are a multitude of quantitative empirical studies. On the one hand, there is the project group on German Educational Statistics. 1 Its projects were targeted at describing and analyzing the long-term structural changes of the German educational system on a broad empirical and statistical basis. On the other hand, there are comprehensive data compilations of individual research projects, focusing on a wide variety of special educational research topics. The online database “histat” provides central digital access to these datasets on German educational history. Currently, it offers more than 120,000 long-term time series on the German educational system for a period of 200 years. The striking size of the database shows its key importance for researchers in the field of education. Thus, this paper aims to provide useful insights into the background of the database, the special characteristics of the data compilations and their analytical potential. Additionally, examples are given of how the data have already been used by researchers.
C82|Public Debt and Growth : An Assessment of Key Findings on Causality and Thresholds|We provide a comprehensive assessment of the relationship between public debt and GDP growth in the postwar advanced economies. We use the timing of changes in public debt and growth to account for endogeneity, and find little evidence of a negative relationship. Semi-parametric estimates do not indicate any threshold effects. Finally, we reconcile our results with four recent, influential papers that found a substantial negative relationship, especially when public debt exceeds 90 percent of GDP. These earlier results appear to derive mostly from peculiar parametric specifications of nonlinearities, or use of small samples which amplify the influence of outliers.
C82|Understanding the Global Dynamics of Sectoral Labor Productivity|This study provides some empirical evidence and quantification of differences in labor productivity among industries and countries. Using a recently available data base of value added per worker, country and time fixed effects are estimated first for various industries. Results are subsequently elaborated, to identify some time trends and sectoral profiles by country, which are in turn employed in a cluster analysis, summarizing some salient characteristics of industrial labor productivity in different economies.
C82|Recovery amid Stabilising Economic Growth|The economic environment for foreign direct investment (FDI) has improved. A cautious upturn in economic activities across the Central, East and Southeast European (CESEE) region is based on expanding private consumption. Investments have started to recover, increasing opportunities for foreign business. Also, the most important foreign markets for CESEE products in Europe and overseas have stabilised, albeit amid increasing uncertainty. The CESEE region has maintained its cost competitiveness, despite surging wages and occasional labour shortages, by benefiting from considerable productivity improvements. FDI inflows to the CESEE countries increased by 45% in 2016, compared with the revised 2015 data. The invested amount of EUR 90 billion is the highest since 2008, marginally surpassing the inflows reported in 2011 and 2012. The 2016 recovery was 23% in the EU’s Central and East European region and almost 150% in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and Ukraine; meanwhile the Western Balkans and Turkey booked a decline of 25%. The 2016 changes were in just the opposite direction to 2015, when FDI in the Western Balkans and Turkey boomed, while it declined in the other two regions. A special section of this report analyses the position of Austria as investor and investment destination for CESEE countries. A separate section presents new features of greenfield investments in 2016 an increasing number of projects and higher capital investments that increasingly focused on the manufacturing sector. Forecasts for FDI in 2017 point upwards again, because the international environment is positive, although plagued by uncertainties, and also economic growth in most of CESEE is bound to be more robust than in the previous year. The second part of this report contains two sets of tables Tables I cover FDI flow and stock data, FDI flows by components and related income; Tables II provide detailed FDI data by economic activity and by country. The main sources of data are the central banks of the individual Central, East and Southeast European countries. The section ‘Methodological Explanations’ highlights important recent changes in reporting standards and their application in the wiiw FDI Database and wiiw FDI Report. The wiiw FDI Database is available online This online access with a modern query tool supports easy search and download of data.

C82|The Death of Cash? Not So Fast: Demand for U.S. Currency at Home and Abroad, 1990-2016|It would seem that physical currency should be fading out as the world of payments is increasingly electronic, with new technologies emerging at a rapid pace, and as governments look to restrictions on large-denomination notes as a way to reduce crime and tax evasion. Nonetheless, demand for U.S. dollar banknotes continues to grow, and consistently increases at times of crisis both within and outside the United States because it remains a desirable store of value and medium of exchange in times and places where local currency or bank deposits are inferior. After allowing for the effect of crises, demand for U.S. banknotes appears to be driven by the same factors as demand for other types of money, with no discernible downward trend. In this work, I review developments in demand for U.S. currency since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in late 2008 with a focus on some new questions. First, what are the factors driving demand for lower denominations, especially $20s, which are the most commonly used in domestic transactions? To what extent can the recent strength in demand be attributed to the long spell of very low interest rates? Finally, for the larger denominations, I revisit the question of international demand: I present the raw data available for measuring international banknote flows and presents updates on indirect methods of estimating the stock of currency held abroad. These methods continue to indicate that a large share of U.S. currency is held abroad, especially in the $100 denomination. As shown in an earlier paper, once a country or region begins using dollars, subsequent crises result in additional inflows: the dominant sources of international demand over the past two decades are the countries and regions that were known to be heavy dollar users in the early to mid-1990s. While international demand for U.S. currency eased during the early 2000s as financial conditions improved, the abrupt return to strong international demand that began nearly a decade ago with the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 has shown only limited signs of slowing. In contrast, the growth rate of demand for smaller denominations is slowing, perhaps indicating the first signs of declining domestic cash demand.
C82|Big Data and Unemployment Analysis|"Internet or ""big"" data are increasingly measuring the relevant activities of individuals, households, firms and public agents in a timely way. The information set involves large numbers of observations and embraces flexible conceptual forms and experimental settings. Therefore, internet data are extremely useful to study a wide variety of human resource issues including forecasting, nowcasting, detecting health issues and well-being, capturing the matching process in various parts of individual life, and measuring complex processes where traditional data have known deficits. We focus here on the analysis of unemployment by means of internet activity data, a literature starting with the seminal article of Askitas and Zimmermann (2009a). The article provides insights and a brief overview of the current state of research."
C82|The effect of globalisation on energy footprints: Disentangling the links of global value chains|This paper investigates the impact of global value chains on energy footprints. Energy footprints are consumption-based indicators which record the energy used to produce a country's final demand. In order to disentangle key characteristics of global value chains and their effects on the global energy footprint, we employ structural decomposition analyses (SDA). Furthermore, the analysis combines a retrospective with a prospective SDA approach. After an analysis of the global energy footprint for the period between 1995 and 2009, we discuss three scenarios of international integration and their implications for energy footprints for the period from 2009 to 2030. Our results show that the global energy footprint has increased by 29.4% from 1995 to 2009, and the scenarios indicate that it will increase by another 23.5% until 2030. Economic activity is the most important driver for the increase in energy footprints. Rising final demand alone would have increased the global energy footprint by 47.0% between 1995 and 2009. The composition of countries from where consumption and investment goods come adds another 12.6%. Sectoral energy intensity reductions are the most important decelerator of energy use (−27.8%). There is a substantial contribution of changing global value chains on the rise in the global energy footprint (7.5%): Stronger backward linkages in global value chains increased the global energy footprint by 5.5% between 1995 and 2009. Changes in the regional composition of intermediate inputs raised it by another 1.8%. The shift of the world economy towards East Asia alone would have increased the global energy footprint by 3.0%. The sectoral composition of global value chains, on the other hand, had a negligible effect on energy footprints.
C82|Cross-Country Income Levels over Time: Did the Developing World Suddenly Become Much Richer?|The latest global survey on relative prices and income levels, for the year 2011, showed changes to relative income levels that were larger in lower income countries, thereby narrowing the world income distribution compared to estimates based on the previous, 2005, survey. This paper examines whether changes in measurement methodology between the 2005 and 2011 survey can explain these large differences. We construct a counterfactual set of relative prices for 2005 that harmonizes measurement, and we no longer find systematic differences across income levels, implying that international income inequality based on the 2005 survey was overstated.
C82|Interval Based Composite Indicators|Composite indicators are increasingly important in country comparisons and in policy making. At the same time, the robustness of the results obtained and in particular of the rankings and the conclusions obtained from the analysis it is usually accepted with doubts. In this sense our proposal is to use interval data in order to measure the uncertainty related to the different composite indicators based on the different assumptions used as input. In this sense where composite indicators can be considered as models, for this reason it could be necessary to assess the uncertainties related to the different choices in the construction. The uncertainty can be represented by the interval data. The intervals keep the information related to the initial value of the composite indicator, but at the same time give information on the range of the results.
C82|Assessing the Business Outlook Survey Indicator Using Real-Time Data|Every quarter, the Bank of Canada conducts quarterly consultations with businesses across Canada, referred to as the Business Outlook Survey (BOS). A principal-component analysis conducted by Pichette and Rennison (2011) led to the development of the BOS indicator, which summarizes survey results and is used by the Bank as a gauge of overall business sentiment. In this paper, we examine whether data vintages matter when assessing the predictive content of the BOS indicator and individual BOS questions and whether the BOS is a better indicator of revised or unrevised macroeconomic data. As an indicator of business sentiment in the context of monetary policy, the reliability of the BOS is essential, and it is crucial to understand whether the signals it sends are best interpreted for early-released or revised data. For this purpose, we use different methods of forecasting that take into account the real-time perspective of the data. Results from the different methods show that the BOS content is informative regardless of data revisions. However, in real time, the BOS indicator and individual BOS questions are found to produce better nowcasts of first-released data or partially revised data than of latest-available data. This is particularly important in the case of growth in real business investment. In fact, because revisions to real business investment are more volatile than revisions to real gross domestic product (GDP), the choice of data vintages when assessing the ability of the BOS to forecast growth appears to be more important for real business investment than for real GDP.
C82|The derivatives through the lens of the financial accounts: measurement and analysis|This paper studies the performance of the market value of the derivatives for Italian banks by using the financial accounts and proposing an international comparison. An estimate of the market value was also obtained for the period from the first quarter of 2001 to the third quarter of 2008 by exploiting the continuity of the notional values found in the supervisory reports. Our analysis of the performance of banking derivatives in the major countries shows that their value has significantly decreased since the financial crisis. At the end of 2015, the amount of financial derivatives reported in the assets of monetary financial institutions was 4 per cent of the total financial assets in Italy, a much lower value than in the UK, Germany and France.
C82|Measuring the “Free” Digital Economy within the GDP and Productivity Accounts|We develop an experimental methodology that values ”free” digital content through the lens of a production account and is consistent with the framework of the national accounts. We build upon the work in Nakamura, et al. (2016) by combining marketing‐ and advertising‐supported content and find that the impact of ”free” digital content on U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) has accelerated in recent years, particularly since 2005. However, the explosion in ”free” digital content is partially offset by a decrease in ”free” print content like newspapers. Including these, real GDP growth would grow at 1.53 percent a year from 2005 to 2015 rather than the official growth rate of 1.42 percent, a tenth of a percent faster. Thus, there is a substantive impact on 2005 to 2015 real growth, even when we do not measure the full consumer surplus benefits of free goods. In addition, from 1995 to 2005, real GDP growth, including ”free” content, would grow 0.07 percentage point faster, and in the earlier period, from 1929 to 1995, 0.01 percentage point faster. We further find that the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and core PCE deflators would have risen about 0.1 percentage point slower from 2005 to 2015. To analyze the impact of ”free” content on measured private business total factor productivity (TFP) growth, we account for inputs of ”free” content used in production. We find that TFP would grow faster by 0.07 percentage point per year from 2005 to 2014 and faster by 0.07 percentage point from 1995 to 2005.
C82|Structural Change, Expanding Informality and Labour Productivity Growth in Russia|Recent decades have been years of intensive growth, structural change and expanding informality for many developing and emerging economies. However, in exploring the relationship between structural change and productivity growth, most empirical studies ignored informality. This paper explores how structural change in the Russian economy 1995–2012 affects aggregate labour productivity growth, taking into account the informal sector. Using a newly developed dataset for 34 industries and applying three alternative approaches aggregate labour productivity growth is decomposed into intra-industry and inter-industry contributions. All three approaches show that the overall contribution of structural change is growth enhancing, significant, and dumped in time. In turn, labour reallocation between the formal and informal sectors is growth reducing because of the extension of informal activities with low productivity levels. At the same time, sectoral labour reallocation effects are found to be highly sensitive to the methods.
C82|Determinants of long-term economic growth redux: A Measurement Error Model Averaging (MEMA) approach|This paper estimates determinants of long-run growth rates of GDP per capita in a cross section of countries. We propose a novel Measurement Error Model Averaging (MEMA) approach that accounts for measurement error in international income data as well as model uncertainty. Estimating the model using eight vintages of the Penn World Tables (PWT) together with other proposed growth determinants, we identify 18 variables related to economic growth. In addition, the results are robust to allowing for outliers in the form of heteroscedastic model errors.
C82|The CBR-LRI Dataset: Methods, Properties & Potential of Leximetric Coding of Labour Laws|Leximetric data coding techniques aim to measure cross-national and inter-temporal variations in the content of legal rules, thereby facilitating statistical analysis of legal systems and their social and economic impacts. In this paper we explain how leximetric methods were used to create the CBR Labour Index (CBR-LRI), an index and related dataset of labour laws from around the world spanning the period from 1970 to 2013. Datasets of this kind must, we suggest, observe certain conventions of transparency and validity if they are to be usable in statistical analysis. The theoretical framework informing the construction of the dataset and the types of questions which it is are designed to answer should be made explicit. Then the choices involved in the selection of indicators, the definition of coding algorithms, and the aggregation and weighting of data to create composite measures, must be spelled out. In addition, primary legal sources should be referenced, and it should be clear how they were used to generate reported values. With these points in mind we provide an overview of the CBR-LRI dataset's main features and structure, discuss issues of weighting, and present some initial findings on what it reveals of global trends in labour regulation.
C82|Shadow Economies around the World: New Results for 158 Countries over 1991-2015|This paper is a first attempt to estimate the size and development of the shadow economy of 158 countries over the period 1991 up to 2015. Using the Multiple Indicators, Multiple Causes (MIMIC) method we apply for the first time (i) the light intensity approach instead of GDP avoiding the problem that quite often GDP is used as a cause and indicator variable, (ii) the Predictive Mean Matching (PMM) method, and (iii) a variety of robustness tests. Results suggest that the average size of the shadow economy of these 158 countries over 1991-2015 is 32.5% of official GDP, which was 34.82% in 1991 and decreased to 30.66% in 2015. The lowest size of the shadow economy East Asian countries with 16.77% averaged over the period 1991- 2015, then follows OECD countries with 18.7% and the highest value have Latin American and sub-Saharan African countries with values above 35%.
C82|Mediciones del crecimiento económico regional y local en Colombia, 1950-2017: una revisión|Resumen: El artículo contiene una revisión de las principales mediciones del PIB y otras mediciones macroeconómicas en el nivel departamental y municipal en el periodo 1950-2017. Se espera que esta revisión pueda ser de utilidad para las investigaciones sobre la economía regional y urbana de Colombia al señalar sus limitaciones metodológicas y temporales. El común denominador de las diversas mediciones, básicamente PIB departamental y de Bogotá, es su discontinuidad y el reducido número de años de estas estimaciones, exceptuando aquellas realizadas por el DANE, Planeación Departamental de Antioquia y Valle, CEGA y el autor (hasta 2011). Con la serie del PIB del DANE, y la que fue iniciada en CEGA y continuada por el autor, es posible ampliar el horizonte temporal al periodo 1975-2017 e incluso extenderlo hasta mediados del siglo XX. / Abstract : This article contains a review of the main measurements of GDP and other macroeconomic measures at the departmental and municipal level in the period 1950-2017. It aims at being useful for research on the regional and urban economics of Colombia by pointing out methodological and temporary limitations. The common denominator of the several measurements, basically of departmental and Bogota’s GDP, is the discontinuity and the reduced number of years of these estimates, except those calculated by DANE, departmental planning of Antioquia and Valle, CEGA and the author (until 2011). GDP series calculated by DANE, and those initiated by CEGA and continued by the author, can be extended to the period 1975-2017 and back further into the mid-twentieth century.
C82|Updating USAGE: Baseline and Illustrative Application|USAGE is a dynamic, CGE model of the U.S. economy created at CoPS in collaboration with the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC). The model has been used by and on behalf of: the USITC; the U.S. Departments of Commerce, Agriculture, Energy, Transportation and Homeland Security; private sector organizations such as the Cato Institute and the Mitre Corporation; and the Canadian Embassy in Washington DC. To keep the model relevant for policy analysis, it must be updated periodically. This paper describes a major update of USAGE undertaken for the USITC. In accordance with the CoPS contract with the USITC, the update task was to: 1. build a NAICS-based database at the 400-industry level for USAGE using the 2007 BEA benchmark input-output tables; 2. update this database to 2014; 3. create a baseline projection starting from the base year of 2014 and proceeding at 5 year intervals to 2024; and 4. conduct an illustrative USAGE policy simulation around the baseline. At the completion of this work in August 2016, the ITC requested a fifth task: 5. update from 2007 to 2015 rather than 2014 and create a baseline from 2015 to 2020. This paper describes how we undertook the five tasks.
C82|The journey from micro supervisory data to aggregate macroprudential statistics|The Consolidated Banking Data CBD) are a key component of the ECB/ESCB statistical toolbox for financial stability analysis. This dataset, which contains all the relevant dimensions of systemic risk stemming from and affecting national banking systems, is compiled from firm-level supervisory returns. With the entry into force of the new set of European Banking Authority (EBA) Implementing Technical Standards on Supervisory Reporting in 2014, the whole CBD statistical framework had to be reshaped. In August 2015 the first data for the revised CBD were released. This paper deals with the main issues in the challenging endeavour of transposing firmlevel supervisory returns, often based on different accounting systems, into comprehensive aggregate statistics, while ensuring as far as possible continuity in the time series for indicators and aggregates calculated from different successive data models. At the same time, the new CBD has substantially enlarged the quantity and increased the quality of data, available to the users. This paper provides a description of the database, together with some examples drawn from it. JEL Classification: C82, G21
C82|Estimating non-financial assets by institutional sector for the euro area|Official euro area-wide statistics on the capital stock and its breakdowns by asset type and sector are not yet available, but would be very useful for economic and financial stability analysis. This paper proposes a constrained optimisation model with the help of which a full cross-sector classification of the capital stock by non-financial asset type can be estimated. The model is applied for the estimation of the capital stock by institutional sector, including households’ non-financial asset types and housing wealth, both for the euro area as a whole and for euro area countries currently not estimating and/or publishing such data.

C82|Forecasting in a Mixed Up World: Nowcasting Hawaii Tourism|We evaluate the short term forecasting performance of methods that systematically incorporate high frequency information via covariates. Our study provides a thorough introduction of these methods to the tourism literature. We highlight the distinguishing features and limitations of each tool and evaluate their forecasting performance in two tourism-specific applications. The first uses monthly indicators to predict quarterly tourist arrivals to Hawaii; the second predicts quarterly labor income in the accommodations and food services sector. Our results indicate that compared to the exclusive use of low frequency aggregates, including timely intra-period data in the forecasting process results in significant gains in predictive accuracy. Anticipating growing popularity of these techniques among empirical analysts, we present practical implementation guidelines to facilitate their adoption.
C82|News implied volatility and disaster concerns|We construct a text-based measure of uncertainty starting in 1890 using front-page articles of the Wall Street Journal. News implied volatility (NVIX) peaks during stock market crashes, times of policy-related uncertainty, world wars, and financial crises. In US postwar data, periods when NVIX is high are followed by periods of above average stock returns, even after controlling for contemporaneous and forward-looking measures of stock market volatility. News coverage related to wars and government policy explains most of the time variation in risk premia our measure identifies. Over the longer 1890–2009 sample that includes the Great Depression and two world wars, high NVIX predicts high future returns in normal times and rises just before transitions into economic disasters. The evidence is consistent with recent theories emphasizing time variation in rare disaster risk as a source of aggregate asset prices fluctuations.
C82|The Ethiopian Commodity Exchange and spatial price dispersion|In this article, we study the impact of an institutional intervention on market efficiency in Ethiopia. More specifically, we analyze to what extent the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange (ECX) in combination with regional warehouses have contributed to a reduction in price spreads between regional markets. Our hypothesis is that warehouses connected to the ECX reduce the dispersion between export prices and local retail prices in different coffee growing areas, as well as the dispersion between export prices and local retail prices in different coffee growing areas. By doing so, the ECX has the potential to improve the market efficiency. To identify the causal effect, we combine retail price data with information on the gradual rollout of warehouses connected to the ECX from 2007 to 2012. Our results suggest that, when two markets both have access to an operating warehouse, the average price spread is 0.86–1.78 ETB lower than it is for markets where at least one part lacks warehouse access. This is a substantial reduction considering that the average price spread over the full period is 3.33 ETB. The main results are robust to various econometric specifications, and our analysis thus suggests that local warehouses connected to the ECX have indeed improved market efficiency.
C82|The Paradox of Plenty: A Meta-Analysis|Since Sachs and Warner’s seminal article in 1995, numerous studies have addressed the link between natural resources and economic growth. Although the “resource curse” effect was commonly accepted at first, many articles have challenged its existence, and the results found in the literature are ambiguous. In this paper, we aim to quantitatively review this literature in order to (i) identify the sources of heterogeneity and (ii) assess the impact of natural resources on economic growth. A meta-analysis is performed on 69 empirical studies on the resource curse, totaling 1,419 estimates. Our findings show that (i) only developing countries suffer from the resource curse although it is soft; (ii) the way natural resources are taken into account is crucial to understand the heterogeneity found in the literature; (iii) the negative impact of the volatility of the terms-of-trade on growth should be qualified. An additional MRA performed on indirect effects size also indicate that when institutions are at their best level, the resource curse disappears and may be turned into a blessing.
C82|The Australian Macro Database: An online resource for macroeconomic research in Australia|A website that encourages and facilities the use of quantitative, publicly available Australian macroeconomic data is introduced. The Australian Macro Database hosted at ausmacrodata.org provides a user friendly front end for searching among over 40000 economic variables, sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Reserve Bank of Australia. The search box, tags and categories used to facilitate data retrieval, are described in detail. Known issues with the website and future plans are discussed in the conclusion.
C82|Forecasting the real price of oil under alternative specifications of constant and time-varying volatility|This paper constructs a monthly real-time oil price dataset using backcasting and compares the forecast performance of alternative models of constant and timevarying volatility based on the accuracy of point and density forecasts of real oil prices of both real-time and ex-post revised data. The paper considers Bayesian autoregressive and autoregressive moving average models with respectively, constant volatility and two forms of time-varying volatility: GARCH and stochastic volatility. In addition to the standard time-varying models, more flexible models with volatility in mean and moving average innovations are used to forecast the real price of oil. The results show that timevarying volatility models dominate their counterparts with constant volatility in terms of point forecasting at longer horizons and density forecasting at all horizons. The inclusion of a moving average component provides a substantial improvement in the point and density forecasting performance for both types of time-varying models while stochastic volatility in mean is superfluous for forecasting oil prices.
C82|Interval Based Composite Indicators| Composite indicators are increasingly important in country comparisons and in policy making. At the same time, the robustness of the results obtained and in particular of the rankings and the conclusions obtained from the analysis it is usually accepted with doubts. In this sense our proposal is to use interval data in order to measure the uncertainty related to the different composite indicators based on the different assumptions used as input. In this sense where composite indicators can be considered as models, for this reason it could be necessary to assess the uncertainties related to the different choices in the construction. The uncertainty can be represented by the interval data. The intervals keep the information related to the initial value of the composite indicator, but at the same time give information on the range of the results.
C82|The Anatomy of Financial Vulnerabilities and Crises|We extend the framework used in Aikman, Kiley, Lee, Palumbo, and Warusawitharana (2015) that maps vulnerabilities in the U.S. financial system to a broader set of advanced and emerging economies. Our extension tracks a broader set of vulnerabilities and, therefore, captures signs of different types of crises. The typical anatomy of the evolution of vulnerabilities before and after a financial crisis is as follows. Pressures in asset valuations materialize, and a build-up of imbalances in the external, financial, and nonfinancial sectors follows. A financial crisis is typically followed by a build-up of sovereign debt imbalances as the government tries to deal with the consequences of the crisis. Our early warnings indicators which aggregate these vulnerabilities predict banking crises better than the Credit-to-GDP gap at long horizons. Our indicators also predict the severity of banking crises and the duration of recessions, as they take into account possible spill-over and amplification channels of financial stress to from one to another sector in the economy. Our indicators are of relevance for macroprudential and crisis management, in part, because they perform better than the Credit-to-GDP gap and do not suffer from the gaps econometric flaws.
C82|Structural change, expanding informality and labour productivity growth in Russia|Intensive growth, structural change and expanding informality has characterized many developing and emerging economies in recent decades. Yet most empirical investigations into the relationship between structural change and productivity growth overlook informality. This paper includes the informal sector in an analysis of the effects of structural changes in the Russian economy on aggre-gate labour productivity growth. Using a newly developed dataset for 34 industries covering the period 1995–2012 and applying three alternative approaches, aggregate labour productivity growth is decomposed into intra-industry and inter-industry contributions. All three approaches show that the overall contribution of structural change is growth-enhancing, significant and attenuating over time. Labour reallocation from the formal sector to the informal sector tends to reduce growth through the extension of informal activities with low productivity levels. Sectoral labour reallocation effects are found to be highly sensitive to the methods applied.
C82|The Statistical Measurement of Business Conditions for Small Entrepreneurs|A specific feature of business conditions surveys describing actual and expected short-term trends of company financial and economic activities is the non-quantitative nature of the relevant data. To facilitate its interpretation and visualisation for various user groups, the respondents’ answers are typically aggregated into simple and composite indicators (CI). This study proposes, tests, and validates conceptual and information measurement hypotheses for building and applying such CI, which provide an integrated assessment of small entrepreneur (SE) economic sentiment. These CI demonstrate a strong, statistically significant correlation with growth cycles of reference statistical indicators. A theoretical model for building CI to measure business conditions for SE is presented, and a relevant toolset is described. Industry-specific features of building business conditions indicators are illustrated using the retail and wholesale sectors as examples. New opportunities for the visualisation and analytical presentation of the cyclic profiles of indicators are demonstrated, based on tracers tracking their phase-to-phase movement. New information and analysis-related areas are identified for the application of nonparametric data to estimate the current state and expected development of SE
C82|A Comparison of Russian Practices in Industrial Statistics with Un Recommendations: Similarities and Differences in Classifications, Data Items and Indicators|This study compares Russian state information systems of industry with UN international recommendations. The harmonization of the Russian information system with successful international practices is necessary for measuring the main industrial indicator levels and dynamics in comparison with the information analogues of both cross-border and strategically important countries. This allows the estimation of the efficiency and competitiveness of Russian industry and the best decisions to be made at all levels of governance in Russia including in the technology and innovation policy sphere. The study shows that a significant number of annual, quarterly, monthly and weekly reporting forms within the Russian statistical system in the absence of a single questionnaire for obtaining comprehensive information from an enterprise and unified methodological recommendations do not solve the information gap problem. The available disaggregated information is not sufficient to analyse the quality and effectiveness of industrial policy, especially in comparison with global levels and tendencies of re-industrialization. The state statistical system needs modernization to reduce the reporting burden on enterprises and improve information transparency and comparability at the detailed level.
C82|Does Compulsory Education Really Increase Life Satisfaction?|This paper examines the impact of the 1972 British education reform on life satisfaction using 1996-2008 British Household Panel Survey data. The education reform increased compulsory education by one year for those who were born after the 1st of September 1957, yielding an exogenous change in education for the treated group. Contrary to other work, we find no evidence that a one-year rise in compulsory education increased life satisfaction, even though it is often estimated to increase income. Many of our estimates suggest a negative relationship: the positive life-satisfaction effect found in research using earlier data does not then seem to have endured.
C82|The Logic of Inequality Extraction: An Application to Gini and Top Incomes Data|"As embodied in the concept of ""inequality extraction"" (Branko Milanovic), it is not possible to increase inequality (especially income inequality) in a society sustainably to levels beyond what is actually socially acceptable (and even less to levels endangering physical subsistence of parts of the population). Consequently, in international and intertemporal comparisons of inequality levels on the country (or the regional) level and for poorer societies in general, adaptations for the levels of inequality, which are actually feasible in physical and social terms, are necessary to arrive at meaningful conclusions. We extend this concept to cover also top-incomes ratios, which allows a broader database for measurement and analysis of cross-country historical inequality. A first look at the data uncovers different patterns and dynamics of inequality extraction when compared to untransformed inequality measures, sometimes to the point of trend reversal, which holds for extraction ratios based on Gini coefficients as well as top income shares. In the discussion, we also outline some directions of further research, especially about explanations of extraction patterns and dynamics, also with an application to global inequality data and in combination with institutional arrangements."
C82|The 2017 PREDICT Dataset Methodology|This methodological report details the work done in the Prospective Insights on R&D in ICT (PREDICT) project in 2017. PREDICT provides updated indicators for the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sector and for its Research and Development (R&D) in the European Union and in the major ICT leaders worldwide. This project is being carried out jointly by the Joint Research Centre, Directorate B and the Directorate General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG CNECT) of the European Commission. The data and methodologies have been developed in collaboration with the Valencian Institute of Economic Research (IVIE). The 2017 PREDICT Dataset has been deepened and expanded in this latest version in order to include complementary dimensions, such as the Media and Content sector and sub-sectors. An updated methodology for estimating ICT Government Budget allocations for Research and Development (ICT GBARD) has been applied. Furthermore, for the most important indicators, existing PREDICT time series have been reconstructed back to 1995, while figures are now-casted for 2015 and 2016.

C82|Are Chinese Growth and Inflation Too Smooth? Evidence from Engel Curves|China has experienced remarkably stable growth and inflation in recent years according to official statistics. We use systematic discrepancies between cross-sectional and time-series Engel curves to construct alternative estimates of Chinese growth and inflation. Our estimates suggest that official statistics present a smoothed version of reality. Official inflation rose in the 2000s, but our estimates indicate that true inflation was still higher and consumption growth was overstated. In contrast, inflation was overstated and growth understated during the low-inflation 1990s. These patterns hold for the food Engel curve, and for numerous other categories, such as grain as a fraction of food.
C82|Review Essay on British Economic Growth, 1270-1870 by Stephen Broadberry, Bruce M. S. Campbell, Alexander Klein, Mark Overton, and Bas van Leeuwen|British Economic Growth, 1270-1870 makes a big leap forward in our understanding of the long-run performance of what became the leading nineteenth-century economy and the workshop of the world. It does so by implementing a giant quantitative enterprise, one that will make it the standard data source for studying the evolution of the British economy for decades to come.
C82|Mismeasuring long-run growth: the bias from splicing national accounts—the case of Spain|Comparisons of economic performance over space and time largely depend on how statistical evidence from national accounts and historical estimates are spliced. To allow for changes in relative prices, GDP benchmark years in national accounts are periodically replaced with new and more recent ones. Thus, a homogeneous long-run GDP series requires linking different temporal segments of national accounts. The choice of the splicing procedure may result in substantial differences in GDP levels and growth, particularly as an economy undergoes deep structural transformation. An inadequate splicing may seriously bias the measurement of GDP levels and growth rates. Alternative splicing solutions are discussed in this paper for the particular case of Spain, a fast-growing country in the second half of the twentieth century. It is concluded that the usual linking procedure, retropolation, is seriously flawed as it tends to bias GDP levels upwards and, consequently, to underestimate growth rates, especially for developing countries experiencing structural change. An alternative interpolation procedure is proposed.
C82|Contemporary methods for statistical disclosure control|A critical review is made of the most popular statistical methods and ideas associated with keeping statistical secret and control on disclosure of confidential statistical data. Some of the most important issues for the statistical data producers and consumers, which are still not widely discussed in the specialized Bulgarian scientific literature, are considered too.
C82|Factor Models in Panels with Cross-sectional Dependence: An Application to the Extended SIPRI Military Expenditure Data| Strategic interactions between countries, such as arms races, alliances and wider economic and political shocks, can induce strong cross-sectional dependence in panel data models of military expenditure. If the assumption of cross-sectional independence fails, standard panel estimators such as fixed or random effects can lead to misleading inference. This paper shows how to improve estimation of dynamic, heterogenous, panel models of the demand for military expenditure allowing for cross-sectional dependence in errors using two approaches: Principal Components and Common Correlated Effect estimators. Our results show that it is crucial to allow for cross-sectional dependence, that the bulk of the effect is regional and there are large gains in fit by allowing for both dynamics and between country heterogeneity in models of the demand for military expenditures.
C82|Climate change damage (or, more correctly, impact) functions relate variations in temperature (or other climate variables) to economic impacts in various dimensions, and are at the basis of quantitative modeling exercises for the assessment of climate change policies. This document provides a summary of results from a series of meta-analyses aimed at estimating parameters for six specific damage functions, referring to: sea level rise, agricultural productivity, heat effects on labor productivity, human health, tourism flows and households' energy demand. All parameters of the damage functions are estimated for each of the 140 countries and regions in the GTAP9 dataset. To illustrate the salient characteristics of our estimates, we approximate the change in real GDP for the different effects, in all regions, corresponding to an increase in average temperature of +3°C. After considering the overall impact, we highlight which factor is the most significant one in each country, and we elaborate on the distributional consequences of climate change|No abstract is available for this item.
C82|Does slack influence public and private labor market interactions?|We empirically analyze the impact of public employment and wages' shocks on private labor market outcomes by studying if policies operate differently in periods of economic slack than in normal times. We use local projection methods and focus on the Spanish and euro area aggregate cases. We find that the degree of economic slack is key to determine: (i) if public employment crowds-out private employment, and (ii) the degree and extent of public wage influence on the private sector. In addition, we find that the specific features of the economy also count. In the case of Spain, when fiscal consolidation is implemented at times of economic distress, the contractionary effects of public employment cuts appear more damaging for the economy than those of public wage cuts, while the opposite happens for the euro area as a whole. These differences are likely to be related to specific features of the labor markets in both cases. JEL Classification: E62, E65, H6, C3, C82
C82|Using external sources to understand sample survey bias: the case of the Invind survey|We look at two sources of bias in survey estimates of the Bank of Italy’s Survey of Industrial and Services Firms conducted yearly on a panel of enterprises: 1) the bias owing to panel attrition caused by the differences between units entering and exiting the sample and those participating more regularly in the survey; 2) the bias created by delays in the distributional data on the reference population, needed for computing the survey weights. By comparing an array of performance indicators (available in an integrated database) for the firms regularly participating against those participating more erratically, we find that panel attrition has a limited effect on the official aggregate estimates, since they are determined by larger firms, which tend to participate regularly in the survey. Smaller firms’ erratic participation, the comparatively worse performance of the units exiting the sample and the higher-than-average age of the firms in the sample call for a careful assessment of the estimates that are not influenced by firm size. Finally, for the less recent years we measure the extent to which the estimates vary if we use the revised information on the reference population, and we find that the delays in updating significantly bias the aggregate estimates only when the population size is highly unstable, with negligible effects on the estimates less dependent on firm size.
C82|"Valuing ""Free"" Media in GDP: An Experimental Approach"|“Free” consumer entertainment and information from the Internet, largely supported by advertising revenues, has had a major impact on consumer behavior. Some economists believe that measured gross domestic product (GDP) growth is badly underestimated because GDP excludes online entertainment (Brynjolfsson and Oh 2012; Ito 2013; Aeppel 2015). This paper ntroduces an experimental GDP methodology that includes advertising-supported media in both final output and business inputs. For example, Google Maps would be counted as final output when it is used by a consumer to plan vacation driving routes. On the other hand, the same website would be counted as a business input when it is used by a pizza restaurant to plan delivery routes. Contrary to critics of the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), the process of including “free” media in the input-output accounts has little impact on either GDP or total factor productivity (TFP). Between 1998 and 2012, measured nominal GDP growth falls 0.005% per year, real GDP growth rises 0.009% per year and TFP growth rises 0.016% per year. Between 1929 and 1998, measured nominal GDP growth rises 0.002% per year, real GDP growth falls 0.002% per year, and TFP growth rises 0.004% per year. These changes are not nearly enough to reverse the recent slowdown in growth. Our method for accounting for free media is production oriented in the sense that it is a measure of the resource input into the entertainment (or other content) of the medium rather than a measure of the consumer surplus arising from the content. The BEA uses a similar productionoriented approach when measuring GDP. In contrast, other researchers use broader approaches to measure value. Brynjolfsson and Oh (2012) attempt to capture some consumer surplus by measuring the time expended on the Internet. Varian (2009) argues that much of the value of the Internet is in time saving, an additional metric for capturing consumer surplus. The McKinsey Institute (Bughin et al. 2011) attempts to measure the productivity gain from search directly. In particular, this production-oriented accounting has no method to account for instances in which the good or service precedes the revenue that it eventually generates. Over the past two decades, many Silicon Valley firms have followed the disruptive business model described as URL: ubiquity now, revenue later. Some firms have been creating proprietary software or research, which is already captured in the national accounts as investment. Other firms have been creating intangible investments in open source software, customer networks and other organizational capital. Despite their long-run value, none of these intangible assets are currently captured in the national accounts as investment. If we treat these asset categories as capital, then the productivity boom from 1995 to 2000 becomes even stronger and the weak productivity growth of the past decade may be ameliorated somewhat.
C82|SVAR Approach for Extracting Inflation Expectations Given Severe Monetary Shocks: Evidence from Belarus|Inflation expectations play a crucial role for macroeconomic dynamics and more specifically for monetary environment. However, inflation expectations is an unobservable variable. So, the quality of the correspondent measure in a great extent predetermines its feasibility for macroeconomic analysis. Today, survey-based measures of inflation expectations prevail in macroeconomic analysis. However, the drawbacks and/or unavailability of such measures give a rise to other identification strategies. Extracting inflation expectations from the actual data (e.g. series of interest rate and actual inflation) basing on SVAR identification approach has become a valuable alternative/supplement for measuring inflation expectations. In this paper I show that the existing strategy of inflation expectations identification through SVAR approach is very sensitive to the state of monetary environment. When a monetary environment is unstable (e.g. high and volatile inflation), the assumptions of the baseline approach are not hold, and it produces biased estimations. I emphasize two sources of this bias in estimations and suggest procedure for obtaining unbiased estimates. My identification strategy includes a number of steps. I suggest applying Markov regimeswitching framework for extracting an unbiased mean for ex ante real interest rate. Further, I use two-stage SVAR identification strategy. First, I identify an unexpected shock to actual inflation, which is crucial for obtaining a proper measure of inflation expectations. Further, I net the series of ex post interest rate from this ?noise?. Second, I run a baseline SVAR procedure, for which I use the data adjusted at the first step. Finally I obtain an unbiased and informatively rich series of inflation expectations.
C82|Nowcasting of the Russian GDP Using the Current Statistics: Approach Modification|This work presents a modification of the model of GDP short-term estimation based on current macroeconomic statistics initially offered in the paper titled 'Nowcasting and Short-Term Forecasting of Russian GDP with a Dynamic Factor Model' by Alexey Porshakov and co-authors [8]. The model modification presented in this work considers factors separately for each of the three groups of indicators - agents' expectations and their estimate of the current economic situation; financial variables, world market and foreign economic activity indicators; real sector indicators. This model can be used to get GDP estimates for the previous and current quarters, which allows researchers to obtain information on output dynamics in the economy in addition to estimates under other models and expert judgments. Also, the model helps decompose GDP quarterly growth rates into various factors.
C82|A New Global Index of Infrastructure: Construction, Rankings and Applications|We construct comprehensive and comparable indices on the most relevant components of economic infrastructure. An unobserved components model is employed to cover the largest possible number of developing and developed countries over the period 1990-2010. We map major findings from the new indices on infrastructure and provide country rankings, which we also compare with subjective assessments of infrastructure in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report. Finally, we exemplify possible applications related to trade and FDI. By overcoming several data limitations, our new global index can help assess the links between infrastructure and economic development more systematically.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
C82|Political Budget Cycles: Manipulation from Leaders or Manipulation from Researchers? Evidence from a Meta-Regression Analysis|Despite a long history of research on political budget cycles, their existence and magnitude are still in question. By conducting a systematic analysis of the existing literature we intend to clarify the debate. Based on data collected from over 1; 700 regressions and 57 studies, our meta-analysis suggests that leaders do manipulate fiscal tools in order to be re-elected but to an extent that is significantly exaggerated by scholars. However, we show the incumbents' strategy differs depending on which tools they leverage. Finally, we discuss in further details how authors' methodological choices and country institutions affect political budget cycles.
C82|Extending the Input-Output Table Based on Firm-level Data|This paper proposes a general method to extend a standard input-output (IO) table to incorporate firm heterogeneity when portraying the domestic segment of global value chains in a country. We develop a quadratic optimization model to estimate an extended IO table that reports inter-sector transactions between different types of firms in an economy, using information from standard IO tables along with various linear constraints implied by sector-level statistics and firm-level data. The proposed method permits the computation of standard errors of all values in the estimated IO tables, inferred from bootstrapped samples of the underlying firm-level data. As an illustration, we implement our model using Chinese IO tables and firm census data. We then use the estimated IO tables to compute the direct and indirect domestic value added in exports of different firm types in China. Based on our reconciled data sets for 2007 and 2010, we find that both state-owned enterprises (SOE) and small and medium enterprises (SME) in China have much higher value-added exports (VAX) to gross exports ratios, compared to the rest of the economy. While the VAX ratio of China’s aggregate exports increased by about 9% between 2007 and 2010, SOE’s and SME’s VAX increased by 47% and 27%, respectively.
C82|"Comment on Feige's Paper ""Reflections on the Meaning and Measurement of Unobserved Economies: What do we really know about the 'Shadow Economy'?"""|This comment provides a reply to Prof. Feige’s paper with the title “Reflections on the Meaning and Measurement of Unobserved Economies: What do we really know about the ‘Shadow Economy’?”, in which Prof. Feige heavily criticizes me. I show that the same critique which Prof. Feige raises against me can be put forward to his results on the non-observed economy. Moreover, I show that my dataset is appropriately documented and I also address the problem of calibration and normalization issues when undertaking a MIMIC estimation. In the concluding chapter I suggest that a joint paper should be written in which all the pros and cons of each method of estimating the size and development of the non-observed/shadow economy are presented and criticized.
C82|Testing for news and noise in non-stationary time series subject to multiple historical revisions|This paper focuses on testing non-stationary real-time data for forecastability, i.e., whether data revisions reduce noise or are news, by putting data releases in vector-error correction forms. To deal with historical revisions which affect the whole vintage of time series due to redefinitions, methodological innovations etc., we employ the recently developed impulse indicator saturation approach, which involves potentially adding an indicator dummy for each observation to the model. We illustrate our procedures with the U.S. real GNP/GDP series of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and find that revisions to this series neither reduce noise nor can be considered as news.
C82|Fundamentos económicos y cuentas nacionales: una propuesta de medición de la evolución del valor|El producto social anual de un país es concebido unilateralmente como una masa de valores de uso, cuya evolución es captada por la medición a precios constantes. En tal contexto, el presente artículo desarrolla dos objetivos consecutivos. Primero, sobre la base de una relectura crítica de los fundamentos generales de las distintas escuelas de pensamiento, presenta una conceptualización alternativa del producto social, que considera también su carácter de masa de valor. Segundo, propone un indicador de la evolución de dicho carácter, complementario al producto a precios constantes. Como cierre, aplica este indicador al caso argentino para el lapso 1935-2010. ***** A country’s annual social product is unilaterally conceived as a mass of use values, whose evolution is captured by the measuring at constant prices. In this context, this paper aims to develop two consecutive goals. First, through a critical reading of the general principles of different schools of thought, it presents an alternative conceptualization for the social product, which also considers its character as a mass of value. Second, it proposes an indicator for that character, which is complementary to the product at constant prices. In sum, both indicators are applied to Argentina for the 1935-2010 period.
C82|Una Matriz de Contabilidad Social para el sector rural colombiano|En este trabajo se construye una Matriz de Contabilidad Social con énfasis en el sector rural colombiano, la cual puede servir como insumo para el análisis de las estrategias recomendadas por la Misión para la Transformación del Campo, o de la Reforma Rural Integral contenida en los Acuerdos de Paz de la Habana. Esta base de datos busca capturar los principales rasgos y características del sector rural colombiano, enfatizando los siguientes aspectos: a) una sectorización de las actividades agropecuarias que permite identificar las actividades donde se concentra el sector empresarial y aquellas donde predominan la pequeña agricultura y la agricultura familiar; b) la consideración explícita de la formación de los ingresos laborales rurales a partir del trabajo familiar e independiente, y del trabajo asalariado, tanto en actividades agropecuarias como no agropecuarias; c) la diferenciación entre hogares rurales y hogares urbanos en términos de la formación de sus ingresos y sus patrones de gasto.
C82|Reconstrucción de PIB regionales en Colombia (1800-2015): una revisión crítica de las fuentes y los métodos|Este documento resume y analiza las principales fuentes y métodos empleados en la reconstrucción de PIB regionales para los últimos dos siglos en Colombia. Además, se ofrece una perspectiva general de lo que se esperaría fuese la evolución de este campo de estudio en los próximos años. Se encuentra que se trata de un campo apenas en construcción. Los trabajos son pocos y buena parte de ellos están aún inéditos. Sin embargo, el ritmo al que está creciendo la producción, tanto de aplicaciones como de fuentes, sugiere un futuro próximo prolífico. Adicionalmente, se identificó que las agendas de investigación para el siglo XIX y XX se han mantenido separadas.
C82|The Informational Theory of Legislative Committees: An Experimental Analysis|We experimentally investigate the informational theory of legislative committees first proposed by Gilligan and Krehbiel [1987, 1989]. Two committees provide policy-relevant information to a legislature under two different procedural rules. Under the open rule, the legislature is free to make any decision; under the closed rule, the legislature is constrained to choose between a committee's proposal and an exogenous status quo. Our experiment shows that even in the presence of conflicts of interests, legislative committees help improve the legislature's decision by providing useful information. We further obtain evidence in support of three theoretical predictions: the Outlier Principle, according to which more extreme preferences of the committees reduce the extent of information transmission; the Distributional Principle, according to which the open rule is more distributionally eefficient than the closed rule; and the Restrictive-rule Principle, according to which the closed rule better facilitates the informational role of legislative committees. We, however, obtain mixed evidence for the Heterogeneity Principle, according to which more information can be extracted in the presence of multiple committees with heterogeneous preferences. Our experimental findings provide overall support for the equilibrium predictions of Gilligan and Krehbiel [1989], some of which have been controversial in the literature.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
C82|Spain's Historical National Accounts: Expenditure and Output, 1850-2015|This essay offers a new set of historical GDP estimates from the demand and supply sides that revises and expands those in Prados de la Escosura (2003) and provides the basis to investigate Spain’s long run economic growth. It presents a reconstruction of production and expenditure series for the century prior to the introduction of modern national accounts. Then, it splices available national accounts sets over the period 1958-2015 through interpolation, as an alternative to conventional retropolation. The resulting national accounts series are linked to the ‘pre-statistical era’ estimates providing yearly series for GDP and its components since 1850. On the basis of new population estimates, GDP per head is derived. Trends in GDP per head are, then, drawn and, using new employment estimates, decomposed into labour productivity and the amount of work per person, and placed into international perspective.
C82|The Economic Effects of U.S. Presidential Tax Communication|Aside from affecting tax expectations, the U.S. President holds a unique position to in uence economic sentiment. We apply a probabilistic topic model and a dictionary-based sentiment analysis to extract information on the tone and the prevalence of tax policy in public statements by the U.S. president. Our econometric analyses show that prioritizing tax policy temporarily stimulates consumption, investment, and output. A positive tone in presidential tax news suggests that these results stem from sentiment effects. In accordance, we find that confidence rises and policy uncertainty decreases in response to more precise tax communication. The positive effect on output persists after controlling for tax foresight, underscoring the existence of a distinct sentiment effect.
C82|Committing to Fiscal Policy: The Influence of the U.S. President on Consumer Confidence and Output|This paper examines whether the U.S. president's fiscal commitment raises confidence and ultimately output. We analyze 80,545 U.S. presidential speeches by using a probabilistic topic model to construct a continuous measure on the president's commitment to fiscal policy. Impulse responses from a SVAR model confirm that a stronger commitment temporarily boosts consumer confidence which then stimulates output.

C82|Estimates of Public, Housing and Other Private Sectors’ Net Capital Stocks for the Cyprus Economy: 1995Q1-2015Q4|The Cyprus Statistical Service (Cystat) computes annual data for the net capital stock and capital depreciation by NACE Rev. 2 classification using the Perpetual Inventory Method (PIM). This data is available with a two-year lag, whilst quarterly data, including a breakdown by institutional sector, is not produced. On the basis of the latest vintage of annual data, this paper provides a quarterly breakdown of net capital stock for the total economy and its depreciation for the period 1995-2015 in constant 2005 prices. We further present a quarterly breakdown by institutional sector, namely public, housing and other private sector.
C82|Further Causality Evidence on Arms Race, Inflation and Economic Growth|This paper examines the effects of expanding the ratio of defense spending on long-run inflation and economic growth by constructing an endogenous growth model and employing empirical approaches for China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan over the period between 1955 and 2010. By analyzing cointegration test results, it is found that: (1) the increase of the ratio of defense spending leads to a lower long-run inflation rate in China and Japan, but higher inflation rate in Taiwan; (2) the increase of the ratio of defense spending leads to a higher long-run economic growth, supporting the famously Benoit Hypothesis for China, Japan and Taiwan; (3) The results of bidirectional Granger causality test suggests that an arms race exists among the cross-country pairs of China and Japan, China and Taiwan, and the last pair, Japan and South Korea. Based on (1) to (3), as the ratio of defense spending increases, an arms race, higher economic growth and lower inflation coexist in China and Japan. These findings may also be an explanation of why, in view of economic performance, those arms race and disarmament issues have been advocated in recent years.
C82|Reconciling Chinaâ€™s official statistics on state ownership and control|Chinaâ€™s National Bureau of Statistics releases data for Chinaâ€™s industrial sector, fixed asset investment and real estate investment both according to the enterpriseâ€™s official registration status, and according to whether the controller of the enterprise is the state. For most applications data for â€˜state owned and state-holding companiesâ€™ based on the control concept is appropriate, as this includes coverage of SOEsâ€™ listed- and unlisted-subsidiaries. These data show that less than a third of Chinese industrial output, fixed asset investment, and less than twenty per cent of Chinese real estate investment is carried on by companies that are controlled by the state. A broader definition to cover all state ownership would include enterprises that are not â€˜state controlledâ€™ but nevertheless include state capital or investment from SOEs. This would capture some additional proportion of the limited liability companies, joint-ventures and shareholding corporations that are in mixed ownership.

We review the conceptual framework underpinning this model, and identify its core assumptions. Finally, we highlight potential applications for this model, including : considering the dispersion of global economic activity; assessing the potential scale of activity across different trading blocs; and quantifying the impact of domestic policy reform scenarios in individual economies. Rather than provide an exhaustive analysis of the results, we make the data and results freely available .

C82|Estimating gross value added volumes and prices by institutional sector|Integrated quarterly sector accounts (QSA) provide an analytical tool to understand the generation, allocation and use of income for all institutional sectors in the economy. They also provide a tool to analyse production from a sectoral point of view instead of an industry point of view. However, since QSA are published in current prices only, sectoral volume and price measures are lacking as an important toolkit for economic analysis and forecasting, notably in the case of gross value added. This paper introduces a methodology to estimate sectoral price and volume measures for euro area value added at a quarterly frequency and provides a comparison of alternative estimation methods. It presents a benchmark method which yields robust estimates of sectoral volumes and prices in the euro area. JEL Classification: C33, C82, E01, E30
C82|Does slack influence public and private labour market interactions?|We empirically analyse the impact of public employment and public wages shocks on private labour market outcomes by examining whether policies operate differently in periods of economic slack than in normal times. We use local projection methods and focus on the Spanish and euro area aggregate cases. We find that the degree of unemployment slack is key for determining: (i) whether public employment crowds out private employment, and (ii) the degree and extent of the influence of public wages on the private sector. In addition, we find that at times of economic distress, public wage adjustment has lower output costs than public employment cuts for the Spanish case, while the opposite occurs at the euro area level. We conjecture that differences in the degree of wage rigidities and the size of the unemployment pool may rationalise our findings
C82|Measuring on-going changes in China's capital controls: A de jure and a hybrid index data set|Liberalizing China's capital account controls may have profound implications for the RMB exchange rate, monetary policy autonomy, and Chinese economy. However, rigorous studies on the importance of China's capital controls are limited, primarily due to the scarcity of proper measurements of China's capital controls. In this paper we create a new data set of indices including de jure and hybrid measurements of the changes in China's capital controls. In contrast to other capital control indices that are compiled in a yes-or-no style, we quantify the intensity of changes in China's capital controls. Our indices reveal a persistent but uneven process of capital account liberalization in China between 1999 and 2012. This paper describes the de jure and hybrid indices, including indices for capital controls on individual asset categories, gross flows, inflows and outflows, as well as for resident and nonresident asset transactions. Understanding that China usually implements policies in a step by step gradualist style, we extract this gradual information from the text in the IMF's Annual Report on Exchange Arrangement and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER) and some supplementary material from other sources.
C82|Building original series of physical capital stocks for China's economy methodological problems, proposals for solutions and a new database|There are to date no official Chinese statistics relating to capital stocks. This lacking data hinders econometric studies of growth in this country. Series of such stocks are proposed in the literature, but most available empirical work on this topic suffers multiple deficiencies. The purpose of this article is to build the most reliable and longest possible statistical series of capital stocks for China. Our initial capital stocks are calculated on the basis of an output-capital ratio which is less approximate (and lower) than those generally provided. Our investment flows are consistent with the perimeters of the initial stocks. Our investment price indices are strictly tailored to the content of these stocks, and the unit root tests show that all the indices are non-stationary and cointegrated to the order of 2. This means they cannot be substitutes, as supposed in many other studies. Our depreciation rates are estimated by type of capital, under assumptions consistent with age-efficiency and retirement. Investment shares are used to approximate an overall capital structure and to calculate a total depreciation rate. Built from 1952 to 2014, our original series are available to econometricians seeking to conduct new empirical studies on China, over the long run.
C82|A tale of two correlations: Evidence and theory regarding the phase shift between the price level and output|We examine the relationship between the price level and output at business-cycle frequencies. In the postwar period, there is evidence of a phase shift between the price level and output. Such a phase shift is manifested in the price level being countercyclical and the inflation rate being procyclical or acyclical, depending on the detrending method used. Our examination takes three approaches. First, we apply bootstrapping methods to characterize the two correlations, though the methodology could easily be extended to any set of facts. Second, we specify a model economy with forecast heterogeneity, showing numerically that this model economy can match the observed pair of correlations. Third, we apply robust control theory, deriving conditions in which the price level is countercyclical and the inflation rate is procyclical.
C82|Nowcasting Czech GDP in real time|In this paper, we employ a Dynamic Factor Model (DFM) to nowcast Czech GDP. Using multiple vintages of historical data and taking into account the publication lags of various monthly indicators, we evaluate the real-time performance of the DFM over the 2005–2012 period. The main result of this paper is that the accuracy of model-based nowcasts is comparable to that of the nowcasts of the Czech National Bank (CNB). Moreover, combining the DFM and the CNB nowcasts results in more accurate performance than in the case of the individual nowcasts alone. Our results also suggest that foreign variables are crucial for the accuracy of the model, while omitting financial and confidence indicators does not worsen the nowcasting performance.
C82|New stylized facts on occupational employment and their implications: Evidence from consistent employment data|The business cycle properties of occupational employment have not yet been extensively explored because of inconsistencies in the aggregate employment series by occupation. Using consistent aggregate hours data constructed through the method of “conversion factors,” which was developed by the U.S. Census Bureau, we provide new empirical facts on the cyclical behaviors of occupational employment and discuss their implications. First, employment of the middle-skill occupation group is negatively affected by a technology shock, while those of high-skill and low-skill groups are positively correlated with it. Second, it is the middle-skill group that experiences the largest decline in employment volatility after the mid-1980s. Last, recessions since the 1980s have heterogeneous impacts on different occupations, defining the characteristics of each recession. We further discuss the value of having consistent employment data in studies of business cycles.
C82|A newly identified source of potential CPI bias: Weekly versus monthly unit value price indexes|We find that unit value prices used for constructing the CPI should be for the same period as the index to be constructed, rather than for a sub-period. The latter approach can lead to an upward bias in the CPI.
C82|Measuring industry productivity and cross-country convergence|This paper introduces a new method for simultaneously comparing industry productivity across countries and over time. The new method is similar to the method for making multilateral comparisons of Caves, Christensen and Diewert (1982b) but their method can only compare gross outputs across production units and not compare real value added of production units across time and space. The present paper uses the translog GDP methodology for measuring productivity levels across time that was pioneered by Diewert and Morrison (1986) and adapts it to the multilateral context. The new method is illustrated using an industry level data set and shows that productivity dispersion across 38 countries between 1995 and 2011 has decreased faster in the traded sector than in the non-traded sector. In both sectors, there is little evidence of decreasing distance to the productivity frontier.
C82|On the use of palynological data in economic history: New methods and an application to agricultural output in Central Europe, 0–2000AD|In this paper we introduce a new source of data to economic history: palynological data or, in other words, information about pollen grains which are preserved in the bottom sediments of various water basins. We discuss how this data is collected and how it should be interpreted; develop new methods for aggregating this information into regional trends in agricultural output; construct an extensive dataset with a large number of pollen sites from Central Europe; and use our methods to study the economic history of Greater Poland, Lesser Poland, Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Lower Saxony since the first century AD.
C82|Language, news and volatility|I use Google News to study the relation between news volumes and stock market volatilities. More than nine million stock market-related news stories in English and Chinese are collected and the dynamics of the news volume and the stock market volatility is compared. I find that the stock market volatility and the number of publicly available global news stories are strongly linked in both languages. Furthermore, the directional link between news and volatility rather is from news to volatility than vice versa. In out-of-sample evaluations of volatility forecasts I find news volumes to improve forecasts, regardless of language.
C82|Trading gains: new estimates of swiss gdp, 1851 to 2008|This paper revises Swiss GDP emphasizing the difference between single and double deflation, which depends on trading gains: i.e. gains from terms of trade and from the real exchange rate. These gains contributed significantly to Swiss economic growth between 1930 and 1990. Earlier series of Swiss GDP have neglected trading gains. In backward projections, this leads to overestimation of GDP (per capita) levels. The Maddison database (Bolt & Zanden 2014), for example, suggests that Swiss GDP per capita was 38 percent above that of the USA in 1875. My series shows that Swiss GDP per capita was still below the Western European average.
C82|Estimation of Climate Change Damage Functions for 140 Regions in the GTAP 9 Database|Climate change damage (or, more correctly, impact) functions relate variations in temperature (or other climate variables) to economic impacts in various dimensions, and are at the basis of quantitative modeling exercises for the assessment of climate change policies. This document provides a summary of results from a series of meta-analyses aimed at estimating parameters for six specific damage functions, referring to: sea level rise, agricultural productivity, heat effects on labor productivity, human health, tourism flows, and households' energy demand. All parameters of the damage functions are estimated for each of the 140 countries and regions in version 9 of the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP 9) Data Base. To illustrate the salient characteristics of the estimates, the change in real gross domestic product is approximated for the different effects, in all regions, corresponding to an increase in average temperature of +3°C. After considering the overall impact, the paper highlights which factor is the most significant one in each country, and elaborates on the distributional consequences of climate change.
C82|Indice de la Violence Interne : une mesure composite et quantitative de la violence et de la criminalité internes dans les pays en développement|Nous avons créé un nouvel indice, l’Indice de Violence Interne (IVI), dont le but est de comparer le niveau de violence dans 130 pays en développement. L’IVI est un indice composite mesurant la violence interne sous différentes formes: conflits armés internes, criminalité, terrorisme et violence politique. Sa construction repose uniquement sur des variables quantitatives, contrairement aux indicateurs de fragilité déjà existants basés essentiellement sur des informations subjectives et des jugements d’experts. Mots clés : Personnes déplacées, terrorisme, criminalité, conflits, fragilité
C82|Internal Violence Index: a composite and quantitative measure of internal violence and crime in developing countries|We have created a new index, the Internal Violence Index (IVI), which aims to compare the amount of violence at the country level for 130 developing countries. The IVI is a composite indicator composed of four clusters - internal armed conflict, criminality, terrorism, and political violence. It is based on quantitative variables only, in contrast to the existing subjective indicators of fragility.
C82|Valuing Free Media in GDP: An Experimental Approach|“Free” consumer entertainment and information from the Internet, largely supported by advertising revenues, has had a major impact on consumer behavior. Some economists believe that measured gross domestic product (GDP) growth is badly underestimated because GDP excludes online entertainment (Brynjolfsson and Oh 2012; Ito 2013; Aeppel 2015). This paper ntroduces an experimental GDP methodology that includes advertising-supported media in both final output and business inputs. For example, Google Maps would be counted as final output when it is used by a consumer to plan vacation driving routes. On the other hand, the same website would be counted as a business input when it is used by a pizza restaurant to plan delivery routes. Contrary to critics of the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), the process of including “free” media in the input-output accounts has little impact on either GDP or total factor productivity (TFP). Between 1998 and 2012, measured nominal GDP growth falls 0.005% per year, real GDP growth rises 0.009% per year and TFP growth rises 0.016% per year. Between 1929 and 1998, measured nominal GDP growth rises 0.002% per year, real GDP growth falls 0.002% per year, and TFP growth rises 0.004% per year. These changes are not nearly enough to reverse the recent slowdown in growth. Our method for accounting for free media is production oriented in the sense that it is a measure of the resource input into the entertainment (or other content) of the medium rather than a measure of the consumer surplus arising from the content. The BEA uses a similar productionoriented approach when measuring GDP. In contrast, other researchers use broader approaches to measure value. Brynjolfsson and Oh (2012) attempt to capture some consumer surplus by measuring the time expended on the Internet. Varian (2009) argues that much of the value of the Internet is in time saving, an additional metric for capturing consumer surplus.

C82|Trading gains: new estimates of Swiss GDP,1851 to 2008|This paper revises Swiss GDP emphasizing the difference between single and double deflation, which depends on trading gains: i.e. gains from terms of trade and from the real exchange rate. These gains contributed significantly to Swiss economic growth between 1930 and 1990. Earlier series of Swiss GDP have neglected trading gains. In backward projections, this leads to overestimation of GDP (per capita) levels. The Maddison database (Bolt & Zanden 2014), for example, suggests that Swiss GDP per capita was 38 percent above that of the USA in 1875. My series shows that Swiss GDP per capita was still below the Western European average
C82|Nowcasting Tourism Industry Performance Using High Frequency Covariates|We evaluate the short term forecasting performance of methods that systematically incorporate high frequency information via covariates. Our results indicate that including timely intra-period data into the forecasting process results in significant gains in predictive accuracy compared to relying exclusively on low frequency aggregates. Anticipating growing popularity of these tools among empirical analysts, we oâ†µer practical implementation guidelines to facilitate their adoption.
C82|Has Structural Economic Vulnerability Decreased in Least Developed Countries? Lessons Drawn from Retrospective Indices| The Economic Vulnerability Index (EVI) is a well-recognised measure of the structural vulnerability of developing countries and is regularly used and published by the United Nations for cross-country comparison purposes, primarily to review the list of Least Developed Countries (LDCs). However, due to the revisions in methodology occurring over time, the official EVI cannot be used to assess the changes in vulnerability. In this paper, we use two retrospective series of the EVI, based on constant definitions. The real change in vulnerability is thus isolated from the impact of revisions in the design of the index, allowing comparison of the evolution of LDCs and non-LDCs. The implications of the revisions in the EVI design are then discussed.
C82|Labor flows in Hungary and Europe|It is common practice in the literature to compute labor flows from data on stocks. To use these flows in standard search models, it is assumed that the economically relevant movements occur between employment and unemployment. If there are significant flows between labor force participation and inactivity, ignoring the participation decision can lead to biased results. This paper shows that while with three states it is impossible to identify all the flows from publicly available data on stocks, partial identification is possible. A new method is described, which allows the computation of the transition probabilities that are most relevant from a macroeconomic perspective. The method is easy to use, and the paper describes the detailed steps for its implementation to potential users.
C82|Determinants of long-term economic Growth redux: A Measurement Error Model Averaging (MEMA) approach|This paper estimates determinants of long-run growth rates of GDP per capita in a cross section of countries. We propose a novel Measurement Error Model Averaging (MEMA) approach that accounts for measurement error in international income data as well as model uncertainty. Estimating the model using eight vintages of the Penn World Tables (PWT) together with other proposed growth determinants, we identify 18 variables related to economic growth. The results are robust to allowing for outliers in the form of heteroscedastic model errors.
C82|Measuring hours worked in Germany : contents, data and methodological essentials of the IAB working time measurement concept (Die Berechnung der geleisteten Arbeitsstunden in Deutschland : Inhalte, Daten und methodische Grundlagen der IAB Arbeitszeitrechnung)|"""This article presents the Working Time Measurement Concept of the Institute for Employment Research, which determines the hours worked in Germany and their individual components. The Working Time Measurement Concept is the key data product on working time in Germany and underlies the German national accounts figure on labour input. These statistics on hours worked are essential for a proper analysis of aggregate labour market trends and cyclical fluctuations. In the Working Time Measurement Concept, changes in working hours due to collective agreements and economic fluctuations are brought together with shifts in employment structure, thus producing a differentiated picture of the scope, structure and development of the annual working time of gainfully employed persons. We outline the conceptual and methodological framework of the measurement, which continually evolves due to its integration in the system of national accounts and due to innovations to the statistical procedures applied. An overview of single components and their data sources is given, while the resulting time series of hours worked and the volume of work are depicted according to their long run trends, cyclical variation and reaction in the 2008/09 financial and economic crisis.""

C82|Research Performance Based Funding Systems: a Comparative Assessment|Performance based funding is used by most EU Member States to increase the performance of their public research system. This report analyses the different nature of systems in EU Member States, selected associated and third countries. It aims to inform Member States which are in a process of mutual learning to improve the design of their allocation systems. â€¢ Research Performance based funding systems provide incentives to increase scientific performance and concentrates resources in well performing organisations â€¢ The nature of systems in place differs widely â€¢ The specific features of RPBF assessment designs can generate unintended consequences â€¢ The assessment suggests RPBF as a potential avenue for several Member States â€¢ The choice for specific designs, taking into accounts costs and potential benefits, should take into account the national context
C82|Quality analysis and harmonization issues in the context of “Frame SBS”|The paper describes the results of the quality analysis behind the process of integration and harmonization of administrati ve data with sample survey of small and medium-sized enterprises (SME). The integration process involves both Structural Business Statistics (SBS) and National Accounts (NA) to reduce the distance from the different estimates. The quality analysis considers a study of the coverage of administrative data, the harmonization of definitions and comparison analysis among administrative and survey data with a subsequent analysis of the distribution of differences in critical domains to verify the absence of systematic errors. The final quality analysis explores separately the impact of the new sources on the SME estimates by decomposing the difference in two parts: (1) the source effect due to the use of administrative data and (2) the sampling effect due to the passage from the sample to census estimations.
C82|The labour cost variables in the building of the “Frame SBS”|The building of the new Structural Business Statistics (SBS) Register (so called Frame) exploits company accounts and en terprise level fiscal data as main sources concerning the variables on revenues and costs. When dealing with labour cost variables an additional source is available: social security data. There are advantages and disadvantages in the use of social security data to feed the variables on wages and labour costs into the frame. In fact, while being heterodox with the main sources, their use has the advantage to introduce consistency with employment data entering the Frame via the business register. This work reports the findings obtained trying to answer questions like: which is the most suitable source to comply with SBS definitions on wages and labour costs? What are the magnitudes and characteristics of discrepancies between sources? What are the causes of these differences? The main reasons of differences have been identified through an in-depth study of the definitions of administrative variables and comparative analyses between sources,at both the macro and micro level. The solution proposed for the Frame involves an innovative correction procedure using social security data to reduce the definitional bias in company accounts due to the inclusion of costs related to external workers into the labour cost.
C82|The new statistical register “Frame SBS”: overview and perspectives|The paper summarizes the main features of the new statistical register on economic accounts of Italian small and medium enterp rises (SMEs) developed at Istat in 2013-2014.The register, which is called “Frame SBS”, allows to annually estimate the main variables of the economic accounts based on the massive use of microdata from integrated administrative sources.The sampling survey on SMEs is used as complementary source of information for estimating those variables which cannot be directly obtained from administrative sources. For methodological and technological details, the paper refers to the other papers published in this Volume of the Statistical Review. The paper highlights the role of the register in the area of business statistics, focusing on its potentials in terms of integrability with other sources for complex economic analyses.
C82|Size and Development of the Shadow Economies of 157 Countries Worldwide: Updated and New Measures from 1999 to 2013|"This paper is a first attempt to study the size and development of the shadow economies of 157 countries over 1999 to 2013. Using a MIMIC model, we find that higher tax and regulatory burden, unemployment and self-employment rates are drivers of the shadow economy, meaning that an increase of these causal variables increases the shadow economy. Our result also confirms previous findings of Friedrich Schneider, Andreas Buehn and Claudia Montenegro (2010). The estimated average of informality of 157 countries around the world, including developing, eastern European, central Asian and high income OECD countries averaged over 1999 to 2013 is 33.77% of official GDP. A critical discussion about the size of these macro-estimates comes to the conclusion that most likely the ""true"" shadow economy of these countries is only 69% of their estimated macro-MIMIC-values."
C82|Taking Stock - Credit Measures in Monetary Transmission|Empirical research on the monetary transmission mechanism considering credit developments is almost exclusively limited to the amount of outstanding credit in an economy. Two issues arise out of this. First, stock-flow inconsistencies might occur. Second, the change of the outstanding amount of credit on banks' balance sheets does not consist only of new lending activity, but also incorporates other factors. As central banks should predominantly be focused on the amount of newly created credits in an economy while analysing the impact of monetary policy towards lending activity, using the change in the stock of lending can lead to distorted results, because of the incorporation of data on maturing loans, revaluations, securitization, and write-offs into this variable. The majority of existing credit channel literature does not really account for these issues. This paper makes a case to better caption new lending activity in monetary policy research. What is shown in this paper is that empirical investigations might lead to differing results when accounting for the other factors in the stock data. Central bank policy might therefore be biased.
C82|Determinants of lending activity in the Euro area|Empirical estimations of the drivers for loan extension mainly apply the outstanding stock of bank credit as the dependent variable. This paper picks up the critique of Behrendt (2016), namely that such estimations may lead to misleading results, as the change of the stock is not only driven by extended loans, but also by repayments, write-downs, revaluations and securitisation activity. This paper specifically applies a variable of new credit extensions for eight Euro area countries in a simultaneous equation panel model to evaluate potential determinants for credit extension, and compares the findings with a conventional specification using the outstanding stock. It is found that the new lending variable performs exceedingly better in respect to the underlying theory than the stock variable. This result has vast implications for the conduct of monetary policy while looking at credit trends. As most determinants have different coefficients, not only by magnitude, but also by significance and sign, central banks might react in a different way to changing trends in lending when looking at the stock variable rather than the underlying credit extension.
C82|Analysis of Correlation Based Networks Representing DAX 30 Stock Price Returns|Abstract In this paper, we consider three methods for filtering pertinent information from a series of complex networks modelling the correlations between stock price returns of the DAX 30 stocks for the time period 2001–2012 using the Thomson Reuters Datastream database and also the FNA platform to create the visualizations of the correlation-based networks. These methods reduce the complete $$30\times 30$$ 30 × 30 correlation coefficient matrix to a simpler network structure consisting only of the most relevant edges. The chosen network structures include the minimum spanning tree, asset graph and the planar maximally filtered graph. The resulting networks and the extracted information are analysed and compared, looking at the clusters, cliques and connectivity. Finally, we consider some specific time periods (a) a period of crisis (October–December 2008) and (b) a period of recovery (May–August 2010) where we discuss the possible underlying economic reasoning for some aspects of the network structures produced. Overall, we find that network based representations of correlations within a broad market index are useful in providing insights about the growth dynamics of an economy.

Ahhoz, hogy az így kapott áramlási rátákat a standard munkapiaci keresési modellben használhassuk, feltételezni kell, hogy a közgazdasági szempontból releváns mozgások a foglalkoztatottság és a munkanélküliség között zajlanak. Ha azonban a munkapiaci részvétel és az inaktivitás között is jelentősek az áramlások, és ha ez utóbbiakat nem vesszük figyelembe, akkor a számítások nagymértékben torzulnak. A rendelkezésre álló állományi adatokból nem identifikálható ugyan az összes áramlás, de részleges identifikáció lehetséges. A cikkben bemutatunk egy olyan, tudomásunk szerint új módszert, amelynek segítségével az összevont állományokból azonosíthatók a makroökönómiai szempontból releváns átmeneti valószínűségek.

C82|Determinants of Central Bank Independence: a Random Forest Approach|In this paper we implement an efficient non-parametric statistical method, Random survival forests, for the selection of the determinants of Central Bank Independence (CBI) among a large database of political and economic variables for OECD countries. This statistical technique enables us to overcome omitted variables and over omitting problems. It turns out that the economic variables are major determinants compared to the political ones and linear and nonlinear effects of chosen predictors on CBI are found.

C82|Nowcasting and Short-Term Forecasting of Russian GDP with a Dynamic Factor Model|Real-time assessment of quarterly GDP growth rates is crucial for evaluation of economy's current perspectives given the fact that respective data is normally subject to substantial publication delays by national statistical agencies. Large information sets of real-time indicators which could be used to approximate GDP growth rates in the quarter of interest are in practice characterized by unbalanced data, mixed frequencies, systematic data revisions, as well as a more general curse of dimensionality problem. The latter issues could, however, be practically resolved by means of dynamic factor modeling that has recently been recognized as a helpful tool to evaluate current economic conditions by means of higher frequency indicators. Our major results show that the performance of dynamic factor models in predicting Russian GDP dynamics appears to be superior as compared to other common alternative specifications. At the same time, we empirically show that the arrival of new data seems to consistently improve DFM's predictive accuracy throughout sequential nowcast vintages. We also introduce the analysis of nowcast evolution resulting from the gradual expansion of the dataset of explanatory variables, as well as the framework for estimating contributions of different blocks of predictors into nowcasts of Russian GDP.
C82|Hedonic Prices for Fixed Broadband Services: Estimation across OECD Countries|This paper sets out a framework to estimate quality-adjusted price levels and price changes for fixed broadband services in OECD countries. We extend and adapt existing hedonic frameworks for international and interarea comparisons and consider the extended country product dummy approach. Hedonic pricing studies often are context and data dependent, and this study is no exception. We find that the multilevel structure of international broadband price datasets suggests modeling hedonic functions at the company level. This not only mitigates efficiency loss due to lack of subscriber information on individual plans but also allows for company costs and markups to influence estimates of hedonic function coefficients. Incorporating random variation in hedonic slope coefficients at the ISP level produces results that statistically dominate standard models where slope coefficients are the same across countries, and we suggest how price comparisons based on random coefficient hedonic models might be useful in telecommunications policy analysis.
C82|Educación superior y subempleo profesional: ¿Una creciente burbuja mundial?|Conforme la proporción de jóvenes con educación secundaria completa se incrementa en todas partes del mundo, los países enfrentan una fuerte presión para expandir la oferta de educación superior pública y promover el aumento de la oferta provista por organizaciones privadas. Algunos riesgos inherentes a un acelerado crecimiento del sector son la proliferación de programas universitarios y técnicos de baja calidad y el desajuste entre la demanda laboral y la oferta educativa. En un mercado con imperfecciones propias de “bienes experiencia”, un desmesurado incremento del número de graduados universitarios y no universitarios podría exacerbar problemas ya existentes como las elevadas tasas de desempleo, subempleo y sobreeducación de profesionales. Es este contexto que surge un importante debate acerca del papel regulatorio del Estado sobre la cantidad y calidad de alumnos y egresados de educación superior, que todavía continúa y que se viene resolviendo en función del contexto político y las fortalezas o debilidades institucionales de cada país.
C82|Capital Control Measures: A New Dataset|Abstract This paper presents a new data set of capital controls by inflows and outflows for 10 asset categories in 100 countries during 1995–2013. Building on the data in Schindler (2009) and other data sets based on the analysis of the IMF’s Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER), this data set covers additional asset categories, more countries, and a longer time period. The paper discusses in detail the construction of the data and characterizes them with respect to the prevalence and correlation of controls across asset categories and between inflow and outflow controls, the aggregation of the separate categories into broader indicators, the experience of some particular countries, and the comparison of these data with others indices of capital controls.
C82|Reflections on the meaning and measurement of Unobserved Economies: What do we really know about the “Shadow Economy”?|This paper reviews the meaning and measurement of unobserved economies germane to tax evasion and macroeconomic information systems. These include the unreported, non-observed, underground, illegal, informal and unrecorded economies. It reviews the progress and shortcomings of national and international agency efforts to measure these unobserved economies, noting what they have in common, what distinguishes one from another and their interconnections. It then examines the meaning of Professor Schneider’s Shadow Economy (SSE), and the veracity of his claim to have accurately estimated its size and trend worldwide by employing a MIMIC model methodology. It concludes that SSE estimates suffer from conceptual flaws, apparent manipulation of results and insufficient documentation for replication, questioning their place in the academic, policy and popular literature.

C82|Do Data Revisions Matter for DSGE Estimation?| This paper checks whether the coefficient estimates of a famous dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model are robust to macroeconomic data revisions. The effects of revisions are captured by rerunning the estimation on a real‐time data set compiled using the latest time series available each quarter from 1997 through 2015. Results show that estimates of the structural parameters are generally robust to changes in the data that have occurred over the past 20 years. By comparison, standard error estimates are more sensitive to revisions. The latter implies that judgments about the statistical significance of certain parameters depend on which data vintage is used for estimation.
C82|Un Índice de Desigualdad Regional usando Datos Agregados<BR>[A Regional Inequality Index using Aggregated Data]|This work considers the Euclidean distance concept to assess the evolution of regional disparities from aggregate data, such as for example, the per capita output. The vector space concept, as a measure of inequality, presents interesting properties: it tends to zero when the distances are reduced, is equal to zero in the hypothetical case of absolute equality and considers the contribution of each element to the joint inequality. The exercise generates an individual inequality index for the Mexican states along 1940-2010 that may be attractive in many respects, for example, in methodologies testing stochastic convergence, in regional economic growth, to determine the effectiveness of policies aimed to reduce the regional differences, among others.

C82|Professor Schneider's Shadow Economy:What do we really know? A Rejoinder|Abstract: Professor Schneider’s “Comment” on my “Reflections” paper does not adequately address the key issues concerning the veracity of his findings, namely issues of documentation, normalization, calibration and replication. Further findings of inadequate documentation, suspicious normalization procedures, unexplained calibration errors and the inability to replicate the results; reinforces the conclusions of my original “Reflections” paper. Schneider’s Shadow Economy results suffer from conceptual flaws, arbitrary data manipulations and insufficient documentation for replication, questioning their place in the academic, policy and popular literature.

History, relevance and limitations in its interpretation]|Despite theoretical and methodological improvements by national accounts framework revisions, not without disputes and confrontations of views, the growing complexity of economic and social phenomena under globalization circumstances has led to increasing difficulties in the design, monitoring and implementation of specific policies depending on GDP indicator. The paper focuses on the analysis of the GDP relevance and limitations in its interpretation, including a retrospective view. Some inconsistencies as regards the metrics of GDP (illegal activities, unobserved economy, self-consumption in rural households, owner’s imputed rents) are highlighted. Because the GDP does not take into account the impact of important factors of progress (depletion of natural resources, environmental factors, urban concentration and rural depopulation etc.) and does not reflects neither the citizens wellbeing (starting from Easterlin Paradox), efforts to develop new statistical standards in order to complement/substitute GDP with other indicators and/or building composite indicators that integrates various aspects of quality of life have been made, but without meeting a general consensus at the global level.

The general equilibrium approach was used. To this end, a recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium model was built and calibrated based on the 2013 Social Accounting Matrix. Three scenarios were considered in terms of simulations: in the first, an increase in investment expenditure in the education sector has been envisaged; in the second, the corresponding increase in the health sector has been considered and the last scenario combines the two aforementioned. The results show the extent of the implications of such investments on the output and poverty. They reveal also transmission channels by which stakeholders are likely to be affected, while emphasizing the order of magnitude of impacts. The study concludes with a contribution.
