O51|Long-term macroeconomic effects of climate change: A cross-country analysis|We study the long-term impact of climate change on economic activity across countries, using a stochastic growth model where labour productivity is affected by country-specific climate variables - defined as deviations of temperature and precipitation from their historical norms. Using a panel data set of 174 countries over the years 1960 to 2014, we find that per-capita real output growth is adversely affected by persistent changes in the temperature above or below its historical norm, but we do not obtain any statistically significant effects for changes in precipitation. Our counterfactual analysis suggests that a persistent increase in average global temperature by 0.04oC per year, in the absence of mitigation policies, reduces world real GDP per capita by 7.22 percent by 2100. On the other hand, abiding by the Paris Agreement, thereby limiting the temperature increase to 0.01oC per annum, reduces the loss substantially to 1.07 percent. These effects vary significantly across countries. We also provide supplementary evidence using data on a sample of 48 U.S. states between 1963 and 2016, and show that climate change has a long-lasting adverse impact on real output in various states and economic sectors, and on labour productivity and employment.
O51|The Industry Anatomy of the Transatlantic Productivity Growth Slowdown|"By merging KLEMS data sets and aggregating over the ten largest Western European nations (EU-10), we are able to compare and contrast productivity growth up through 2015 starting from 1950 in the U.S. and from 1972 in the EU-10. Data are provided at the aggregate level, as well as for 16 industry groups within the total economy and 11 manufacturing subindustries. The analysis focuses on outcomes over four time intervals: 1950-72, 1972-95, 1995- 2005, and 2005-15. We interpret the EU-10 performance as catching up to the U.S. in stages, with its rapid growth of 1950-72 representing a delayed adoption of the inventions that propelled U.S. productivity growth in the first half of the 20th century, and the next EU-10 stage for 1972-95 as imitating the U.S. outcome for 1950-72. A striking finding is that for the total economy the ""early-to-late"" productivity growth slowdown from 1972-95 to 2005-15 in the EU-10 (-1.68 percentage points) was almost identical to the U.S. slowdown from 1950-72 to 2005-15 (-1.67 percentage points). There is a very high EU-U.S. correlation in the magnitude of the early-to-late slowdown across industries. This supports our overall theme that the productivity growth slowdown from the early postwar years to the most recent decade was due to a retardation in technical change that affected the same industries by roughly the same magnitudes on both sides of the Atlantic."

We show that both the pace of aggregate productivity growth during 1972-95 for the EU-10 as well as its industrial composition matched very closely the growth record of the U.S. in the previous 1950-72 time interval. A striking finding is that for the total economy the “early-to-late” productivity growth slowdown from 1972-95 to 2005-15 in the EU-10 (-1.68 percentage points) was almost identical to the U.S. slowdown from 1950-72 to 2005-15 (-1.67 percentage points).

O51|The Role of Nonemployers in Business Dynamism and Aggregate Productivity|A well-documented observation of the U.S. economy in the last few decades has been the steady decline in the net entry rate of employer firms, a decline in business dynamism, suggesting a possible connection with the recent slowdown in aggregate productivity growth. We consider the role of nonemployers, businesses without paid employees, in business dynamism and aggregate productivity. Notwithstanding the decline in the growth of employer firms, we show that the total number of firms, which includes nonemployer businesses, has increased in the U.S. economy since the early 1980s. We interpret this trend, along with the evolution of the employment distribution across firms, through the lens of a standard theory of firm dynamics. The model implies that firm dynamics have contributed to an average annual growth rate of aggregate productivity of at least 0.26% since the early 1980s, over one quarter of the productivity growth of 1% in the data. Further, our implied measure of productivity growth moves closely over time with measured productivity growth in the data.
O51|International Financial Credit Crises; Lessons from Canada|The credit crises experienced in the US in year 2008 is labeled as perhaps the most significant crises since the great depression. The roots of the crises were found in the default of the sub-prime mortgages and the failure occurred in both the US and the UK. Due to the integrated nature of international financial systems the spillover impacted many countries as the economies in Asia and Europe were purchasers of the sub-prime mortgages that originated in both UK and US. The impact of the credit crises in Canada is of unique importance due to the close proximity to US, and both the US and Canada being of great strategic importance to each other as well as one of the largest trading partners. Even though the international financial credit crises adversely impacted many countries, the evidence that has come across recent years point towards the conclusion that Canada was able to weather the crises much better than many other countries.
O51|Household Incomes in Canada and the United States: Who is Better Off?|It is commonly noted that Americans are on average richer than Canadians. For example, in 2016, GDP per capita was US $47,294 in Canada (PPP-adjusted) compared to US $57,798 in the United States. However, this comparison of average incomes does not necessarily imply that all or even most Canadians are worse off than Americans. This report shows that Canadian households in the bottom 56 per cent of the income distribution are in fact better off than American households at the same point of the income distribution. This finding is driven by the lower income inequality in Canada, and illustrates how the usual comparison of incomes between Canada and the United States using GDP per capita or average household income hides a critical part of the story.
O51|Does Import Competition Reduce Domestic Innovation? Evidence from the 'China Stock' and Firm-Level Data on Canadian Manufacturing|A key economic issue in Canada is the declining Business Enterprise Research and Development in manufacturing since the early 2000s. Accompanying this, the total factor productivity (TFP) growth in manufacturing slowed after 2000. However, there has not been a definitive explanation for these trends. To deepen our understanding of this phenomenon, we focus on the increasing Chinese import share in the total domestic absorption in Canadian manufacturing since the early 2000s, which appears to be driven by positive supply shocks within Chinese manufacturing. Based on a firm-level database covering all incorporated firms in Canadian manufacturing, we find that rising Chinese import competition led to declines in R&D expenditure and TFP growth within firms but reallocated employment towards more productive firms and induced less productive firms to exit. The negative within-effects were pronounced for firms that were initially smaller, less profitable, and less productive. These firms also experienced declines in their profit margins due to rising Chinese import competition while larger and better-performing firms did not. Our estimates imply that rising Chinese import competition can explain about 7 per cent of the total decline of $1.36 billion (2007 CAD) in R&D expenditure in Canadian manufacturing between 2005 and 2010. Although it led to declines in TFP within firms, the positive reallocation effects more than offset the negative within-effect. Had there been no increase in Chinese import competition between 2005 and 2010, TFP in Canadian manufacturing would have declined by 1.26 per cent per year instead of the actual 1.09 per cent per year over this period.
O51|Normalized CES supply systems: Replication of Klump, McAdam, and Willman (2007)|The analysis of Klump, McAdam, and Willman (Review of Economics and Statistics, 2007, 89, 183–192) is replicated using alternative software. Their results are verified substantively and, in large measure, numerically. Contributions include a more explicit consideration of the nested testing structure than has appeared previously, and the appropriate means of imposing and testing the special case of logarithmic growth in technology. Also, plots of the likelihood serve to emphasize that maxima in the neighborhood of a unitary elasticity of substitution are often a spurious artifact of the singularity of the model at this point, of which empirical researchers should beware.
O51|Are factor biases and substitution identifiable? The Canadian evidence|Revised productivity accounts recently released by Statistics Canada are used to estimate a KlumpMcAdamWillman (KMW) normalized CES supply-side system for the half-century 19612012. The model permits distinct rates of factor-augmenting technical change for capital and labour that distinguish between short-term versus long-term effects, as well as a non-unitary elasticity of substitution and time-varying factor shares. The advantage of the Canadian data for this purpose is that they provide a unified treatment of measurement issues that have had to be improvised in the US and European data used by previous researchers. In contrast to previous results, we find that an elasticity of substitution and distinct factor biases of technological progress are not well determined by the model. For the Canadian data, the KMW model does not appear to provide a framework that overcomes the classic DiamondMcFaddenRodriguez non-identification result. That impossibility theorem is manifested in our findings, not overcome by them.
O51|A rural health supplement to the hookworm intervention in the American South|This project re-investigates the hookworm eradication efforts of the Rockefeller Foundation's Sanitary Commission (RSC) in the American South during the Progressive Era. The RSC worked to eradicate hookworm across 11 southern states between 1911 and 1915, efforts that have been linked to dramatic short- and long-term increases in human capital and labor productivity. Although useful from an identification standpoint, these single-shot interventions, in the absence of cooperative efforts to improve underlying conditions, have a mixed record of long-term effectiveness across public health research. The efficacy of deworming campaigns in particular has come under extensive scrutiny. The experience of the American South had stood as example of how a single-shot hookworm eradication program has improved outcomes; however, the robustness of this result has also recently come into question. A replication of the Bleakley (2007) seminal work investigating hookworm eradication finds faults with the robustness and interpretations of the results (Roodman 2017), and an investigation into the activities of the RSC has determined them unevenly distributed across hookworm-affected areas (Elman et. al 2013). Perhaps not coincidentally, the RSC's hookworm eradication program was not the only public health intervention that occurred in the rural South during the Progressive Era. Rural public health centers spread throughout the American South during this period, partially backed by the Rockefeller Foundation. Given the use of difference-in-difference methods using decennial census data, and the participation of the Rockefeller Foundation in the funding of these rural health centers, this is a potentially critical omission in the evaluation of the RSC efforts. In this project, we investigate the connection between these rural health centers and the Rockefeller Foundation's hookworm eradication efforts, consider whether their presence explains effects attributed thereto, and examine their importance as a follow-up program to the initial hookworm intervention.
O51|The Causal Effect of Infrastructure Investments on Income Inequality: Evidence from US States|Through utilizing US state-level data at annual frequency from 1976 to 2008, this paper documents a causal effect of infrastructure investments, specifically public spending on highways, on income inequality. The number of seats in the US House of Representatives Committee On Appropriations serves as a valid instrument to identify quasi-random variations in state-level spending on highways. When a given state gains an additional committee member, which is rather exogenous, new federal grants are allocated to that state, resulting in the state government slashing its investment expenditures on highways. In other words, a crowding-out effect of federal funding for state investment in highways is at play. The main contribution of this paper is to show that such committee-driven cuts in spending on highways cause an increase in income inequality within a two-year horizon. In addition, we show that wages paid for construction jobs correlate positively and strongly with spending on highways at the state level. This further provides suggestive evidence that the construction sector plays an important role in the transmission channel from a rise in state spending on highways to a reduction in income inequality.
O51|Age and High-Growth Entrepreneurship|Many observers, and many investors, believe that young people are especially likely to produce the most successful new firms. We use administrative data at the U.S. Census Bureau to study the ages of founders of growth-oriented start-ups in the past decade. Our primary finding is that successful entrepreneurs are middle-aged, not young. The mean founder age for the 1 in 1,000 fastest growing new ventures is 45.0. The findings are broadly similar when considering high-technology sectors, entrepreneurial hubs, and successful firm exits. Prior experience in the specific industry predicts much greater rates of entrepreneurial success. These findings strongly reject common hypotheses that emphasize youth as a key trait of successful entrepreneurs.

O51|What drives the legalization of immigrants? Evidence from IRCA|We develop a model to understand the trade–offs faced by an elected representative in supporting an amnesty when a restrictive immigration policy is in place. We show that an amnesty is more desirable the more restricted are the occupational opportunities of undocumented immigrants and the smaller is the fiscal leakage to undocumented immigrants via the welfare state. Empirical evidence based on the voting behavior of U.S. Congressmen on the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 provides strong support for the predictions of our theoretical model.
O51|Female Employment And Quality Of Life In Europe And The United States: The Positive Effects Of Industry On Services Employment And Wages, 2000-2017|This paper presents a short version of some chapters and articles published by the author related with Female Employment and Quality of Life in several OECD countries of Europe and America for the period 1990-2010 as well as an update for the period 2010-2018. We focus on the positive impact that Industry usually has on the development of Services and the real Wage. Those impacts are very important in order to increase total employment and female employment. Regarding quality of life, some factors that have an important impact for women are those related with the quality of working conditions (opportunities for employment, real wage, conciliation of family and work, and other ones) as well as opportunities for social participation (in news, political tasks, instutions and other ones). Many of these factors are also important for quality of life of men. We cite the results of several econometric models in order to explain the main differences of employment rates and real income per capita among the countries of the study.
O51|Characterising green employment: The impacts of ‘greening’ on workforce composition|This paper estimates the share of jobs in the US that would benefit from a transition to the green economy, and presents different measures for the ease with which workers are likely to be able to move from non-green to green jobs. Using the US O*NET database and its definition of green jobs, 19.4% of US workers could currently be part of the green economy in a broad sense, although a large proportion of green employment would be ‘indirectly’ green, comprising existing jobs that are expected to be in high demand due to greening, but do not require significant changes in tasks, skills, or knowledge. Analysis of task content also shows that green jobs vary in ‘greenness', with very few jobs only consisting of green tasks, suggesting that the term ‘green’ should be considered a continuum rather than a binary characteristic. While it is easier to transition to indirectly green rather than directly green jobs, greening is likely to involve transitions on a similar scale and scope of existing job transitions. Non-green jobs generally appear to differ from their green counterparts in only a few skill-specific aspects, suggesting that most re-training can happen on-the-job. Network analysis shows that the green economy offers a large potential for short-run growth if job transitions are strategically managed.
O51|Development Economics Meets the Challenges of Lagging U.S. Areas: Applications to Education, Health and Nutrition, Behavior, and Infrastructure|This chapter examines the development economics evidence base for insights into policy reforms that would benefit struggling areas in the United States. My focus is on improving education, physical and mental health, infrastructure, and institutions. First, consistent with findings on education policy effectiveness, I propose raising the legal minimum dropout age (prospectively to 19), providing better information about the benefits of completing high school, supporting targeted paraprofessional tutoring, and providing family financial incentives for attending school and graduating from high school. Second, to improve health outcomes in struggling areas, the focus is using and building on existing effective health and nutrition programs and services, identifying ways to include more families who are eligible for but not participating in these programs. Moreover, the recent development and behavioral economics evidence base has extended our understanding of the psychological, cognitive, and economic behavioral lives of the poor; the literature highlights the ways that poverty can impede cognitive functioning, with implications for policies to uplift lagging U.S. areas. Third, a review of evidence on the benefits of improving lagging rural and urban area transportation infrastructure points to the likely benefits of improved connectivity for lagging U.S. areas: reversing the legacy of past discriminatory policies, encouraging sector-based clusters, and extending access to high-speed internet. Finally, the chapter highlights the relevance of some cross-cutting themes in development economics, including the high returns to reliable household microdata and the importance of improving institutions to enable more inclusive, substantial, and lasting progress.
O51|The geographical efficiency of education and research: The ranking of U.S. universities|This paper proposes to study the American efficiency of educational diffusion and research productivity following two distinctions: urban vs. rural areas and public vs. private universities. Following this geographical consideration, knowledge diffusion seems to be homogeneous over the American territory, whereas research productivity is more heterogeneous: American research efficiency decreased of 7% points, due to some rural university localizations. Universities in urban areas favor educational quality through high student selection criteria, contrary to those located in more rural areas. Third, public universities present higher educational efficiency, in favoring educational quality over research productivity: the lesser research efficiency of public institutions comes from difficulties in the management of several campuses, by comparison with the private institutions which are all single-campus.

O51|Pipeline Pressures and Sectoral Inflation Dynamics|In a production network, shocks originating in individual sectors do not remain confined to individual sectors but permeate through the pricing chain. The notion of “pipeline pressures” alludes to this cascade effect. In this paper we provide a structural definition of pipeline pressures to inflation and use Bayesian techniques to infer their presence from quarterly U.S. data. We document two insights. (i) Due to price stickiness along the supply chain, we show that pipeline pressures take time to materialize which renders them an important source of inflation persistence. (ii) As we trace their origins to 35 disaggregate sectors, pipeline pressures are documented to be a key source of headline/disaggregated inflation volatility. Finally, we contrast our results to the dynamic factor literature which has traditionally interpreted the comovement of price indices arising from pipeline pressures as aggregate shocks. Our results highlight the role of sectoral shocks – joint with the production architecture – to understand the micro origins of disaggregate/headline inflation persistence/volatility.
O51|A Portrait of U.S. Factoryless Goods Producers|This paper evaluates the U.S. Census Bureau’s most recent data collection efforts to classify business entities that engage in an extreme form of production fragmentation called “factoryless” goods production. “Factoryless” goods-producing entities outsource physical transformation activities while retaining ownership of the intellectual property and control of sales to customers. Responses to a special inquiry on the incidence of purchases of contract manufacturing services in combination with data on production inputs and outputs, intellectual property, and international trade is used to identify and document characteristics of “factoryless” firms in the U.S. economy.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
O51|The Persistent Statistical Structure of the US Input-Output Coefficient Matrices: 1963-2007|The paper finds evidence for the existence of a statistical structure in the US input-output (I-O) coefficient matrices A = f{aij} for 1963-2007. For various aspects of matrices A we find smooth and unimodal empirical frequency distributions (EFD) with a remarkable stability in their functional form for most of the samples. The EFD of all entries, diagonal entries, row sums, and the (left and right) Perron-Frobenius eigenvectors are well described by fat-tailed distributions while the EFD of column sums and eigenvalue moduli are well explained by the normal distribution and the Beta distribution, respectively. The paper provides several economic interpretations of these statistical results based on the recent developments in the I-O analysis and the price of production literature. Our findings question some probabilistic assumptions conventionally adopted in the stochastic I-O analysis literature and call for a statistical approach to the discussion of the structure of I-O matrices.
O51|Immigrants' Genes: Genetic Diversity and Economic Development in the US|We examine the effect of genetic diversity on economic development in the United States. Our estimation strategy exploits that immigrants from different countries of origin differed in their genetic diversity and that these immigrants settled in different regions. Based on a sample of over 2250 counties, we find that increases in genetic diversity of US counties that arose due to immigration during the 19th century had a significant positive effect on US counties' economic development. We also detect a significant positive long-run effect of 19th century immigrants' genetic diversity on contemporaneous measures of income.
O51|To What Extent Can Long-Term Investment in Infrastructure Reduce Inequality?|By reviewing US state-level panel data on infrastructure spending and on per capita income inequality from 1950 to 2010, this paper sets out to test whether there is an empirical link between infrastructure and inequality. Our main result, obtained from panel regressions with both state and time fixed effects, shows that highways and higher education spending growth in a given decade correlates negatively with Gini indices at the end of the decade. Such a finding suggests a causal effect from growth in infrastructure spending to a reduction in inequality, through better access to job and education opportunities. More significantly, this relationship is stronger with inequality at the bottom 40 per cent of the income distribution. In addition, infrastructure expenditures on highways are shown to be more effective at reducing inequality. A counterfactual experiment reveals which US states ended up with a significantly higher bottom Gini coefficient in 2010 that is attributed to underinvestment in infrastructure over the first decade of the 21st century. From a policy making perspective, this paper aims to present innovations in finance for infrastructure investments, for the US, other industrially advanced countries and also for developing economies.
O51|Firm Heterogeneity in Consumption Baskets: Evidence from Home and Store Scanner Data|A growing literature has emphasized the role of Melitz-type firm heterogeneity within sectors in accounting for nominal income inequality. This paper explores the implications of firm heterogeneity for household price indices across the income distribution. Using detailed matched US home and store scanner microdata that allow us to trace the firm size distribution into the consumption baskets of individual households, we present evidence that richer US households source their consumption from on average significantly larger producers of brands within disaggregated product groups compared to poorer US households. We use the microdata to explore alternative explanations, write down a quantitative framework that rationalizes the observed moments, and estimate its parameters to quantify the underlying channels and explore model-based counterfactuals. Our central findings are that larger, more productive firms endogenously sort into catering to the taste of wealthier households, and that this gives rise to asymmetric effects on household price indices. We find that these price index effects significantly amplify observed nominal income inequalities in both the cross-section of households and for changes over time, and that they lead to a significantly more regressive distribution of the gains from international trade.
O51|GDP Growth, Private Debt and Monetary Policy|Economic research has considered Private Debt a determinant of GDP growth for years. By keeping this perspective, the objective of this work is to understand how much of the GDP response to a monetary shock is due to the variation of private debt. This is the marginal contribution of private debt, which we relate to an increase of the aggregate demand. We study the USA, the UK and Germany in the period 1980q1-2015q4. Our approach is based on the comparison of one baseline structural VAR with one counterfactual for each country. The analysis is developed using the two main constituents of private debt: households and corporations debt.
O51|The sources of growth in a technologically progressive economy: the United States, 1899-1941|We develop new aggregate and sectoral Total Factor Productivity (TFP) estimates for the United States between 1899 and 1941 through better coverage of sectors and better-measured labor quality, and find TFPgrowth was lower than previously thought, broadly based across sectors, and strongly variant intertemporally. We then test and reject three prominent claims. First, the 1930s did not have the highest TFP-growth of the twentieth century. Second, TFP-growth was not predominantly caused by four ‘great inventions’. Third, TFPgrowth was not driven indirectly by spillovers from great inventions such as electricity. Instead, the creativedestruction-friendly American innovation system was the main productivity driver
O51|The Global Role of the U.S. Economy: Linkages, Policies and Spillovers|This paper analyzes the role of the United States in the global economy and examines the extent of global spillovers from changes in U.S. growth, monetary and fiscal policies, and uncertainty in its financial markets and economic policies. Developments in the U.S. economy, the world’s largest, have effects far beyond its shores. A surge in U.S. growth could provide a significant boost to the global economy. Tightening U.S. financial conditions—whether due to contractionary U.S. monetary policy or other reasons— could reverberate across global financial markets, with adverse effects on some emerging market and developing economies that rely heavily on external financing. In addition, lingering uncertainty about the course of U.S. economic policy could have an appreciably negative effect on global growth prospects. While the United States plays a critical role in the world economy, activity in the rest of the world is also important for the United States.
O51|Quantity Measurement and Balanced Growth in Multi-Sector Growth Models|Multi-sector models typically rely on a numeraire to aggregate quantities whereas NIPA uses the chain index. For three popular versions of the multi-sector growth model, we provide analytical expressions for the growth of aggregate quantities under both measurement methods and establish that the compound differences are sizeable over long horizons. We show that using the chain index captures more accurately the aggregate effects of secular changes in relative prices. For example, in a standard model of structural transformation, measuring GDP growth with the chain index captures that Baumol's disease reduces welfare growth, which using a numeraire misses.
O51|Structural Change within the Service Sector and the Future of Baumol's Disease|Structural change reduces aggregate productivity growth when it leads to the reallocation of production to industries with low productivity growth. We document that this so-called Baumol's disease considerably reduced productivity growth in the postwar U.S. We capture the effect of Baumol's disease on productivity growth with a novel model of structural change that disaggregates the service sector into services with low and high productivity growth. The data imply that the two service subsectors are substitutes. We find that the substitutability limits how important services with low productivity growth may become, which bounds the future effect of Baumol's disease.
O51|The Sources of Growth in a Technologically Progressive Economy: the United States, 1899-1941|We develop new aggregate and sectoral Total Factor Productivity (TFP) estimates for the United States between 1899 and 1941 through better coverage of sectors and better-measured labor quality, and find TFP-growth was lower than previously thought, broadly based across sectors, and strongly variant intertemporally.

O51|Knowledge spillovers and patent citations: trends in geographic localization, 1976-2015|" This paper examines the trends in geographic localization of knowledge spillovers via patent citations, considering US patents from the period of 1976-2015. Despite accelerating globalization and widespread perception of the ""death of distance,"" our multi-cohort ""matched-sample"" study reveals signi cant and growing localization effects of knowledge spillovers at both intra- and international levels after the 1980s. We also develop a novel network index based on the notion of ""farness,"" which an instrumental variable estimation shows to be a signifi cant and sizable determinant of the observed trends at the state-sector level."
O51|Growth In The Shadows: Effect Of The Shadow Economy On U.S. Economic Growth Over More Than A Century|Taking a long‐term look at U.S. economic growth over 1870–2014, this paper focuses on the spillovers from the shadow or the unofficial economy to growth in the official sector. Shadow activities might spur or retard economic growth depending on their interactions with the formal sector and impacts on the provision of public goods. Nesting the analysis in a standard neoclassical growth model, we use a relatively new time series technique to estimate the short‐run dynamics and long‐run relationship between economic growth and its determinants. Results suggest that prior to World War II (WWII) the shadow economy had a negative effect on economic growth; however, post‐WWII the shadow economy was beneficial for growth. The sanding effect of the shadow economy in the earlier period is especially robust to alternate considerations of possible endogeneity and an alternate set of growth determinants.

O51|Testing R&D-Based Endogenous Growth Models|R&D-based growth models are tested using US data for the period 1953-2014. A general growth model is developed which nests the model varieties of interest. The model implies a cointegrating relationship between multifactor productivity, research intensity, and employment. This relationship is estimated using cointegrated VAR models. The results provide evidence against the widely used fully endogenous variety and in favor of the semi-endogenous variety. Forecasts based on the empirical estimates suggest that the slowdown in US productivity growth will continue. Particularly, the annual long-run growth rate of GDP per worker converges to between zero and 1.1 pct.
O51|Hidden negative aspects of industrialization at the onset of modern economic growth in the U.S|The decrease in nutritional status of the American population during the structural change brought about by the onset of modern economic growth is inferred from the decline in average physical stature for more than a generation beginning with the birth cohorts of the early 1830s. The decline occurred in a dynamic economy characterized by rapid population growth, urbanization, and industrialization. The decline in nutritional status was associated with a rise in both mortality and morbidity. These hitherto hidden negative aspects of rapid industrialization were brought about by rising inequality and a marked increase in real food prices, which induced dietary changes through the substitution away from edibles toward non-edibles. The implication is that the human biological system did not thrive as well as one would theoretically expect in a growing economy.
O51|General Equilibrium Trade Modelling with Canada-US Transportation Costs|Transportation costs are an important topic in international trade, but seldom have researches paid attention to general equilibrium trade modelling with transportation costs and explored their relevant effects. This paper uses different numerical general equilibrium trade model structures to simulate the impacts of transportation costs on both welfare and trade for a Canada-US country pair case. We compare two groups of model structure, Armington assumption models and homogeneous goods models. Within these two groups of models, we also compare balanced trade structures to trade imbalance structures, and production function transportation costs to iceberg transportation costs. Armington goods models generate absolute welfare gains from transportation cost elimination than homogeneous goods models. Welfare gains under balanced trade structures are larger in production function transportation cost scenarios, but are larger in iceberg transportation cost scenario under trade imbalance structures. Canada’s welfare gains with iceberg transportation cost are significantly larger than gains with production function transportation cost. On trade effects, homogeneous goods models generate more export and import gains, balanced trade structures have more trade variations, and iceberg transportation cost generate more trade effects.
O51|Regularities in Prices of Production and the Concentration of Compositions of Capitals|Recent developments in price of production models have proposed a hypothesis on the structure of the input coefficient matrices to explain the empirical near-linearity and monotonicity found in prices as a function of income distribution - the tendency towards zero of subdominant eigenvalues. The objective of this paper is twofold: First, based on the behavior of observed eigenvalues, the paper shows that they cannot explain by their own the regularities found in prices of production. Second, it is shown theoretically and empirically the existence and relevance of an additional force acting on the input matrix and the labor coefficient vector: the concentration of industries' vertically integrated compositions of capital around their average. It is argued that the combined effect of these two factors produces the empirical regularities in relative prices. The tendency of the vertically integrated labor to means of production proportions to cluster around their average reveals the existence of an economic force acting on the structure of technology of observable economies and calls for an explanation. The paper relies on the US 1987- 2007 Input-Output accounts, at the highest disaggregation level (between 370-466 sectors), for the empirical evidence in this paper.
O51|Capital Intensity, Unproductive Activities and the Great Recession of the US Economy|The purpose of this article is to show that the ‘great recession’ of 2007 in the USA is of the classical type with basic features the rising value composition of capital which more than fully offset the rising rate of surplus value giving rise to a falling rate of profit. The tendential fall of the latter, from a point onwards, led to a stagnant mass of real net profits, thereby decreased net investment and eventually impacted on employment. The evolution of capital intensity and the consequences of unproductive activities remain key issues in the discussions of capital accumulation and its periodic ruptures
O51|Are Democratic Regimes Antithetical to Globalization?|In this study we have made an attempt to investigate into the relationship between political regime type (that ranges from authoritarian to democratic) and the extent of globalization, which of late has been considered as a path to development. We have made use of the Democracy index (and its constituent indicators) provided by the Economist Intelligence Unit and the globalization index (and its constituent indicators) of the KOF. Applying canonical correlation analysis on the data we have made an attempt to look into the response of globalization to the quantitative measures of democratic (versus authoritarian) practices of the governments in 116 countries distributed over Asia, Africa, Australia/Oceania, Europe and the Americas. We have also tested the Lee thesis in the context of globalization as a path to development. Our findings indicate that the empirical support to Lee’s thesis if extended to globalization as a path to development is superficial and does not withstand critical analysis. Contrary to Lee’s thesis, democracy promotes globalization. In African countries political discordance (at the national as well as international level) is not much favourable while in the Asian countries, political will, irrespective of regime type, is more or less in concordance with globalization. Therefore, rather illusively, it so appears that democracies thwart development as well as globalization as a means to development by implication, while the reality is very different.
O51|Sources of Income Inequality: A Comparison of Japan and the United States|We compare the sources of income inequality in Japan and the United States. We exploit two longitudinal household surveys to decompose the income inequality in both countries. For Japan, we use Keio Household Panel Survey data and the five latest waves (2009–2013). For the United States, the data comes from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and covers the years 2009, 2011, and 2013. To ensure comparability between the two countries, we restrict our sample to household heads between 35 and 65 years old and currently working. In a first step, we calculate the Gini coefficient of labor income for the two samples. We find that the Gini coefficient of labor income is higher in the United States (0.453) than in Japan (0.329), corroborating well-established previous findings. In a second step, we decompose the income inequality in both countries by using a comparable set of variables. Our results show that differences in the number of years of education and marital status explain the largest part of income inequality in Japan. In the United States, education and working hours are the strongest contributors to unequal income distribution. Finally, when introducing additional, country-specific variables, we find that working for a large company and being an irregular worker are important drivers of inequality in Japan. For the United States, lower wages for African Americans appears to contribute 5%–10% to income inequality.
O51|The growth of US science and technology parks: does proximity to a university matter?|Abstract In this paper, we present a generalized model of US university science and technology parks, and we identify covariates that might serve as target variables not only to perpetuate the growth of existing parks but also to provide information for those nations, regions, and universities starting new parks. Relevant covariates are the distance between the park and the university and if the park was founded during the information and communications technology (ICT) revolution (post-2000).
O51|Keeping up with the Joneses: Other-regarding Preferences and Endogenous Growth|We study a series of sustained growth models in which households' preferences are affected by the consumption of other households as summarized by average consumption. In endogenous growth models, the equilibrium paths involve lower savings and lower growth than the corresponding efficient paths. Both savings and growth are inversely related to the extent of social preferences. In semi-endogenous models, other-regarding preferences have no growth effects, but have positive level effects on the long-run research intensity, because they increase the market size for potential monopolists in the intermediate goods sector. To test the extent to which consumption is other-regarding, we use Consumer Expenditure Survey data: our identification strategy relies on a two-stage estimator that uses the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 as a positive and a negative consumption shocks to top incomes respectively. In the first stage, we use a difference-in-difference approach to exploit the exogenous variation in consumption caused by federal tax reform. We then use the predicted values for average within-cohort consumption by income deciles as an instrument to estimate the extent of social preferences. Our results point toward highly significant long-run `keeping up' effects on the order of 30%.
O51|A Spatial Decomposition of Income Inequality in Chile| P aredes , D., I turra , V. and L ufin , M. A spatial decomposition of income inequality in Chile, Regional Studies . Previous literature identifies the high and persistent income inequality of Chile, but the geographic heterogeneity of the inequality is still unexplored. This lack of discussion encourages spatially blind policy that ignores the interaction between individual and spatial inequality. To evaluate its magnitude, a spatial decomposition at the regional, provincial and county levels is proposed. The decomposition indicates that between 1992 and 2009, 21% of the total inequality is attributable to geographical scale. The results show that spatial inequality is a relevant magnitude to be considered by policy-makers.
O51|Big-Box Retailers and Personal Income Growth in the U.S| This paper addresses a research gap in the literature by investigating the impact of big-box retailers’ presence on personal income growth in U.S. counties between 2000 and 2005, based on neoclassical growth models of cross-country income convergence. Whether big-box retailers have a negative effect on local economic growth has been a permeating question amongst regional developers, policy makers and economists. Walmart’s and Target’s economic impacts are estimated in regards to the degree in which their individual presence affects personal income growth. Different model specifications are applied in the analysis, including spatial models that control for spatial autocorrelation. Results suggest that counties with the presence of both Walmart and Target stores have experienced slower growth in personal income - even after controlling for spatial autocorrelation. Walmart’s individual effect on personal income growth is negative and highly significant. Target’s individual effect is also negative, but statistically insignificant after controlling for spatial dependence.
O51|U.S. Agricultural Export Competitiveness and Export Market Diversification| This paper examines the structural relationship between U.S. agricultural exports, foreign GDP growth, and real exchange rate volatility, and the impact of exogenous shocks on the evolution of export growth to examine the sector's international competitiveness and opportunities for export extensification. The long- and short-run dynamics of export demand are analyzed within the structural cointegrating vectorautoregressive framework. Principal findings are that: 1. Exports of high-value processed agricultural products are more sensitive to changes in foreign income and exchange rate fluctuations than exports of low-value grains and bulk commodities. Specifically, a 10% growth in trade-adjusted GDP across all importing countries leads to a 7.8% increase in U.S. exports of bulk commodities compared to 33% increase in exports of high-value processed commodities. Similarly, a 10% increase in the value of the trade-weighted exchange rate (i.e., an appreciation of the U.S. dollar) reduces bulk exports by 8.4% compared to a whopping 35% decline in high-value processed food exports; 2. In response to exogenous shocks, deviations from the predicted equilibrium level of exports are corrected at a much faster rate for grains and other bulk commodity exports than export of high value commodities. For example, more than 75% of the disequilibrium in aggregate bulk commodity exports is corrected within one year; less than 15% of the disequilibrium in high-value processed exports is corrected within a year. 3. The present concentration of U.S. agricultural commodity exports to a few developed countries is increasingly problematic, U.S. agricultural exports may benefit not only from policies intended to increase trade with existing developing country importers but also from policies that aim to export agricultural commodities to emerging markets. Our paper also highlights the importance of including the long-run relationship when modeling the short-run dynamics.
O51|American colonial incomes, 1650–1774|New data now allow conjectures on the levels of real and nominal incomes in the thirteen American colonies. New England was the poorest region, and the South was the richest. Colonial per capita incomes rose only very slowly, and slowly for five reasons: productivity growth was slow; population in the low-income (but subsistence-plus) frontier grew much faster than that in the high-income coastal settlements; child dependency rates were high and probably even rising; the terms of trade was extremely volatile, presumably suppressing investment in export sectors; and the terms of trade rose very slowly, if at all, in the North, although faster in the South. All of this checked the growth of colony-wide per capita income after a 17th century boom. The American colonies led Great Britain in purchasing power per capita from 1700, and possibly from 1650, until 1774, even counting slaves in the population. That is, average purchasing power in America led Britain early, when Americans were British. The common view that American per capita income did not overtake that of Britain until the start of the 20th century appears to be off the mark by two centuries or longer.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
O51|Firm growth and knowledge flows: comparative analysis between defence and civil areas|In this paper, we seek to understand how technological duality influences the growth of companies. Since the end of the Cold War, defense budgets are strongly discussed. In this context, the dual policy (convergence between civil and military areas) is presented as an optimization strategy of the defense budgets. Nevertheless, the 1990s are also characterized by a wave of defense restructuring in the United States around large private companies. Therefore, we choose to study the results of duality for these groups as they are more at stake. In order to do so, we use structural analysis tools as a way of understanding duality as the relocation of defense activities in the?innovation system center. As a result, we show that the duality of defense activities is specific because it has an opposite effect on centrality of civil activities on firms? growth. JEL Codes: B52, C55, L64, O33, O51
O51|Oil prices and the global economy: Is it different this time around?|The recent plunge in oil prices has brought into question the generally accepted view that lower oil prices are good for the US and the global economy. In this paper, using a quarterly multi-country econometric model, we first show that a fall in oil prices lowers interest rates and inflation in most countries, and increases global real equity prices. The effects on real output are positive, although they take longer to materialize (around 4 quarters after the shock). We then re-examine the effects of low oil prices on the US economy over different sub-periods using monthly observations on real oil prices, real equity prices and real dividends. We confirm the perverse positive relationship between oil and equity prices over the period since the 2008 financial crisis highlighted in the recent literature, but show that this relationship has been unstable when considered over the longer time period of 1946–2016. In contrast, we find a stable negative relationship between oil prices and real dividends which we argue is a better proxy for economic activity (as compared to equity prices). On the supply side, the effects of lower oil prices differ widely across the different oil producers, and could be perverse initially, as some of the major oil producers try to compensate their loss of revenues by raising production. Taking demand and supply adjustments to oil price changes as a whole, we conclude that oil markets equilibrate but rather slowly, with large episodic swings between low and high oil prices.
O51|Sources of Canadian economic growth|We apply modern ideas-oriented growth accounting, based on the semi-endogenous growth theory of Jones (2002), to compare the sources of Canadian and US economic growth between 19812014. This framework allows us to distinguish between transition dynamics and steady state growth as well as quantify their respective contributions. We find that the bulk of the 1.1 percentage points total average Canadian growth rate of output per hour has been due to transitional factors, mainly capital intensity and domestic human capital growth driven by educational attainment. The growth in excess ideas (total ideas growth minus steady state growth) has contributed a small share of 0.06 percentage points. Two features stand out in comparison to the US growth experience over the same period. First, over a full percentage point of the average US growth of 1.64% is due to excess ideas growth. Second, the constant growth view that reconciles large sources of transitional growth with relatively stable average growth is not supported in Canada. We estimate a relatively low elasticity of output with respect to world research effort as the reason behind the small share of R&D-oriented sources of Canadian growth.
O51|Business Dynamism and Economic Growth: U.S. Regional Evidence|We document empirical evidence on the determinants of U.S. regional growth over the last 25 years, with a special attention to the role of entrepreneurial activity or `business dynamism'. The main data source is the Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS) released by the U.S. Census Bureau. The key findings are: i) business entry and exit rates are similarly distributed across states, ii) neither entry nor exit rates have had a significant impact on regional growth, iii) higher business density results in faster regional growth, iv) entry rates have fallen over time and the states with greater business detrending have had weaker economic growth, v) states where entry and exit show substantial comovement (business churning) tend to grow faster, especially after 2007, vi) state-level population growth has no substantial e ffect on regional growth, and vii) the convergence hypothesis holds across the states of the U.S.
O51|Private Debt and GDP: A Short-Run Perspective|Mainstream economic research regards private debt as a determinant of GDP growth in the longrun. Levine (2005) surveys in details this branch of literature and explains the channels by which debt fuels growth. In this paper we switch the focus from the long to the short-run and study whether private debt has a significant impact on GDP growth in the short-run too. Our aim is to understand whether policy measures aimed to reduce the cost of private debt may favor a quick increase of the economic activity.
O51|International Trade and Economic Growth: Causality Relations Within NAFTA|This research explores empirically the causal link between international trade and economic growth within a free trade area. In particular, we use data from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to estimate the causal relationship between economic growth and trade flows, but isolating trade within the bloc from trade with the rest of the world. The period considered is 1960-2014. Our analysis follows three strategies: we investigate Granger causality on a one-country and two-countries basis and then we include the three countries in the same framework, following the identification strategy proposed by Arellano and Bover (1995). We find that both exports cause growth and growth drives exports. This goes in the same direction as that one followed in the literature. However, under the third strategy, we do not find conclusive evidence that supports the idea that trade within a trade bloc is more important for growth than trade with the rest of the world. Moreover, the long run effect is more significant for growth during the whole period than when NAFTA has been active. Regarding the impact of growth on exports, we find that production is important for enhancing exports within NAFTA in both short- and long-run but when the whole period is considered.
O51|A Straightforward Analysis of Sector Portfolios in the US Stock Market|This research focuses on analysing the US stock market in recent years –specifically the US stock market, that is, Dow Jones index, and six sector portfolios (Financials, Energy, Technology, Health Care, Consumer Discretionary and Telecommunications)-. All sectors achieve higher returns than expected according to the CAPM (except the “Consumer Discretionary” sector). Moreover, this fact is confirmed with the Security Market Line (SML). Thus, these results help investors to choose the most suitable sectors in the investment horizon. Therefore, this research includes relevant implications to portfolio managers to reduce the risk and maximize the return.
O51|The Model of Innovative Activities Management in a Competitive Market Conditions|Market competition in all sectors of the economy calls for maximum use, activation, optimal implementation of the results of scientific and technical progress- innovations. This is necessary not discrete implementation of innovative projects and development of a new system of interaction of innovative processes in all areas. Purpose of the article is modeling of innovative activities’ processes management and development of recommendations to improve its productivity. The authors analyzed the theoretical and methodological aspects of innovative activities’ implementation, revealed the structure of innovative activities and the parameters of its implementation. A mathematical model for innovative activities’ managing, defining the hierarchy of its connections is proposed. This article is intended for regional leaders, top managers of enterprises, scientists and researchers involved in the innovative development of an economic sector
O51|Foreign Direct Investments and Gross Domestic Product Development in USA, European Union and China (1995-2014)|European Union (EU) and China established diplomatic relations in 1975, and now became mutually indispensable economic partners, presenting both an opportunity and challenge. During that time, after the first market reforms which were introduced in 1978, China has transitioned from a predominantly agricultural to industrial and service-oriented economy. On 11 December 2001, China also became the 143rd member of the World Trade Organization. The aim of this research is to quantitatively compare the US, EU and Chinese gross domestic product from 1995 to 2014, the US and Chinese outward Foreign direct investments (FDI) from 1995 to 2013, and analyse the impact of the exponentially rising Chinese investments in the EU. We have found that while the US economy experienced a regression in general, and exhibited outward FDI exponential decrease in particular, the Chinese outward FDI sustained an exponential growth. There is also possible to expect continue of exponentially rising economic investment of China in the EU. The Chinese investment in the EU is estimated to peak during the next decade, when China will become by far the foremost economic partner of the EU.
O51|Mobility of knowledge and local innovation activity|This paper studies the diffusion of knowledge and its consequences for local innovation production. In a common framework, we analyze the geographic reach of different channels of knowledge flows that thus far have been studied separately in the literature. To jointly estimate these flows, we develop and apply novel econometric techniques appropriate to the nature of the data. We find that geographic along with technological proximity to be more essential to the operation of market than to non-market channels of knowledge flows. External accessible disembodied knowledge has a strong positive effect on local innovation production that is larger than that of embodied knowledge.
O51|Econometric general equilibrium modeling|The point of departure for the study of the impact of energy and environmental policies is the neo-classical theory of economic growth formulated by Cass (1965) and Koopmans (1967). The long-run properties of economic growth models are independent of energy and environmental policies. However, these policies affect capital accumulation and rates of productivity growth that determine the intermediate-run trends that are important for policy evaluation.
O51|The US economy since the crisis: slow recovery and secular stagnation|The US economy has experienced a slowdown in its long-term growth and job creation that predates the Great Recession. The stagnation of output growth stems mainly from the depressing effects of rising inequality on aggregate demand, while both increased inequality and the delinkage of employment from output have their roots in profound structural changes to the US industrial structure and international position. Stagnation tendencies were temporarily offset by debt-financed household spending before the financial crisis, after which households became more financially constrained. Meanwhile, fiscal policy has shifted toward austerity while business investment has failed to keep up with the boom in corporate profits in spite of low interest rates. Slower US growth in turn exacerbates the global slowdown as it implies smaller injections of demand into global export markets.

El modelo de Insumo-Producto analiza la interdependencia sectorial en tales estructuras. En este trabajo, identificamos una red económica en una tabla IP trilateral norteamericana. Utilizamos una medida de densidad como indicador de la integración regional. Nuestros resultados muestran que la economía de los Estados Unidos determina el perfil de la estructura de Norteamérica. Canadá y México mantienen escasas relaciones directas y su pertenencia a la región ayuda a entender sus economías.
O51|The Outlook for U.S. Labor-Quality Growth|Over the past 15 years, labor-quality growth has been very strong—defying nearly all earlier projections—and has added around 0.5 percentage points to an otherwise modest U.S. productivity picture. Going forward, labor quality is likely to add considerably less and may even be a drag on productivity growth in the medium term. Using a variety of methods, we project that potential labor-quality growth in the longer run (7 to 10 years out) is likely to fall in the range of 0.1 to 0.25 percent per year. In the medium term, labor-quality growth could be lower or even negative, should employment rates of low-skilled workers make a cyclical rebound towards pre-recession levels. The main uncertainties in the longer run are whether the secular decline in employment of low-skilled workers continues and whether the Great Recession pickup in educational attainment represents the start of a new boom or is simply a transitory reaction to a poor economy.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
O51|R&D and productivity in the US and the EU: Sectoral specificities and differences in the crisis|Using data on the US and EU top R&D spenders from 2004 until 2012, this paper investigates the sources of the US/EU productivity gap. We find robust evidence that US firms have a higher capacity to translate R&D into productivity gains (especially in the high-tech macro sector), and this contributes to explaining the higher productivity of US firms. Conversely, EU firms are more likely to achieve productivity gains through capital-embodied technological change, at least in the medium- and low-tech macro sectors. Our results also show that the US/EU productivity gap has worsened during the crisis period, as the EU companies have been more affected by the economic crisis in their capacity to translate R&D investments into productivity. Based on these findings, we make a case for a learning-based and selective R&D funding, which, instead of purely aiming at stimulating higher R&D expenditures, works on improving the firms' capabilities to transform R&D into productivity gains.
O51|Temperature and Growth: A Panel Analysis of the United States|We document that seasonal temperatures have significant and systematic effects on the U.S. economy, both at the aggregate level and across a wide cross section of economic sectors. This effect is particularly strong for the summer: a 1oF increase in the average summer temperature is associated with a reduction in the annual growth rate of state‐level output of 0.15 to 0.25 percentage points. We combine our estimates with projected increases in seasonal temperatures and find that rising temperatures could reduce U.S. economic growth by up to one‐third over the next century.
O51|The Productivity Impact of R&D Investment: A Comparison between the EU and the US|Using data on the US and EU top R&D spenders from 2004 until 2012, this paper investigates the sources of the US/EU productivity gap. We find robust evidence that US firms have a higher capacity to translate R&D into productivity gains (especially in the high-tech industries), and this contributes to explaining the higher productivity of US firms. Conversely, EU firms are more likely to achieve productivity gains through capital-embodied technological change at least in medium and low-tech sectors. Our results also show that the US/EU productivity gap has worsened during the crisis period, as the EU companies have been more affected by the economic crisis in their capacity to translate R&D investments into productivity. Based on these findings, we make a case for a learning-based and selective R&D funding, which – instead of purely aiming at stimulating higher R&D expenditures – works on improving the firms' capabilities to transform R&D into productivity gains.
O51|Effect of Smoking and other Economic Variables on Wages in the Euro Area|The smoking effects on wages has been examined in this work using different econometric methodologies with the use of European Community Household Panel (ECHP) datasets. We employ econometric tools like Instrumental Variable technique, Heckman correction factor, Endogenous Switching and matching estimates. The initial results from regression estimates (OLS and IV methods) revealed that the wage gap between smokers and non-smokers ranges 1% to 22.7%. Moreover, endogenous switching and matching estimator also showed a negative average treatment effect of approximately 47% and 4.3% to 6.9% respectively. Thus smokers observed less wage effects is explained in part by real effects on their health status and a measure of unobserved preferences.
O51|A test of the Behavioral versus the Rational model of Persuasion in Financial Advertising|We present a test of the behavioral versus the rational model of advertising in the financial market. We analyze the Granger-causality relationship existing between Comit stock market index and advertising of financial products and services from the most important daily published financial newspaper in Italy. We run the test for both the risky and non-risky advertising, finding that the behavioral model of advertising is supported when risky financial products and services are considered, while the rational model is true for the non-risky. We ascribe this result to the dual process of reasoning: When investors evaluate the decision to buy risky nancial products and services, they activate the automatic, rapid decision making process. The behavioral model of advertising copes with it and provides an advertising strategy that responds to market evolutions. When non-risky financial products and services are considered, a di erent mental process, requiring slow and sequential reasoning, operates, compatibly with a rational decision making process.
O51|Business Dynamism and Economic Growth: U.S. Regional Evidence|We document empirical evidence linking regional growth in the United States over the last 25 years with entrepreneurial activity, or `business dynamism'. The main data source is the Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS) released by the US Census Bureau. We uncover a new stylised fact: across US states, it is not the level but rather the change in business entry rate that has a significant positive relationship with regional growth. Specifically, those states that have experienced a relatively large decline in the entry rate also have had weaker economic growth. Besides, our research confirms earlier found stylised facts such as the high correlation between entry and exit rates, and the convergence hypothesis which holds across the states. We conduct a number of robustness checks to establish these new and old stylised facts and conditional correlations in the BDS data.
O51|The State of American Entrepreneurship: New Estimates of the Quality and Quantity of Entrepreneurship for 32 US States, 1988-2014|Assessing the state of American entrepreneurship requires not simply counting the quantity but also the initial quality of new ventures. Combining comprehensive business registries and predictive analytics, we present estimates of entrepreneurial quantity and quality from 1988-2014. Rather than a secular pattern of declining business dynamism, our quality-adjusted measures follow a cyclical pattern sensitive to economic and capital market conditions. Consistent with the role of investment cycles as a driver of high-growth entrepreneurship, our results highlight the role of economic and institutional conditions as a driver of both initial entrepreneurial quality and the scaling of new ventures over time.
O51|Trends in the distribution of income between labor and capital: Factors, consequences and problems of adjustment|Inverse cyclical relations of trends in distribution of GDP between labor and capital components of value added (between compensation of employees, on the one hand, and gross operating surplus plus gross mixed income, on the other hand) to the trends in supply of labor and capital in the economy are elaborated in the article. Long waves and globalization influence on the economic policy of the USA and on personal income distribution in the country as well as economic, social and political consequences of such distribution are subjects of in-depth analysis. Adjustment of income distribution is presented in the article as a key problem to be solved by economics and form a part of the economic strategy adequate to the realities of the 21st century.
O51|Boosting productivity through greater small business dynamism in Canada|Small business dynamism is a feature of an SME sector that contributes to overall productivity growth, not an end in itself. Such dynamism increases productivity growth by reallocating resources towards more productive firms and strengthening the diffusion of new technologies. Small business dynamism in Canada has declined in recent decades, as in other OECD countries, but overall it remains in the middle of the range, with some indicators above average and others below. Framework economic policies are generally supportive of small business dynamism, especially labour regulation, but there is scope to reduce regulatory barriers to product market competition. Canada has many programmes to support small businesses. Some of the largest programmes are not well focused on reducing market failures. Focusing support more on reducing clear market failures would increase the contribution of these programmes to productivity growth and living standards. This would likely entail redirecting support from small businesses in general to start-ups and young firms with innovative projects, which would boost small business dynamism. This Working Paper relates to the 2016 OECD Economic Survey of Canada (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-canada.htm) Augmenter la productivité en favorisant le dynamisme des petites entreprises au Canada Le dynamisme des petites entreprises n’est pas une fin en soi, mais un élément du secteur des PME qui concourt à la progression globale de la productivité. Il favorise les gains de productivité en redistribuant les ressources vers les entreprises les plus efficientes et en renforçant la diffusion des nouvelles technologies. Au Canada comme dans les autres pays de l’OCDE, le dynamisme des petites entreprises a été moindre ces dernières décennies, mais il reste dans une position médiane, certains indicateurs étant supérieurs à la moyenne de l’OCDE et d’autres inférieurs. Si le cadre de politique économique lui est en général propice, en particulier la réglementation du travail, il existe une marge de réduction des obstacles réglementaires à la concurrence sur les marchés de produits. Alors que de nombreux programmes ont vocation à aider les petites entreprises, certains des plus importants ne ciblent pas bien les défaillances du marché. En les axant davantage sur l’atténuation des dysfonctionnements manifestes, on ferait davantage contribuer ces programmes à la progression de la productivité et du niveau de vie. Il faudrait probablement pour cela réorienter l’aide des petites entreprises en général vers les start-ups et les entreprises de création récente dotées de projets innovants, ce qui donnerait une impulsion à ce segment de l'économie. Ce Document de travail se rapporte à l’Étude économique de l’OCDE du Canada 2016 (www.oecd.org/fr/eco/etudes/etude-economique-canada.htm)

Au Canada comme dans les autres pays de l’OCDE, le dynamisme des petites entreprises a été moindre ces dernières décennies, mais il reste dans une position médiane, certains indicateurs étant supérieurs à la moyenne de l’OCDE et d’autres inférieurs. Si le cadre de politique économique lui est en général propice, en particulier la réglementation du travail, il existe une marge de réduction des obstacles réglementaires à la concurrence sur les marchés de produits. Alors que de nombreux programmes ont vocation à aider les petites entreprises, certains des plus importants ne ciblent pas bien les défaillances du marché. En les axant davantage sur l’atténuation des dysfonctionnements manifestes, on ferait davantage contribuer ces programmes à la progression de la productivité et du niveau de vie. Il faudrait probablement pour cela réorienter l’aide des petites entreprises en général vers les start-ups et les entreprises de création récente dotées de projets innovants, ce qui donnerait une impulsion à ce segment de l'économie. Ce Document de travail se rapporte à l’Étude économique de l’OCDE du Canada 2016 (www.oecd.org/fr/eco/etudes/etude-economique-canada.htm)
O51|The Historical “Roots” of U.S. Energy Price Shocks: Supplemental Results|Sustained energy price increases in the United States have preceded declines in economic activity as far back as 1890. This finding applies to two different historical GDP data sets. It suggests a much longer national experience with rising energy prices that began well before the period after World War Two. This problem emerged well before the US transition towards petroleum products when coal was an important energy source. This relationship varies with the state of the economy and appears less evident during some periods, as in the years following the 1929 stock market crash.

O51|Self-employment effects on regional growth: a bigger bang for a buck?|Abstract This paper estimates the net employment spillovers from changes in self-employment (SE) and compares them to spillovers from changes in wage and salary (WS) employment using US county-level data. Our findings offer a policy-relevant perspective on the relative importance of SE and WS employment and help bridge two entrepreneurship research traditions. Our estimated effects of self-employment, at the margin, are substantially larger than identical effects of paid employment. This supports the literature that points to a special role played by self-employed businesses in economic growth. At the same time, the little attention given to SE as a potential engine of growth among policymakers and scholars can be explained, at least in part, by the relatively small total economic impact of self-employment stemming from its small share of the economy. In an austere fiscal environment, however, spending a dollar to stimulate SE is likely to have greater returns as opposed to stimulating WS employment, assuming the costs of adding one SE and one WS job are comparable.
O51|Entrepreneurial and Wage and Salary Employment Response to Economic Conditions Across the Rural-Urban Continuum|In this paper, we explore how national economic trends in a set of industries that compose local economies and growth in nearby metropolitan areas affect local employment growth in different tiers of the urban-rural hierarchy, paying close attention to the effects of urban proximity. The results of our county-level analyses reveal heterogeneous responses. Favorable economic changes due to a fast-growing local industry composition have the largest positive impact on self-employment growth in small metropolitan areas and the smallest positive impact in rural counties. Self-employment in rural counties is fostered by growth in nearby small MSAs and is hampered by growth in nearby large MSAs. In micropolitan counties, there are no significant negative effects, whereas positive (or spread) effects are detected originating only from small and medium MSAs but not from large MSAs. In urban counties, growth in a nearby large MSA is not related to local self-employment growth in the lower tiers of the urban hierarchy.
O51|Firm patenting activity, metropolitan innovative environment and their effects on business survival in a high-tech industry|This paper distinguishes between internal (produced within the firm) and external (produced by other firms) knowledge and studies the effects of both knowledge types on survival in a cohort of computer and electronic product manufacturing companies started in 1991 in the continental US metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). Estimation results suggest that innovative companies face lower hazard but this effect seems to be driven by company’s initial characteristics, as producing more knowledge measured by successful patent applications does not translate into a higher likelihood of survival. In contrast, an innovative environment decreases survival likelihood in the whole sample, yet this result appears to be driven by non-patenting establishments. In the subset of non-patenting firms an innovative environment has a strong negative effect on survival whereas no significant relationship is identified in the subset of innovative firms.
O51|How to Tell the History of Business Ethics|The history of U.S. business ethics and CSR exhibits some key normative continuities and stability. I argue that these normative continuities and stability are underlain by moral background discontinuities and variation. The former I call “first-order” stability and the latter I call “second-order” variation. The second-order or moral background level is where the action is—at least, the action that sheds most light on our understanding of society, morality, and the moral foundations of capitalist societies. Next, I consider one facet of the moral background that might be of special interest to business ethics and CSR scholars: the demarcation of morality. How are boundaries between moral and non-moral things drawn? How are they institutionalized and policed? How do they vary across time and place? However, I also show why these empirical questions are conceptually trickier than they may appear at first sight.
O51|The Impact of Research and Development on Economic Growth and Productivity in the U.S. States|Research and development (R&D) has a large effect on both state output and total factor productivity in the long run. Our estimates for the private sector of the U.S. states from 1963 to 2007 show that the R&D elasticity averages 0.056â€“0.143. The implied returns to state Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from R&D spending are 82â€“211%. There are also positive R&D spillovers, with 70â€“80% of the total returns accruing to other states. We also find that states with more human capital have higher own- and other-R&D elasticities, and those in lowest tier of economic development have the least own-state R&D elasticity but the highest other-R&D elasticity. In addition, we find that the positive effect of R&D spillovers across states is larger when we consider R&D spillovers across states based on economic similarity of R&D across sectors.
O51|The Industry Origins of Canada's Weaker Labour Productivity Performance and the Role of Structural Adjustment in the Post-2000 Period|This article examines how much of the slowdown in labour productivity growth observed in Canada's business sector after 2000 was due to weaker productivity growth within industries and how much was due to structural adjustment. The analysis makes use of a decomposition method that differs from many of the standard decomposition approaches commonly found in the literature and allows for the contributions of changes in the importance of individual industries to be calculated. The approach reveals that the post-2000 slowdown was attributable entirely to weaker productivity growth within industries and that structural adjustment had a slight mitigating effect on the slowdown. Lower productivity growth within three industries - manufacturing; finance, insurance and real estate; and mining, oil and gas - accounted for all of the slowdown in business sector labour productivity growth in the 2000s.
O51|Explaining the Gap between Productivity and Median Wage Growth in Canada, 1976-2014|Canadian labour is more productive than ever before, but there is a pervasive sense among Canadians that the living standards of the 'middle class' have been stagnating. Indeed, between 1976 and 2014, median real hourly earnings grew by only 0.09 per cent per year, compared to labour productivity growth of 1.12 per cent per year. We decompose this 1.03 percentage-point growth gap into four components: rising earnings inequality; changes in employer contributions to social insurance programs; rising relative prices for consumer goods; and a decline in labour's share of aggregate income. Our main result is that rising earnings inequality accounts for half the 1.03 percentage-point gap, with a decline in labour's income share and a deterioration of labour's purchasing power accounting for the remaining half. Further analysis of the inequality component reveals that real wage growth in recent decades has been fastest at the top and at the bottom of the earnings distribution, with relative stagnation in the middle. Our findings are consistent with a 'hollowing out of the middle' story, rather than a 'super-rich pulling away from everyone else' story.
O51|Decomposing Multifactor Productivity Growth in Canada by Industry and Province, 1997-2014|Between 1997 and 2014, multifactor productivity (MFP) in Canada's business sector industries grew at an annual rate of 0.02 per cent per year - essentially zero. In this article, we decompose aggregate MFP growth into contributions by industry and province. Two sets of results are presented: one based on the generalized exactly additive decomposition (GEAD) and one based on the CSLS decomposition. The two decomposition methods lead to very different conclusions. The GEAD suggests that the reallocation of inputs to the mining and oil and gas extraction industry in the oil-rich provinces were the primary drivers of MFP growth in Canada while the manufacturing sector, concentrated in Ontario and Quebec, dragged MFP growth down. The CSLS decomposition suggests precisely the opposite: mining and oil and gas was the main hindrance to Canada's MFP performance while manufacturing was the major driver of MFP growth. The disagreement between the two methods is primarily attributable to the fact that the large increase in commodity prices (especially oil prices) over the 1997-2014 period increases the mining and oil and gas industry's contribution to MFP growth according to the GEAD while the CSLS decomposition does not treat such relative price effects as contributors to productivity growth.
O51|Partial versus Total Factor Productivity Measures: An Assessment of their Strengths and Weaknesses|A partial productivity measure relates output to a single input. Total factor productivity (or TFP) relates an index of output to a composite index of all inputs. This article reviews the strengths and weaknesses of each type of productivity measure from theoretical and methodological perspectives. Different productivity measures may be useful for different analytical purposes, and no single measure provides a complete picture of an industry's productivity performance. We argue for a balanced, context-appropriate approach to productivity analysis that incorporates both productivity measures.
O51|The Human Development Index in Canada: Ranking the Provinces and Territories Internationally, 2000-2014|We develop internationally comparable estimates of the Human Development Index (HDI) for the Canadian provinces and territories over the 2000-2014 period. The HDI is a composite index composed of three dimensions (life expectancy, education and income) measured by four indicators (life expectancy at birth, average years of education, expected years of schooling and GNI per capita). We first replicate the Canadian estimates from the most recent Human Development Report (HDR) using data from Statistics Canada. Next, we generate estimates for the provinces and territories following the same methodology and using the same Canadian data sources. We make these estimates internationally comparable by scaling each province or territory’s estimate to Canada’s in the most recent HDR. This allows the provinces and territories to be ranked in the most recent HDR international rankings for all four component variables as well as the overall HDI. The highest HDI score in 2014 among the provinces and territories belongs to Alberta, which would be fourth in the international rankings, while the lowest ranking region is Nunavut, which would be in 46th place. Overall, our report highlights the diverse human development experiences of Canadians that are concealed by Canada’s overall HDI.
O51|Labour Productivity and the Distribution of Real Earnings in Canada, 1976 to 2014|Canadian labour is more productive than ever before, but there is a pervasive sense among Canadians that the living standards of the 'middle class' have been stagnating. Indeed, between 1976 and 2014, median real hourly earnings grew by only 0.09 per cent per year, compared to labour productivity growth of 1.12 per cent per year. We decompose this 1.03 percentage-point growth gap into four components: rising earnings inequality; changes in employer contributions to social insurance programs; rising relative prices for consumer goods, which reduces workers' purchasing power; and a decline in labour's share of aggregate income. Our main result is that rising earnings inequality accounts for half the 1.03 percentagepoint gap, with a decline in labour's income share and a deterioration of labour's purchasing power accounting for the remaining half. Employer social contributions played no role. Further analysis of the inequality component reveals that real wage growth in recent decades has been fastest at the top and at the bottom of the earnings distribution, with relative stagnation in the middle. Our findings are consistent with a 'hollowing out of the middle' story, rather than a 'super-rich pulling away from everyone else' story.
O51|New Evidence on the Canada-U.S. ICT Investment Gap, 1976-2014 Selected OECD Countries, 1986-2013|Productivity growth results in part from investment in information and communications technologies (ICT). To better understand Canada’s poor productivity growth relative to the United States since 2000, this report provides a detailed examination of ICT investment trends in the two countries. The report finds that real ICT investment in the total economy in Canada has yet to recover from the 2008-2009 recession, while it has not suffered the same fate south of the border. Between 2008 and 2014 real ICT investment in Canada fell 1.0 per cent per year, compared to a 2.9 per cent per year increase in the United States. The gap was even greater for real ICT investment per job, down 1.8 per cent per year in Canada versus a 2.8 per cent annual increase in the United States. The weaker ICT investment growth in Canada resulted in a large increase in the Canada-US ICT investment gap from 31.6 percentage points to 43.7 points, as nominal ICT investment per job fell from 68.4 per cent of the US level in 2008, the highest value ever achieved, to 56.3 per cent in 2014.

O51|Partial versus Total Factor Productivity: Assessing Resource Use in Natural Resource Industries in Canada|A partial productivity measure relates output to a single input. Total factor productivity (or TFP) relates an index of output to a composite index of all inputs. This report discusses the strengths and weaknesses of each type of productivity measure from theoretical and methodological perspectives. Different productivity measures may be useful for different analytical purposes, and no single measure provides a complete picture of an industry's productivity performance. The report then presents estimates of TFP and a suite of partial productivity measures for a set of natural resource-related industries in Canada. The three forestry products industries and the crop and animal production industry exhibited the best productivity performance over the 1990-2012 period across a variety of productivity measures, while oil and gas extraction and mining experienced the worst productivity performance.
O51|A vision of the growth process in a technologically progressive economy: the United States, 1899-1941|We develop new aggregate and sectoral Total Factor Productivity (TFP) estimates for the United States between 1899 and 1941 through better coverage of sectors and better measured labor quality, and show TFP-growth was lower than previously thought, broadly based across sectors, strongly variant intertemporally, and consistent with many diverse sources of innovation. We then test and reject three prominent claims. First, the 1930s did not have the highest TFP-growth of the twentieth century. Second, TFP-growth was not predominantly caused by four leading sectors. Third, TFP-growth was not caused by a ‘yeast process’ originating in a dominant technology such as electricity.
O51|Digitization and Productivity: Measuring Cycles of Technological Progress|This paper investigates the dynamics of technological progress as the underlying trend in productivity growth. We employ a multi-factor approach to measuring the long-term productivity trend, where this trend encompasses everything that permanently raises output per hour
O51|Structural Funds And Romanian Neets 2007-2013|If the entire class of young NEETs would be integrated into work, Romania's GDP would increase by 2%. Faulty implementation of SOP HRD 2007-2013 failed to combat the economic crisis. Thus, at the end of 2013 Romania had over 400,000 young people NEET. In addition to short-term effect of inactivation of the potential workforce, due to aging demographics, the effects of the lack of activity of this category will create a series of negative problems in the social contributions sector. Romania is offered another chance by the Youth Guarantee Scheme and by the Human Capital Operational Programme 2014-2020, but the country must prove having learned from previous experience. The 2007-2013 period shown that good planning in terms of indicators far not guarantee success. Effective implementation of projects and supporting project beneficiaries will sustainable reduce the number of NEETs.
O51|Manufacturing And Development In Countries And Areas Of Africa, 2000-2010|In this study we analyze the evolution of economic development in 6 areas and 38 countries of Africa for the period 2000-2010. We find that industrialization in Africa shows little increase with an average value added of Manufacturing per head, at constant prices, of only 278 in year 2000 and 282 in year 2010, clearly below World average. Northern Africa and Southern Africa are the areas with the highest levels in Africa, but with relatively low values, below 1000 Dollars per head, in comparison with World average. North West Africa and Eastern Africa have low values although with a positive evolution for that period, while Sahel-Central Africa and North East Africa show very low values and stagnation for the period 2000-2010. We find that it is of great importance to foster the educational level of human capital, health assistance, infrastructures and conditions to favour industrial development and tourism in many countries and areas of Africa. As seen in this and other studies, empirical evidence shows the great importance of Kaldor´s views on the positive impact of industrialization on economic development. We estimate an econometric model that shows the positive impact of manufacturing on economic development of African countries. International cooperation through foreign investment and official development aid is interesting but we must have into account other ways of international cooperation like private foundations, foreign trade of goods and tourism, accordingly to Guisan, Aguayo and Exposito(2015), and other studies that quantify and analyze several ways of international cooperation to foster socio-economic development in low income countries.
O51|Manufacturing And Development In Countries And Areas Of America, 2000-2010|We analyze the evolution of manufacturing and development in 22 American countries for the period 2000-2010, following our previous studies of the period 1980-1999. We find some advance in industrial development of several American countries for the period of study, but unfortunately we may notice stagnation and even diminution in some developing countries. Achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) requires that international cooperation play a role to foster industrialization in many countries with a low level of manufacturing activities, given the positive impact of industry on non industrial development. The paper contributes to show empirical evidence in favour of Kaldor´s perspective on the positive role of industrialization.
O51|Employment Change in the U.S. Census Divisions from 2000 through the Great Recession and Current Recovery|This paper takes a geographic look at how industry employment differed across the nine census divisions from 2000 to 2014. We use dynamic shift-share analysis with a focus on NAICS supersectors to compare and contrast differing industry performance across regions of the U.S. before and after the Great Recession. The dynamic method is extended to a graphical version that facilitates comparisons across regions. The graphs highlight the capability of dynamic shift-share to provide annual information on differences in performance and present decomposition into the separate causes of these differences in terms of the shift-share components. Further graphical analysis allows a closer look at the industry contributions to employment growth in each year.
O51|Manufacturing And Development In Countries And Areas Of Asia-Pacific, 2000-2010|We analyze the evolution of manufacturing and development in 30 countries or territories of Asia-Pacific, for the period 2000-2010, following our previous studies of the period 1980-1999. We find importance advance in industrial development of several countries for the period of study, particularly in the cases of the two most populated countries: China and India. Achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) requires international cooperation to play a role in order to foster industrialization in many countries with a low level of manufacturing activities, given the positive impact of industry on non industrial development. The paper contributes to show empirical evidence in favour of Kaldor´s perspective on the positive role of industrialization.
O51|The contractionary effects of tax shocks on productivity: An empirical and theoretical analysis|I analyze the effects of tax policy changes on US Total Factor Productivity. VAR estimates show that permanent and exogenous tax increases have strong, permanent, and negative effects on TFP which represent about 80% of change in output following the tax increase. I then build a DSGE model which has learning-by-doing and endogenous TFP evolution. The benchmark model is able to replicate the empirical impulse responses. However, when I calibrate the model as in the literature, the effect of taxes on TFP is substantially less elastic than in the data. I argue that this divergence may arise because tax changes labeled as exogenous can give spurious results or because of a mis-specified model.
O51|Leaders and followers: Perspectives on the Nordic model and the economics of innovation|What kinds of social and economic systems are most conducive to innovation? We formulate a simple model in which countries can close the gap with the technological leader, but where the cost of doing so may be so high that the country chooses to remain laggards. Observed disparities in productivity may be the result of a recognition that the cost of closing the gap exceeds benefit and there may therefore exist an international equilibrium in which there are leaders and followers. Even if it is granted that the United States is the leader and Scandinavia are followers, there are theoretical grounds for arguing that the Nordic model may in fact be better for innovation, suggesting that if the US adopted some of the Nordic institutions, innovations would be higher, and societal welfare would be improved even more.

O51|The growth effects of R&D spending in the EU: A meta-analysis|"In this paper we conduct a meta-analysis to examine the link between R&D spending and economic growth in the EU and other regions. The results suggest that the growth-enhancing effect of R&D in the EU15 countries does not differ from that in other countries in general, but it is less significant than that for other industrialized countries. A closer inspection of the data reveals that the weak results for the EU15 stem from comparisons with the US - the US has been able to generate a stronger growth response from its R&D spending. Possible explanations for the US advantage include higher private sector investment in R&D and stronger public-private sector linkages than in the EU. Hence, to reduce the ""innovation gap"" vis-à-vis the US, it may not be enough for the EU to raise the share of R&D expenditures in GDP: continuous improvements in the European innovation system will also be needed, with focus on areas like private sector R&D and public-private sector linkages."
O51|Polarization of Job Losses: Canada and the USA, the Role of ICT|"Canada-USA comparisons are used to examine whether recent wage polarization is a general phenomenon, or more of a U.S. experience (it is the latter). The role of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) in ""polarization"" is examined and the Canadian productivity and ICT lags relative to the U.S. are discussed. ICT is a recent tool and thus discussions of its ""demise"" need to be cautious."
O51|Inequality and welfare: Is Europe special?|We review the literature about inequality and welfare with a particular focus on whether Europe has a special sensitivity to these matters or specific outcomes. We argue that both statements are likely to be true which raises the possibility of a causal link. Europe has relatively good results in terms of inequality and welfare in comparison with other continents and more specifically America, because these issues matter for European people. Still, research needs to be fostered in at least 5 areas that are detailed at the end of this review. A specific attention is devoted to the contribution of other social sciences and natural sciences (cognitive science) to the development of our knowledge for these fields.
O51|European Universities during the Crisis: A Public Policy Perspective, with a Brief Excursion to the US|"The crisis slowed down the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy (for the EU to become the most competitive region in the world). The crisis has aggravated the divergence between the North West of Europe and Southern Europe in labor productivity imparted by the knowledge economy. At the same time, equality of opportunity for participation in higher education seems to have been well-preserved in the EU Member States. This is in contrast to the US with its substantial higher private costs for university education. The relative stagnations in university education and research during the crisis is similar in Europe as in the US. Asian countries may – as a result – have improved their position in innovation. The room for maneuver of Governments of EU Member States to deal with universities (as with other public expenditures) was severely limited by the agreed upon maximum levels of the budget deficit and Government debt. Political institutions appear to determine the ""code"" for higher education expenditures. The quality of the minister responsible for higher education and the level of ""trust"" in the country may also the room for maneuver in setting university policy."
O51|Locational determinants of us outward fdi into sub-saharan Africa|This paper uses panel data techniques to investigate the locational determinants of US outward foreign direct investment (FDI) into 23 countries of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) for 1996–2010. The findings revealed that US outward FDI into SSA is influenced by the availability of crude oil and natural gas, infrastructure development, market size and completion rates in primary education. Conversely, labor force (of those aged 15+) and inflation deter US FDI, while political instability, corruption, and the exchange rate have an insignificant negative relationship with US FDI. These findings suggest that US investors investing in SSA are significantly influenced by resource and market seeking factors but not by efficiency seeking factors. The study therefore suggests that credible policies for attracting US investors into SSA countries should be relentlessly pursued through education, training and skills acquisition, inflation targets, trade openness (especially in the natural resource sector), corruption control and political stability.
O51|Dynamic analysis of wage inequality and creative destruction|This paper investigates the transitional dynamics of a basic Schumpeterian growth model under constant relative risk aversion. In this model, there are three patterns governing the evolution of wage inequality, but only if the intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption is sufficiently low: (a) skill-biased technological change, i.e., technological progress leads to a widening of wage inequality; (b) unskill-biased technological change, i.e., technological progress leads to a contraction of wage inequality; and (c) unbiased technological change, i.e., technological progress is independent of wage inequality. By conducting comparative dynamics of an unexpected permanent increase in research productivity in any sector, which we interpret as the arrival of new general purpose technologies, we show that the property of technological change shifts entirely from unskill-biased to skill-biased. The evolution of wage inequality in the model is then consistent with the shift in the trend in wage inequality beginning in the 1970s in the US economy. Copyright Springer-Verlag Wien 2015
O51|Hajlító csapások - Az állami segítség ára az Amerikai Egyesült Államok bankrendszerében|Az Amerikai Egyesült Államok bankrendszerén mély nyomot hagyott a 2007–2008-as globális bankválság. A válság éppen innen indult, a világ egyik legfejlettebb bankrendszere került bajba. Az amerikai bankpiac mérete és a globális pénzügyi piacokkal való szoros integráltsága miatt ennek következményei globális jelentõségûek voltak. A bankrendszer megóvása érdekében az állam közbelépett. Az állam tõkét juttatott a magánbankoknak. Ez a lépés sok vitát váltott ki. Kifogásolták, hogy közpénzzel támogatták a bankárokat. Mivel a bankoknak tõkére volt szükségük, nem volt más választás. Mára ismét talpra állt az amerikai bankrendszer. A bankok mérlegpozíciója megerõsödött, tõkehelyzete jó, üzletvitele nyereséges és nagy a likviditás a bankszektorban. De közben minden megváltozott. Az állami segítségnek súlyos ára volt. Szigorúbbá vált a pénzpiacok szabályozása. Átalakult a bankok mérlegszerkezete, megváltozott az üzleti modell, és a likviditást tápláló források szerkezete is alapvetõen más ma, mint a válság elõtt volt.
O51|The Impact of War on Resource Allocation: 'Creative Destruction' and the American Civil War|What is the effect of wars on industrialization, technology and commercial activity? In economic terms, such events as wars comprise a large exogenous shock to labor and capital markets, aggregate demand, the distribution of expenditures, and the rate and direction of technological innovation. In addition, if private individuals are extremely responsive to changes in incentives, wars can effect substantial changes in the allocation of resources, even within a decentralized structure with little federal control and a low rate of labor participation in the military. This paper examines war-time resource reallocation in terms of occupation, geographical mobility, and the commercialization of inventions during the American Civil War. The empirical evidence shows the war resulted in a significant temporary misallocation of resources, by reducing geographical mobility, and by creating incentives for individuals with high opportunity cost to switch into the market for military technologies, while decreasing financial returns to inventors. However, the end of armed conflict led to a rapid period of catching up, suggesting that the war did not lead to a permanent misallocation of inputs, and did not long inhibit the capacity for future technological progress.
O51|Savings from top incomes and accumulation in the United States context: Results from disaggregated national accounts|This paper proposes that high savings out of top incomes con- tributed to the steady wealth income ratio amongst US households. I explore counter claims regarding capital gains and housing prices and nd they had very little in uences on the trends and magnitudes of household net worth, relative to income. Using the dynamics of inter-group accumulation rates, I propose an accounting decomposi- tion formula which captures savings rates for any reference group. This methodology is applied to data from national accounts, balance sheets and income distribution statistics in order to compute saving rates for the Top 1% of households in the US income distribution. The estimates support the idea that high savings from top incomes have captured a growing share of wealth between 1980 and 2010.
O51|The Idea of Secular Stagnation: Three Versions|"The paper critically analyses the idea of ""secular stagnation"" actively discussed in the recent economic literature. It examines the most popular versions of this idea offered by T. Cowen, R. Gordon and L. Summers. Key arguments include, respectively, the exhaustion of the main sources of economic growth, the emergence of new impediments to growth, and the output gap that cannot be reduced by traditional macroeconomic policy measures. The author concludes that in the next decades a slowdown of economic growth in the U.S. is highly probable although it can hardly be characterized as ""stagnation""."
O51|Local Directional Moran Scatter Plot - Ldms|This paper propose a novel methodology to estimate the distribution dynamics of income in presence of spatial dependence by representing spatial dynamics as a random vector field in Moran space. Inference on the local spatial dynamics is discussed, including a test on the presence of local spatial dependence. The methodology also allows to compute a forecast of future income distribution which includes also the effects of spatial dependence. An application to US States is used to illustrate the effective capacities of the methodology.
O51|STEM Education and Economic Performance in the American States|This paper examines the effect of STEM graduates on the level and growth of real GDP per capita for the 50 US states and the District of Columbia between 1990 and 2011. This paper also examines the effect of STEM graduates on approved utility patents per one million people. The findings show that the share of STEM graduates has a statistically significant positive effect on the level and growth of real GDP per capita. The results are robust irrespective of estimation methods. The paper finds that an increase in the share of STEM graduates increases the number of approved utility patents per one million people but that the statistical significance of the results depends on the estimation methods.

O51|Production Technology and Carbon Emission: Long run relation with Short run Dynamics|What is the role of technological progress on reduction of CO2 emission? Question of linkage among carbon emission, income and technological progress is the main focuses on recent research area. Using vector error correction model (VECM), this paper investigates the long run relation with short run dynamics among CO2 emission, technological progress and economic growth. This study observes a specific kind of causality running from technological progress to CO2 emission in the USA during 1963 – 2010, while past income is the cause of rising carbon emission. Policy makers should emphasis on R & D for updated production technology which helps to reduce CO2 emission with raising income. Technological progress is the central force that causes income growth as well as emission reduction. Continuous change and adaption of new and updated technology is the main driving force toward sustainable development.
O51|Productivity Indexes under Hicks Neutral Technical Change|The Malmquist and Hicksâ€“Moorsteen productivity indexes are the two most widely used indexes for measuring productivity growth of firms, industries and countries. We indicate that these two indexes coincide under constant returns to scale technology and Hicks neutral technical change. While the conditions on production technology under which two indexes coincide have been examined before, this is the first study on the types of technical change under which they coincide. We shed new insight on the relationship between these popular indexes.
O51|Multiple Directions for Measuring Biased Technical Change|Malmquist and Hicksâˆ’Moorsteen productivity indexes are the two most widely used indexes for measuring productivity growth. The former, which has been proposed initially, has a nice feature of decomposing productivity growth into two important sources: efficiency change and technical change components. The technical change component is considered measuring the distances between the isoquants along a single direction. When technical change is not Hicks-neutral and is biased towards certain factor inputs or outputs, the distance between the isoquants is dependent on the direction selected. In this case, if we adopt a single direction for measuring the distances, we can only locally capture technical change, which is a global phenomenon by nature. To rectify this problem, we propose a more global index of technical change that measures the distance between the isoquants by utilizing two directions. Along with the existing measure of efficiency change, this allows us to define a corresponding productivity index. This index turns out to be the geometric mean of the Malmquist and the Hicks-Moorsteen productivity indexes under constant returns to scale technology. While there has been a long discussion on which index is more preferable between the two productivity indexes, we give a justification to using the geometric mean of these two indexes.
O51|Editor’s Overview|The 28th issue of the International Productivity Monitor features articles on the following topis: the measurement of industry contributions to labour productivity growth; the benefits of closing the Aboriginal education gap; the impact of public policies on bargaining power and the pay/productivity linkage; the relationship between employment and productivity growth; and the contribution of ICT diffusion and investment to labour productivity growth.
O51|Measuring Industry Contributions to Labour Productivity Change: A New Formula in a Chained Fisher Index Framework|Canada and the United States use Fisher indexes in their input-output accounts. Existing methods for decomposing aggregate labour productivity growth into industry contributions in a Fisher index framework either leave some productivity growth unaccounted for or are poorly suited for answering relevant questions about the industry sources of productivity growth. This article derives formulas for analyzing industry contributions to productivity change that add up exactly to the aggregate change in productivity and that have useful economic interpretations. These formulas show that the manufacturing sector made a positive contribution to productivity growth in the Canada in 2000-2010 and in the United States in 1998-2012, whereas the widely used GEAD formula implies that manufacturing made a negative contribution. Methods that can be used to decompose chained Laspeyres measures of productivity growth are also developed. These methods would be applicable in countries other than Canada and the United States.
O51|A Detailed Analysis of Productivity Trends in the Forest Products Sector in Quebec, 2000-2013: Adversity Drives Productivity|The Quebec forest products sector has had an above-average productivity performance in the 2000-2013 period, driven in particular by the forestry and logging subsector. While the wood product manufacturing subsector has also benefited from strong productivity gains, the productivity performance of the paper manufacturing subsector has been far from impressive. This report provides a detailed analysis of output, input and productivity trends in the Canadian forest products sector. It also looks at the key drivers of productivity in the sector, investigating potential barriers to productivity growth and discussing policies that could enable faster growth. Given the increasing role of countries with low-labour costs in several forest product markets, maintaining robust productivity growth is an imperative for the Quebec forest products sector if it wants to remain competitive internationally. In this vein, the report recommends a renewed focus on human and physical capital investment, as well as on R&D spending and the introduction of new innovative products.
O51|A Detailed Analysis of Productivity Trends in the Forest Products Sector in Ontario, 2000-2013: Sunset Industry or Industry in Transition?|Ontario’s forest products sector was hit by a near perfect storm in the first decade of the twenty-first century, when a multitude of structural and cyclical factors came together to devastate the sector. Despite this, the Ontario forest products sector has had an above-average productivity performance, driven in particular by the wood product manufacturing subsector. This report provides a detailed analysis of output, input and productivity trends in the Ontario forest products sector. It also looks at the key drivers of productivity in the sector, investigating potential barriers to productivity growth and discussing policies that could enable faster growth. Given the increasing role of countries with low-labour costs in several forest product markets, maintaining robust productivity growth is an imperative for Ontario’s forest products sector if it wants to remain competitive internationally. In this vein, the report recommends a renewed focus on human and physical capital investment, as well as on R&D spending and the introduction of new innovative products.
O51|On The Interaction Between Economic Growth And Business Cycles|The present paper studies the interaction between short-run fluctuations and economic growth by presenting empirical evidence of the impact of business cycle fluctuations on the rate of growth consistent with a constant unemployment rate in 13 Latin American and 18 OECD countries during the period 1981-2011. The results of both parametric (OLS and a panel estimator that allows for parameter heterogeneity and cross section dependence) and non-parametric (a penalized regression spline estimator) econometric techniques show that this measure of potential output experiences positive (negative) changes in periods of high (low) growth in the majority of countries, and, hence, that business cycles fluctuations have statistically significant effects on potential output. However, in contrast to the sample of OECD countries, less than half of the sample of Latin American countries experience statistically significant changes of this measure of potential output in periods of low growth.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
O51|Catching-Up from Way Behind: How Timor-Leste Can Avoid the Dutch Disease?|This paper seeks to analyse the capacity of the newly independent but petroleum rich Timor-Leste to avoid experiencing the “Dutch Disease”. The historical and social circumstances of Timor-Leste has left the resource-rich country with serious challenges to break out from the resource curse with the incidence of poverty rising over the last decade and the social indicators of child mortality rates and life expectancy falling very slowly. The evidence shows that Timor-Leste is facing mounting obstacles as oil and gas, which has contributed little to direct employment, continues to dominate GDP, with cereal yields from the agricultural sector showing a trend fall over the last decade. The paper offers policy recommendations to assist the government in its efforts to bolster the non-petroleum sectors through technological capability building targeted at the productive sectors of agriculture and manufacturing in order to avoid the resource curse.
O51|Are Resources Cursed? An Investigation of Chinese Provinces|No abstract is available for this item.
O51|Are Resources a Curse? An Investigation of Chinese Provinces| The phenomenon of low economic growth in resource-rich regions is recognized as the “resource curse”. This research empirically shows the existence of a resource curse at Chinese province level. Of two widely offered explanations for the resource curse, our analysis supports the crowding-out effect in China rather than the institution explanation. Education and R&D are the two main crowded-out factors.
O51|What the Rich Won Over the Past 35 Years and What Everyone Else Lost| The explosion in inequality since 1980 has quashed hopes that mature economic development would generate more equitable economic and social conditions. Although inequality is receiving increasing attention from academics and politicians, the focus has been mostly on income and wealth. This article provides a broader analysis by expanding the focus to what this dramatically greater inequality has meant in terms of peoples' lives; their relative status, their health and longevity, their opportunities and mobility, the quality of public goods, and the distribution of political power. It presents metrics and qualitative analysis of what, when seen more fully, the rich have gained and the non-rich have lost. To better grasp the amount of wealth captured by a small elite, the article ends with a depiction of what the $29 trillion in wealth gains by the top 10 percent could purchase in terms of public goods such as infrastructure, social security, health care, education and budget deficits.
O51|The secular stagnation hypothesis: a review of the debate and some insights|Recent studies warn that the U.S. economy may return to a phase of secular stagnation. In the next 20 to 50 years, U.S. economic growth will be negatively affected by lower contributions of hours worked and education. But some studies also add that productivity could decelerate sharply and that GDP per capita, by focusing on the average household, neglects that income has already been stagnating in the last 30 years for the households in the bottom 99% of the income distribution. After reviewing recent long-run projections, we argue that similar warnings were issued in the past after all deep recessions. Interestingly, pessimistic predictions turned out to be wrong neither because they were built on erroneous theories or data, nor because they failed to predict the discovery of new technologies, but because they underestimated the potential of the technologies that already existed. These findings suggest that today we should not make the same mistake and undervalue the effects of the information technology. Finally, we discuss a number of issues that should be tackled by future research.
O51|Entry, Exit and Economic Growth: US Regional Evidence|Entry rates have a negative long-run effect on US regional growth, which contradicts innovation-based growth models. This puzzle is resolved when a model-consistent specification is estimated using per capita entry growth. Evidence supports the Schumpeterian hypothesis of a positive relationship between exit and economic growth.

O51|Are small or large producers driving the Canada-U.S. labour productivity gap? Recent evidence from manufacturing|This paper shows that the higher smallplant employment share in Canada compared with the United States mattered for the CanadaU.S. manufacturing labourproductivity gap, but it did not contribute to the widening of the gap between 2002 and 2007. In addition, it shows that while the weaker productivity performance of small plants in Canada compared with the United States accounted for much of the gap in a particular year, the deterioration in the productivity performance of large plants in Canada was responsible for most of the widening gap over this period.
O51|World Development, 2000-2010: Production, Investment And Savings In 21 Areas Of America, Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe And Eurasia|In this study we present a comparison of investment and production per head in 21 areas of the World, and we find that in many poor areas there has been little improvement during the period 2000-2010. One of the main causes of this disappointing result has been the stagnation in many countries, of investment and production per capita during this decade. We present a comparison of the levels of industrial development in those areas, and we find that they are too much low in many countries. We analyze the evolution of investment and savings in 132 countries of America, Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe and Eurasia, and we notice that it is important to foster international cooperation in order to avoid the negative consequences of low levels of investment and production per head on poverty. We include some econometric models relating investment, manufacturing and economic development with a sample of 132 countries.
O51|Reverse assimilation? Immigrants in the Canadian labour market during the Great Depression|This paper uses Canadian census data from 1911 to 1931 to trace the labour market assimilation of immigrants up to the onset of the Great Depression. We find that substantial earnings convergence between 1911 and 1921 was reversed between 1921 and 1931, with immigrants from Continental Europe experiencing a sharp decline in earnings relative to the native-born. The effect of Depression labour market conditions was particularly pronounced among older immigrants with long tenures in Canada.
O51|Body weight and labour market outcomes in Post-Soviet Russia|Purpose - – The purpose of this paper is to focus on the impacts of overweight and obesity on the probability of employment, wages, and the incidence of sick-leave days by gender, in Russia, over the transition period, 1994-2005. Design/methodology/approach - – The authors uses panel data and appropriate instrumental variables techniques to estimate a set of three models. Findings - – The results show a linear negative effect of body mass index (BMI) on probability of employment for women and positive effect for men. The authors did not find evidence of wage penalty for higher BMI, a result different from findings of several studies on developed market economies. There is also positive impact of BMI on the number of work days missed due to health problems for women. Originality/value - – The results derived in transition context add evidence to the growing obesity and labour market outcomes literature emphasising the relative importance of the labour supply side compared to the demand side. The policy implications of our study are gender specific.
O51|Directed technological change, skill complementarities and sectoral productivity growth: evidence from industrialized countries during the new economy|Recent growth accounting exercises attribute strong productivity growth to increased investments in information and communication technologies (ICT) over the last decades, but abstain from potential complementarity effects with other inputs. Based on three different sets of industrialized countries, this study shows that sectoral productivity growth originated from ICT-skill complementarities and skill-biased technological change (SBTC) during the New Economy. In particular, Scandinavian goods-producing sectors and Anglo–Saxon market services reveal strong SBTC effects that originated from ICT-skill complementarities, while such effects were totally missing in Continental market services during the same periods. Further drivers of productivity growth were intermediate and non-ICT capital deepening. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014
O51|Returns to scale effect in labour productivity growth|Economists acknowledge that technical progress and growth in capital inputs increase labour productivity (LP). However, less focus is given to the realization that changes in labour input alone could also affect LP. Because this effect disappears when the short-run technology exhibits constant returns to scale, we call it the returns to scale effect. We decompose growth in LP into three contributing factors: (1) technical progress, (2) capital input growth and the (3) returns to scale effect. We propose theoretical measures for these three components and show that they coincide with the index number formulae consisting of prices and quantities of inputs and outputs. Subsequently, we apply the results of our decomposition to US industry data for 1987–2009. LP in the services sector is shown to grow much slower than that in the goods sector during the 1987–1995 productivity slowdown period. We conclude that the returns to scale effect can considerably explain the gap in LP growth between the two industry groups. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014
O51|Sources of Firm Life-Cycle Dynamics: Differentiating Size vs. Age Effects|What determines firm growth over the life-cycle? Exploiting unique firm panel data on internal organization, balance sheets and innovation, representative of the entire Canadian economy, we study recent theories that examine life-cycle patterns for firm growth. These theories include organizational capital accumulation and management practices, financial frictions, learning about demand, and recent endogenous growth models with incumbent innovation. We emphasize the importance of differentiating between pure age effects of these theories and effects on size conditional on age. Our stylized facts highlight both empirical successes and shortcomings of current theory. First, models of organizational capital and innovation are broadly consistent with firm size correlations conditional on age but have difficulties matching the life-cycle dynamics of firm organization and innovation. Second, among theories we analyze, organizational capital and management practices are the most important determinants to explain intensive margin firm growth over the life-cycle. Third, although less important to explain intensive margin firm growth, financial frictions are an important determinant of firm exit, conditional on firm age.
O51|Productivity Gap and Asymmetric Trade Relations: The Canada-United States of America Integration Process|The usefulness of the European model of integration is currently subject to debate and the North American integration process has been largely ignored as a comparative framework. The asymmetrical relationship between Canada and the United States began a long time before NAFTA, and the study of this process could shed light on the usual problems faced by Latin American countries. This article attempts to encourage discussion about this topic. Particularly, there is evidence for a substantial and positive change in Canadian productivity at the time of the Canada-US Free Trade Agreement (CUFTA). However, the enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) does not seem to have had the same effect as the earlier treaty.
O51|Fiscal Effects of Putting Initiatives on the Ballot: Evidence from the Last 20 Years in the United States|This paper investigates both the indirect (i.e. the existence) and the direct effects (i.e. the usage) of direct democracy institutions on major fiscal outcomes across the United States over the 1992-2009 period. Being based on a more recent time span than previous contributions, our work includes detailed information such as the type of institution (i.e. direct or indirect initiative), the voting outcome, and the topics of concern. The main results suggest that States permitting initiatives spend and tax less than those without, confirming some previous findings. However, when initiatives are effectively used, their practice contributes to increase spending among those States allowing them. The intensity of different initiatives also matters for fiscal outcomes as well as the nature of topics involved.
O51|The Theory of the Free Trade Area As a Possible Form of Future Cooperation of the European Union with The US|The European Union and the United States of America present the world´s largest exporter and importer of goods, services and capital. The idea of increasing foreign trade between them based on the implementation of the lowest degree of economic integration, a free trade area, is not new. A proposal was made in the 1990s to create a Transatlantic Free Trade Area between the EU and member countries of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has not been successfully implemented. Nowadays, it is getting back to the forefront of interest among not only politicians but also economists. Whether political or economic pressures are behind this step, it is important to understand the general principle of the functioning of the free trade area. The aim of this paper is to illustrate the basic characteristics of the free trade area on the example of the EU and the US.
O51|The Impact of Regional and Sectoral Productivity Changes on the U.S. Economy|We study the impact of intersectoral and interregional trade linkages in propagating disaggregated productivity changes to the rest of the economy. Using U.S. regional and industry data, we obtain the aggregate, regional and sectoral elasticities of measured total factor productivity, GDP, and employment to regional and sectoral productivity changes. We find that the elasticities vary significantly depending on the sectors and regions affected, and are importantly determined by the spatial structure of the economy. We use our calibrated model to perform a variety of counterfactual exercises including several specific studies of the aggregate and disaggregate effects of shocks to productivity and infrastructure. The specific episodes we study include the boom in California’s computer industry, the productivity boom in North Dakota associated with the shale oil boom, the disruptions in New York’s finance and real state industries during the 2008 crisis, as well as the effect of the destruction of infrastructure in Louisiana following hurricane Katrina.
O51|The Impact of the Oil Boom on Canada's Labour Productivity Performance, 2000-2012|The objective of this article is to evaluate the impact of the oil and gas industry on labour productivity growth in Canada since 2000 through an exploration of the various channels, both direct and indirect, by which the oil and gas sector affects aggregate productivity. The article sheds light on the paradoxical lack of a direct negative contribution of the oil and gas sector to aggregate labour productivity growth despite the very large fall in productivity experienced by the sector. It highlights the divergent productivity growth paths for the oil and gas sectors in Alberta and Newfoundland and Labrador, which drove the aggregate productivity performance of these two provinces. The article also discusses how developments in the oil and gas industry, notably the increase in the price and production of petroleum, have affected productivity growth in other parts of the economy.
O51|An Analysis of Productivity Trends in the Canadian Forest Products Sector, 2000-2012|The 2000-2012 period was a difficult time for the Canadian forest products sector. Yet despite an unfavourable environment the sector experienced an above-average productivity performance, driven in particular by the wood product manufacturing subsector. While the forestry and logging subsector has also benefited from strong productivity gains, the productivity performance of the paper manufacturing subsector has been far from impressive, especially in the post-2008 period. This article provides a detailed analysis of output, input and productivity trends in the Canadian forest products sector. It also looks at the key drivers of productivity in the sector, investigating potential barriers to productivity growth and discussing policies that could enable faster growth. Given the increasing role of countries with low-labour costs in several forest product markets, maintaining robust productivity growth is an imperative for the Canadian forest products sector if it wants to remain competitive internationally. In this sense, the article recommends renewed focus on human and physical capital investment, as well as on R&D spending.

O51|Sustainable Governance Indicators|A strong case can be made that the quality of governance provided by the government of Canada deteriorated somewhat from May 2011 to May 2013. While the government has constructed high-quality governance structures and implemented effective policies in many areas over many decades, the actions of the Conservative government since winning a majority of the seats in the House of Commons in May 2011 have jeopardized this situation. This report highlights a number of developments that lead to this conclusion.
O51|The Impact of the Oil Boom on Canada's Labour Productivity Performance|The objective of this report is to evaluate the impact of the oil and gas industry on labour productivity growth in Canada since 2000 through an exploration of the various channels, both direct and indirect, by which the oil and gas sector affects aggregate productivity.

The report also discusses how developments in the oil and gas industry, notably the increase in the price and production of petroleum, have affected productivity growth in other parts of the economy. It finds that the oil boom has had a substantial negative effect on the cost competitiveness of manufacturing by putting upward pressure on the value of the Canadian dollar – the so-called Dutch Disease. Counteracting this are positive effects associated with demand and incomes generated by the oil boom, as well as increases in spending on R&D and education by the major oil-producing provinces.
O51|Crowding-out Effect or Institutions? The Resource Curse Revisited with an Investigation of U.S. States| The phenomenon of low economic growth in resource-rich regions is recognized as the “resource curse”. This research empirically shows the existence of a resource curse at the U.S. state level. Of two widely offered explanations for the resource curse, our analysis supports the crowding-out effect in the U.S. rather than the institutional explanation. Investment and R&D are the two main crowded-out factors.
O51|Taxation or regulation in preventing systemic risk? The political distortion|Free riding leads to excess risk production. This problem may be solved, at least partially, either by financial regulation or by taxation. From a normative viewpoint, taxation is superior in many respects. However, reality shows that financial regulation is adopted more frequently. If the majority chooses regulation, the level is likely to be too harsh. If it chooses taxation, then the level is likely to be too low. Due to regressive effects, a tax on financial transactions receives low support from a majority of low polluting portfolio owners.The same kind of majority may strategically choose regulation in order to burden the minority with a larger share of the cost of reducing systemic risk
O51|Heterogeneous convergence|We use US county-level data to estimate convergence rates for 22 individual states. We find significant heterogeneity. E.g., the California estimate is 19.9% and the New York estimate is 3.3%. Convergence rates are essentially uncorrelated with income levels.
O51|Reallocation and Technology: Evidence from the US Steel Industry|We measure the impact of a drastic new technology for producing steel--the minimill--on industry-wide productivity in the US steel industry, using unique plant-level data between 1963 and 2002. The sharp increase in the industry's productivity is linked to this new technology through two distinct mechanisms: (i) the mere displacement of the older technology (vertically integrated producers) was responsible for a third of the increase in the industry's productivity, and (ii) increased competition, due the minimill expansion, drove a productivity resurgence at the surviving vertical integrated producers and, consequently, the productivity of the industry as a whole. (JEL D24, L13, L23, L61, M11, O31, O33)
O51|Outsourcing and the rise in services|This paper investigates the impact of outsourcing on sectoral reallocation in the U.S. over the period 1947-2007, and on the rise in services in particular. Roughly 40% of the growth of the service sector comes from professional and business services. This is an unusual industry as more than 90% of its output is an intermediate input to other firms, and it is where most of the service outsourcing activity is concentrated. These facts are essential to understanding the structure of the economy: professional and business services have experienced an almost fourfold increase in their forward linkage, the largest change in input-output linkages over the past 60 years. Using a simple gross output accounting framework, I calculate the contribution of the change in the composition of intermediates and their sourcing mode to the reallocation of employment across sectors. I find that the evolution of the input-output structure accounts for up to 33% of the increase in service employment, and professional and business services outsourcing alone contributes almost half of that amount.
O51|The size and scope of government in the US states: does party ideology matter?|We investigate empirically how party ideology influences size and scope of government as measured by the size of government, tax structure and labor market regulation. Our dataset comprises 49 US states over the 1993–2009 period. We employ the new data on the ideological mapping of US legislatures by Shor and McCarty (Am. Polit. Sci. Rev. 105(3):530–551, 2011 ) that considers spatial and temporal differences in Democratic and Republican Party ideology. We distinguish between three types of divided government: overall divided government, proposal division and approval division. The main result suggests that Republican governors have been more active in deregulating labor markets. We find that ideology-induced policies were counteracted under overall divided government and proposal division. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013
O51|American Incomes Before and After the Revolution|Building social tables in the tradition of Gregory King, we develop new estimates suggesting that between 1774 and 1800 American incomes fell in real per capita terms. The colonial South was richer than the North at the start, but was already beginning to lose its income lead by 1800. We also find that free American colonists had much more equal incomes than did households in England and Wales. The colonists also had greater purchasing power than their English counterparts over all of the income ranks except in the top few percent.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
O51|U.S. Elasticities Of Substitution And Factor Augmentation At The Industry Level|We provide industry-level estimates of the elasticity of substitution (?) between capital and labor in the US economy. We also estimate rates of factor-augmentation. Aggregate estimates are produced using the same data. Our empirical model comes from the first-order conditions associated with a CES production function. Our data represents 35 industries at roughly the 2-digit SIC level from 1960 to 2005 and covers the entire US economy. We find that aggregate US ? is less than unity and perhaps less than 0.5.The same is likely true for the large majority of individual industries. We find no consistent and/or systematic evidence that aggregate ? is either greater or less than the value-added share-weighted average of industry ?s. Also, there is still considerable variation across the industry-level ? point estimates. Technical change in the aggregate appears to be net labor-augmenting. However, at the industry-level there is little evidence that the type of technical change is uniform across industries. For many individual industries, technical change may be characterized by net capital-augmentation.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
O51|Macro-Econometric Models Of Supply And Demand: Industry, Trade And Wages In 6 Countries, 1960-2012|We analyse the impact of industry on non industrial production, as well as its effect on wages and employment in 6 OECD countries: France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States for the period 1960-2012. Our approach to macro-econometric modelling have into account both demand and supply sides, including not only the effects of primary inputs but also those of intermediate inputs (domestic and imported). We present some estimated equations, and analysis of causality, with a panel of those countries. We show that excessive delocalization of industry, for 2003-2012, and austerity policies, for 2009-2012, have had a negative effect on wages and development. The main conclusion is that industrialized countries should make compatible their foreign trade policy with domestic development, avoiding strong and unsustainable trade deficits.
O51|Employment, Production and Income by Sector in Spain: Econometric Models and Comparison with Germany and the United States, 1965-2010|We analyse the evolution of real valued-added by sector accordingly to two approaches: production and income in Spain in comparison with Germany, the USA and other OECD countries. We found that the quick increase of employment in Building and Services in Spain for the period 1995-2007 was unsustainable due to the lack of an even evolution of Industrial production. Economic policies for the period 1995-2012 did not foster the necessary increase in real production per inhabitant, in order to reach high rates of employment and convergence of productivity, real wages and real income per capita to more advanced economics. Here we present the estimation of econometrics models which have into account the impact of industrial development on real value-added and employment by sector.
O51|In dubio pro CES - Supply estimation with mis-specified technical change|Capital-labor substitution and total factor productivity (TFP) estimates are essential features of growth and income distribution models. In the context of a Monte Carlo exercise embodying balanced and near balanced growth, we demonstrate that the estimation of the substitution elasticity can be substantially biased if the form of technical progress is misspecified. For some parameter values, when factor shares are relatively constant, there could be an inherent bias towards Cobb-Douglas. The implied estimates of TFP growth also yield substantially different results depending on the specification of technical progress. A Constant Elasticity of Substitution production function is then estimated within a “normalized” system approach for the US economy over 1960:1–2004:4. Results show that the estimated substitution elasticity tends to be significantly lower using a factor augmenting specification (well below one). We are able to reject Hicks-, Harrod- and Solow-neutral specifications in favor of general factor augmentation with a non-negligible capital-augmenting component. Finally, we draw some important lessons for production and supply-side estimation. JEL Classification: C15, C32, E23, O33, O51
O51|Growth spillover through trade: A spatial dynamic panel data approach|This paper empirically examines the international spillover of economic growth through bilateral trade. We extend the Solow growth model with a spatial autoregressive term and a spatial time lag term, and estimate such a model with a sample of 26 OECD countries over the period 1971–2005. We find that there is a positive spillover effect of growth from one country to its trade partners. The implied rate of convergence is higher after including the spatial terms.
O51|An Econometric Approach to General Equilibrium Modeling|The first objective of this chapter is to present a new approach to econometric modeling of producer behavior. Our key contribution is to represent the rate and biases of technical change by unobservable or latent variables. We also divide the rate of technical change between components that are induced by changes in prices and those that are autonomous and not affected by prices. In our dataset, production is disaggregated into 35 separate commodities produced by one or more of the 35 industries making up the US economy. Our second objective is to present a new econometric model of aggregate consumer behavior. The model allocates full wealth among time periods for households distinguished by demographic characteristics, and determines the within-period demands for leisure, consumer goods and services. An important feature of our approach is the development of a closed-form representation of aggregate demand and labor supply that accounts for the heterogeneity in household behavior that is observed in micro-level data. Our model of producer behavior is the supply side of general equilibrium models of the US. The aggregate demand functions are important components of the demand side. These general equilibrium models are used to analyze the consequences of a broad spectrum of public policies. These applications are discussed in more detail in Chapter 8 of this Handbook. The third objective of the chapter is to demonstrate an important benefit of the econometric approach to parameterization. The parameter covariances obtained in the course of estimation can be used to construct confidence intervals for endogenous variables in general equilibrium models. Confidence intervals characterize the precision of modeling results more rigorously and systematically than traditional sensitivity analysis.
O51|Energy, the Environment and US Economic Growth|The point of departure for the study of the impact of energy and environmental policies is the neoclassical theory of economic growth formulated by Cass (1965) and Koopmans (1967). The long-run properties of economic growth models are independent of energy and environmental policies. However, these policies affect capital accumulation and rates of productivity growth that determine the intermediate-run trends that are important for policy evaluation. Heterogeneity of different energy producers and consumers is critical for the evaluation of energy and environmental policies. To capture this heterogeneity it is necessary to distinguish among commodities, industries and households. Econometric methods are essential for summarizing information on different industries and consumer groups in a form suitable for general equilibrium modeling. In this chapter, we consider the application of econometric general equilibrium modeling to the US – the economy that has been studied most intensively. The framework for our analysis is provided by the Intertemporal General Equilibrium Model (IGEM) introduced by Jorgenson and Wilcoxen (1998). The new version of the IGEM presented in this paper is employed for the evaluation of proposed legislation on climate policy by the US Environmental Protection Agency (2012b).

O51|Re-examining the decline in the US saving rate: The impact of mortgage equity withdrawal|This paper investigates the effect of mortgage equity withdrawal on saving in the US over the period 1993–2011. A multivariate time series analysis based on a vector error correction model (VECM) is carried out. The saving rate, mortgage equity withdrawal, net wealth, interest rates and inflation are included in the empirical model. The results show that the equity withdrawal mechanism plays a relevant role in explaining the saving rate pattern.
O51|Financial systemic risk: Taxation or regulation?|This paper describes financial systemic risk as a pollution issue. Free riding leads to excess risk production. This problem may be solved, at least partially, either by financial regulation or by taxation. From a normative viewpoint, taxation is superior in many respects. However, reality shows that financial regulation is adopted more frequently. This paper makes a positive, politico-economic argument. If the majority chooses regulation, the level is likely to be too harsh. If it chooses taxation, then the level is likely to be too low. Due to regressive effects, a tax on financial transactions receives low support from a majority of low polluting portfolio owners. The same kind of majority may strategically choose regulation in order to burden the minority with a larger share of the cost of reducing systemic risk.
O51|Outsourcing and the Rise in Services|This paper investigates the impact of outsourcing on sectoral reallocation in the U.S. over the period 1948-2002. Roughly 40% of the growth of the service sector comes from professional and business services. This is an unusual industry as more than 90% of its output is an intermediate input to other firms, and it is where most of the service outsourcing activity is concentrated. These facts are essential to understanding the structure of the economy: professional and business services have experienced an almost fourfold increase in their forward linkage, the largest change in input-output linkages over the past 60 years. Using a simple gross output accounting model, I calculate the contribution of the change in the composition of intermediates and their sourcing mode to the reallocation of employment across sectors. I find that the evolution of the input-output structure, which is mostly due to professional and business services outsourcing, accounts for 36% of the increase in services employment and 25% of the fall in manufacturing.
O51|Forecasting Real Estate Business: Empirical Evidence From The Canadian Market|In this paper, we compare the out-of-sample forecasting ability of three ARIMA family models: ARIMA, ARIMAX, and ARIMAX-GARCH. The models are tested to forecast turning points and trends in the Canadian real estate index using monthly data from April 2002 to March 2011. The results indicate that the ARIMAX model, which includes exogenous macroeconomic variables such as the gross domestic product, the consumer price index, the difference in long-term and short-term interest rates, and the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar against the US dollar and their lags, provides the best out-ofsample forecasts. Overall, the models are suitable only for short-term forecasts.

Fortunately, the crisis had no major impact on this commerce, as it is very easy to see from the text below. The article is structured in three parts: 1- methodological considerations for the scientific approach understanding, 2- the trade evolution of the four participants to the international trade with HT products, in 2007-2011 period that constitutes the main part of the analysis and 3- some dominant conclusions of the undertaken analysis. The selected subject is one of great interest having in view the technological course which takes place nowadays in the global economy and the efforts of the leading international countries (or statesâ€™ unions) for the domination of the HT international market.

O51|On Harrod’s Natural Rate of Growth and the Role of Demand: an Empirical Assessment|Starting from the seminal contribution of Harrod (1939), the current paper tests the hypothesis of endogeneity of the natural growth rate of output visà-vis aggregate demand fluctuations for the NAFTA economies (Canada, Mexico and the United States). Empirical results show that potential output reacts to fluctuations in actual growth rates, thus signaling that deflation may lead to stagbilisation (stagnation cum stabilisation) as depression of both effective demand and employment impart deleterious effects on the actual rate of economic growth. Under elastic conditions of the supply- side of the economy, neglect of the role played by demand does not contribute to a better understanding of the determinants of economic growth./ El presente artículo parte de la contribución original de Harrod (1939), y procede a contrastar la hipótesis de endogeneidad de la tasa natural de crecimiento del producto vis-à-vis fluctuaciones de la demanda agregada para el caso de las economías del TLCAN (Canadá, Estados Unidos y México). Los resultados empíricos muestran que el producto potencial reacciona ante fluctuaciones en la tasa de crecimiento observada, lo cual sugiere que la deflación puede inducir estancabilización (estancamiento con estabilización), dado que la depresión de la demanda efectiva y el empleo provocan efectos nocivos en la tasa de crecimiento económico observado. La omisión del papel de la demanda no contribuye a una mejor comprensión de los determinantes del crecimiento económico cuando la oferta es elástica.
O51|"Is Self-Esteem a ""Double Edged Sword""? Self-Esteem and the Onset of Adolescent Sexual Activity"|"Self-esteem has been conceptualized as a ""social vaccine"". The belief is that high self-esteem can inoculate young people, against vulnerability to a wide range of social illnesses. This study gives a contribution in the understanding of the causal relation between self-esteem and sexual behaviour among American adolescents. I analyzes the impact of different levels of early self-esteem on a wide set of risky sexual behaviours. I use data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and I take into account the endogeneity of self-esteem using instrumental variables methods and measuring self-esteem before sexual initiation. I find that self-esteem over a certain threshold' is a protective resource for girls, delaying the onset of sexual activity, reducing the number of occasional sexual partners and increasing the likelihood of having protected sexual encounters."
O51|US shadow economies: a state-level study|Recent studies of shadow economies focus primarily on cross-country comparisons. Few have examined regional or state-level variations in underground economic activity. This paper presents estimates of the shadow economy for 50 US states over the period 1997–2008. Results suggest that tax and social welfare burdens, labor market regulations, and intensity of regulation enforcement are important determinants of the underground economy. Among the states, Delaware, on average, maintains the smallest shadow economy at 7.28 % of GDP; Oregon, on average, has the second smallest shadow economy at 7.41 % of GDP; followed by Colorado, averaging 7.52 % of GDP, rounding out the three smallest shadow economies in the US West Virginia and Mississippi, on average, have the largest shadow economies in the US as a percent of GDP (9.32 and 9.54 %, respectively).

O51|The Great Recession: a comparison of recession magnitudes in Europe, USA and Japan|In this article recession magnitudes in Europe, the USA and Japan during the Great Recession are compared. The strongest recessions (of severe category) occurred in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, while recessions in Japan and the USA were significantly weaker. Even the strongest recession (in Latvia) was found smaller in its magnitude than the Great Depression 1929-1933 in the USA. Hence, comparisons of the Great Recession to the Great Depression in the literature are somewhat exaggerated.
O51|Revisiting Convergence: A case study form American States|This paper investigates the convergence of wage and salary disbursements per job and compensation of employees per job for fifty one states in the United States for the period 1990 and 2010. Additionally, this paper examines the relationship between the wage and salary disbursements per job and compensation of employees per job at 1990 and their respective annual growth rates between 1990 and 2010 for four regions in the United States. This paper finds that the American States are diverging with respect to wage and salary disbursements per job and compensation per job for the last twenty years. This paper also finds that the wage and salary disbursements per job and compensation of employees per job are converging in the ‘Mid-West’ and in the ‘West’, whereas they are diverging in the ‘North-East’ and in the ‘South’.
O51|Is direct democracy a problem or a promise for fiscal outcomes? The case of the United States|In time of worry for large deficits, the question on whether direct democracy can be a problem or a promise to better rule modern societies may arise. Both theoretical and empirical studies provide mixed answers. This paper investigates both the indirect (i.e. the existence) and the direct effects (i.e. the usage) of direct democracy institutions on major fiscal outcomes across the American States during 1992-2009. Being based on a more recent time span than previous contributions, our study includes more detailed information such as the type of institution, the voting result, and the topics of concern. The main results suggest that States permitting initiatives spend less than those without, confirming some previous findings. However, when initiatives are effectively used, their practice contributes to increase spending among those States allowing them. The intensity of different initiatives also matters for fiscal outcomes as well as the nature of topics involved.
O51|The Growth of Unproductive Activities, the Rate of Profit, and the Phase-Change of the U.S. Economy|This paper by using the categories of productive and unproductive labor and by extending and further elaborating the data series utilized in Shaikh and Tonak (1994) reveals a sharp expansion of the unproductive activities in the U.S. economy during the period 1964-2007. The combination of growing productivity and the stagnant or even falling real wages of productive workers increased the rate of surplus value in the recent decades to unprecedented highs. As a consequence, the general rate of profit from the early 1980s onwards was also rising until the last years of our analysis; meanwhile the net rate of profit remained at levels much lower than those of the 1960s and the slightly rising trend during the post-1980s has been already reversed. The patterns of these crucial variables reveal startling similarities with the onset of the slowdown that started in the mid- to late 1960s.JEL classification: B5, E1, O51
O51|The Fiscal Cliff Mythology and the Full Employment Alternative|This paper critiques the fiscal cliff mythology and the neoliberal push for economic austerity policies and sequestration of government programs. The purpose of the paper is to shift the debate to a social justice alternative that can sustain and enhance the social safety nets by implementing a full employment program that is both financially affordable and economically productive. First, the paper critically assesses the laissez-faire approach to job creation and lays out the mechanics of the job guarantee (JG) program as an alternative to the neoliberal model. Next, the paper critiques the deficit hawksâ€™ and deficit dovesâ€™ â€œfiscal cliffâ€ debate and demonstrates how the JG program can be financed according to modern money theory (MMT). Finally, the paper presents the cost estimation of the JG program for the United States to demonstrate its financial affordability and its productive capabilities.JEL Classification: B5, E5, E12, E24, J2, J3, H3, H6, O51
O51|A note on convergence across Canadian provinces: new insights from the club clustering algorithm|This paper employs the newly-developed convergence tests introduced by Phillips and Sul (Econometrica 75:1771–1855, 2007 ) to investigate convergence of real GDP per capita across Canadian provinces, as well as the transitional path of factors behind the convergence or divergence pattern. In contrast with previously published studies on Canadian provincial convergence, the analysis carried out in this paper allows for heterogeneous technology and reveals that Canadian provinces are characterized by distinct convergent clubs, that is, separate convergence clubs that converge to different steady states. We make the case that the findings presented in this paper are of utmost importance for Canadian policy-makers as they seek to develop effective policy measures to address regional economic disparities.

O51|The US monetary performance prior to the 2008 crisis| This article uses a Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) approach to study the different shocks to the monetary performance in the two decades of the US economy prior to the 2008 financial crisis. By using the Federal Fund Rate as a measure of change in the monetary policy, this study shows that interest rate expectation is informative about the future movement of Federal Fund Rate and the anticipated monetary policy should be one of the crucial reasons in causing monetary and financial deterioration in the US economy. This article discusses a possible conjecture of a low interest rate trap when a persistent and prolonged low interest rate regime led to financial instability.
O51|Labour Market Matters - October 2013|Literacy is central to the improvement and betterment of any society. Individuals cannot fully engage in social and political discourse, and are more likely to become less-than-equals in society without basic literacy to pursue their goals. On the individual level, more literate individuals tend to enjoy better employment opportunities and higher earnings â€“ leading to a better quality of life. On a societal level, a more literate workforce may be better positioned to adjust to change and to adopt new technologies. Thus, improving literacy for individuals may have spill-over effects that benefit the economy as a whole. As many industrialized countries are facing significant population ageing in the coming decades, what are the implications for literacy skills? A paper entitled â€œAgeing and Literacy Skills: Evidence from Canada, Norway and the United Statesâ€ (CLSRN Working Paper no. 98) by CLSRN affiliates David A. Green and W. Craig Riddell (both of the University of British Columbia) studies the relationship between age and literacy skills using data from the 1994 International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS) and the 2003 International Adult Literacy and Life Skills Survey (IALSS). Canada, as many other advanced economies is projected to face a significant â€œgreyingâ€ of its population in the coming decades due to factors such as the ageing of the baby boomers and low-birth rates. What impact will population ageing have on the Labour Market? A study entitled â€œInter-temporal and Inter-industry Effects of Population Ageing: A General Equilibrium Assessment for Canadaâ€ by CLSRN Affiliates Nabil Annabi, Maxime FougÃ¨re, and Simon Harvey (all of Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, HRSDC) find that the projected decline in the growth of the labour force would raise pressures on labour markets leading to an increase in wages and to an unprecedented decline in unemployment. However, the authors show that the impact would vary at the industrial and occupational levels causing significant distributional effects. The authors also suggest that investment in capital and labour quality would become more important than labour quantity in the determination of productivity.
O51|MarchÃƒÂ© du travail en revue - Octobre 2013|Lâ€™alphabÃ©tisme est capital pour lâ€™amÃ©lioration de toute sociÃ©tÃ©. Tout un chacun ne peut participer entiÃ¨rement au discours social et politique, et aura sans doute une position infÃ©rieure en sociÃ©tÃ©, sâ€™il ne possÃ¨de pas lâ€™alphabÃ©tisme de base lui permettant dâ€™atteindre ses objectifs. Sur le plan individuel, les personnes plus alphabÃ¨tes tendent Ã obtenir de meilleurs emplois et des revenus supÃ©rieurs, dâ€™oÃ¹ une qualitÃ© de vie supÃ©rieure. Sur le plan de la sociÃ©tÃ©, une main-dâ€™Å“uvre plus alphabÃ¨te peut Ãªtre mieux placÃ©e pour sâ€™ajuster au changement et adopter de nouvelles technologies. AmÃ©liorer lâ€™alphabÃ©tisme des gens peut donc avoir des retombÃ©es positives sur lâ€™ensemble de lâ€™Ã©conomie. Comme de nombreux pays industrialisÃ©s feront face Ã un vieillissement significatif de leur population dans les prochaines dÃ©cennies, quelles sont les implications pour les capacitÃ©s de lecture et dâ€™Ã©criture? Dans une Ã©tude intitulÃ©e Â«Le vieillissement et les capacitÃ©s dâ€™alphabÃ©tisme : Ã©lÃ©ments de preuve pour le Canada, la NorvÃ¨ge et les Ã‰tats-UnisÂ» (Rapport de recherche du RCCMTC no 98), les membres affiliÃ©s du RCCMTC David A. Green et W. Craig Riddell (tous deux de lâ€™UniversitÃ© de la Colombie-Britannique) examinent les rapports entre lâ€™Ã¢ge et les capacitÃ©s dâ€™alphabÃ©tisme en utilisant les donnÃ©es de lâ€™EnquÃªte internationale sur lâ€™alphabÃ©tisation des adultes (EIAA) de 1994 et celles de lâ€™EnquÃªte internationale sur lâ€™alphabÃ©tisation et les compÃ©tences des adultes (EIACA) de 2003. Comme dans bien dâ€™autres Ã©conomies avancÃ©es, il est prÃ©vu que le Canada fera face Ã une population Â«grisonnanteÂ» dans les dÃ©cennies Ã venir, du fait des baby-boomeurs qui prennent de lâ€™Ã¢ge et de la chute de la natalitÃ©. Quel impact le vieillissement de la population aura-t-il sur le marchÃ© du travail? Une Ã©tude intitulÃ©e Â«Les effets intertemporels et intersectoriels du vieillissement de la population : une Ã©valuation dâ€™un modÃ¨le dâ€™Ã©quilibre gÃ©nÃ©ral pour le CanadaÂ» par les membres affiliÃ©s du RCCMTC Nabil Annabi, Maxime FougÃ¨re et Simon Harvey (tous trois de Ressources humaines et DÃ©veloppement des compÃ©tences Canada - RHDCC) indique que le dÃ©clin projetÃ© de la croissance de la population active ferait pression sur le marchÃ© du travail, entraÃ®nant une augmentation des salaires et un dÃ©clin sans prÃ©cÃ©dent du chÃ´mage. Cependant, selon les auteurs, lâ€™impact varierait aux niveaux industriel et professionnel et causerait des effets distributifs importants.

O51|Lightning, IT Diffusion, and Economic Growth Across U.S. States| Empirically, a higher frequency of lightning strikes is associated with slower growth in labor productivity across the 48 contiguous U.S. states after 1990; before 1990, there is no correlation between growth and lightning. Other climate variables (e.g., temperature, rainfall, and tornadoes) do not conform to this pattern. A viable explanation is that lightning influences IT diffusion. By causing voltage spikes and dips, a higher frequency of ground strikes leads to damaged digital equipment and thus higher IT user costs. Accordingly, the flash density (strikes per square kilometer per year) should adversely affect the speed of IT diffusion. We find that lightning indeed seems to have slowed IT diffusion, conditional on standard controls. Hence, an increasing macroeconomic sensitivity to lightning may be due to the increasing importance of digital technologies for the growth process. © 2012 The President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
O51|Non-Balanced Growth and Production Technology Estimation|Capital-labor substitution and TFP estimates are essential features of many economic models. Such models typically embody a balanced growth path. This often leads researchers to estimate models imposing stringent prior choices on technical change. We demonstrate that estimation of the substitution elasticity and TFP growth can be substantially biased if technical progress is thereby mis-specified. We obtain analytical and simulation results in the context of a model consistent with balanced and near-balanced growth (i.e. departures from balanced growth but broadly stable factor shares). Given this evidence, a Constant Elasticity of Substitution production function system is then estimated for the US economy. Results show that the estimated substitution elasticity tends to be significantly lower using a factor-augmenting specification (well below one). We are also able to reject conventional neutrality forms in favor of general factor augmentation with a non-negligible capital-augmenting component. Our work thus provides insights into production and supply-side estimation in balanced-growth frameworks.
O51|Causes of mortality and development: Evidence from large health shocks in 20th century America|Exploiting pre-intervention variation in flu/pneumonia, tuberculosis and maternal mortality, together with time variation arising from medical breakthroughs starting in the late 1930s, this paper studies the aggregate impact of large health shocks across US states. The analysis demonstrates that the shocks influenced income per capita in different ways. While the shock to flu/pneumonia mortality has been conductive for development, the large reduction in the incidence of tuberculosis deaths has been a negative force in the development of US states over the second-half of 20th century. In addition, the decline in maternal mortality has a fragile, but positive relationship with income per capita. Because these specific health shocks affected mortality across the life cycle differently, the evidence here underscores the general tenet of regarding health as multifaceted.

In the end theauthor suggests proposals for improving specific audit performances in the area ofinformatics systems.
O51|A stakeholder empire: the political economy of Spanish imperial rule in America|This paper revises the traditional view of Spain as a predatory colonial state that extracted revenue from natural resources and populations in the Americas while offering little in return. Using 18th century Spanish American treasury accounts we show that local elites not only exerted important control over revenue collection as argued by (Irigoin/Grafe 2006) but also over expenditure allocation. Mirroring Elliot’s characterization of the English empire as a ‘stakeholder empire’ we contend that the Spanish colonial state developed into a stakeholder model, in which local interests were deeply invested in the survival and expansion of empire. The means of co-optation were intra-colonial transfers, as well as credit relations between the state and colonial individuals and corporations, which guaranteed that much of colonial revenue was immediately fed back into the local economy, while minimizing enforcements costs. By allowing stakeholder control of both revenue and expenditure Spain managed to avoid the problems faced by France where royal control of expenditure clashed with at least partial elite control of revenue raising (Velde/Weir 1992, Hoffman/Rosenthal 1997).<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
O51|Le capital-risque : un financement efficace de l'innovation sur le long terme|Venture capital is a long run investment that aims at fostering radical innovations and at increasing the innovative capacity of firms. The United States are by far the country that is the most innovative and the one that invests the greatest amount in venture capital whereas Europe and France stay behind. The explanations to the underinvestment in venture capital in France rely on the mismatch between demand and supply, the low expertise of venture capitalists and on the weak development of seed capital. We suggest policy measures to foster the development of an efficient venture capital industry that creates innovation. Classification JEL: G24, O31, O51, O52.
O51|A further step to understand income inequality in Chile: A decomposition using three-stages nested Theil index decomposition method|The previous literature identifies the high and persistent income inequality of Chile, but the geography of this inequality is still unexplored. To evaluate this dimension, we propose a three-stage decomposition of the Theil index at regional, province and county level. Our decomposition indicates that between 1992 and 2009, 21% of the inequality is attributable to these spatial scales. Inside of them, the highest inequality exists between counties and between regions, although they follow different patterns. The inequality between-counties fell from 65% to 53%. Oppositely, inequality between regions was 21% in 1992, and grew to 35% in 2009.
O51|USA nach der Wahl: Hat sich das Risiko des »Fiscal Cliff« erhöht? Welche Folgen sind zu befürchten?|Die USA haben gewählt und den amtierenden Präsidenten Barack Obama in seinem Amt bestätigt. Nach Ansicht von Josef Braml, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Auswärtige Politik (DGAP), Berlin, bleibt angesichts der auch für Barack Obamas zweiter Amtszeit absehbaren Blockade der politischen Gewalten und der daraus resultierenden fiskal- und handelspolitischen Beschränkungen die US-Notenbank die einzige handlungsfähige Institution, um aus der Wirtschaftskrise herauszuführen. Mit ihrem Finanzgebaren gefährde sie jedoch das »exorbitante Privileg« des Dollar und damit auch die Grundlage des auf Pump finanzierten amerikanischen Wirtschaftsmodells. Wenn nicht bis Jahresende eine überparteiliche Lösung im Kongress gefunden wird, droht den USA nach Meinung von Rudolf Besch, DekaBank, eine vermutlich kurze, aber durchaus heftige Rezession. Insbesondere im ersten Quartal 2013 würde dies einen Rückgang des Bruttoinlandsprodukts auf das Gesamtjahr hochgerechnet um über 10% nach sich ziehen. Für Bernd Weidensteiner, Commerzbank AG, ist ein plausibles Szenario, dass die USA zu Jahresbeginn zwar über die »fiskalische Klippe« stürzen. Der Kongress dürfte dann aber im Januar eine rückwirkende Verlängerung der Steuererleichterungen beschließen. Die USA würden dann zwar von der Klippe stürzen, dies wäre aber gleichsam ein »Bungee«-Sprung. Die realwirtschaftlichen Folgen würden sich in Grenzen halten, und den USA bliebe eine Rezession erspart.
O51|The Pattern of Foreign Market Entry of Canadian Exporters|This paper employs a unique large-scale longitudinal (1997-2005) dataset to investigate the pattern of foreign market entry by 6,079 Canadian exporters. We have found that fewer firms are choosing the United States as their initial export destination. This trend suggests that a growing number of firms are not following the traditional stage model of internationalization. Furthermore, our results suggest that government support should be targeted towards young and small Canadian-controlled firms, since they are more likely than established firms to encounter barriers and to gain benefits from exporting to a wider range of foreign markets.
O51|Does the Canadian economy suffer from Dutch disease?|We argue that the failure to disentangle the evolution of the Canadian currency from the U.S. currency leads to potentially incorrect conclusions regarding the case of Dutch disease in Canada. We propose a new approach that is aimed at extracting both currency components and energy- and commodity-price components from observed exchange rates and prices. We first analyze the separate influence of commodity prices on the Canadian and the U.S. currency components. We then estimate the separate impact of the two currency components on the shares of manufacturing employment in Canada. We show that between 33 and 39 per cent of the manufacturing employment loss that was due to exchange rate developments between 2002 and 2007 is related to the Dutch disease phenomenon. The remaining proportion of the employment loss can be ascribed to the weakness of the U.S.
O51|The Good Governance Indicators of the Millennium Challenge Account: How Many Dimensions are Really Being Measured?|This paper assesses the validity of the perception-based governance indicators used by the US Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) for aid allocation decisions. By conducting Explanatory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis of data from 1996 to 2009, we find that although the MCA purports to measure seven distinct dimensions of governance, only two discrete underlying dimensions, the perceived “participatory dimension of governance” and the perceived “overall quality of governance,” can be identified. Our results also show that some of the doubts that have been raised concerning the validity of perception-based governance indicators are less warranted when the indicators are applied exclusively to developing countries.
O51|Inbound International Tourism To The United States: A Panel Data Analysis|The objective of this paper is to analyze the demand for tourist arrivals to the United States, using the panel cointegration technique. The study attempts to identify and measure the impact of the main determinants of inbound international tourism flows to the United States. The study uses annual data from 1986 to 2011 for tourist arrivals from 50 major countries of tourist origin. The specified model includes several country-specific determinants. The panel unit root tests indicate all the variables are integrated of order one. The panel cointegration tests show that all seven test statistics reject the null hypothesis of no cointegration at the 1% significance level, indicating that the five variables are cointegrated. The results suggest that tourism demand to the United States must be considered as a luxury good and is highly dependent on the evolution of relative prices and cost of travel between origin and destination country. The results also show that tourism demand is elastic with respect to income but inelastic with respect to tourism price, real exchange rate, and travel costs.

In this paper we hypothesize that the way in which macroeconomic conditions affect inequality depends on how these conditions influence the constituents of total inequality: inequality of opportunity (IO) and inequality of effort (IE). Using the PSID database for the U.S. (1970-2009), we first decompose total inequality into these components. Then, we specify a dynamic model that relates each inequality component to a set of macroeconomic factors. Apart from real GDP and inflation rates, the most widely used factors in the literature, we also consider outstanding consumer credits and public welfare and health care expenditures. We find that real GDP and outstanding credits have a negative and significant effect upon IO and IE, while inflation has a positive and significant effect only on IE, and welfare expenditures have a negative and significant effect only on IO.
O51|Innovating global value chains : creation of the netbook market by Taiwanese firms|This paper explores the process of creation of the netbook market by Taiwanese firms as an example of a disruptive innovation by latecomer firms. As an analytical framework, I employ the global value chain perspective to capture the dynamics of vertical inter-firm relationships that drive some firms in the chain to change the status quo of the industry. I then divide the process of the emergence of the netbook market into three consecutive stages, i.e. (1) the launch of the first-generation netbook by a Taiwanese firm named ASUSTeK, (2) the response of the two powerful platform leaders of the industry, Intel and Microsoft Intel, to ASUSTeK’s innovation, and (3) the market entry by another powerful Taiwanese firm, Acer, and explain how Taiwanese firms broke the Intel-centric market and tapped into the market-creating innovation opportunities that had been suppressed by the two powerful platform leaders. I also show that the creation of the netbook industry was an evolutionary process in which a series of responses by different industry players led to changes in the status quo of the industry.
O51|The relationship between total factor productivity growth and employment: some evidence from a sample of European Regions|This paper provides a structural estimation of an equilibrium matching model with exogenous productivity growth on a sample of European Regions for the period 1976–2000. Using a three-stage least squares procedure, I estimate a simultaneous equation model for employment, wages and capital stock. The importance of the study of the relationship between growth and employment is due to the fact that the sign of this connection is not clear-cut. Theoretical models imply that the impact of productivity on employment is ambiguous. Furthermore, the empirical contributions are still not so many to reach a strong conclusion on the sign of the relationship above. This paper finds that the impact of productivity growth on employment is negative in the short-run and this effect remains negative even in the long-run. The implication of my results is that all new technology is embodied in new jobs and job creation plays no role in the employment dynamics of the sample I have considered.
