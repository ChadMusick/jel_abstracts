Y90|Evolutionism in Music History: toward Reconciliation|The first part of this paper identifies some of the reasons why evolutionism has been avoided in historical musicology in the Latin American context, including political ideologies, postcolonial studies, and philosophical positions. Moreover, nature has been used many times as an argument to validate music theory and musical hierarchies, causing the links between biology and musicology to be full of faults made by past thinkers. The second part presents some arguments derived from analysis, critically reviewing the objections to musical evolutionism and showing how these have misunderstood the basic principle of natural selection. The paper also discusses the possible claim of evolutionary biology as a useful tool in order to understand music history, while contributing to current discussions in music historiography.
Y90|Between a Combinative Perspective and Self-Contained Practice: A Critical Review of Ethnomethodology|Ethnomethodology (EM) brought a new vision to social studies by putting the construction of social reality through everyday life and practices of the members of society at the center and questioning what is taken granted conventionally in social research. However, it is doubtful if EM possesses a systematic and comprehensive approach to explain the social world extensively as a fully-fledged practice or framework of analysis. Moreover, it shows a very fragmented structure regarding the studies in the field. Based on these aspects, this article problematizes the extent of EM?s contribution to social analysis. The argument of this work is that it is not suitable to be considered a separate framework of social analysis due to the drawbacks mentioned; nevertheless it has a significant potential to contribute to the examination of social reality if it is integrated into the theoretical and/or methodological frameworks of social analyses as a perspective. The argument is defended through critical reading of the primary and secondary sources which deals with EM theoretically and also discussing some studies which can be regarded as its applications in social research.
Y90|Voluntourism as a Pro-Poor Tourism: A Case of Volunteer Tourism in Thailand|Volunteer tourism or voluntourism is a relatively new form of tourism which is viewed as a means for poverty reduction or an approach for pro-poor tourism in the developing countries. The primary aim of this research was to examine the role of volunteer tourism in poverty alleviation. It employed an interpretive paradigm utilizing qualitative data collection methods including semi-structured interviews and participant observation. The informants included twelve volunteer tourists who were on a working vacation in Thailand, and fifteen local residents in Thailand in the communities where volunteer tourism activities took place. The findings of the research indicate that in the point of view of both the volunteer tourists and the local residents, volunteer tourism could be used as an effective means to help reduce the state of poverty in the local communities. Specifically, volunteer tourism activities helped transfer of wealth as well as better skills and knowledge from rich or developed countries to poor or developing countries. It was also perceived as a means for providing unfortunate local people with an opportunity to learn English which will enable to have a better life in the future. The research findings provide tourism practitioners, especially those related to volunteer tourism, with insights on how to organize volunteer tourism in the way that that poor people can truly benefit from such tourism activity.

Y90|Overcrowded Housing and Relationship Break up|To what extent is there an association between housing density and divorce? And if so, is it a causal relationship? Housing space may affect the probability of divorcing because of stress, lower subjective well-being, and poor mental health, any of which could put pressure on the relationship with the partner and eventually cause a break-up. Using the Luxembourgish PSELL 2003-2014, we operationalize overcrowding with both an objective and a subjective measure. We check for the following confounding factors: financial difficulties, home ownership, and nationality. We find that there is no significant association between housing density and divorce once confounders are taken into account, not to mention causality. Instead, home ownership turns out to be of the utmost importance in explaining the bivariate association between housing density and union dissolution.
Y90|The governance, risk-taking, and performance of Islamic banks|Abstract We examine whether the difference in governance structures influences the risk taking and performance of Islamic banks compared to conventional banks. Using a sample of 52 Islamic banks and 104 conventional banks in 14 countries for the period from 2005 to 2013, we conclude that the governance structure in Islamic banks plays a crucial role in risk taking as well as financial performance that is distinct from conventional banks. Particularly, we show that the governance structure in Islamic banks allows them to take higher risks and achieve better performance because of product complexities and transaction mechanisms. However, Islamic banks maintain a higher capitalization compared to conventional banks. These results support the research on Islamic investment and risk taking. Our results add a new dimension to the governance research that could be a valuable source of knowledge for policy makers and regulators in the financial services sector.

Y90|Management Framework for the Visualization of Smart Monitoring Architectures Apply to Distributed Ubiquity Mobility Platform|Smart Mobility is proved to be a high priority topic in regard to arising European societal challenges. Deploying smart mobility required both technological and monitoring knowledge, and one important key features of the initiative stay in the multiplicity of the final users. Its goal is, depending on the type of users, to provide the required accurate data through a dynamic monitoring application. This implies to collect data coming from physical sensors deployed in all the parking areas of a region. Those sensors are simple, meaning that the information that they can collect is limited to an entry or exit signal of a vehicle. This paper presents an architecture for applying the visualization of smart monitoring architecture to a distributed ubiquity mobility platform and show a deployment in the frame of a use case. The later has been developed in a European region and consists in a smart mobility monitoring project.

Y90|The Old and New Forms of Political Filmmaking in Turkey|There are many ways of analysing films from a ?political? perspective. One common approach is to look at the ?content? of the film and classify it as ?political? if the film talks about a certain political event. This is an insufficent way of looking at films, as ?politics? can involve not only the ?content? of the film, but its very ?form?, philosophical depth, socio-political background, production conditions, audience relationship, marketing and so on. That?s why ?independent? cinema today is almost synonymous with ?progressive? or ?political? cinema even though the film may not center around an obvious political event. This paper aims at examining the ?political cinema? of Turkey starting after the 1960 Coup d?Etat. The short lived ?Social Realist? Movement had an overt political overtone as well as Y?lmaz Güney, who after 1970, made films focusing on the agonies of the working class. Reminiscent of Italian neo-realism with their minimalist styles, mostly non professional or lesser known actors and on location shooting, these films were clearer examples of a ?political? cinema in Turkey. After 1990s though, a novel look at ?socially engaged? cinema started to emerge as independent films replaced the old ?Ye?ilçam? productions. Ye?im Ustao?lu, Dervi? Zaim, Nuri Bilge Ceylan and Zeki Demirkubuz were among the most prominent filmmakers who had an ?indirect? relationship with politics. Nuri Bilge Ceylan, for example, hardly had anything overtly political in his films although his extreme emphasis on avoiding any contact with the ?film market? clearly indicated a subtle political choice. After the first ?wave? of independen cinema in Turkey which culminated with the international success of Distant at Cannes in 2003, a second wave emerged with younger filmmakers (including many female directors) who focused on the ?micro? political discourses of those marginalised from the ?decent? life of the ?neo-bourgeois?. Among them, Hüseyin Karabey, Orhan Eskiköy, Özgür Do?an, Pelin Esmer, Belmin Söylemez reflected those who had an ?accented? (in Hamid Naficy?s terms) lifestyles that, in a postmodern guise, pronounced a new political discourse mostly based on ?identity? problems.
Y90|An analysis on relationship between researchers' network and research impact using co-authorship network analysis|Many factors in organization and countries and personal characteristics influence performances of researchers. Many researchers suggested significant factors which is influencing publication of excellent papers. In this study, relationship between researcher?s network position and research impact was investigated. Nowadays, collaboration researches occurs more commonly since almost every research area are converging and it is more efficient than stand-alone research. Co-authorship network analysis using SCI papers was used to find out relationship between research impact and researchers? network. Number of highly cited papers is used as research impact and three centralities were used as each researcher?s network position.Regression analysis was used to verify relationship between research performances and network and result showed that researchers? network position can play an important role in produce more important and excellent publications empirically.
Y90|Historical Tourism : A Case Study of Muang Wiang Sa|The study of historical tourism: a case study of Muang Wiang Sa purposed to study community context, general situations about historical tourism, and historical tourism resources of Muang Wiang Sa, Wiang Sa district, Surat Thani province, Thailand. The method of this research was qualitative research by applying SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats). The key informants were from three groups; namely 1) executives and community leaders, 2) manufacturer and entrepreneur, and 3) representative local people in the community. The research instruments were an in-depth interview, documentaries and focus group. The findings indicated that: Muang Wiang Sa has valuable historical attractions. The existing community sages are ready to convey the knowledge to the young new generation. However, the community does not have high potential in the management of historical tourism and environmental conservation. The cooperation of the community in the management of tourism is at the high level. Basic infrastructure and facilities should be improved. The historical tourism plan should be made. Moreover, the collaboration of young generation in the community must be encouraged.

Y90|12th International Conference on Teaching, Education and Learning (ICTEL) in Mauritius|The 12th International Conference on Teaching, Education and Learning (ICTEL) was held on the 25th and 26th November 2016 at Middlesex University. In this hectic time closing this year, eight academics who also wrote research papers made a formal presentation of their work. Dr Banally of Global Research and Development Services (GRDS) acted as the moderator for all the presentations that took place on both days. The conference invited topics from various spheres of tertiary education while it allowed for a panoply of subjects to be treated. There could be a high level of convergence seen from the fact that traditional teaching methodology, though still persistent, should leave the way for modern student-focused learning. This should be coupled with high level of student interaction, the use of online technology, new methods of motivating modern learners and the need to understand generational shifts. A selective notes of conference is provided in the following paragraphs to highlight the diversity of topics treated by the various academics in this conference.
Y90|Inovac¸ão em servic¸os: estado da arte e perspectivas futuras<BR>[Innovation in services: state of the art and future perspectives]|Despite significant advances in research on innovation in services, there are still major challenges in this area. The purpose of this article is to analyse the state-of-the art on innovation in services, and point out some future possibilities. The method used was a bibliographic review. The results indicate that there is a transition taking place, where researchers are no longer trying to explain what innovation is (linked to a school of thought of the subject), but trying to explain how it occurs. Moreover, it is observed that the research trend is the study on innovation in services interconnected with other areas. Apesar dos importantes avanc¸os na pesquisa em inovac¸ão em servic¸os, essa área ainda tem desafios a serem superados. Nesse sentido, o objetivo deste artigo é analisar o estado da arte em inovac¸ão em servic¸os e apontar algumas possibilidades de pesquisas futuras. O método utilizado foi uma revisão bibliográfica. Os resultados indicam que há uma transic¸ão ocorrendo da temática, cujos pesquisadores não estão mais buscando explicar o que é inovac¸ão atrelada a uma escola de pensamento da disciplina, mas tentando explicar como o fenômeno ocorre. Além disso, observa-se que a tendência de pesquisa nessa área é o estudo da inovac¸ão em servic¸os e a sua interligac¸ão com outras áreas.
Y90|Reflexiones sobre los atisbos agroecológicos de Joaquín Costa a la luz de la actualización de su corpus agrario en las investigaciones de Gómez Benito y Ortí|This research aims to update the debate on collectivism, the agrarian question and populism in light of the publication of the new agricultural corpus of Joaquín Costa by Cristobal Gómez Benito and Alfonso Ortí. This updating process seeks to connect the restricted historical sense of costian collectivism with the new broad conceptualization of common goods. Seen from the current transdisciplinary agroecological approach, one may characterize such nineteenth-century collectivism as narodnist environmental regenerationism (using the arguments of Joan Martínez Alier). It seeks to challenge and confront the global food supply system that is in the hands of multinationals. In this sense, agroecology tries to avoid degradation caused by synthetic chemistry’s negative effects on the health of living beings and the gradual deterioration of communal ecological goods such as air, water, land and biodiversity. The conclusion of these reflexions shows that both agroecology and common goods offer similar strategies for breaking out of the enclosures generated by capitalism.
Y90|Two Oriental Images of Istanbul: Robbe-Grillet?s \|This paper aims at comparing Alain Robbe-Grillet?s L?Immortelle (1963) and Metin Erksan?s Time To Love (1966) in terms of their reflection of Istanbul that occupies a central place within the plots of both films. While the image they develop for the city is basically an ?Oriental image? that excludes the documentary, realistic aspects, their orientalism diverge greatly. Erksan wishes to retreat from the Westernized modern life of Istanbul and thus sublimates old Eastern philosophical traditions to find some Platonic ?truthfulness? within the old imperial city (Dersaadet). Grillet, on the other hand, in search for the immortal passion and exoticism, recreates the Oriental ?myth? of Istanbul within a modernist guise. The parallel depiction of female heroines and urban space in both films also reflect the ?self-reflexive? relation between the ?male gaze? and the reconstruction of the orientalist discourse through female subjectivity.
Y90|The applicability of adopting European Union?s integration model in South Asia: A comparative analysis of European Union and South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation|The European integration is three decades older than the South Asian integration. European Union stands as an outstanding regional body even though South Asian Association for regional Cooperation is still struggling to achieve the basic premises of economic integration. The aim of this paper is to comparatively analyze the two regional integrations and to identify how far is it appropriate to adopt the European integration model to accelerate the South Asian integration. One specific objective is to identify the core differences between the two regional settings and next objective is to determine the theoretical relevance of certain existing theories in describing the two integration processes. Another specific objective is to evaluate the suitability of adopting European Union model in South Asia and to recommend necessary reforms for better integration in South Asia.Data triangulation method has been used to accumulate secondary data from multiple sources available in electronic and printed form including books, journals, web, reports, historical records and treaties. Qualitative content analysis has been used since this is a documentary analysis and Content analysis evaluate document texts and to test theoretical relevance to understand data more comprehensively and scientifically. It will test prevailing theories in different contexts when compare the categories of different settings. Key findings depicts that there is a sharp diversity between the European Union and South Asia in terms of trade, economic development, human development, industrialization, urbanization, trade liberalization, income levels, poverty alleviation and political integration. Amidst these differences the applicability of adopting the European model proves to be a failure due to many factors. The democratic nature of the countries and their practice of free market economic policies along with the successful resolutions for political tensions in Europe significantly caused the long term success of European integration whereas South Asian countries are suffering from huge diversities in economic, geographic, cultural, trade and military terms within the region and hesitate to co-operate with one another due to these differences. Indo-Pakistan political tensions blended with smaller states? fear psychosis of Indian hegemony is the greatest constraint for better integration in South Asia. South Asia required rearranging the structure of its regional organization and opening avenues to discuss contentious issues among member states. Establishment of real democracies and reliable interactions among people to people contacts while adopting more comprehensive free market economic policies domestically would facilitate the economic and political integration of South Asia in the future.

However, the extent of their productive impacts is not yet analysed in great detail. The objective of this study is to estimate the productive impacts of cash transfer (old age allowance, allowances for the widowed, destitute and deserted women) and conditional cash transfer programs (stipend for primary students, secondary students and a combination of CFW, FFW, VGD, and 100 days employment scheme) in Bangladesh. The study used the HIES 2010 data. The study used PSM method. The outcome variables were i) labor allocation changes, ii) income generating activities, iii) investments in land, tools, animals, family enterprises, durable goods and housing, iv) investments in human capital, and v) coping mechanisms. Results show that different programs are producing different outcomes. So, policy makers should implement a number of interventions simultaneously to serve the needy.
Y90|Analyzing Consumer Demand During a Food Scandal: The Case of Dioxin Contaminated Feed in Germany and the Media| This study investigates the effect of media coverage on the consumer demand for pork chops and chicken filet in the course of the German dioxin scandal in 2011. A media index is constructed to account for the dynamics of the media coverage for the first nineteen calendar weeks in 2011. The response of the German households is estimated with a dynamic correlated random effect Tobit model based on weekly panel data provided by the GfK and data on media coverage provided by Lexis Nexis. Our dataset contains detailed information on purchasing transactions and socio-economic characteristics of the consumer households. The empirical results show that unobserved heterogeneity is important to consider when analyzing the determinants of demand in times of a scandal. For both meat products, media had a significant negative effect on the propensity to consume as well as the quantity purchased.

A group of students from mechanical engineering from Instituto TecnolÃ³gico de Celaya has developed over the past three years a prototype of human powered vehicle innovative, efficient and economical, which have been involved in various HPVCâ€™s, thus leading to the presence of their institution of affiliation in international events, as well as extremely enriching extracurricular experiences in their professional training.
Y90|Advocating For Integrating Business Intelligence In Virtual Communities Of Practice|In the age of information and technology, Virtual Communities of Practice represent a reachable, cost effective and viable solution. For their advantages, they become more popular between the members of the cluster communities that share the same interest. Virtual Communities of Practice bring together people through online platforms and put them into the collaborative relation, so that they can share, learn, experiment and improve their activity. To this, there is always an informational input came from document resources shared into the community. But the challenge come with the management of this hole information and the use of it in order to go further and use the proper information to obtain knowledge and take decisions. For this, in our paper, we propose a model of using Business Intelligence into Virtual Communities of Practice, focusing on the advantages that this approach brings not only to the virtual community, but also to the local communities, improving their activities and being an innovation accelerator.
Y90|Threshold Of Significance In Stress Management|Stress management is the individual's ability to handle any situation, external conditions, to match the demands of the external environment. The researchers revealed several stages in the stress response. A first phase was called ‘‘alert reaction'' or ‘‘immediate reaction to stress‘‘, phase in which there are physiological modifications and manifestations that occur under psychological aspect. Adaptation phase is the phase in which the reactions from the first phase diminishes or disappears. Exhaustion phase is related to the diversity of stress factors and time and may exceed the resources of the human body to adapt. Influencing factors may be: limited, cognitive, perceptual, and a priori. But there is a threshold of significance in stress management. Once the reaction to external stimuli occurs, awareness is needed. The capability effect occurs, any side effect goes away and comes out the ''I AM'' effect.
Y90|Power, National Unity, and Territorial Integrity: the Cases of Russia's Chechnya and Ukraine's Crimea|Perhaps, in the age of globalization, the concepts of national unity and territorial integrity sound to many of us like obsolete terms, although they are still important to international law. But, no matter whether they remain essential or worthless they are equally applicable to both Russia and Ukraine. This paper discusses Russia's stern approach to strangle the freedom aspirations in Chechnya to preserve its own territorial integrity, while avidly pushing Crimean Russians to separating from Ukraine thereby ruining its national unity. While the political scientists talk about an increasingly integrated contemporary world in which the concept of power loses its classical meaning, Russia's brute force-based aggressive policies towards Ukraine refute the arguments that traditional state forms have disappeared. The cases of Crimea and Chechnya have many similarities, however Russia's approach to them has been very different.
Y90|Historical-Anthropological Ethno-Genesis of Albanian Society Development, Especially the Gjakovar with Surrounding One|Albanian society inherits an ethno-genesis since ancient ages. Part of this, is also the Gjakovar society with surrounding. Through development phases, as many other societies, this one faced with challenges from the most different. Among the main ones was the war for surviving from numerous invaders, and that until the last decade of the 20th century. Of course that all of them who had claims toward these lands, they tried through different ways, to make the history of this society as their own, alluding that this population wasn't existent in this land. However, the Albanian society managed to survive all historical periods and that by keeping its genesis clear. It had been achieved through 'inherits' guides of traditions and culture over generations, and that, leaving deep footprints not only for itself, but even for the stories of neighbor societies. So, through this study, we will try to tell how the society of Gjakova region has kept its ethno-genesis, proving that it was a unique part of Albanian society and that was one of the very first in Europe. We will prove it through showing historical-anthropological fact since the antiquity to the newest artifacts. To clarify that this population is really autochthonous in this land, it is told also by saving and taking-after the cultural heritage. As an argument it is also the keeping of surnames based on cultivated artisans through ages, which are still being held by a part of this population.
Y90|Reflections on Movement Patriotic in Elbasan in the Years 1909-1910|The development of education in the Albanian territories under Ottoman Empire witnessed a rapid evolution after the announcement of Hyrjetit (the Turkish Constitution of 1908). Thus, in the years 1909-1910 patriotic movement in the Albanian territories will mark a new phase of her, revealed at the opening of schools and courses in Albanian language in the new conditions of constitutional freedoms. In this period, through the organization of the Congress of Monastir displayed in 1908, was unveiled final resolution of the case and the use of a common alphabet writing Albanian language. But despite such a situation, Albanians will not enjoyed for a long period of so-called constitutional freedom. The Young Turks (Young Turks) newly consolidated their political positions in the Ottoman Empire, tried with any form to prevent the spread of great little bit he received learning Albanian. In the years 1909 - 1910, the Albanian National Movement difficulties faced even greater. Through this work we aim to highlight not only the achievements of the patriotic movement in the region of Elbasan Albanian education center, but most are focused on coverage of issues; obstacles and difficulties faced by the patriotic movement in this region in the years 1909-1910. The Young Turks use of all forms and, using all opportunities to curb educational movement in the region of Elbasan, using new tactics more sophisticated you put sticks under the Elbasan Patriots wheels. But it must be said that at the same time, taking advantage of the weaknesses of the Albanian patriotic movement, contradictions and differences that existed between the Albanian political elite of the time. Meanwhile, in moments when new tactics did not give the expected result, they turned to old methods of violence and terror.
Y90|Whatever Explains Whatever: The Duhem-Quine Thesis And Conventional Quantitative Methods In Political Science|The paper (for the first time, to the best knowledge of the author) applies the Duhem-Quine thesis to conventional quantitative methods in political science. As a result, the discussion of methodological problems associated with these methods is implanted into the epistemological issues highlighted by the Duhem-Quine thesis. Such a link between popular political science methods and philosophy of science could help clarify the difficulties of the former and give impetus to the improved research practices
Y90|Total Factor Productivity and the Institutional Possibility Frontier: An Outline of a Link between Two Theoretical Perspectives on Institutions, Culture and Long Run Growth|The paper proposes an outline for the link between two theoretical perspectives on the prerequisites of high institutional quality and long run growth. One framework is based on the tradeoff between disorder and dictatorship and introduces the notion of the institutional possibility frontier, another perspective focuses upon the role of total factor productivity as a parameter underlying long run growth. The connection between these frameworks is proposed and elaborated. The paper sheds some light on the nature of total factor productivity and designates the directions for further research on fundamental conditions of high-quality development
Y90|Participant Motivations In A Social Media Community Page|Recently there has been explosive growth in both the global reach and easy access to online social media content. However, peopleâ€™s motivations for using social media vary considerably from individual to individual. Attempting to gain a greater understanding of what motivates people to use social media is of interest to content providers and administrators of social media platforms such as online community pages, who wish to appeal to their current members and attract a wider audience. Means-end theory explores the abstract relationship between a productâ€™s attributes, the consequences or benefits gained from that product, and personal values guiding individuals to use a particular product. This exploratory study uses softladdering interviews and a hard-laddering survey method to create means-end chains and a subsequent Hierarchical Value Map. We use this information to illustrate the shared values of a sample of group members of an online community page. The results of the study were used to understand individualâ€™s motivations for joining the page. The study concludes with practical suggestions for marketing the community page to appeal to the current memberâ€™s shared values. We believe this approach will create a wider and more loyal group to the page

Y90|The Use Of English-Loan Words In The Information Technology Domain|This paper examines the phenomenon of linguistic borrowings in general and the use of anglicisms in particular, in the contexts of globalization and the progress made in different domains, especially in the Information Technology domain. Borrowing is the phenomenon which undertakes the word transmission process from one language into another among the connected communities. The language that lends is the donor or the borrower language, and the language that borrows is known as the receptor or the borrowing language. Anglicisms are the English-loan words that are present in many European languages. The phenomenon of globalisation is the main topic of several contradictory and polarization discussions and undoubtedly globalisation is necessary and it is a fact in today’s world but the question is: what will be the long-term language consequences? There might be two situations: the consequences may be positive, such as ease of communication and perception, language economics and also negative: not understanding anglicisms resulting in disturbed communication, rejection of anglicisms, loss of semantic diversity of your own language, less and less possibilities of expressing yourself in your own language. We can mention that responsible for the impact of English is the prestige associated with this language. This language is generally held in highest regard by the younger generation of Romanians, who are easily influenced by the television, radio, movies, and other media that are supplied by British and American entertainment, which are considered to be trendy and cool. Each of those resources has influenced the Romanian population on numerous levels, creating new words and phrases in the Romanian language. In order to illustrate and discuss the pertinent or, on the contrary, the unjustified use of English-loan words in the field of Information Technology, the study will focus on a selection of articles published in the electronic Romanian issues of two computer and communications magazines – namely Chip Magazine and PC World. Different stances, adopted in relation to the phenomenon mentioned above, and the understanding of two groups of Romanian readers (students at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, University of Oradea) will be presented.

Y90|The Energy Issues: A Corpus-Based Analysis|The energy-related issues have become of paramount importance in recent years due to the exhaustion of fossil fuel resources, their price variations and political dependence on nations with role of energy providers. In addition, the changing in climate conditions requires reduction emissions of greenhouse gases. Therefore, this paper proposes and assesses the novel idea of using constructions as a unit of analysis for corpus-based discourse analysis in the energy field. This article will use a standard method in linguistics to quantitatively investigate academic writings from both a lexical and a stylistic perspective. The present research paper aims to add to the knowledge about energy issues by conducting a data-driven analysis of economic academic discourse, through three periods of time and using secondary data analysis. The findings suggest the evolution of the energy sector throughout time and they gave interesting and different insights into the content of the discourses and enabled better comparison of corpora.
Y90|Honour Killings in Turkey|This academic work will look at the ?honour killings? in Turkey. An honour killing is the homicide of an individual due to the perpetrators' belief that the victim has violated the principles of a family or a community or a religion. Honour killings have a long tradition in Turkey. It is also a strong concern that many suicides of women could be honored crimes, especially in eastern and southeastern Turkey, with the family forcing the victim to commit suicide. Hoping to join the EU, Turkey has strengthened the punishment for honour crimes. Despite the legal reforms, the violence against women in the name of honour and tradition has continued. This paper will discuss challenges and solutions to the problem. In addition to academic works, the paper will be based on sources from the media.
Y90|Sex and Enslaved Manhood|"This paper focuses on the sexual abuse and exploitation of enslaved men in America. I am in the process of expanding into a book my published article, ""Sexual Abuse of Black Men Under American Slavery,"" (Journal of the History of Sexuality). This paper will specifically focus on the issues of ideals of consent and choice as well as examples of force and coercion with regard to cross-status relationships (primarily between white women and enslaved men) as well as interactions between men. The primary sources for this paper include the WPA slave narratives as well as court records, and manuscript and published sources and accounts. Studying the sexual exploitation of enslaved men, contributes to the scholarship on gender and sexuality in early America, to our understanding of slavery and slave life, to literature on black masculinity, and also to literature examining historicisation of rape."
Y90|Challenging the Writer?s Authority: A study of the Participatory Creative Process of the Malay Novelists|The participatory of a reader in the participatory creative process that involves the media convergence has challenged the authority of the writer. This development is further enhanced with the influence of commercialism in the writing of popular novel. But to what extent it is true? This paper will examine the participatory creative process of two Malay novelists who write popular novels. They are Ain Maisarah and Wan Iman Wan Mohd Nazi. The theory of participatory creative process which comprises of three principles, namely, media convergence, participatory cultural and emotional intelligence will be applied in this study. The method used is, textual analysis involving novel analysis and social media. The study found that the novelists still have their authority over their works although there is a huge drive of commercialism in the writing of the popular novels.
Y90|From Hollywood to ancient Thrace: two types of artistic reception of Antiquity|The text explores the way ancient literary, historical or mythological stories and personages are being used in modernity. The research focuses on two types of artistic reception of the epoch. The first one is the representation of ancient stories in the frames of culture industry: it explores some cinematographic implementations of ancient stories explaining the differences between the literary sources and their modern interpretations. Some emblematic examples illustrate the social or political allusions which are to be recognized in the modern artistic representations of ancient stories. The second part of the text explores local Bulgarian festivals that include some ancient divine or heroic personage, e. g. Dionysos, Sabasius, Roman warriors, etc. The slightly altered focus of the research is due to the lack of significant cinematographic representations of antiquity in modern Bulgaria. Nevertheless, the importance of local festivals ?reconstructing? or merely related to ancient rituals constantly increases in the last few years. The explored cases include for instance traditional ?Roman? festivals celebrating the might of Roman army located in ancient provinces Thrace and Dacia (covering the territory of modern Bulgaria), some religious feasts connecting ?ancient? elements and personages with Christian saints and traditional folklore practices, etc. The curious amalgam of various religious rituals is interpreted in terms of the attempt to ?reconstruct?, i. e. to compose the past in order to gain local prestige and to fabricate a coherent religious, cultural and even political history of Bulgaria.

Y90|Limits of Positive Language|Numerous works of practical psychology urges to form positive thinking and have a positive language, sometimes proving optimism led to the extent possible, given that there are less publicized studies on the limits of these practices or on some effects, contrary to popular belief. Although we are promoters of positive language, we propose that, by means of this article, to point out some aspects regarding the risks of using without discrimination of this type of communication having unrealistic expectations. Our study is based on published results of research in this regard, then focusing on domestic issues that can define the context in which positive language has its undesirable consequences. For example, although the praise encourages and criticism demoralizes, not all praises fulfill the same role as between praise and criticism, there are many possible attitudes.
Y90|How Coffee Companies Can Stay Competitive|The coffee shop industry in the U.S. includes 20,000 stores with combined annual revenue of about $11 billion. Major companies include Starbucks, Dunkin’ Donuts, Caribou, Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, and Diedrich (Gloria Jean’s). The industry is highly concentrated at the top and fragmented at the bottom: the top 50 companies have over 70 percent of industry sales. Coffee is one of the world’s largest commodities. The top green coffee producing countries are Brazil, Colombia, and Vietnam. Many grower countries are small, poor developing nations that depend on coffee to sustain local economies. The U.S. is the world’s largest importer of green coffee beans and the largest consumer of coffee. The main objective of this study is to investigate the competitive strategies that U.S. coffee franchise companies adopt considering customers’ expectations and industry best practices. In order to achieve this objective, a best practice benchmarking analysis was performed taking into account the top U.S. coffee companies. This analysis showed that product and service innovation are necessary in order to stay competitive in the market and attract new or to keep existing customers successfully. Many customers focus on the special atmosphere each store has and which is characterized by the location, music, interior design, seating or whether internet access is provided. Particularly for specialty coffee shops it is important not to sell only the beverage but the whole experience. Coffee shops have to establish a unique image that prevents customers from buying products from another shop or use home-brewing systems which are also on the rise in American households. In addressing the increased level of competition, every company’s focus should be on differentiating from the rest of the market in every possible business segment (products, atmosphere, location, image etc.).

Y90|Business English Outside The Box. Business Jargon And Abbreviations In Business Communication|Business English is commonly understood language, yet Harvard Business Review called business jargon “The Silent Killer of Big Companies”. As we all have been taught in school, we are aware of the fact that in communication we must comply with linguistic rules so that our message gets across succinctly. Yet, there is one place where all these rules can be omitted (at least in the recent decades): the corporate office. Here, one can use euphemisms and clichés, can capitalize any word that is considered important, the passive voice is used wherever possible and abbreviations occur in every sentence. The worst part is that all of these linguistic enormities are carried out deliberately. The purpose of this paper is to analyse to what extent business jargon and abbreviations have affected business communication (which most of the time, it is filled with opaque language to mask different activities and operations) and the reasons for which these linguistic phenomena have become so successful in the present. One of the reasons for the research is that in business English, jargon can be annoying because it overcomplicates. It is frequently unnecessary and it can transform a simple idea or instruction into something very confusing. It is true that every field has its jargon. Education, journalism, law, politics, medicine, urban planning – no filed is immune. Yet, it seems that business jargon has been described as “the most annoying”. Another reason is that jargon tends to be elitist. Those who do not understand the terms feel confused and uncertain. The paper starts with defining these two concepts, business jargon and abbreviations, and then it attempts to explain the “unusual” pervasion of these, both in business communication and in everyday communication. For this, the paper includes a list with the most common business jargon and abbreviations. In this view, the authors have accessed different economic blogs and specialty journals. Then, it continues with the presentation of the results of a survey which was applied to Economics students regarding the extent to which communication, with emphasis on business communication, is affected by the use of business jargon and abbreviations.
Y90|The Impact Of Social Media On Vocabulary Learning|The paper aims at investigating the impact of computer and social media in improving students’ knowledge of English language namely vocabulary acquisition (focused on Facebook) with intermediate and upper intermediate first and second year ELT students in Economics at the Faculty of Economic Sciences, University of Oradea. Social media technologies take on many different forms including magazines, Internet forums, weblogs, social blogs, wikis, social networks, podcasts, pictures, videos etc. Technologies cover blogging, picture-sharing, wall-posting, music-sharing just to name a few. Nowadays Facebook technology seems to play an important part for the social life of so many becoming more and more popular as a main means of communication, that it could also meet an educational need. Thus it could play a distinguished role in foreign language learning and teaching. Several studies investigate using different technologies in learning and teaching, in particular, foreign language learning. Still, rare studies were interested precisely in the role of Facebook in learning foreign languages. In this study was intended to assess the role and effectiveness of Facebook use in vocabulary learning. Particularly, the research attempts to answer the question: ‘Can social media affect students’ development and progress in the foreign language?’ In order to discover the answer to this question of the study, a project based on Facebook for the experimental group was conceived. It was assumed that significant differences were to be found between the groups using social media for learning purposes and those who did not in developing vocabulary knowledge. The study was conducted with a number of 127 students of the Faculty of Economic Sciences, University of Oradea, 1st and 2nd year students following the specializations: International Business, Management, Marketing, Finances studying in the academic year 2013-2014. The development in each group was measured and it clearly demonstrated a more significant improvement in vocabulary knowledge of the group exposed to the Facebook group. It is a rather innovative study as there are not many similar studies using the value Facebook can add to learning performed in Romania. The results of the study did not support the assumption that the experimental group would outperform the control group, as the differences between the two groups were not that significant. However, there was an improvement in both of the groups from pre-test to post-test scores.
Y90|Historical, Political and Ideological Influences in Translating Literature for Children|The relationship between history and the translation of children’s literature refers on the one hand to the historical development of scholarly interest in the field and on the other hand to the revolutionary changes in the society’s perception of children and childhood. This paper aims at shedding some light upon both aspects with an emphasis upon the influence of politics and ideology in translating literature for children. The foregrounding idea is that any translation implies some degree of manipulation which is even greater in the case of children’s literature translation due to the didactic, ideological, moral, ethical and religious norms involved in the process.
Y90|Economic Science: From the Ideal Gas Law Economy to Piketty and Beyond|I start with income and wealth inequality data from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and Thomas Piketty, and propose approaches taken from science (for example, behavioral evolution theory,) that might be useful in explaining the data and forecasting future economic events. Using a modified production function developed by Robert Solow, I also explore redistributive effects of income when biological restrictions lead to minimum expenditure requirements and satiation conditions. I conclude that redistributing income from the wealthy to the poor can have counter-cyclical effects in recessions. Moreover, redistribution in the form of human capital can have particularly large positive economic growth effects. Finally, I explain how financial crisis may lead to large economic downturns by proposing a model where productive capital formation is dependent on debt financing.
Y90|Management skills for Library Managers in Improving the Library Performance|The effectiveness of organization in achieving its objectives can be employed by applying management knowledge to management functions. However, current studies show the lack of management skills among managers which could lead to undesirable circumstances and reduce the staff satisfaction especially in performing their roles correctly. In this study, the management skills that are required by managers in the Malaysian university?s library are investigated. This is due to the importance of the library as the main function for supporting research and development of universities. The study aims to identify problem occurs when the managers fail to perform decisions in the university?s library. The management skills typology differences are compared based on demographics factors including age, gender, experience and management rank. The respondents are selected from ten libraries from public universities in Malaysia. Five research university?s libraries and five non-research universities libraries are compared. These libraries are selected based on the university rank listed by the Ministry of Education in Malaysia. This study employed a quantitative approach of structured questionnaire to investigate the management skills possessed by the respondents. A qualitative semi-structured interview is then conducted to support the findings from the aforementioned approach.
Y90|Racism in Canadian Elementary School History and Social Studies Textbooks|Do Manitoba elementary schools? history and social studies textbooks contain racist knowledge towards Indigenous peoples in Canada? Data is collected from a range of textbooks that are published between 1960 and 2013; all were found in schools? libraries and classrooms within the past year. Youth are using even the dated books for research, and therefore consider them legitimate academic sources. The more recent publications are listed on the Manitoba Textbook Bureau, a government agency that designates acceptable books for teachers to use in the province. Surveying these textbooks illuminates various problematic ways that race and Indigenous peoples are taught and portrayed. Older textbooks rely on overtly racist rhetoric, such as labelling Indigenous peoples ?barbarians,? ?Noble Savages,? or suggesting that white settlers were the first people to live in Canada. More recent textbooks move away from this open racism towards a new subtle racism that blurs the lines between learned cultural traits and biological characteristics, essentializing social features. The notion that skin colour provides any deep genetic meaning has long been scientifically disproven. A result of this new, covert racism found in schools? textbooks, combined with the accessibility of old overtly racist ones, is that racialized thinking becomes normalized amongst youth early on.
Y90|Politics and Literature in Turkish Historical Novel: Kemal Tahir, Atilla ?lhan and A.H. Tanp?nar|"Literature is an important component of a community?s culture.The relationship between literature and culture is a complex one: literature shapes a given culture and in turn is shaped by it. A literary piece of work is not the solitary production of the writer whose sole incitement is inspiration. Quite the contrary, literature is not neutral vis a vis the cultural and political requirements of its community. In fact culture itself is in no way immune from the surrounding ideology and politics of identity. This means that literature, culture and politics(of identity) are inseparable from each other and they all constitute different circles of the same chain of knowledge. This presentation will focus on the works of three famous Turkish writers namely Ahmed Hamdi Tanp?nar,(Saatleri Ayarlama Enstitüsü-The Society for Setting Clocks, 1961 ) Kemal Tahir (Devlet Ana, 1967) and Atilla Ilhan (Dersaadet?te Sabah Ezanlar?, Morning Prayers in Istanbul, 1981) whose historical novels are the best examples of the complex relationship between literature, culture and politics of identity formation. Ahmet Hamdi Tanp?nar's Saatleri Ayarlama Enstitüsü is an allegorical novel criticizing various aspects of the Kemalist Ideology. The present analysis will mostly concentrate on the ""leadership aspect"" of Kemalism that Tanp?nar implicitly criticizes. The ""father complex"" he talks about is the most controversial aspect of the Kemalist ideology. Kemal Tahir's Devlet Ana, on the other hand, is no doubt one of the most influential historical-novels of the late-Republican Era. In a sense it exemplifies Tzvetan Todorov's emphasis on how a novel can be more influential than a mere history book in propagating a peculiar understanding of history. Kemal Tahir's aim here is to transfer his philosophy of nationalism to the reader via a history novel based on a myth. Atilla Ilhan?s Dersaadet?te Sabah Ezanlar? is also a historical novel. Similar to Kemal Tahir?s Devlet Ana, this novel also constitutes a good example of Todorov?s emphasis on literature and history. Similar to Devlet Ana, its language and narrative style gives us the impression that the author(or more truly the narrator) does in fact live in those days with these people(there exists a reality effect, the impression of reality which substitutes truth with fiction). To increase this impression of reality, both authors(Tahir and ?lhan) adds some familiar(but somehow obscure, even mystical) figures among the protagonists."
Y90|Political Power, Resistance and Squares|Capitalism has emerged along with cities, and cities constitute the agent of its development. The design, construction, formation and usage of urban spaces are very important for capitalist production. In that sense, the struggle for space is a struggle between the ruler and the ruled. Squares are one of the places where this struggle becomes concrete and visible. This fight transforms the squares continuously.The government which applies neoliberal policies and the public emerge as the agents of this transformation. Neoliberal policies and the authoritarian tendencies which are attached to it may be the dynamics of the struggle. The dynamics of people?s struggles for the squares contain different demands that range from reforms to total transformation of the system.Squares are one of the places where this struggle occurs in Turkey, just like other countries. Therefore, the government endeavors to keep urban squares under control at all times. ?stanbul Taksim Square is an example of this. In this study, the struggles which take place in relation to squares, particularly the Taksim Square, is discussed. 1st of May and Taksim Gezi Park protests which occurred in 2013 are examined in this perspective.
Y90|The Dynamics of Conflict in Southern Thailand|The prolonged insurgency in Southern Thailand has claimed thousands of victims since the outbreak of major violence in 2004. Drawing on a unique data set covering all violent incidents since 2004, a hotspot analysis shows that the bulk of the violence is concentrated in clusters of sub-districts forming hotbeds of conflict. Drivers of conflict are identified through a comparative analysis of the hotspots of violence with less violent areas. The analysis shows that identity manifested in language use and religious practices (rather than international borders, infrastructure, and physical geography) influence the prevalence and patterns of violence. © 2014 The Earth Institute at Columbia University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Y90|Lexical Items which Ennobles Wallachian Ethos|There is, in the Wallachian dialect, a few words which give its specificity and ennobles it. They are not found in the rest of dialects and may be considered idiomatic, because they are untranslatable (in the sense of total equivalence). Some are lexemes with the singular form, others are new meanings of some existing phrases in Romanian literary. Popularization of these lexical items through this article aims at knowledge and their integration into generalized use of the Romanian language, pointing their idiomatic character. The Wallachian dialect should not be regarded as having privileged status among other dialects, but as a linguistic resource that allows nuanced and creative expression at the national.

Y90|Economy, Economics, Economic, Economical|To speak and understand a language means - among many other things - knowing the words of that language. The average speaker knows, hears, understands and uses thousands of words daily. But does he use them appropriately? That is why this paper is about words and meanings. More specifically, it deals with the internal structure of complex words, i.e. derivatives. The purpose of the paper is to enable students and potentially other individuals dealing with English language on business basis to engage in their own analyses of some aspects of the language, namely the family tree of the word economy. After having read the paper, the reader should be familiar with the necessary knowledge regarding differences between meanings, misuse and actual sense of words deriving from economy, be able to systematically analyze data and relate his own findings on theoretical language problems. English is used by hundreds of millions speakers and still there is always need for improving our knowledge continuously. Knowing and speaking approximate English may not be enough at an advanced level as in the case of students who prepare themselves for careers that involve proficient communication in a foreign language on specific business issues. This is where the idea of such a paper appeared: students of the Faculty of Economic Sciences talk about economy and all the other terms deriving from it, with approximate knowledge of their meaning, without even being aware that some ‘minor’ suffixes like –ic, -ical, -ics etc. really matter and do make a difference. Consequently, we started our teaching of Business English lecture in September 2012 with a working sheet based on the terms economic/ economical/ economics/ economy to assess students’ awareness of these terms. The result was not a surprise as more than 90% misused economical instead of economic. That seemed a perfect introduction for students in economics. From that moment on, the building of their specific vocabulary could start.
Y90|Methodological Misconceptions in the Social Sciences. Rethinking social thought and social processes|Contemporary social teaching suffers from a grave deficiency: it is lacking rules of methodology and procedure suited to social reality that are, in particular, able to reconcile increasing creativity (implying irreversibility) with rationality, which are indispensable for the scientific judgement of theoretical ideas. Unfortunately, this lack is largely ignored, and eminent social scholars have even explicitly and emphatically theorized a rejection of method. This allows rhetorical and literary skills to prevail over the reasons of science, thereby promoting a deceptive instead of constructive pluralism, confusion in the study of contemporary societies and growing ineptitude in their government, what represents a main source of afflictions in the present world. Method is a two-edged sword: it offers powerful assistance in and enhances our capability of understanding and solving the problems of everyday life; but if the chosen method is inappropriate,it can seriously obstruct the advancement of knowledge. Significantly, the best contributions to social knowledge have been ad hoc studies that disregard method and simply apply common sense. But ad hoc studies suffer a lack of coordination, and the neglect of method makes it difficult to evaluate and select findings and results. As a consequence, ad hoc analyses have little chance of stimulating the cumulative growth of knowledge. However, the present study is intended as a contribution that prevents method from becoming a prison for the mind as opposed to a stimulant of creativity and knowledge.

Y90|Trajectories of Regime Transformation and Types of Stateness in Post-Communist Countries|It is commonplace that a sovereign state is a prerequisite to democracy. But not all states are alike, each having different resources, capacities, priorities, properties, and so forth. What kinds of states and what particular features are conducive to democracy or autocracy? How do different types of stateness and their dynamics relate to different trajectories of regime transformation in post-communist countries? In light of the significant debate in comparative politics regarding the importance of structural and procedural (actor-oriented) factors in democratization and democratic consolidation, we address the effect of stateness on regime transformations in a broad framework, allowing us to specify the role of structural conditions and the decisions of key political actors in post-communist regime change. The focus of this research is empirical, implementing a combination of qualitative comparative and multivariate statistical methods in order to study a sample of post-communist countries from the two past decades. This Working Paper is an output of a research project implemented as part of the Basic Research Program at the National Research University Higher School of Economics.
Y90|(Re-)Bulding the Ship of State at Sea? State Capacity and Regime Dynamics in Post-Communist Countries|The relationship between stateness and state capacity, on the one hand, and political regimes and their dynamics, on the other, has received increasing attention in comparative politics in recent years. Though empirical research does not provide consistent findings, arguments currently under discussion vary from “stateness first” (democratization only after effective state-building) to “building or rebuilding the ship of state while at sea” (state-building and democratization as complements). Several studies reveal a J-curve link connecting autocracy and democracy to levels of state capacity, implying that autocratic regimes have higher state capacity than hybrid ones. This paper questions these claims and reveals that democratization may start at low levels of state capacity, although democratic consolidation occurs at high levels of state capacity. Using a post-Communist sample, we reveal no J-shaped relationship between state capacity and political regime. We also show that state capacity does not remain unchanged in periods of social and political upheavals and its dynamics in numerous cases stipulate changes in the level of democracy. Particular patterns of this relationship are discussed in the paper in the context of clusters of post-Communist regime transformations.
Y90|The Principle of Population for the 21st Century: The Never Coming Stationary State|One of the most enchanting areas in economics is the forward thinking. While Malthus and Ricardo agreed on the gloomy vision of the future, Mill described the wider stationary state and foresaw it in a more optimistic way. Space sciences and improvements in our technology provided us with the solution decades ago, although economics did not notice this possible solution of the classical stationary state until now. This article incorporates this knowledge into economics. Calories integrate the supply of means of production and the demand for means of consumption in one market. The stationary state could come only if the demand for means of subsistence grows faster than the supply of means of production. Increasing scarcity of free calories exceeding the minimal required volume of it preventing the malnutrition and death will push the calorie price up while economy will move towards the stationary state. But where to take the land when the very last piece of it - even the deserts - will be already cultivated? Increasing scarcity of land opens possibility for firms to make profit from producing land. Thus, the classical stationary state is only an illusion.
