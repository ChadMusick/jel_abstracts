L97|The 2018 Indicators on the Governance of Sector Regulators - Part of the Product Market Regulation (PMR) Survey|Complementing the Product Market Regulation (PMR) survey, the Indicators on the Governance of Sector Regulators map the regulatory arrangements of 130 regulators across 38 countries and five network sectors: energy, e-communications, rail and air transport, and water. The indicators are structured along three components: independence, accountability and scope of action.For the 2018 update, the OECD Secretariat and delegates of the Network of Economic Regulators (NER) revised the structure and content of the survey based on new best practice principles, guidance documents and the growing body of work of the NER on the performance of regulators.The analysis shows that, while the governance arrangements of regulators vary considerably across countries and sectors, some key trends and correlations can be observed. These insights can support countries and regulators wishing to benchmark their governance practices and reform their governance arrangements.
L97|Long-Term Electricity Investments Accounting for Demand and Supply Side Flexibility|Short-term Electricity Demand Response (DR) is an emerging technology in Europe's Electricity markets that will introduce a new degree of flexibility. The objective of this work is to analyze to what extent the untapped DR potential can facilitate an optimal transition to an European low emission power system. The benefits of DR consists of a reduction in peak load consumption, which leads to reduction in capacity investments, production and consumption savings, reduced congestion phases, reliable integration of intermittent renewable resources and supply and demand flexibility. The capabilities of DR are studied in the European Model for Power Investment with (High Shares of) Renewable Energy (EMPIRE), which is an electricity sector model with a time span of 30 years ending in 2050. The model is two-stage stochastic that includes uncertainty at the operational level and energy economics dynamics at a strategic level. The main contribution of this article is designing the investment-operation DR module within the EMPIRE framework. It models several classes of shiftable and curtailable loads in residential, commercial and industrial sectors, including flexibility periods, operational costs and endogenous DR investments, for 31 European countries. The results show that DR capacity substitutes partially flexible supply side capacity from peak gas plants and battery storage, in addition to enabling more solar PV production.

L97|Utilities Governance, Incentives, and Performance: Evidence from the Water Sector in India|Network utilities across the world are subject to regulation and political scrutiny. In developing countries, managing the trade-offs between socioeconomic and environmental objectives in public water and energy utilities is particularly challenging. These industries share important underlying technical and economic features. Therefore, many economic, governance, and policy lessons are transferable across these sectors. In India, the water sector suffers from mounting financial losses, lack of access, and poor quality of service. There is a dearth of literature on the multi-faceted nature of utility performance related to water utilities. We examine the socioeconomic and environmental aspects of urban water supply in India. We use a stochastic frontier analysis approach and distance functions to analyse the performance of 304 urban water supply utilities in three Indian states during the period 2010-2015. The results suggest that incentive-based economic reform and regulation would help the utilities improve their performance. More specifically measures to improve cost recovery, billing efficiency and reduce losses would help the utilities to enhance service delivery, expand coverage and induce efficiency in the sector. The results also show the dependence of water utilities on groundwater sources which is unsustainable in the long run. We highlight the need for designing economic incentives to improve the performance of utilities and enable them to achieve social and sustainability objectives.
L97|Dynamic Corrective Taxes with Time-Varying Salience|The intermittency of payment for many goods creates a disconnect between paying and consuming such that the marginal price is not always salient when consumption decisions are made. This paper derives optimal dynamic corrective taxes when there are externalities as well as internalities from inattention and persistence in consumption across periods. Our optimal taxes address dynamic inefficiencies that are not captured in static models of inattention. We also characterize a second-best constant tax and the excess burden associated with time-invariant tax rates. We then calibrate the model to U.S. residential electricity consumption.

L97|Environmental Risks between Conceptualization and Action|Changes in the contemporary world materialized in particular through population growth and mobility, urbanization, and economic expansion also result in an increased exposure of people and assets to extreme events and impose, implicitly, adequate management of induced risks. The occurrence of natural and anthropogenic risk phenomena, known as hazards, puts a heavy tribute on disaster-sensitive human communities regardless of their level of development. The magnitude of the disasters and their increasing frequency and severity imply the need for their approach by the entire world community and for global action. Knowledge of risks becomes a sine qua condition in carrying out impact studies, risk prevention plans, spatial planning plans, and, in general, a condition for effective management of natural resources or sustainable development projects.
L97|Do economic regulatory agencies matter to private-sector involvement in water utilities in developing countries?|This paper suggests that, for developing countries, the creation of economic regulatory agencies, separate from the ministry in charge of water and sanitation, may not be a necessary or sufficient condition to stimulate large scale private involvement (PPPs) in the sector. The odds of an impact are higher for Latin American countries than other regions and for countries with higher income levels. They are also better when inflation is high. At the margin, the odds are unrelated to the contract type, except for greenfield projects, for which they may be contraindicated.
L97|Modern Public Enterprises: Organisational Innovation and Productivity|In advanced economies, state-owned enterprises play an important role in sectors of general interest such as energy and water supply. The conditions under which they operate have changed fundamentally since 1998, with new strategies required for firms to preserve market shares in the face of liberalisation and technological innovation. This paper investigates the productivity effect of three strategies in new public management: corporatisation, outsourcing, and partial privatisation. Firm-level productivity is estimated from production data using a control function approach. As most of the firms are typically multiproduct firms, we suggest a method for modelling differences in the product mix and to account for heterogeneous production environments. Using a newly constructed and unique dataset from the German Federal Statistical Office, we find that outsourcing and corporatisation positively impact productivity, while partial privatisation does not increase productivity.
L97|Do Private Water Utilities Operators Care about Regulatory Agencies in Developing Countries ?|This paper shows that the creation of an independent regulatory agency (IRA) is often not a necessary or sufficient condition to help countries attract private participation in the operation and financing of the water and sanitation sector of developing countries. The odds of an impact are, however, significantly higher for Latin American and Caribbean countries and to a lesser extent Eastern European countries, than for any other region. Higher income levels and higher prices are also correlated with a higher effectiveness of IRAs in attracting private sector financing. The analysis of the impact on the various types of PPP contracts shows that, at the margin, IRAs are irrelevant in general, to the contract choice, except for greenfield projects for which IRAs may be counterproductive at the margin.
L97|Bridging the industrial energy efficiency gap – Assessing the evidence from the Italian white certificate scheme|The Italian white certificate scheme is the main national policy instrument to incentivise energy efficiency of the industrial sector, with savings from white certificates amounting to 2% of Italy's 2012 primary energy consumption. The mechanism sets binding energy-saving targets on electricity and gas distributors with at least 50,000 clients and includes a voluntary opt-in model for participation from other parties. This paper investigates and assesses the elements of the scheme that help overcome several barriers to deliver industrial energy efficiency. Results from a survey conducted among leading experts indicate that the Italian system provides a strong financial incentive to energy efficiency investments, covering a significant share of investment costs and thus reducing payback time. Moreover, the scheme fosters the development of energy service companies (ESCOs), which are key to developing, installing and arranging finance for projects on the ground. In conjunction with other policies, the mechanism also raises awareness of energy efficiency investment opportunities, thus helping overcome the market failure of insufficient information. Core challenges remain, including tackling regulatory uncertainty and improving access to finance.
L97|Nudges in the marketplace: The response of household electricity consumption to information and monetary incentives|This paper provides field evidence from India examining changes in electricity consumption in response to various behavioral interventions. I study the impact of (i) weekly reports with peer comparisons of electricity use; (ii) reports augmented with monetary incentives to reduce consumption and (iii) price variation. I estimate consumption changes using a randomized control trial in conjunction with a quasi-experiment. Households provided reports alone reduced summer season consumption by 7 percent. Price elasticity identified from cross-sectional and time series variation was estimated at −0.56. Against this benchmark, the impact of peer comparisons alone was equivalent to increasing tariffs by about 12.5 percent. Counter-intuitively, when weekly reports were augmented with monetary incentives rewarding electricity conservation, households no longer reduced consumption. Households receiving reports also show higher price elasticity relative to controls. These results provide new evidence identifying the response of developing country consumers to behavioral interventions while examining the interaction of prices, incentives and information.
L97|On the Impact of Input Prices on an Entrant’s Profit Under Multi-Product Competition|Abstract We study the impact of input prices on an entrant’s profit when firms are engaged in multi-product competition. We consider a setting with both horizontal and vertical differentiation, in which a vertically integrated firm controls the input that is required for the supply of the high-quality product. We establish the conditions under which the entrant is better off from an increase in the wholesale price of this critical input. This possibility contrasts with the existing literature that, under linear demands, finds a non-positive relationship between the input price and the single-product entrant’s profit.
L97|Trade in services related to the environment|This paper discusses the nature and scope of international trade in environmentally related services, and analyses the implications that services trade restrictions have on the provisions of these services domestically and abroad. Numerous services appear crucial to the delivery and proper functioning of environmental goods and equipment be they a wastewater-treatment facility or a renewable power plant. By helping lower the costs of these services and improving access to world-class suppliers, trade policy can contribute alongside energy and environmental policy to the prevention and abatement of greenhouse-gas emissions and pollution in all its forms. Besides clarifying the role and scope of services related to the environment, the analysis undertaken in this paper suggests that the restrictions that countries impose on services trade may have a detrimental effect on the provision of environmental activities through the establishment by specialised firms of a commercial presence abroad, i.e. through mode 3 trade in services.
L97|When the total is more than the sum of parts : infrastructure complementarities|This paper shows evidence on complementarities in infrastructure and the magnitude of their impacts on social indicators over Peruvian households (level of income, expenditures and capacity of savings). In order to test the hypothesis, it evaluates the impact of having access to each of the basic services on variables that reflect the living conditions of Peruvian households. The dataset consists of information obtained from the National Household Survey (ENAHO) for 2006 and 2013, with the aim of comparing the effects between beneficiaries of infrastructure and non-beneficiaries, and using as methodologies the Propensity Score Matching and Double-Differences. The infrastructure variables obtained from ENAHO are household access to water, sanitation, electricity and telecommunications. The results demonstrate positive effects on infrastructure complementarities for Peruvian households, in the sense that benefits of having more utilities together (2, 3 or 4) are greater than summing up individual benefits of each utility.
L97|Mesurer l’économie circulaire à l’échelle territoriale. Une analyse systémique de la gestion des matières organiques à Bruxelles|L’économie circulaire connait un engouement réel et apparaît comme une approche prometteuse pour rompre avec les flux linéaires qui commencent par l’extraction d’une ressource et finissent par la création d’un déchet. Mobilisant la théorie des systèmes socio-écologiques et différents indicateurs d’impact, cet article souligne l’existence de trajectoires alternatives vers la circularisation de l’économie – et que ces alternatives ne sont pas neutres quant à leurs conséquences économiques, sociales et environnementales. La mesure de ces conséquences pour le cas des flux des matières organiques dans la métropole bruxelloise permet de faire ressortir deux trajectoires potentielles :celle d’une « troisième révolution industrielle », avec une prolongation de la logique de croissance économique basée sur l’accumulation de capital et une expansion quantitative, et celle d’une « post-croissance » créatrice d’une nouvelle organisation polycentrique du travail et d’un développement qualitatif moins intensif en capital.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

L97|Distribution network prices and solar PV: Resolving rate instability and wealth transfers through demand tariffs|1-in-4 detached households in Southeast Queensland have installed rooftop solar PV—amongst the highest take-up rates in the world. Electricity distribution network capacity is primarily driven by periodic demand, and household load generally peaks in the early evening, whereas solar PV production peaks during the middle of the day and thus a mismatch exists. Compounding matters is the fact that the structure of the regulated two-part network tariff is dominated by a flat-rate variable charge. In this article, interval meter data at the customer switchboard circuit level confirms that solar households use only slightly less peak capacity than non-solar households and, that non-trivial cross-subsidies are rapidly emerging. A tariff model demonstrates that a peak capacity-based ‘demand tariff’ is a more efficient, cost-reflective and equitable pricing structure that improves the stability of tariffs given a rate-of-return regulatory constraint.
L97|Gas-to-power market and investment incentive for enhancing generation capacity: An analysis of Ghana's electricity sector|Ghana's electricity generation capacity is currently insufficient to meet demand, making power outages and load shedding common. The resulting impact is potentially devastating for the country's growth prospects. Traditionally, lack of an affordable and reliable fuel supply for power generation, coupled with ineffective institutions and an unfavourable investment climate, have resulted in Ghana's electricity sector performing poorly. In light of the 2007 discovery of natural gas reserves in Ghanaian waters, this paper examines whether domestic gas could advance the performance of the electricity sector, and if so, how. The results of our analysis show that utilization of gas reserves in Ghana's gas-to-power market is an economically superior strategy compared to an export-oriented utilization scheme. The lack of an effective regulatory framework for investment, skill shortages, and an inefficient electricity pricing structure continue to be the main constraining factors. Our analysis also considers possible approaches to modification of the electricity tariff in order to send the right signal to potential investors in generation capacity, without compromising the affordability of power supply.
L97|Bet big on doubles, bet smaller on triples. Exploring scope economies in multi-service passenger transport companies|In this paper, using a sample of Italian bus and coach operators, we investigate the presence and the magnitude of scale and scope economies in the provision of passenger transport services. The estimates of a Composite Cost Function econometric model highlight the presence of global scope and scale economies only for multi-service operators (providing urban, intercity and for-hire bus and coach transport services) with output levels lower than the ones characterising the ‘average’ firm. This indicates that relatively small, specialized companies would benefit from cost reductions by evolving into multi-service firms providing urban, intercity and coach renting services. For operators of a bigger size, scope economies can be still exploited by linking urban and intercity services or by linking intercity services and coach renting, whereas the couple urban service-coach renting is associated with strong diseconomies of scope. Our results can help policymakers (that must define the boundaries of the service area to be tendered) and firms (that, as a result of the ongoing liberalization process, have increased opportunities to invest in regulated and non-regulated passenger transport activities) to make informed decisions.
L97|Regulating networks in decline|Abstract Demand for some services provided on traditional postal, electricity, gas and fixed telecommunications networks can be characterized as being in decline in some jurisdictions. Declining demand can give rise to difficult questions for regulators, in particular, the extent to which network operators can fully recover the costs of historic investments, and the efficiency and distributional effects of applying different rate structures. It can also raise fundamental questions about: the on-going rationale for regulation; the essential functions provided by network operators; and whether regulations should be applied symmetrically to traditional and alternative suppliers. Depending on the pace and scale of the decline, regulation may need to adapt. Proposals for adapting regulation are identified and critically examined in this paper, particularly in terms of the approach to setting the allowed level of revenues and the determination of rate structures.
L97|Policy measures to improve energy efficiency in Russian buildings: Forecast up to 2050|The article presents a long-term forecast of costs and benefits associated with the implementation of additional energy efficiency policies in Russian buildings. In Russia, buildings are directly and indirectly responsible for 38% of primary energy use; at the same time, they have a large energy efficiency potential. The 10 assessed scenarios of implementing packages of policy measures to improve energy efficiency illustrate that it is possible to halve fossil fuel use while providing energy services to the buildings stock which is expected to double by 2050. Additional benefits are considered, such as reduced greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution and improved indoor comfort, employment growth, improved affordability of housing services for both residents and the public sector. The paper estimates the costs and economic benefits of the implementation of energy efficiency measures and policies in the buildings sector. It shows that a new model of economic growth in Russia should be based on improving the overall economic efficiency, including energy efficiency.
L97|Property rights and transaction costs : The role of ownership and organization in German public service provision|This paper provides evidence that ownership and organization matters for the efficiency of provision of public services. In particular, we find that pure private ownership is more efficient than pure public ownership, followed by mixed ownership. The delegation of management in different legal forms also has an impact, highlighting the importance of the design of the government-operator relation. We apply a structural approach of production function estimation ensuring precise determination of total factor productivity for a panel of German refuse collection firms in the time period between 2000-2012. We project total factor productivity estimates (TFP) on ownership and organization. Our results are in line with the trade-offs implied by the property rights literature and provide important policy implications regarding the organization of public service provision.
L97|Municipal Waste Selection and Disposal: Evidences from Lombardy|This article exploit a data base of 1.522 observations related to Lombardy’s municipalities to run a cross sectional estimation of the drivers of MW selection. We find no evidence of a significant correlation between the percentage of selected MW selection and market variables such as the unit charge for waste management, a result probably affected by the high degree of integration existing in Lombardy among collectors and disposal operators. On the contrary, we discover robust and significant correlation with a set of geographical, socio-economic, and political variables. Among the latter ones, we have a confirmations on the influence of party competition on the percentage of household recycling, with the left wing ruling parties more addressed to it than the rivals, and on the high correlation existing between MW selection and the implementation of a unit pricing scheme. Other positive correlations with the independent variable are shown by per-capita income, while quite surprisingly the education level of citizens seems to play no role.
L97|Generación del valor a partir de la gerencia del riesgo sistemático|RESUMEN Este artículo tiene como propósito profundizar en cómo se conceptualiza la teoría, la aplicación del riesgo, su gestión y valor. Se demostrará cómo los modelos de gerencia del riesgo pueden crear valor a través de la reducción de la tasa de descuento de los flujos de valoración del activo subyacente. La investigación planteará tres modelos de derivados reales: derivados de ventas, derivados de costos y derivados de EBIT. El propósito de estos derivados reales se centrará en la maximización del valor del activo a través de estrategias de reducción del riesgo sistemático (beta). En síntesis, los resultados de esta investigación contradicen uno de los postulados centrales de la gerencia moderna, liderado por C. W. Smith en su bien conocido artículo “Corporative risk management”.******This article explores the concept of risk in terms of its theory, application, management and value. The study shows how risk management models can create value by reducing the discount rate of valuation flows of the underlying asset Three models of real derivatives are put forward: sales derivatives, cost derivatives, and EBIT derivatives. These real derivatives focus on maximizing asset value through systematic risk (beta) reduction strategies. In summary, the results of this study contradict one of the central principles of modern management, put forward by C. W. Smith in his well-known article, “Corporate risk management”.
L97|No Decline in Investment in Public-Sector Energy and Water Supply|A considerable share of public investment comes not only from public budgets but also from public utility companies. One major area of investment is energy and water supply, where the utility companies have substantial fixed assets in the form of distribution infrastructure. Using new microdata which has not been analyzed before, the present report shows that—unlike with the core public budgets—public energy and water supply companies show no signs of insufficient investment. On the contrary, gross investment into distribution networks over the past ten years has shown an upward trend comparable to that of private energy and water supply companies—if investment related to the expansion of infrastructure resulting from the energy transition is not taken into account. In addition, no clear correlation was found between the investment expenditure of energy and water supply companies and the financial strength or demographic trends within a given region. However, this does not rule out the possibility of diverging investment trends in the near future in response to demographic changes.

Einen beachtlichen Anteil öffentlicher Investitionen tätigen – außerhalb der öffentlichen Haushalte – kommunale Unternehmen, beispielsweise Stadtwerke. Ein bedeutender Investitionsbereich ist die Energie- und Wasserversorgung, da die Unternehmen über beträchtliche Sachanlagen in der leitungsgebundenen Infrastruktur verfügen. Der vorliegende Bericht zeigt auf Basis erstmalig verfügbarer Mikrodaten, dass es in der ausgelagerten Energie- und Wasserversorgung – im Gegensatz zu den kommunalen Kernhaushalten – keine Anhaltspunkte für unzureichende Investitionen gibt. Vielmehr folgten die Bruttoinvestitionen in Leitungsanlagen während der vergangenen zehn Jahre einem steigenden Trend, der mit dem der privaten Energie- und Wasserversorgungsunternehmen – sieht man von Erweiterungsinvestitionen im Rahmen der Energiewende ab – vergleichbar ist. Darüber hinaus lässt sich kein eindeutiger Zusammenhang zwischen dem Investitionsverhalten eines kommunalen Energie- und Wasserversorgers und der regionalen Finanzkraft beziehungsweise Bevölkerungsentwicklung finden. Dies schließt jedoch nicht aus, dass insbesondere der demographische Wandel in Zukunft zu regionalen Unterschieden beim Investitionsbedarf führen kann.
L97|Port Management and Educational Needs of the Sector: A Study in Ports|Ports, as well as the load transfer, performs the coordination of many commercial and legal processes. They are also in relationship with a lot of organizations or people at the same time during such activities, such as shippers, exporters, importers, logistics companies, public authorities, banks, insurance companies. Through this process, the ports are making a significant contribution to the national economy. Ports have own types of services and operational processes. Even if a port staff delays his job the entire service slows down because all processes directly connected with each other. The most important component of ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of ports is human resources. Human mind is the most important difference that distinguishes humans from other species. The mind is a phenomenon that developing and strengthening by education. So the port staff needs to get a good education for the development of ports. The purpose of this study is to determine the educational needs of port staff according to the needs of port sector. Program content in undergraduate and graduate levels at the universities concerned before working with port operations were examined in this context. In this context the program contents examined first at the undergraduate and graduate levels in the universities concerned with port operations. Then the educational needs of the port industry are set out. Later the compatibility of the current situation with the sector needs is examined. As a result of aforementioned study, it has been determined that current situation is not fully meeting the sector needs. According to the identified results, new proposals have been made based on the needs of the sector.
L97|Attribute non-attendance in discrete choice experiments: A case study in a developing country|In a discrete choice experiment (DCE), some respondents might not attend to all presented attributes when evaluating and choosing their preferred options. Utilizing data from a DCE survey in Vietnam, this paper contributes to the literature on attribute non-attendance (ANA) with an investigation of the ANA in a developing country context. Based on a review of relevant published ANA studies, we find that the extent of ANA reported by respondents in our Vietnam case study could be potentially more serious than in developed country studies. Our econometric analysis, based on a mixed logit model, shows that respondents who ignored the attributes have different preferences from respondents who attended to the attributes. An examination of ANA determinants using a multivariate probit model was undertaken to gain a better understanding of reasons for the differences in the preferences of two groups of respondents. Our results confirm that the stated ANA could be an example of a simplifying strategy of respondents, and that respondents ignored attributes which were not relevant to their situation.
L97|White certificates — Energy efficiency programs under private information of consumers|Energy efficiency is an objective of public interventions at least since the Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act of 1978 (PURPA). Recently, conservation has received considerable attention in the United States and in particular in the European Union but this time in order to mitigate global warming. Policy measures include regulations at the technical level and the introduction of white certificates in order to force utilities and firms to invest into conservation in a way similar to the already existing renewable energy quota. This paper derives the optimal mechanism if utilities must deal with white certificates facing consumers holding private information. The optimal mechanism has some theoretically interesting features like restricted participation and a discontinuity.
L97|One more ride on the merry-go-round! Public ownership and delayed competition in local public services|This paper investigates the effect of public ownership on the use of competitive bidding to award local monopoly franchises. The empirical setting is provided by the Italian natural gas liberalization reform, which made competitive bidding to award gas distribution franchises at the municipality level compulsory. The paper shows that municipalities owning a capital share in a gas distribution network operator experience a reduction in the hazard of awarding. The paper provides additional tests to support the causal interpretation of the findings. First, the credibility of competitive procedures is tested. Second, the presence of a contemporaneous dependence structure in the data is taken into account to address the imitation effect among the municipalities served by the same operator.
L97|A study of the negotiated-settlement practice in regulation: Some evidence from Florida|Negotiated settlements have become a frequently used alternative to contested proceedings when setting prices charged by public utilities under the US rate-of-return regulatory model. The behavior of the representatives of consumer advocates and the firms during settlement negotiations determine customer prices. This paper examines this behavior by using data from the Florida Public Service Commission to estimate the payoff functions of both parties. The estimation suggests that the advocate and the firm weight the present rate change more than the consumer's future average price and the firm's future operating revenue in their settlement decisions. It also indicates that the time saved by settlements is not a primary reason for their popularity.

L97|Nonlinear pricing with competition: the market for settling payments|The multiple payments settlement systems available in the United States differ on several dimensions. The Fedwire Funds Service, a utility that operates a U.S. large-value payments-settlement service, offers the fastest speed of settlement. Recognizing that payments differ in the urgency with which they need to be settled, Fedwire offers banks a decreasing block-price schedule. This approach allows Fedwire to price discriminate, charging high fees for urgent payments and low fees for less urgent ones. We analyze banks’ demand for Fedwire Funds given this nonlinear scheme, taking into account competing settlement systems. We show that how banks respond to Fedwire’s pricing depends crucially on the need to settle payments quickly. If the urgency for immediate settlement is great enough, banks will respond to marginal price; otherwise, they will respond to average price. We test whether banks respond to marginal or to average price. Our identification comes from exogenous variation in Fedwire’s pricing, which results in differential changes in marginal and average price for comparable banks. We find that banks respond to average price.
L97|Prices based on current cost or historical cost: How different are they?|In 1996, The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) prescribed total element long-run incremental cost (TELRIC) to determine rates incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) charge for most mandated wholesale services. TELRIC, which bases prices on a hypothetical incumbent that serves current volumes with completely new equipment, was a major departure from the predominant use of historical (or original) costs for regulated prices. The FCC made two exceptions: total service resale of local exchange services and rental of space by cable television providers and competitive local exchange carriers on poles and conduit owned by electric utilities and ILECs are based on original cost calculations. The FCC’s use of both current cost and historical cost methodologies recalls the fierce debates over whether regulated rates should be based on replacement (current) costs or original (historical costs) that preceded the US Supreme Court’s 1944 FPC v Hope decision. Parties advocating low rates favored replacement costs when equipment costs were expected to decrease, but original costs when such asset prices would be expected to increase. The Hope decision upheld the Federal Power Commission’s use of original costs, which subsequently were widely used by federal and state regulators. While rates based on current costs have, indeed, differed in the expected way from the corresponding rates based on historical costs, this paper demonstrates that (1) the large differences expected by conventional wisdom are the result of faulty application of the current cost methodology and (2) proper application substantially narrows the difference between the rates produced by the respective approaches.

L97|The US Electricity Industry After 20 Years of Restructuring|Electricity restructuring in the 1990s ended the era of vertically integrated monopolies in many states, allowing nonutility generators to sell electricity to utilities and, in fewer states, allowing retail service providers to buy electricity from generators and sell to end-use customers. We review the economic arguments for restructuring and the resulting effects in subsequent years. We argue that the greatest political motivation for restructuring was rent shifting, not efficiency improvements. Although electricity restructuring has brought efficiency improvements, it has generally been viewed as a disappointment because the price-reduction promises made by some advocates were based on politically unsustainable rent transfers. In reality, electricity rate changes since restructuring have been driven more by exogenous factors, such as generation technology advances and natural gas price fluctuations, than by restructuring. We argue that a similar dynamic underpins the current political momentum behind distributed generation, primarily rooftop solar photovoltaic systems, which remains costly from a societal viewpoint, but privately economic owing to the rent transfers it enables.
L97|The Economics of Universal Service: an Analysis of Entry Subsidies for Rural Broadband| Universal service is a policy objective that all individuals or households have access to some service. Subsidy policies to accomplish universal service may arise when private provision is non-universal. In the context of rural high speed wired broadband subsidies, this paper exploits household-level cable and satellite broadband subscription data from North Carolina to examine household adoption and substitution patterns and to evaluate how many currently unserved regions warrant an entry subsidy. This paper has three main findings: (i) fewer than 47% of households adopt high speed broadband in areas currently served by a single broadband provider, (ii) there exists a significant elasticity of substitution between high speed wired broadband and the lower speed options of satellite broadband and DSL, and (iii) a generous upper bound on the number of regions that warrant an entry subsidy is 67%. These results suggest a policy of universal service in North Carolina would be unlikely to achieve universal adoption, would connect many households already with internet access and who would not substitute, and in many regions would be prohibitively costly even assuming very generous estimates of the consumer surplus generated. From the perspective of social welfare, to connect the 5% least dense areas of North Carolina would require each adopting household value broadband access at more than $1550 per month.
L97|Regulación económica de industrias de redes: ¿contractual o administrativa?| Los contratos de concesión o de asociación público-privada han sido ampliamente utilizados como mecanismo para atraer la inversión privada para la provisión de infraestructura o de servicios públicos. La literatura reciente (Stern (2003), Spiller (2008)) ha enfatizado que el uso de estos contratos ha permitido, además, mitigarlos riesgos asociados a la intervención administrativa de los gobiernos sobre la inversión privada en esas actividades. Si bien la figura del contrato de concesión ha estado asociada con la delegación por parte del Estado de la prestación de servicios públicos a empresas privadas,obligaciones regulatorias tales como la fijación de tarifas, de acceso e interconexión o de niveles de servicio pueden estar expresamente incorporadas en los contratos de concesión o alternativamente ser aprobadas mediante normas administrativas. El presente artículo muestra evidencia empírica correspondiente a Perú, que identifica los factores que influyen en la decisión de incorporar regulación económica a nivel contractual, a partir de una muestra de 65 contratos de concesión de infraestructura de transporte, energía y telecomunicaciones. Los resultados ilustran que los riesgos de demanda, la escala de los proyectos, la fuentede financiamiento y la tecnología han influido de manera significativa en dicha decisión por parte del gobierno. Finalmente, a partir de los criterios definidos por Stern y Holder (1999) se analizan las fortalezas y debilidades de la regulación contractual y administrativa en el caso del Perú, estableciendo recomendaciones para una necesaria revisión de la agenda regulatoria durante los próximos años.

L97|A Literature Review on the Sediment Transport Process in Shallow-Grade Culverts and Storm Sewers|Sedimentation of fine muddy material in culverts and storm sewers becomes an important issue in Texas coastal plain shallow-grade drain systems. It leads to a reduction inflow capacity with time and an associated high cost of cleaning. It may not be possible to maintain the required 2 feet per second along sewer in time. The objective of study is to conduct an extensive literature review, and field survey to implement physical experiment for quantifying the sediment transport process in shallow grade culverts and storm sewers. The previous studies indicate that culverts or sewers should be designed to transport fine grains as a suspended load and transport granular sediments as a bed load, and to erode the sediment deposition with high flow velocity to achieve self-cleaning. The suspended load, bed load and bed erosion sediment transport equations have been developed as the function of the sediment grain size, the sediment concentration, the slope of the culverts or sewers, the bed roughness. To quantify the sediment characteristics, three samples were collected from the culvert, the ditch and the sewer located in Orange County of southeast Texas. The sieve analysis indicates that d50 are greater than 0.5mm and d65 are greater than 1mm for all the samples. However, more fine particles are included in the sewer sump and ditch than that in the culvert. The ongoing study is to set up a physical model based on the key variables in the previous transport equation to study the transport process in shallow grade culverts and storm sewers.

L97|Regionale Verteilung umwelt- und energiepolitischer Fördermittel des Bundes im Zeitraum 1999 bis 2012|In dieser Untersuchung wird die regionale Verteilung der Fördermittel des Bundes für Maß-nahmen der Energieeinsparung und Verbesserung der Energieeffizienz in Deutschland im Durch-schnitt für den Zeitraum 1999 bis 2012 dargestellt und es wird ein Vergleich mit der regionalen Verteilung der EEG-Vergütungen vorgenommen. Räumliche Betrachtungseinheiten sind die Bundesländer, Bundesländergruppen, Landkreise und siedlungsstrukturelle Kreistypen. Es werden sowohl die regionalen Unterschiede der absoluten Fördermittel wie auch Unterschiede in der Fördermittelintensität analysiert. Die Untersuchung kommt zu dem Ergebnis, dass für die EEG-Vergütungen zur Erzeugung er-neuerbaren Stroms knapp das 6-fache an Fördergeldern ausgegeben wurde als für Maßnahmen, die der Energieeinsparung und Verbesserung der Energieeffizienz dienen. An der Stromerzeugung aus erneuerbaren Energien sind die ländlichen Regionen maßgeblich beteiligt und erhalten 68,5 % der EEG-Vergütungen. Auf die Einwohner umgerechnet erhalten unter den ländlichen Regionen die dünn besiedelten ländlichen Kreise mit rund 530 Euro je Einwohner die höchsten EEG-Vergütungszahlungen im Jahr 2011. Aus Fördertöpfen des Bundes für Energiespar- und Energieeffizienzprogramme sowie für investive Maßnahmen der Erzeugung erneuerbarer Energie erhalten die ländlichen Regionen einen Fördermittelanteil von rund 38 %. Die jahresdurchschnittlichen Fördermittel liegen für die dünn besiedelten ländlichen Kreise bei rund 21 Euro je Einwohner. Ländliche Kreise mit Verdichtungs-ansätzen kommen ebenfalls auf knapp 21 Euro, schneiden jedoch mit rund 345 Euro je Einwohner bei den EEG-Vergütungen schlechter ab als die dünn besiedelten ländlichen Kreise. Die Einwohner der nicht ländlichen Kreise erreichen im Durchschnitt bei den investiven Maßnahmen der Erzeugung erneuerbarer Energien sowie den Energiespar- und Energieeffizienzprogrammen eine Förderintensität von rund 15 und bei den EEG-Vergütungen eine Förderintensität von 92 Euro je Einwohner. Betrachtet man die absoluten Fördermittel schneiden die südlichen alten Bundesländern, ins-besondere Bayern und Baden-Württemberg, bei den EEG-Vergütungszahlungen wie bei den Fördermitteln für Energiespar- und Energieeffizienzprogramme besser ab als der Durchschnitt der nördlichen Bundesländer. Auch im Vergleich zu den neuen Bundesländern stehen sie besser da. Bezieht man die Fördermittel auf die Einwohner holen die nördlichen alten Bundesländer sowie die neuen Bundesländer im Ranking auf.
L97|The competition assessment framework for the retail energy sector: some concerns about the proposed interpretation|The framework proposed by Ofgem, OFT and CMA invokes a well-functioning market, but the Competition Commission has not always used such a concept, and when it has done so it has been problematic. Here, the well-functioning market is Ofgem's vision of a successful market, not anchored in any actual market. Ofgem's indicators of a competitive market have changed since 2002: tariff variety and products tailored to different customer groups are now a harmful complexity rather than a potential benefit of competition. The proposed “theories of harm” ignore regulatory policy and coordinated conduct facilitated by regulation. The analysis of weak customer response fails to distinguish between competition as an equilibrium state and as the Competition Commission's rivalrous discovery process over time. The framework thus reflects Ofgem's perspective, but the assessment needs to be independent because regulation is at issue, and because Ofgem is no longer capable of a competition assessment.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L97|Promoting or restricting competition?: Regulation of the UK retail residential energy market since 2008|Since 2008 UK energy regulator Ofgem has imposed increasingly severe restrictions on suppliers to the domestic (residential) retail market. Initially, non-discrimination conditions aimed to “remove unfair price differentials”, particularly between suppliers’ prices between regions, totalling £0.5 bn. This actually envisaged increasing prices to other customers by £0.5 billion, to maintain revenue neutrality. In the event, competition reduced, customer switching fell by half, and profits of major suppliers increased by nearly £1 billion, at the expense of customers. Later, restrictions on the number and types of tariffs aimed to encourage customers to engage in the market. However, there is no empirical evidence to justify this, and the policy prohibits many discounts and tariff types that customers value, especially vulnerable customers. Perhaps Ofgem felt pressed to Do Something in the face of an unprecedented increase in energy prices. Successive Governments have supported its interventions, but cannot be blamed for designing them. The decline of economists in senior positions at Ofgem removed an important ‘sanity check’. But Ofgem itself bears responsibility for its change in policy since 2008. It may have been well-meaning, attempting to protect the interests of vulnerable customers, but inappropriate restrictions have made customers worse off. Should other regulators follow suit? No. Hopefully the CMA market investigation will reveal this and bring to an end one of the most misguided episodes in the modern history of UK regulation.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L97|Cost function estimation of multi-service firms. Evidence from the passenger transport industry|In this paper, using a sample of Italian passenger transport firms, we compare the estimates from a Composite Cost Function econometric model (Pulley and Braunstein, 1992) with the ones coming from other traditional functional forms such as the Standard Translog, the Generalized Translog, and the Separable Quadratic. The results highlight the presence of global scope and scale economies only for multi-service firms (providing urban, intercity and for-hire bus transport services) with output levels lower than the ones characterising the â€˜averageâ€™ firm. This indicates that relatively small, specialised firms would benefit from cost reductions by evolving into multi-service firms providing urban, intercity and for-hire bus transport. As for the intercity service, the most efficient solution seems the integration with urban operators rather than integrating with for-hire bus services.
L97|Design of experiments applied to environmental variables analysis in electricity utilities efficiency: The Brazilian case|Benchmarking plays a central role in the regulatory scene. Regulators set tariffs according to a performance standard and, if the companies can outperform such a standard, they can retain the gains observed by such outperformance. Efficiency performance is usually assessed by comparison (or a benchmark) against either other companies or the company's own historical performance. This paper discusses the impact of environmental variables on the efficiency performance of electricity distribution companies. Indeed, such variables, which are argued to be unmanageable, may affect the electricity utilities' performance. Thus, this paper proposes a simulation methodology based on design of experiment philosophy for statistically testing environmental variables and the interactions among them, enabling regulators to build the best suited semi-parametric two-stage model of electricity utility benchmarking analysis. To demonstrate the power of the proposed approach, experimental simulations are carried out using real data published by Brazil's regulator. The results show that environmental variables may impact efficiency performance linearly and nonlinearly.
L97|Mitigating expropriation risk through vertical separation of public utilities: The case of Argentina|In 2002, Argentina devalued its currency and froze public utility rates thus breaching the guarantees granted to investors the decade before. Those guarantees had lowered investors' cost of capital by substantially reducing expropriation risk. This paper looks into the governance structure chosen by Argentina for the privatization process and potential alternatives after a decade of contract breaches. Future governance should be market-oriented, involving vertically separated companies with former public utilities voluntarily acting as operating companies or OpCos, and NetCos in charge of all network expansions under the structure of PPPs created for such purposes.
L97|Energy policy with externalities and internalities|We analyze optimal policy when consumers of energy-using durables undervalue energy costs relative to their private optima. First, there is an Internality Dividend from Externality Taxes: aside from reducing externalities, they also offset distortions from underinvestment in energy efficiency. Discrete choice simulations of the auto market suggest that the Internality Dividend could more than double the social welfare gains from a carbon tax at marginal damages. Second, we develop the Internality Targeting Principle: the optimal combination of multiple instruments depends on the average internality of the consumers marginal to each instrument. Because consumers who undervalue energy costs are mechanically less responsive to energy taxes, the optimal policy will tend to involve an energy tax below marginal damages coupled with a larger subsidy for energy efficient products. Third, although the exact optimal policy depends on joint distributions of unobservables which would be difficult to estimate, we develop formulas to closely approximate optimal policy and welfare effects based on reduced form “sufficient statistics” that can be estimated by using field experiments or quasi-experimental variation in product prices and energy costs.

We integrate the four-stage approach with Simar and Wilson’s (in J Econom 136:31–64, 2007 ) double bootstrapping to filter out the impacts of external variables in the efficiency measurement. Empirical results show that there is room for 15 % cost reductions and capacity, ownership, location and experience are all influential in improving the performance of these plants. We also demonstrate how the results can be applied to modify a yardstick incentive scheme. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014
L97|Regional Supplier Associations as the Producers of Transnational Club Goods in Latin American and Caribbean Utility Markets|There is growing the consensus that regional regulatory agencies provide regional club goods, however; there is little evidence of the impact of the collaborations of the utility providers themselves in the literature. Our study analyzes whether regional networks such as the Caribbean Electric Utility corporation contribute to solving energy issues in Latin America and the Caribbean. Networks of operators provide cross -border services, and operating as a single entity improves the lobbying opportunities of operators to influence policy. Results suggest that utilities that formed linkages or cooperation regionally are likely to benefit from such collaborations, but a comprehensive approach to capacity building and reform is needed to address the regions energy issues.
L97|Testing the Effectiveness of Regulation and Competition on Cable Television Rates|Regulation of the cable television industry was marked by remarkable periods of deregulation, re-regulation, and re-deregulation during the 1980s and 1990s. Using Federal Communications Commission firm-level survey data spanning 1993–2001, we model and econometrically estimate the effect of regulation and competition on cable rates. Our calculations indicate that although regulation lowered rates for small system operators, it raised them for medium and large systems. Meanwhile, competition consistently decreased rates from 5.6 to 8.8 percent, with even larger declines during periods of regulation. Our results suggest that competition is more effective than regulation in containing cable prices.
L97|A better deal for consumers and an attractive environment for investors: How the UK’s economic regulators are developing the use of regulatory and competition powers|There are great expectations in the UK for infrastructure and its role in delivering for customers and society, promoting efficiency and economic growth. These expectations are matched by an ambitious forward programme of investments in renewal and expansion of network capacity and quality across sectors, in some cases backed by the government and in others by private investors. Economic regulation and competition have a big role to play in aligning the interests of investors with the interests of customers and society. Specifically, in relation to investors, economic regulation and competition help to ensure investment is efficient, with the right investment taking place the right place, at the right time and at efficient cost. In this context, regulatory coherence and stability has rarely been so important. 2 In this paper we discuss • the relationship between competition and regulation, and the way regulators use their powers; • the importance of independent regulation in helping to ensure the delivery of what customers and society need, want and can afford from regulated sectors, particularly against a background of major investments in UK infrastructure; • how economic regulation needs to learn and evolve if it is to continue to help ensure delivery of what customers and society expect, given that regulated sectors and the environment in which they operate change over time; and • how the regulators are working together to maximise the benefits from coordination or read across between sectors.

L97|The determinants of board compensation in SOEs: an application to Italian local public utilities| This article investigates the determinants of board compensation for a sample of Italian state owned enterprises (SOEs). To that purpose, we use newly collected panel data of 106 local public utilities observed from 1994 through 2004, which includes detailed information on the boards of directors. During this period, the deregulation process inspired institutional interventions that forced utilities, traditionally owned by local municipalities, to change their juridical form and ownership structure, thereby facilitating the entrance of private investors. The corporate governance literature shows that such changes may exacerbate the agency conflicts between shareholders, top executives and the board. However, board compensation could reduce the agency costs by aligning the incentives of managers with the interests of shareholders. This article addresses this issue by investigating the impact that board composition, firm characteristics and performance have on board compensation. We find that the average board pay is positively related to firm dimension and negatively related to board size. The public or private nature of the major shareholder does not influence board compensation but the juridical form does. Finally, while the proportion of politically connected directors is found to negatively influence the level of per capita compensation, the impact of firm performance is uncertain.

L97|The Financing of Water Supply and Sewerage Services in Romania|Water supply and sewerage services represent utilities that must be provided to all users, both the urban and the rural. The responsibility to ensure these services in terms of non-discrimination and affordability belongs to the local authorities, which in the spirit of decentralization have exclusive jurisdiction on their establishment, organization and operation. Regardless of the chosen management, the funding of water supply and sewerage services, is accomplished by means of the prices and tariffs paid by the users. Their quantum, specific to some social services, covers the costs without allowing the accumulation of consistent profit margins, which would ensure the development of the specific infrastructure from the operators' own funds. It is therefore necessary that funding for the creation and rehabilitation of water supply and sewerage systems to be provided from other sources than the budgets of operators, such as: budgetary allocations of local public authorities, government or European funding programs. This paper is of interest because it captures just how the prices and tariffs for these services are composed, and the entire procedure for foundation, adjustment and modification that follows different rules from those of pricing in the market economy, and it provides a review of the types of programs through which the development of the specific technical-urban infrastructure and the significant increase in the number of users in the past 25 years.
L97|Commitment in utility regulation: A model of reputation and policy applications|This paper builds a dynamic model of utility regulation where a government cannot commit to a time-inconsistent policy of not expropriating investment. By allowing the government’s type to change over time, I explore how reputation concerns may generate partial commitment. Restricting attention to equilibria that are strongly renegotiation proof, I show that there is a unique perfect Bayesian equilibrium. This contains episodes of investment and good behaviour followed by periods of expropriation and non-investment. I then apply the model to consider how the power of the incentive scheme and decentralization may influence the properties of this equilibrium. In the case of the power of incentives, the model suggests that price-caps may worsen commitment in developing countries, but not in developed ones. Similarly, the model suggests that decentralisation is likely to have a significant effect on commitment, but that this effect will depend on the general ability of the government to commit. Overall, we conclude that the effect of such policies on commitment will be different across countries, depending on the institutional environment.

L97|Cooperation in the initial stages of infrastructure projects: a conceptual model and surv ey of Italian utility managers|This paper examines the role of collaborative initiatives in local infrastructure projects. It seeks to establish that cooperation between local governments, utilities, and other stakeholders has the potential of reducing the transaction costs that hinder the early stages of infrastructure investments. Having developed a conceptual model of cooperation between local actors in infrastructure projects (CLAIP), a survey was designed to obtain evidence of the main benefits and costs of collaboration in the construction of local water and transport infrastructure. The findings that emerge from managers’ opinions confirm that one of the main benefits of collaborative initiatives is the opportunity to acquire and transfer know-how in areas of the project containing problems or risks. CLAIP may also prove useful as a means of strengthening project governance, and increasing public acceptance of the facilities involved. Among the respondents, the managers who are most positive about CLAIP are likely to work in small and privately-owned or public-private utilities.
L97|As-Efficient Competitor Test in Exclusionary Prices Strategies: Does Post-Danmark Really Pave the Way towards a More Economic Approach?|The Post Danmark judgment may cast the light on the interpretations by the EU Court of Justice of crucial dimensions of the competition policy as: selective price cuts, above-cost rebates, costs test for exclusionary abuses with common costs. As we see one of the main interests of the decision lies on the cost criteria used by the Court to determine if a given price practice may exclude a competitor as efficient as the incumbent. In other words, does Post Danmark constitutes a real step towards the appropriation by the Court of Justice of the more economic approach promoted by the Commission and, more broadly, is really the logic of the Court coherent with an effects-based approach? Does Post Danmark conciliates the traditional decisional practice of the Court with the new principles of competition policy enforcement advocated by the Commission since the issuance of its February 2009 guidelines, relative to the exclusionary practices of dominant undertakings?
L97|The trade balance effects of infrastructure services regulation|This paper addresses the relationship between the design of incentives to firms under regulation, mainly the rule for adjusting tariffs, and trade balance performance of the country. We also explore whether this relationship is relevant or not for a typical developing economy like Argentina. We find it is. To study these issues we perform comparative static numerical exercises using a CGE model where service obligation and no entry in regulated industries are assumed. We show that the capital account openness and the rate of exchange regime could be key elements to match with the regulatory regime. The potential inconsistency between the international trade regime and the regulatory regime should not be rejected a priori. Copyright Springer-Verlag 2013

R&D Venturing is a practical way of bringing about technology transfer and exploration of future technologies through R&D cooperation, which is described in this paper by a multiple case study in the energy sector. Existing literature has been reviewed and an R&D Venturing concept will be suggested with a number of propositions for implementation. The results of the case study strongly support that different perspectives of the concept from industry, academia and the ventures themselves have to be carefully understood. Based on the results of the case study, a conceptual framework and propositions for a successful implementation have been derived. A critical discussion of the R&D Venturing concept shows the need for further empirical investigation. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2013
L97|Are New German Postal Providers Successful? Empirical Evidence Based on Unique Survey Data|In order to investigate firm survival and the potential for competition in the German postal market, I analyzed key success determinants of market leader competitors. The analysis is based on eight 2011 case studies, in which I conducted in-depth interviews during on-site visits to various postal firms. The analysis is further supported by unique data stemming from a survey I conducted in 2010 for the German postal market. In general, I find that there are possibilities for smaller private firms to succeed and survive in the market despite the natural monopoly occurring within the postal industry. The success of these firms is often based on specialization, cooperation and combining the postal business with another business, such as publishing.
L97|Competition through Cooperation? The Case of the German Postal Market|How can small and medium-sized German postal providers ensure nationwide geographical coverage without the aid of the former monopolist? A closer look at the industry revealed that postal providers in Germany engage in different types of cooperation in order to expand their geographical coverage independently from the market leader. In order to shed light on the effects of cooperation, I conducted a theoretical analysis using a spatial economic model complemented by a brief game-theoretical discussion. Moreover, I provide the first descriptive and case study evidence from unique data collected in 2010 and 2011, within the framework of a German postal market survey. I found that small postal providers cooperate with each other in order to extend their geographical service area and to succeed in the market. Furthermore, I also found – in both the theoretical analysis as well as in the evidence – that there is a negative counter-effect stemming from this cooperation.
L97|How consumers’ socio-economic background influences satisfaction: Insights for better utility regulation|Augmenting consumer welfare was a key justification behind the reform of utilities from the 1980s. But, three decades later, evidence is mounting that consumer satisfaction with household utilities is quite uneven. Moreover, governments, regulators and international organizations are increasingly recognizing that consumers from specific socio-economic backgrounds may be less satisfied than those from other backgrounds. To attend to this, instances of demand-side regulation have been implemented, but there remains a lack of empirical research on the precise links between consumers’ socio-economic background and their satisfaction. This article contrasts consumers’ stated and revealed preferences for three major household utility services (electricity, gas and telecommunications, including internet) across twelve European countries. Contrasting stated and revealed preferences has been applied to policy on transportation, marketing and the environment: this article pioneers the application of this technique to the analysis of satisfaction with household utilities across multiple countries. We find strong evidence that consumers’ socio-economic category matters: consumers with lower levels of education, the elderly and those who are not employed exhibit particular expenditure patterns and lower satisfaction levels vis-à-vis some of or all the services under analysis. We conclude by highlighting how our findings may be of use to regulators in the ongoing quest to improve the quality of utility regulation.

The situation of this region is analysed in the context of interregional and intraregional disparities emphasizing the close relation between the general development level and the provision of services of general economic interest as well as the particularly poorer situation of the border, rural, intermediate regions. The issues of applying of subsidiarity principle and the involvement of the private sector in the provision of these services are also discussed, in relation to the possible solutions for ensuring a better access of all citizens.
L97|Theory and empirics of horizontal and spatial integration of local communal services|There are three parts of our paper. Firstly, it gives an overview about the goals and factors which affect the integration of local communal services. Horizontal integration means joining the various individual service providers, such as water supply and sewage, communal waste, district heating, streetcleaning, public transportation companies. Spatial integration means joining the service providers of neighbouring communities. In recent years several examples can be observed for both types of integration in Hungary. Three main factors behind this trend will be discussed in detail: economies of scope argument, economies of scale argument and managerial power and prestige argument. According to the economies of scope argument, local service providers use similar physical assets (such as vehicles, office buildings, maintenance tools and so on) and similar skills and organizations. Joining of the respective customer bases brings synergies in the management of users (metering, billing, call centres and so on), and in administration costs. Bigger organizations may be in a better position in order to raise the funds required for financing their projected investments also. The economies of scale argument lies behind the spatial extension of the providers of the same service. However, spatial extension leads to the increasing cost of spatial interactions among the various sites of companies also which effect can overweight the potential cost reduction due to the increasing return. Horizontal and spatial integration can be driven also by managerial attitude towards empire building. The second part of the paper presents a short survey about the previous controversial empirical findings of the integration of local communal services in various countries. In the third part our own empirical research is presented, firstly as a case study about the integration of communal waste, district heating, real estate services and other general services in the Western Hungarian town of GyÃµr (which has about 130 thousand inhabitants) and secondly a comparative study about six other Hungarian towns (with similar size). Our results suggest a balanced view: cost efficiency argument cannot be verified in administrative activities, neither in horizontal nor in spatial integration, but there is slight cost efficiency in physical activities. The changing organizational structure and the joint human resource management have both advantages and disadvantages.
L97|Economies of scale in local communal services: a Hungarian case study|Knowledge of whether, and over what range of output, there are economies or diseconomies of scale in providing local communal services is an important question from theoretical, practical and regional political point of view also. The theoretical side of the question is connected to the primordial research concerning to the optimal city size. If optimal city size actually can be established, then a valid policy argument can be made for fostering its approximation. However, theoretical considerations are based sometimes those types of assumptions, which are often not valid in reality. Therefore empirical investigations are essential in this research area. After a short theoretical review, our paper firstly gives a general outline about the previous controversial empirical evidences on economies of scale in the community size and providing local communal services. Various conceptual and comparability problems in this issue are also examined, such as the differences between technical and monetary measures, the measurement problems of costs and outputs, the effect of population density, spatial extension of the community, the integrated service provision and the quality differences of services, the difference between service plant level and community level investigations. In the second part we present our empirical findings concerning to economies of scale in local communal services based on a large and detailed ten years long data base which consist of more than 200 Hungarian towns above 5 thousand inhabitants. The analysis has two levels, the community level and service level. On community level the general per capita costs are compared for the whole community, on service level the individual services are the observational units. During the examination several methodological questions have occurred. For example, there are several solutions for the organizational structure of providing local services, from the big holding to the smaller individual companies. Considering this and some other issues, the main results suggest that on community level there is a moderated economies of scale until 20 thousand inhabitants, but above this level there is not connection between the settlement size and the average cost of services. This result is mainly consistent with the previous findings: there are economies of scale under a threshold, but after reaching this, unit cost reduction is not feasible. This threshold is different in the different types of services.
L97|Regionale Verteilungswirkungen durch das Vergütungs- und Umlagesystem des Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetzes (EEG)|Die Untersuchung analysiert regionale Verteilungseffekte der Energiewende in Deutschland. Im Fokus steht die regionale Verteilung erneuerbarer Energieanlagen, des erneuerbar erzeugten Stroms sowie des EEG-Finanzierungssaldos für das Jahr 2011. Räumliche Betrachtungseinheit sind die Bundesländer, Landkreise und siedlungsstrukturelle Kreistypen. Mit Hilfe der Verteilung der Anlagen und der Herstellerfirmen werden die Wertschöpfungs- und Beschäftigungseffekte aus der Erzeugung von Strom durch erneuerbare Energieträger für ländliche und nicht ländliche Regionen abgeschätzt. Zudem werden sektorale Verteilungseffekte des EEG-Finanzierungssystems am Beispiel des Agrarsektors untersucht. Die Untersuchung zeigt, dass ländliche Regionen maßgeblich zur Stromerzeugung aus erneuerbaren Energien beitragen. Die Energieanlagendichte ist zumeist höher als in den nicht ländlichen Regionen. Nach wie vor gibt es auch ländliche Räume mit geringer Produktion erneuerbarer Energien. Ländliche Regionen profitieren von den EEG-Vergütungszahlungen und erzielen höhere Wertschöpfungs- und Beschäftigungseffekte aus dem Betrieb und der Wartung der Energieanlagen. Nicht ländliche Regionen profitieren hingegen von den höheren Wertschöpfungseffekten aus der Herstellung der Anlagen.
L97|Dynamics of Yardstick Regulation: Historical Cost Data and the Ratchet E ffect|Real life applications of Yardstick Regulation frequently refer to historical cost data. While Yardstick Regulation cuts the link between fi rms own costs and prices firms may charge in a static setting, it does not in a dynamic setting where historical cost data is used. A fi rm can influence the price it will be allowed to charge in the future if its behavior today can e ffect future behavior of other fi rms that determines the price this fi rm will be able to charge later on. This paper shows that, assuming that slack, infl ating of costs, is bene cial to fi rms, a tradeoff between short term profit through abstinence from slack and the benefit of slack in (in finitely) many periods arises. A ratchet eff ect that Yardstick Regulation was meant to overcome can occur and firms can realize positive rents because of the use of historical cost data, even if firms are identical. Equilibria with positive slack can exist without any collusion between fi rms or threat. Moreover, this problem is more severe if the fi rm with lowest costs of all other firms instead of the average fi rm is the yardstick.
L97|Public and Public Utility Enterprises Restructuring: Statistical and Quantitative Aid for Ensuring Human Resource Sustainability|This article presents a quantitative approach to restructuring public and public utility enterprises, particularly during downsizing requests. The large number of employees in the public sector can be one of the causes for economic instability at country level. That is particularly visible in the context of the euro zone crisis and economic/political instability in countries like Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Italy. Our approach is based on the statistical analysis of productivity oscillation and setting of performance standards in public and public utility enterprises based on the aforementioned productivity. Data background is given through job descriptions, organizational charts, salary reports and monthly performance reports, in most cases part of organizational information systems. It is recommended for quantitative data to be analyzed on a monthly basis, during a period of 30 or more months. Our method increases procedural fairness and accuracy, because quantitative, statistical, impartial and objective approach is applied for estimating parameters which could be related to downsizing. However, the application of this method is not limited to downsizing, as during its application in more than 20 public and public utility enterprises it was sometimes applied to increase output or reduce costs not necessarily connected to labour. Although it finally refers to downsizing, this method can provide fairer and more impartial approach than the subjective estimate of employee surplus, and its arbitral distribution within the enterprise.
L97|The Hunter Valley access undertaking: Elements of a negotiated settlement|Is Australian transport regulation ready for negotiated access undertakings? On 29 June 2011 the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) accepted an access undertaking from Australian Rail Track Corporation (ARTC) in relation to the Hunter Valley rail network. The ACCC encouraged ARTC and its users (principally coal producers) to discuss and negotiate the detail of the undertaking. At the final stage the parties were able to resolve their differences and put an agreed undertaking to the ACCC. Compared to the undertaking that the ACCC would likely otherwise have accepted, this agreement was for a shorter term and embodied other provisions preferred by the users, in return for a higher rate of return requested by ARTC. The paper discusses the nature and lessons of this experience.
L97|Consideration Regarding Community Services of the Romanian Public Utilities|The community service of public utilities has known all through time various regulations and revisions that have been done according to the political, economic and administrative views of that period. In the 1866 Constitution, they were considered as public utilities, whereas Law 129/1938 labelled them as communal exploitation and the communist regime revised them as public households. The current legislation, written according to the European principles established them as community service of public utilities. The present politics and administration encourage a certain openness of market of public services, but the community services of public utilities still implies a certain degree of monopole. That is due to the fact that this type of services are offered through a local administration infrastructure and also to the fact that they serve the public interest, enclosing accessibility and capacity to be supported by all users. The aim of this paper is to present the evolution of the way the community services of public utilities have been organized and have been supplied to the people. The analysis is done taking into consideration the different legal laws that regulate this field but also the relation between suppliers and users that functions in a monopole market. The decisions and the evolution in this particular market are only dependent on the local public authorities and the protective political measures taken by the authorities. This paper aims to point out the directions to be followed in the future regarding the community services of public utilities, monopole or liberalization
L97|Price and volatility dynamics between electricity and fuel costs: Some evidence for Spain|The purpose of this study is to investigate the causal linkages between the Spanish electricity, Brent crude oil and Zeebrugge (Belgium) natural gas 1-month-ahead forward prices. Following Lütkepohl et al. (2004), we control for the presence of a structural change in the series and then we use the Johansen cointegration test and a vector error correction model (VECM) to embrace the analysis. Additionally, a multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (GARCH) model is applied to explore volatility interactions between the three markets involved in the study. Our findings reveal that Brent crude oil and Zeebrugge natural gas forward prices play a prominent role in the Spanish electricity price formation process. Furthermore, causation, both in price and volatility, runs from Brent crude oil and natural gas forward markets to the Spanish electricity forward market. These results are of practical importance for both the wholesale and retail markets' participants as well as the regulator through the established link between the forward contracts' price and the Spanish tariff of last resort paid by more than 23million of customers.
L97|Product Differentiation and the Irrelevancy of Input Prices for Make-or-Buy Decisions|Mandatory network unbundling is perhaps one of the foremost topics in regulatory economics today. The concept has crucial importance in the deregulation of many previously regulated industries including telecommunications, gas, electricity and railroads. Moreover, the topic has emerged as one of the more prominent issues associated with the implementation of the 1996 Telecommunication Act in the United States. Upon initial examination, establishing the correct costing standards and/or determining the correct input prices would seem important for sending the correct price signals to the entrants for their efficient make-or-buy decisions. However, Sappington uses a standard Hotelling location model to show that input prices are irrelevant for an entrant’s make or buy decision. In this study, we show that this result is closely related to the specific conditions of the Hotelling framework. Specifically, it is shown that input prices are irrelevant when firms produce homogeneous products, but are relevant for make-or-buy decisions when the entrant and incumbent produce differentiated products under Bertrand price competition fra-mework. These results suggest that, in general, it is important for regulators to set correct prices in order to not distort the entrants’ efficient make-or-buy decisions.

L97|Customer Lifetime Value in Public Services|Public administration and public services, after a slow development and successive layers, from the beginning of the 90s witnessed a significant transformation. The legislation, by choice or necessity,imposed previously unknown areas of competition in the sector. In open markets where entry and exit barriers are absent or limited andswitching costs associated with the change of supplier minimized, competition is based on the value served to the customer; in turn, the relationship with the customer is a value for the company, a financial and reputational asset on which could be founded the future strategy. This work aims to illustrate the concept of customer lifetime value and the operability of the strategy of the utility company oriented towards efficiency and effectiveness for the citizen.
L97|The Short-Run and Long-Run Effects of Behavioral Interventions: Experimental Evidence from Energy Conservation|"We document three remarkable features of the Opower program, in which social comparison- based home energy reports are repeatedly mailed to more than six million households nationwide. First, initial reports cause high-frequency ""action and backsliding,"" but these cycles attenuate over time. Second, if reports are discontinued after two years, effects are relatively persistent, decaying at 10-20 percent per year. Third, consumers are slow to habituate: they continue to respond to repeated treatment even after two years. We show that the previous conservative assumptions about post-intervention persistence had dramatically understated cost effectiveness and illustrate how empirical estimates can optimize program design."
L97|Board composition, political connections, and performance in state-owned enterprises| This article analyses the effects of board composition on the behavior of a sample of 114 Italian local public utilities, for which information about 1630 directors during 1994--2004 has been collected. This period is particularly interesting because of the legal changes that forced many firms to alter their juridical form and accommodated the entrance of private investors. We investigate whether board size and/or board composition do affect decisions about employment and how they ultimately impact performance. Our main findings indicate that politically connected directors, who dominate boards of directors in Italian public utilities, exert a positive and significant effect on employment, and have a negative impact on performance.

L97|Regulating Networks in the New Economy|The regulation of network industries has undergone profound transformation in the past twenty years. The regulated industry is no longer the same, being exposed to new competitive dynamics having revolutionized their industrial framework, technology and interactions with users. There also have been fundamental changes in what regulation is feasible. In an “information society” a model devised in the 19th century to set prices for monopoly infrastructures such as bridges, roads and railways no longer captures the essential: the interactive dynamics created by technologies, uses, and markets.
L97|Horizontal Product Differentiation and the Irrelevancy of Input Prices for Make-or-Buy Decisions|Mandatory network unbundling is one of the most important topics in regulatory economics today. The concept has crucial importance in the deregulation of many previously regulated industries including electricity, telecommunications, gas and railroads. Upon initial examination, determining the correct input prices would seem important for sending the correct price signals to the entrants for their efficient make-or-buy decisions. However, Sappington uses a standard Hotelling location model to show that input prices are irrelevant for an entrant’s make or buy decision. In this study, it is shown that this result is closely related to the degree of product differentiation when firms are engaged in price competition. Specifically, it is shown that input prices are irrelevant when firms produce homogeneous products, but are relevant for make-or-buy decisions when the entrant and incumbent produce differentiated products. These results suggest that, in general, it is important for regulators to set correct prices in order to not distort the entrants’ efficient make-or-buy decisions.
L97|Risk Spillovers and Hedging : Why Do Firms Invest Too Much in Systemic Risk?|In this paper we show that free entry decisions may be socially inefficient, even in a perfectly competitive homogeneous goods market with non-lumpy investments. In our model, inefficient entry decisions are the result of risk-aversion of incumbent producers and consumers, combined with incomplete financial markets which limit risk-sharing between market actors. Investments in productive assets affect the distribution of equilibrium prices and quantities, and create risk spillovers. From a societal perspective, entrants underinvest in technologies that would reduce systemic sector risk, and may overinvest in risk-increasing technologies. The inefficiency is shown to disappear when a complete financial market of tradable risk-sharing instruments is available, although the introduction of any individual tradable instrument may actually decrease efficiency. We therefore believe that sectors without well-developed financial markets will benefit from sector-specific regulation of investment decisions.
L97|Assessing Territorial Impact Assessment: The Case of Services of General Interest|There is no single or common definition or even understanding of Territorial Impact Assessment (TIA). Generally, the concept is described as a method based on a multi-criteria scenario and indicator approached analysis which will provide information about the territorial impact of a policy. The conceptual background of TIA is focused on Territorial Cohesion (TC), which, in turn, also lacks a single definition. TC has a strong connection to Services of General Interest (SGI) as these services are a crucial element of the Cohesion Policy. Key elements of TC are social, economic and territorial cohesion stressing a spatial coverage as well as fair and universal access of SGI regardless which region you live in. As the definition of SGI is wide and vague, a clear classification of these services is difficult to be set. In this sense, a structured theoretical framework regarding SGI was developed within the ESPON project SeGI - Indicators and perspectives for services of general interest in territorial cohesion and development. This paper is a spin-off of the ESPON SeGI project and aims at discussing the applicability of territorial impact assessment on services of general interest. The following four research questions are proposed to be answered: (1) how does TIA relate with SGI? (2) To what extend can TIA be applied for assessing SGI? (3) Should the territorial impact be differently assessed for different SGI? (4) Are there any external factors that make TIA difficult to use for assessing the territorial impact of SGI? Previous research and EU policy documents constitute the empirical material in this study. The analysis is focused on an ex ante evaluation of TIA and on the methodology of critical evaluation. The findings suggest a rather limited applicability as an undefined concept (TIA) is based on another undefined concept (TC) to measure the impact on a vaguely defined concept (SGI). Moreover, the particularities of each SGI may be related to economic and social changes that could be or not territorially reflected. So, using TIA for all services of general interest is difficult as various external factors interfere without having a territorial impact.

L97|Co-Investments and Tacit Collusion in Regulated Network Industries: Experimental Evidence|Several regulatory authorities have recently allowed competing network operators to co-invest in network infrastructure. With the use of a laboratory experiment, we investigate the impact of co-investments on competition in regulated network industries, particularly in comparison to unilateral and duplicate investments. Our main finding is that co-investment (i.e. cooperation at the infrastructure level) facilitates tacit collusion (i.e. cooperation at the retail level) significantly, which questions the positive evaluation of co-investments with respect to consumers’ surplus in the theoretical literature.
L97|Die Bedeutung der Braunkohle in Deutschland|Die Stromerzeugung in Deutschland wird sich in den nächsten Jahren grundlegend ändern. Dies ist nicht nur auf den Ausstieg aus der Kernenergie zurückzuführen. Vor allem werden die erneuerbaren Energien mit erheblicher Förderung weiter an Marktanteilen gewinnen. Die Braunkohle stellt bisher eine wichtige Säule der Stromerzeugung dar. Die klimapolitischen Anforderungen und möglicherweise steigende Preise für Emissionsrechte bedeuten eine große Herausforderung für diesen heimischen und relativ preisgünstigen Energieträger. Dennoch wäre es unangemessen, die Nutzung der Braunkohle für die Stromversorgung in Deutschland politisch zu behindern. Welche Rolle sie in Zukunft noch spielen kann, muss letztlich im Wettbewerb vor dem Hintergrund der Produktions- und Klimakosten ermittelt werden.
L97|Forward integration and market entry: Evidence from natural gas markets for household customers in Germany|Due to potential abuse of the market power at wholesale and retail market level for natural gas the Federal Cartel Office in Germany prohibited further forward integration of gas importing firms with retail incumbents from 2005/2006 to 2010. The Authority argued that the very few dominant gas importing companies, which also own and operate the gas pipelines, could have an incentive to foreclose existing competitors or prevent potential market entry. However, two of the importing companies remained extensively forward integrated. To analyze possible forward integration issues empirically we employ cross sectional data (for September 2009) for about 500 sub markets for household customers in Germany. These submarkets have different vertical ownership structures. Our data set contains information on ownership and market entry. By applying a market entry model, which is based on the framework introduced by Bresnahan and Reiss (1991), we do not find clear evidence that market entry is restricted by forward integration of gas importers and retail incumbents.

En general, se concluye que la regulación generó una pérdida en el bienestar de los consumidores.
L97|La collaboration interprofessionnelle : cas d’un service de pédiatrie d’un hôpital universitaire au Liban|Interprofessional collaboration (IPC) is an innovating concept which emerges in organization and management theory and which is mostly applied to the health sector. As a response to the evidence found in the literature as to the lack of precise definitions of IPC and to the existence of many underlying concepts which renders its applicability difficult, we propose a generic definition and three contextualized definitions of IPC based on the empirical study conducted in three wards of a pediatric unit of a teaching hospital in Lebanon. The case study approach used in this research allows us to compare between the three units, to propose models of IPC which take into consideration the specific environment of each unit and to develop a generic model of IPC. The unique interview grid on which is based this work limits bias from the researcher and subjectivity of the actors. This tool allows us to highlight the perception of actors of the IPC, the potential situations of IPC, forms of IPC, prerequisites of IPC, facilitating and restrictive factors of IPC and the outcomes.
L97|Arm's length delegation of public services|Delegation is a key feature of political decision making: Mayors or prime ministers delegate to subordinates, voters delegate to elected representatives. We analyze the effect of political delegation on public service provision and the choice between private or public providers when contracts are incomplete and incentives therefore distorted. We identify two important effects: The incentive effect increases the incentive part of service providers' remuneration and delegation may therefore be a substitute for an explicit complete incentive contract. The bargaining effect improves the bargaining position vis a vis a private firm with market power. In general, these effects imply that delegation improves public service provision.
L97|Regulators as Reflexive Governance Platforms|Network industries are now characterized by a regime of permanent innovation, while they continue to be fixed and sunk cost industries, due to the high level of investments in R&D and infrastructures. Players in these industries need to coordinate their investments; hence a threat of collusion. In the same time competition is fierce due to the opportunities brought by innovations; hence the permanent risk of catastrophic evolutions due to systemic interdependencies. To balance this dilemma between coordination and competition, independent third parties granted with capabilities to influence the â€œrules of the gameâ€ are needed. They need however to access critical information and knowledge. Coordination of investments requires figuring out the possible futures of the technology and of the industry. Avoiding oligopoly capture relies on an understanding of costs and business models. Since the relevant information and knowledge are dispersed and permanently evolving, regulators have to organize fora in which the stakeholders have incentives to reveal information, both because they need to learn from others, and because they seek to influence the industry regulation. Properly organized fora establish an open information competition among stakeholders, which can be penalized if they hide or distort information too much.

L97|Regulation and Welfare: Assessing the Regulation of Electricity and Water Supply Utilities in Colombia During the 1990s. The Case of Empresas Públicas de Medellín|Public utilities reforms in the nineties introduced institutional and methodological changes in the price regulation of electricity and water supply utilities in Colombia. This paper, in addition to outlining these changes, evaluates welfare effects through a counterfactual scenario and the measurement of equivalent variation. With the counterfactual, we analyze how prices would have evolved had reforms not been made, while the equivalent variation assesses the impact of reforms on consumers’ welfare. To calculate the equivalent variation, an Almost Ideal Demand System is first estimated to obtain price and expenditure elasticities. In general, we conclude that regulation led to a consumer welfare loss.
L97|A Survey on the Spanish Electricity Intraday Market/El mercado de electricidad español: el mercado intradiario|The Spanish electricity intraday market presents a particular design that makes it unique in Europe. The study is carried out on an hourly basis in order to identify hourly patterns in prices and traded quantities by session. The study evidences an overall growing interest from market participants in intraday trading, particularly in the last-time-negotiated hours. Prices exhibit hourly and daily seasonality as well as mean reversion. Going in depth into the analysis of the current electricity intraday markets is of great relevance nowadays given that there is an open debate concerning the optimal design for intraday markets all over Europe as a consequence of the wholehearted integration of renewables into the power system. El diseño del mercado intradiario de electricidad español no se repite en ningún otro mercado eléctrico europeo. El presente trabajo analiza precios y cantidades negociadas utilizando una frecuencia horaria con el fin de identificar pautas de comportamiento horarios en este mercado. Se evidencia en general un interés creciente por parte de los participantes en el mercado, especialmente en las horas de última posibilidad de negociación. Los precios presentan estacionalidad tanto horaria como diaria así como reversión a la media. La profundización en el análisis de los mercados intradiarios de electricidad existentes es un tema que reviste una gran importancia dado que actualmente existe un debate abierto en relación al diseño óptimo de los mercados intradiarios en Europa como consecuencia de la decidida incorporación de las energías renovables en el sistema eléctrico.
L97|Subadditivity and Contestability in the Postal Sector: Theory and Evidence|Several studies have been conducted to analyze whether a regulation of the postal sector as a monopoly is actually efficient by examining its cost structure. The authors detected significant scale economies only in the delivery function and hence demonstrated a necessity for competition in the upstream operations. The primary purpose of this paper is to summarize the basic conditions of natural monopoly theory and to review the approaches and results of the studies dealing with this topic. Despite the importance of contestability in this context, previous literature concentrates only on the subadditivity aspect. The existence of economies of scale does not inevitably justify a governmental maintenance of the monopoly if the market is contestable. In this respect, further research is needed in order to account for contestability.
L97|Essential Facilities under Construction? A Reflection on Public Policies concerning Next Generation Networks|The public policy discussion concerning next generation networks NGNs began in Europe in 2005, when the capacity of mobile networks was far lower than it is now, and has thus concentrated on fixed networks. Looking ahead, the discussion of access problems to NGNs should consider the competitive constraints arising from mobiles. This seems unlikely, as a peculiar «regulatory compact» comprising new entrants and highly skilled bureaucrats in the regulatory agencies has developed over the past decade. Such a compact, in Europe, seeks to apply to NGNs most (in the Italian case, all) the regulatory measures developed for copper. This increases risk and decreases investment: such an effect is already visible in the data.
L97|Municipalities at a Crossroad: Ownership, Performance and Reforms in Local Public Services|A recent debate in Italy has stressed the relevance of the so called «municipal capitalism», i.e. of the increasing presence of the firms owned by local governments in the public services sectors. These firms are suspected of being ways on the one hand to by-pass public finance constraints and on the other hand to distort competition in sectors where local authorities are in charge also of public regulation. The aim of this article is to return a descriptive analysis of direct and indirect holdings by local governments and to give evidence of their impact on the Italian economic activity and on their operating performance.
L97|Municipal Enterprises: Political Interference or Management Discretion?|The attention of scholars and policy makers is shifting from full privatisation to alternative measures as a means to improve the efficiency of public services. This paper focuses on three restructuring measures adopted by local governments: partial privatisation (without transfer of control rights), inter-municipal joint ventures, and the presence of outside directors on the Board. Divergent hypotheses on these measures have emerged according to whether public choice or agency theory has been used. An empirical analysis investigates the effects of restructuring processes on a sample of Italian municipal utilities. Partial privatisation has been shown to play a significant and positive role, while Board independence from management has a less significant influence. Multi-government utilities have been found to suffer from severe coordination costs, which are not outweighed by scale benefits. Our findings reveal that management discretion is a significant source of inefficiency in municipal enterprises.
L97|Corporate Governance and Performance in Local Public Utilities|This paper analyses the effects of corporatization, mixed ownership and board composition on the behaviour and performance of a sample of 114 Italian local public utilities, for which information about 1,630 directors during 1994-2004 has been collected. Our main findings indicate that, while the corporatization process and the presence of private investors are positively correlated with profitability, the presence of politically connected directors, who dominate boards of directors in the Italian public utilities in the period under investigation, exerts a negative impact on performance.
L97|Aerospace, Security and Defence|In the last two decades a new industrial sector has taken shape, coming to comprise aerospace, security and defense as a whole. Indeed, borders that used to separate the three segmentshave gradually blurred. Such a new market reality presents specific features that strongly influence market regulations, industrial policy, and most of all, the support to technological research. In this evolved context, it has indeed proven difficult to put aside States' specific security and defense needs, however excessive impermeability risks to create duplications and waste resources, as well as contradictory effects. Moreover, these critical issues also influence even more problematically the European market dimension. In this framework, the direct and indirect interplays among the three main actors - industry, state and foreign customers - cannot be overlooked. Europe's reference market is currently represented by the US' and the variety of ongoing initiatives (Framework Agreement/LoI, OCCAR, EDA, European Commission) aim at favoring a similar continental integration. In fact, the concentration process of the European industry, within which the Italian industry has progressively consolidated, goes in that same direction. The current challenge is that of rationalization of industrial activities so as to secure areas of technological excellence, while taking into account the limits imposed by the international economic and financial crisis.
L97|Sustainability as a Driver for Investments in the Energy Sector|The search for sustainability is driving innovation in all production fields and the most dynamic economies are focusing their efforts to recover from the crisis of 2009 on green sectors. The energy sector is leading this change towards sustainability with the substitution of fossil fuels with renewable energy sources and with a permanent change in the investment pattern. The request for sustainability in the energy sector is strictly related to the social acceptability of new investments, which cannot be neglected for changes like those under way. The paper says that the technological change must become the opportunity to improve the competitiveness of the energy industry in a win win strategy.
L97|Meeting Infrastructure Needs in Australia|Adequate and well-functioning infrastructure is a key ingredient to growth and well-being. The benefits to activity of efficient spending in energy, water, transport and communication sectors go well beyond their contribution to capital accumulation. Good infrastructure facilitates trade, bolsters market integration and competition, fosters the dissemination of ideas and innovations and enhances access to resources and public services. These benefits are particularly important for Australia because of its size, the geographical dispersion of its population and production centres, and its remoteness from other markets. Nevertheless, Australia has an important infrastructure deficit. This is in part due to underinvestment in the 1980s and 1990s, while the rebound in capital spending at the beginning of the 2000s has been insufficient to deal with capacity shortages exacerbated by the strong demand generated by the mining boom, expected population growth, technological progress and environmental concerns. To ease these shortages, the authorities have put bolstering infrastructure to the top of their economic policy agenda. This entails greater government expenditure in this area, but also structural reforms to optimise public and private investment choices and the use of existing facilities with better regulation. This chapter reviews the state of Australia’s infrastructure and the government’s action programme. Répondre aux besoins d'infrastructures en Australie Des infrastructures adéquates et fonctionnant bien sont essentielles pour la croissance et le bien-être. Des dépenses bien gérées dans les secteurs de l’énergie, de l’eau, des transports et des communications influencent positivement l’activité au delà de leur contribution à l’accumulation du capital. Elles facilitent les échanges, renforcent l’intégration des marchés et la concurrence, permettent la diffusion des idées et des innovations et améliorent l’accès aux ressources et aux services publics. Ces bénéfices sont particulièrement importants dans le cas de l’Australie en raison de sa taille, de la dispersion géographique de sa population et de ses centres de productions ainsi que leur éloignement des autres marchés. Le pays est pourtant confronté à un déficit d’infrastructures. Celui-ci est du en partie à un sous-investissement au cours des décennies 1980 et 1990. Le rebond des dépenses en capital au début des années 2000 a été insuffisant pour faire face au manque de capacités exacerbé par la hausse de la demande générée par le boom des produits miniers, la progression attendue de la population, les progrès technologiques et les préoccupations environnementales. Pour réduire ces tensions, les pouvoirs publics ont placé le renforcement des infrastructures en haut de leur agenda de politique économique. Ceci implique un accroissement des dépenses publiques dans ce domaine, mais aussi des réformes structurelles visant à optimiser les choix d’investissements publics et privés et l’utilisation des équipements existants grâce à une meilleure régulation. Ce chapitre passe en revue la situation du secteur des infrastructures en Australie et le programme d’action du gouvernement.

L97|Risk spillovers and hedging: why do firms invest too much in systemic risk?|In this paper we show that free entry decisions may be socially inefficient, even in a perfectly competitive homogeneous goods market with non-lumpy investments. In our model, inefficient entry decisions are the result of risk-aversion of incumbent producers and consumers, combined with incomplete financial markets which limit risk-sharing between market actors. Investments in productive assets affect the distribution of equilibrium prices and quantities, and create risk spillovers. From a societal perspective, entrants underinvest in technologies that would reduce systemic sector risk, and may overinvest in risk-increasing technologies. The inefficiency is shown to disappear when a complete financial market of tradable risk-sharing instruments is available, although the introduction of any individual tradable instrument may actually decrease efficiency. We therefore believe that sectors without well-developed financial markets will benefit from sector-specific regulation of investment decisions.
L97|The determinants of board compensation in SOEs: An application to Italian public utilities|This paper investigates the determinants of board compensation for a sample of Italian State Owned Enterprises (SOEs). To that purpose, we use a newly collected panel data of 106 local public utilities observed for the years 1994-2004, which includes detailed information on the boards of directors. During this period, the deregulation process inspired institutional interventions that forced utilities, traditionally owned by local municipalities, to change their juridical form and ownership structure, thereby facilitating the entrance of private investors. The corporate governance literature shows that such changes may exacerbate the agency conflicts between shareholders, top executives and the board. However, board compensation could reduce the agency costs by aligning the incentives of managers with the interests of shareholders. This paper addresses this issue by investigating the impact that board composition, firm characteristics and performance have on board compensation. We find that the average board pay is negatively related to board size and positively related to firm dimension. The public or private nature of the major shareholder does not influence board compensation but the juridical form does. Finally, while the proportion of politically connected directors is found to negatively influence the level of per capita compensation, the impact of firm performance is uncertain.
L97|Informal Benchmarks as a Source of Regulatory Threat in Unregulated Utility Sectors|This paper investigates to what extent unregulated local monopolies attempt not to evoke the introduction of a formal price regulation by conforming to customers’ and authorities’ expectations. It is argued that utilities can meet expectations by setting prices that imitate neighbours’ prices. The empirical evaluation rests on a cross-sectional data set representing all Swedish district heating utilities, and on a flexible nonlinear IV specification. It is found that while utilities’ price setting schemes are insensitive to customer complaints, they are significantly influenced by the passive monitoring by authorities. The spillover effect from the 5-6 closest neighbours is around 40 %.
L97|Electricity and telecoms reforms in the EU: Insights from the economics of federalism|The economics of federalism is a broad discipline with more than five decades of experience. It may shed light on how regulatory jurisdiction is allocated in EU electricity and telecommunications markets. The liberalization of these markets has been accompanied by gradual harmonization of national markets to overcome resistance to competitive forces. Less steps than necessary have been undertaken to promote market integration. Positive and normative reasons remain however for the participation of national or even regional/local powers. Vertical cooperation will remain a necessary condition of a sound regulatory framework, but cooperation may sometimes be inhibited by distributive considerations.
L97|Public interest versus regulatory capture in the Swedish electricity market|This article tests the public interest and regulatory capture hypotheses, in the context of the Swedish electricity market, by studying the factors influencing the Swedish Energy Agency's decision to replace decision-makers it employs to hear customer complaints against utilities. The study covers the period from the beginning of 1996, when a series of regulatory reforms were introduced to improve consumer protection, until the end of 2008. The study concludes that decision-makers who find in favor of customers have had a statistically lower probability of being removed, consistent with public interest theory. A transitory effect of favoring utilities can be observed for the period from 2 to 6 years following the reforms. In this period, government and public scrutiny of the regulator, which had been high in the immediate aftermath of the reforms, had waned and there were few precedents decided by the courts that the regulator was required to follow. This vacuum created an opportunity for the utilities to increase their influence over the regulator. Once the courts started establishing precedents in relatively large numbers, the supervisory role of the courts ensured that the actions of the regulator were scrutinized. This development has served a similar function to government and public scrutiny in the years immediately following the reforms in promoting the public interest.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L97|Is the level of financial sector development a key determinant of private investment in the power sector?|TThis paper seeks to assess the extent to which a country’s overall level of development and that of its financial sector, in particular, are factors that attract private capital into infrastructure projects. The authors investigate these effects in a 1990–2007 dataset on the power sector in 37 developing countries. The results suggest that economic growth is a key determinant of private investors’ investment in infrastructure projects, and that investors tend to take countries’ governance quality into account in their decisions to invest. The empirical results highlight that the development of the financial sector also plays a significant role in private investors’ decisions to enter infrastructure sectors. In particular, the degree of country risk and exchange rate volatility is found to be negatively This paper—a product of the Sustainable Development Department, Middle East and North Africa Region—is part of a larger effort in the department to promote infrastructure development in client countries through applied research targeting cutting-edge policy, regulatory and infrastructure finance issues.

Furthermore, when the banking sector and the capital market are separately treated in the analysis, the existence of a well functioning capital market is the main attracting factor. In addition, the existence of an independent energy regulatory authority significantly improves the level of private investors’ implication in energy projects. When accounting for the interactions between the overall economic development and the financial sector development variables, the effects of these variables are still significant and the results also confirm the importance of an independent energy sector regulator.

L97|Tariff regulation and profitability of energy networks|In this paper we analyse the impact of the regulatory framework for the new regulatory period (2011 – 2013) on the long-term profitability of TenneT TSO, the operator of the highvoltage electricity network in the Netherlands. Long-term profitability is a key component of the financeability of a firm. In the long run, the return on capital should be at least equal to the opportunity costs of capital in order to finance investments. As the ultimate indicator for the long-term profitability, we use the net present value of economic profit, which is the difference between total revenues and total costs, including a normal return on capital. In order to simulate the future financial development of the TSO, we developed a model.

L97|Does political accountability matter for infrastructure regulation? The case of telecommunications|This paper discusses the link between political accountability, regarded as an important aspect of institutional design, and infrastructure regulation that has been emphasized in the recent literature on the role of institutions in economic development. We report on the findings and lessons drawn from an analysis of telecommunications data covering the period 1985-1999 on two sets of countries; one composed of 29 developing countries and another of 23 developed countries. The main point highlighted by the analysis is that infrastructure regulation in a given country cannot be independent of the institutional environment, in particular, the degree of political accountability that supports the country’s institutions. The argument is demonstrated by means of an econometric estimation of dynamic panel data models that shows evidence of a significant effect of pro- political accountability factors on regulatory performance as reflected in measures of sector output and efficiency. Expectedly enough, this effect is found to be more pronounced in the developing countries data set. A key policy implication of this result is that efforts to enhance institutional quality and support politically accountable systems in developing countries should yield large benefits for infrastructure regulation.

L97|Investigating affordability problems of utility services - a theoretical study on the ratio measure|Unlike in developing countries, there tends to be no problem of access to water, electricity, and heating for private households in transition countries. However, transition countries have a considerable amount of low-income households, and the problem of affordability of these environmental-related utility services remains urgent. Welfare economics literature suggests to neglect affordability aspects by separating allocative from distributive impacts of pricing. In practice, this separation runs the risk of rendering impossible any sustainability-oriented price reform. An Institutional Economics approach takes competing objectives into account. From this viewpoint it appears to be worth investigating the affordability-concept. Although the affordability-related research has escalated remarkably in recent years, the theoretical contributions are still limited. Hence, we focus on the simple ratio measure often used in practice. We analyze the arguments speaking for the 'potential affordability approach'. But we find that - within that approach - adhering formally to the ratio measure is possible only under conditions that make no sense regarding the concern of the measure. Thus for most cases the ratio measure is misleading. Some considerations on practical use for governance conclude the paper.
L97|Bureaucratic Minimal Squawk Behavior: Theory and Evidence from Regulatory Agencies|"This paper develops a model in which a desire to avoid criticism prompts otherwise public-spirited bureaucrats to behave inefficiently. Decisions are taken to keep interest groups quiet and to keep mistakes out of the public eye. The policy implications of this ""minimal squawk"" behavior are at odds with the view that agencies should be structured to minimize the threat of ""capture."" An empirical test using data from US State Public Utility Commissions rejects the capture hypothesis and is consistent with the squawk hypothesis: longer PUC terms of office are associated with a higher incidence of rate reviews and lower household electricity bills.

L97|Common Costs And Cross‐Subsidies: Misestimation Versus Misallocation|Existing models of cross‐subsidization have focused on either ex ante distortions to investments or misallocations of common costs as the principal sources of cross‐subsidies in regulated firms. In this paper, we identify a third vehicle for such cross‐subsidization that, given regulators’ preferences, is not only likely but likely to be prominent; namely, the misestimation of the magnitude of common costs. Because our results incorporate regulators’ preferences, they may provide the necessary building block for a positive theory of the magnitude of observed common costs that has, heretofore, been absent in the literature.

L97|Prescriptive Public Choice: Application To Residential Water Rate Reform|Peltzman’s model of price regulation predicts inefficient prices for regulated firms; based on a constraint giving the trade‐off between economic profit and the regulated price, the price will be set between a competitive industry price and a monopoly price. This article generalizes the model for application to a wider class of trade‐offs, including municipal utilities that are not legally permitted to make a profit. Extending Peltzman’s idea of political support functions, this article defines political feasibility relative to economic efficiency. A Pareto superior change with compensation is sufficient but not necessary for political feasibility; the Kaldor‐Hicks criterion is neither necessary nor sufficient for political feasibility. The generalization of Peltzman’s model of public choice and the concept of political feasibility together explain why Tucson in 1976 and Los Angeles in 1993 adopted efficient water rates during droughts and why, 1 yr later, Tucson rescinded the rates and Los Angeles almost rescinded them. The concept of political feasibility explains why and how, after the drought, the Los Angeles innovations to rate design achieved efficiency and political feasibility, avoiding reversion to the previous, inefficient rates, by separating economic efficiency from political feasibility in both the rate design and the rate reform process.

L97|Infrastructure investment in network industries: The role of incentive regulation and regulatory independence|This paper finds that coherent regulatory policies can boost investment in network industries of OECD economies. Rate-of-return regulation is generally thought to result in overinvestment, while incentive regulation is believed to entail underinvestment. Yet, previous empirical work has generally found that the introduction of incentive regulation has not systematically changed investment in network industries. According to the theoretical literature, regulatory uncertainty exposes both types of regimes to the danger of underinvestment. However, regulatory uncertainty is arguably higher under rate-of-return regulation because investment decisions (what can be included in the rate base) are usually evaluated in a discretionary manner, while firms operating under incentive regulation are less affected by this behaviour. In addition, incentive regulation encourages investment in cost-reducing technologies. Using Bayesian model averaging techniques, this paper shows that incentive regulation implemented jointly with an independent sector regulator (indicating lower regulatory uncertainty) has a strong positive impact on investment in network industries. In addition, lower barriers to entry are also found to encourage sectoral investment. These results support the importance of implementing policies in a coherent framework.
L97|Negotiated settlements and the National Energy Board in Canada|In Canada, settlements between oil and gas pipelines and users have largely superseded the litigation of major pipeline toll cases since 1995. Quantitatively, from the first half to the second half of the period 1985-2007 the average number of pipeline toll hearing days in Canada fell by three-quarters. On average, settlements last more than twice as long as litigated outcomes and have cut regulatory processing times by about one third for gas pipelines and by about two thirds for oil pipelines, with the result that regulatory processing times per effective toll-year have fallen to 13% and 27% respectively of previous levels. Qualitatively, settlements have been used to determine prices, operating and capital cost projections, return on equity, service quality improvements, risk-sharing investments and information requirements. They were the vehicle by which multi-year incentive agreements developed rapidly for all pipelines. They have also been used to introduce light-handed regulation. They have provided a mechanism for fruitful collaboration between pipelines and their customers and have changed attitudes in the industry. Two key actions of the National Energy Board have facilitated settlements by clarifying expectations and property rights: its generic cost of capital decision that removes the market power of the pipeline and enables effective negotiation with users, and its willingness to judge a settlement by the reasonableness of the process leading up to it instead of imposing the Board's own values on the outcome.

We focus on perceptions of the trustworthiness of the government purchasers of infrastructure services by the supplying companies and by the governments themselves. In particular, we allow for trust updating and trust misalignments which may give rise to ""undertrusting"" and ""overtrusting"". The core of the paper sets out a game theoretic model of contracts with dynamic adjustment of trust perceptions, which we use to explore the impact of trust misalignment both on economic efficiency (measured by expected welfare) and on investment levels. We explore flexible contracts with and without pre-payments, rigid contracts (which do not allow for post-investment renegotiation) and hybrid contracts. We then compare the efficiency of the flexible contracts to that of hybrid contracts using as a criterion the expected welfare implications of each contract. The model is used to shed light on current issues on the sustainability of private investment infrastructure contracts in developed and in developing countries, including the role of regulatory institutions.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>"

L97|The role of institutional design in the conduct of infrastructure industries reforms - An illustration through telecommunications in developing countries|This paper discusses the relationship between the quality of political and economic institutions and the performance of the infrastructure industries reform process in developing countries. Our point of departure is that, when thinking about this relationship, it is necessary to take into account the specific features of these countries’ economies (Gasmi and Recuero Virto, 2005, Laffont, 2005). Based on two econometric analysis of time-series-crosssectional data on the telecommunications sector, we present the empirical findings and policy implications pertaining two issues (Gasmi et al., 2006, Gasmi and Recuero Virto, 2007). The first issue concerns the impact of the quality of institutions on the performance of regulation. Our review points to the fact that political accountability of institutional systems is a key determinant of regulatory performance. The second issue relates to the factors that shape the sectorial reforms themselves and the impact on these reforms on the development of the industry. Our main conclusion is that countries’ institutional risk and financial constraints are among the major factors that explain which reforms are actually implemented.
L97|Qualité institutionnelle et performance économique : cas des télécommunications dans les pays en voie de développement<BR>[Institutional quality and economic performance through telecommunications in developing countries]|In recent years, a number of studies have shown that institutions are crucial to economic development. This literature has highlighted a relationship between the quality of the macro-institutional environment and the performance of reform policies conducted in some key sectors of the economy. This paper explores this relationship in the context of developing countries for the case of telecommunications, the sector among the infrastructure industries that has experienced worldwide probably the deepest structural changes. We specify an econometric model for a data base of observations on a panel of 32 developing countries covering fifteen years (1985-1999). The sample is decomposed into two panels according to GNP per inhabitant, thus allowing us to test for the existence of a level of revenue below which, once the effect of reforms variables, liberalization and privatization of the incumbent, has been controlled for, the quality of institutions plays only a minor role. We find that the impact of the institutional quality on the performance of the industry is more perceptible in the sample of countries with the lower GNP per inhabitant. Thus, within the developing countries, the marginal effect of an investment in improving the institutional quality is higher in the countries with lower revenues. This result might explain the recent trend of international donors to reallocate resources to long term policies for improving institutional mechanisms as a substitute to shorter-term aid policies focusing on sector-specific governance issues, in particular, in less developed countries.

This is characterized by the families of operations involved in generalized mixtures, based upon a previous result on the characterization of the pair of continuous t-norm and t-conorm such that the former is restrictedly distributive over the latter. The obtained family of mixtures combines probabilistic and idempotent (possibilistic) mixtures via a threshold.

The bargaining effect improves the bargaining position vis a vis a private firm with market power and leads to a lower price for the service.

L97|Reference models and incentive regulation of electricity distribution networks: An evaluation of Sweden's Network Performance Assessment Model (NPAM)|"Electricity sector reforms across the world have led to a search for innovative approaches to regulation that promote efficiency in the natural monopoly distribution networks and reduce their service charges. To this aim, a number of countries have adopted incentive regulation models based on efficiency benchmarking. While most regulators have used parametric and non-parametric frontier-based methods of benchmarking some have adopted engineering-designed ""reference firm"" or ""norm"" models. This paper examines the incentive properties and related aspects of the reference firm model--NPAM--as used in Sweden and compares this with frontier-based benchmarking methods. We identify a number of important differences between the two approaches that are not readily apparent and discuss their ramifications for the regulatory objectives and process. We conclude that, on balance, the reference models are less appropriate as benchmarks than real firms. Also, the implementation framework based on annual ex-post reviews exacerbates the regulatory problems mainly by increasing uncertainty and reducing the incentive for innovation."
L97|Incentives and coordination in vertically related energy markets|We present an agent-based model of a multi-tier energy market. We show how reward interdependence between strategic business units within a vertically integrated firm can increase its profits in oligopolistic energy markets. The effects are shown to be distinct from those of the raising rivals' costs model. In our case, higher prices relate to the nature of energy markets, which facilitate the emergence of financial netback effects.
L97|Measuring The Affordability Of Basic Public Utility Services In Italy|In this paper we analyse the affordability of water and energy for Italian households. We first document how the regulatory reform has changed the system of price setting, illustrating the dynamics of utility prices and of household expenditure in the period 1998-2005. We then discuss current indices adopted to measure the affordability of public utilities and propose an alternative one, in order to investigate how many households would incur a potentially excessive burden, if they consumed a minimum quantity of utility services. Finally, we calculate the values of these indices on data from the ‘Survey on Family Budgets’ over the period, and use them to depict the affordability issue in Italy. Our results show that after the Italian reforms of the Nineties (at least until 2005) the affordability of public utility services has not worsened.
L97|Energy services at local and national level in the transition period in Hungary|Energy industries are mainly organised at national level in Hungary, however local governments have their specific role in the system. Local governments have been major performers in the first period of the transition process: they were entitled to receive 25 per cent of the shares in electric utilities and 40 per cent of the shares in gas supply during the privatisation process. They did not build up long standing portfolios in these utilities. They became more important players at district heating, where they have a contradictory triple function - owner, regulator and provider of the local social safety net. Local governments are also in the forefront of the energy saving programmes.
L97|Regulatory federalism in network industries|This article starts by surveying the literature on economic federalism and relating it to network industries. Some new developments (which focus on the role of inter-jurisdictional externalities and multiple objectives) are then added and used to analyze regulatory arrangements in telecommunications and energy in the EU and the US. Although central or federal policy making is more focused and specialized and makes it difficult for more interest groups to organize, it is not clear that under all conditions central powers will not be associated with underinvestment. When technology makes the introduction of competition in some segments possible, the possibilities for organizing the institutional architecture of regulation expand.
L97|Distributional Effects of Price Reforms in the Italian Utility Markets|" In this paper, we analyse some distributional effects of the reforms to water and energy services in Italy. We first document the new regulation setting in these services, illustrating the dynamics of utility prices and of household expenditure in the period 1998-2005. We then propose a way to measure the affordability of public utilities, in order to investigate how many households would incur a potentially excessive burden if they consumed a minimum quantity of utility services. Finally, we calculate this index on data from the Survey on Family Budgets (""Indagine sui consumi delle famiglie""). Our results show how the affordability of utility bills varies from region to region depending on climate, income, family endowment and family size. The analysis - also based on a counterfactual exercise - finds that so far, utility reforms do not seem to have produced any negative effects on weaker households. Copyright (c) 2008 The Authors."

L97|Utilities deprivation dynamics and energy sector reforms in seven European countries|In the late 1990s many European countries started comprehensive restructuring of their energy industries. The typical ingredients of the reforms are full or partial privatization, vertical disintegration, liberalization. In this paper we focus on the way in which energy sector reforms affect social affordability. The aim of this paper is to analyze the effects of energy reforms on the household probability of experiencing utilities deprivation (that is, to be unable to pay scheduled utility bills) in seven European Countries: Denmark, Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands and Spain. The period of analysis is 1994-2001. We also explore the dynamics of utilities deprivations focusing on the causes behind deprivation persistence. We differentiate between household heterogeneity and true state dependence. Then, controlling for observed and unobserved heterogeneity, we use the magnitude of average partial effects to investigate the relevance of any state dependence and the impact of energy sector reforms on the probability of experiencing utilities deprivations and on state dependence. We find evidence that vertical disintegration in the energy sector and privatization increase the household probability of experiencing utilities deprivation. Moreover, vertical disintegration also increases the household persistence in the status of deprivation.
L97|Regulation and consumer satisfaction from public services: an individual fixed effects approach|When survey-based, self-reported measures of satisfaction are used as dependent variables in a regression framework, the estimates may be biased and inconsistent. We adopt the measurement error perspective introduced by Bertrand and Mullainathan [2001], and propose an individual fixed-effects technique to tackle some of the consistency issues deriving from the potential correlation between the explanatory variables and the biases in the reported level of satisfaction. We apply the fixed-effects method to the analysis of the correlation between reported levels of satisfaction derived from the consumption of services of general interests collected in the Eurobarometer special surveys, and measures of the regulatory and competitive environment collected in the REGREF database.
L97|The Role of Institutional Design in the Conduct of Infrastructure Industry Reforms - An Illustration through Telecommunications in Developing Countries|This paper is concerned with the role of political and economic institutions in the conduct of the infrastructure industries reform process in developing countries. Our point of departure is that the specific features of these countries' economies should be accounted for when considering policy design. We discuss the main results and policy lessons drawn from two studies of the telecommunications sector based on an econometric analysis of time-series-cross-sectional data on developed and developing countries. We synthesise the main empirical findings and policy implications pertaining to two issues. The first issue concerns the impact of the quality of institutions on the function of regulation. Our review points to the fact that political accountability of institutional systems is a key determinant of regulatory performance, in particular in developing countries. The second issue relates to the factors that shape the sectoral reforms themselves and the impact of these reforms on the development of the industry in developing countries. Our main conclusion is that countries' institutional risk and financial constraints are among the major factors that explain which reforms are actually implemented.
L97|The bird in hand: stipulated settlements and electricity regulation in Florida|In the last two decades many major regulatory issues in Florida have been resolved by means of stipulated settlements between the utilities and interested parties, notably the Office of Public Counsel, instead of by the traditional method of hearings and litigation before the Public Services Commission. This paper investigates the extent, nature and effects of these stipulations in the electricity sector there. They have now largely superceded the litigated process. Their purpose is not to save costs, which are orders of magnitude less than the revenues at stake. Stipulations have brought reductions in electricity revenues worth over $3 billion, mainly during the last decade. These reductions are greater than would have otherwise occurred: about three quarters might never have occurred at all. In some cases a change in the method of rate reduction favoured industrial consumers but other customers are nonetheless likely to have benefited despite this. Some benefits were outside the scope of the commission to confer. Other benefits reflected a more flexible accounting policy. Most importantly, there has been a shift from conventional rate of return regulation, and from earnings sharing schemes with profits caps, to prices fixed for specified periods of time with revenue-sharing incentive arrangements. Stipulations have transformed the regulatory landscape in the Florida electricity sector, and their use seems worth considering elsewhere.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

L97|Identifying Fuel Poverty Using Objective and Subjective Measures|The UK Government is committed to abolishing fuel poverty amongst vulnerable households by the year 2010 and in the general population by 2016, but definition and measurement of fuel poverty remains controversial. We define a new measure of subjective household experience and explore links between this measure and the official objective definition, using a unique data set and the Family Expenditure Survey. We identify the relation between the two measures; explore the characteristics of households in each group; and how each measure is related to other household factors.

The study is structured on five chapters that envisage: a stage analysis at national level regarding the application of the measures of energetic efficiency; the identification of the barriers at national level that might impede the application of these measures; the establishment of the modalities for implementing the white certificates as a measure to promote energy conservation; the analysis of internal barriers against the development of energetic services (ESCO; the analysis of the way in which the state / government / local authorities are effectively involved in taking the measures for an efficient use of energy in the public sector.
L97|Regulation of two-part tariffs and quality choice under uncertainty|Many utilities are regulated with respect to prices and quality, and there is uncertainty about market conditions when regulation is chosen. We consider four different regulation regimes, based on two-part tariffs: A cap on the fixed fee is combined with either (i) quantity and quality standards, (ii) price and quality standards, (iii) price standards and quality bonuses, or (iv) quantity standards and quality bonuses. It turns out that there is a clear ranking of the four regimes in terms of expected welfare. The best results are obtained by regime (iv) with fixed fee caps, quantity standards, and quality bonuses.

L97|Arm’s Length Provision of Public Services|We analyze the economic consequences of strategic delegation of the right to decide between public or private provision of governmental service and/or the authority to negotiate and renegotiate with the chosen service provider. Our model encompass both bureaucratic delegation from a government to a privatization agency and electoral delegation from voters to a government. We identify two powerfull effects of delegation when contracts are incomplete: The incentive effect increases the incentive part of service providers’ remuneration and we show that strategic delegation may substitute formal incentive contracts. The bargaining effect improves the bargaining position vis a vis a private firm with market power and leads to a lower price for the service.

L97|The gas chain : influence of its specificities on the liberalisation process|"Like other network industries, the European gas supply industry has been liberalised, along the lines of what has been done in the United Kingdom and the United States, by opening up to competition the upstream and downstream segments of essential transmission infrastructure. The aim of this first working paper is to draw attention to some of the stakes in the liberalisation of the gas market whose functioning cannot disregard the network infrastructure required to bring this fuel to the consumer, a feature it shares with the electricity market. However, gas also has the specific feature of being a primary energy source that must be transported from its point of extraction. Consequently, opening the upstream supply segment of the market to competition is not so obvious in the European context, because, contrary to the examples of the North American and British gas markets, these supply channels are largely in the hands of external suppliers and thus fall outside the scope of EU legislation on the liberalisation and organisation of the internal market in gas. Competition on the downstream gas supply segment must also adapt to the constraints imposed by access to the grid infrastructure, which, in the case of gas in Europe, goes hand in hand with the constraint of dependence on external suppliers. Hence the opening to competition of upstream and downstream markets is not ""synchronous"", a discrepancy which can weaken the impact of liberalisation. Moreover, the separation of activities necessary for ensuring free competition in some segments of the market is coupled with major changes in the way the gas chain operates, with the appearance of new markets, new price mechanisms and new intermediaries. Starting out from a situation where gas supply was in the hands of vertically-integrated operators, the new regulatory framework that has been set up must, on the one hand, ensure that competitive forces can be given free rein, and, on the other hand, that free and fair competition helps the gas chain to operate coherently, at lower cost and in the interests of consumers, for whom the stakes are high as natural gas is an important input for many industrial manufacturing processes, even a ""commodity"" almost of basic necessity."
L97|Choosing the extent of private partipation in public services: a computable general equilibrium perspective|"What determines the propensity to reduce or widen the extent of public ownership? Why has there been a propensity to privatize and concede public utilities in the nineties? The answers to these questions depend both on macroeconomic and microeconomic considerations. And correct answers could also help to avoid or prevent inefficient reversals and frustrations that jeopardize reform processes. An alternative perspective, that combines micro and macro arguments, is given by general equilibrium models. The objective of this paper is to explore the rationality of the decision of choosing in an endogenous way the implicit ""technologies"" of private and state owned operators of utilities in an economy that has fiscal budget and trade balance in equilibrium. The simulations confirm that the choice of the technology to be used for servicing infrastructure depends on deep parameters of efficiency and costs. The model shows that there are plausible scenarios where the selection is not all-or-nothing and that they can coexist"
L97|Is the Company Man an Anachronism? Trends in Long Term Employment in the U.S., 1973-2006|"The wave of corporate downsizing in the 1990s focused attention on the role of long-term employment relationships in the United States. Given 1) the importance that these relationships have played historically, 2) the general view that long-term jobs are ""good jobs,"" and 3) the suspicion that long-term employment relationships are becoming less common, I carry out a systematic investigation of the extent to which long-term employment relationships have, in fact, become less common. Specifically, I examine age-specific changes in the length of employment relationships for different birth cohorts from 1914-1981 using data from various supplements to the Current Population Survey (CPS) from 1973 through 2006. After controlling for demographic characteristics, I find that mean tenure and the fraction of workers reporting at least ten and at least twenty years of tenure have both fallen substantially. This decline is concentrated among men, while long-term employment relationships have became slightly more common among women. Mirroring this decline in tenure and long-term employment relationships, there has been an increase in ""churning"" (defined as the proportion of workers in jobs with less than one year of tenure) for males as they enter their thirties and later. This pattern suggests that more recent cohorts are less likely than their parents to have a career characterized by a ""life-time"" job with a single employer."
L97|Regolamentazione parziale di quantità|Public utilities have recently undergone a major process of reorganization. Competitive segments have been liberalized, (eventually) privatised and tend to evolve into partially regulated oligopo-lies. In the latter, former monopolists are subject to regulatory duties whereas competitors operate unregulated, although endowed with market power. Having these scenarios in mind, we propose a mechanism of partial regulation that is suitable for private Cournot oligopolies. Iterated over time, this scheme, which relies upon data about current costs and past performance, converges to the equilibrium of a Nash-Cournot mixed oligopoly.
L97|The R&D drop in European utilities. Should we care about it?|By using accounting data from the largest utility companies of Europe, this note illustrates the recent R&D performance in energy and telecommunication. Although not all the companies under consideration behaved symmetrically, most of them reduced substantially their R&D investment. Over the period 2000-05, their total R&D expenditures at current prices decreased by 33%, while their R&D intensity (on sales) diminished from 1.1 to 0.7%. In discussing the above findings, it is argued that a drop of this size is hardly justifiable and weakens the EU economy in a non-negligible manner.
L97|Negotiated Settlements: The development of economic and legal thinking|The Federal Power Commission pioneered the use of negotiated settlements in the early 1960s as a means of coping with an increased workload and backlog. Legal scholars have emphasized the importance of settlements in coping with the regulatory load, and in saving time and money, albeit with some concern about transparency and the treatment of non-unanimous settlements. More recently, however, they suggest that settlements better serve the needs of the parties, allow greater flexibility and innovation, and can achieve results that lie beyond traditional regulatory authority. Recent economic research has indicated the high proportion of regulatory cases dealt with by settlements in the US and Canada and confirmed that settlements are not simply a more efficient way of doing the same thing as regulation. Rather, they involve considerable innovation, notably the introduction of price caps and other incentive mechanisms that otherwise would not have been likely or even possible.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L97|Stipulations, the consumer advocate and utility regulation in Florida+|Relatively little is known about the practice of settlement rather than litigation in US utility regulation, or about the activities of consumer advocates. This paper presents evidence from Florida. During 1976-2002, over 30 per cent of earnings reviews were settled by stipulations involving the Office of Public Counsel but only 5 per cent of other cases. Over three quarters of the rate reductions associated with earnings reviews derived from these stipulations, and in the decade 1976-86 the proportion was over 95 per cent. The average value of a rate reduction was seven times higher with a stipulation than without. Only 1 per cent of the rate increases associated with company requests derived from stipulations. In these few cases the stipulation typically provided for a lower proportion of the requested rate increase than a litigated outcome allowed (about one third compared to one half). This research suggests that settlements deserve consideration in utility regulation generally, even outside the US context.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L97|Los servicios públicos domiciliarios en Colombia a la luz del modelo de Salida, voz y lealtad de Albert Hirschman|During the 1990s, household public services in Colombia went through an important reform: the entrance of the private sector was allowed and users could participate in the surveillance and control of these services. However, given the collective dimension and monopolistic character of most of these services, it was necessary to introduce a series of institutional mechanisms that allowed the user to defend his wellbeing. This article analyzes, through the exit, voice, and loyalty model proposed by Albert O. Hirschman, the institutional developments, showing the advances and deficiencies of the system in this area. The voice option is emphasized as the only real defense of users regarding failures of the system and some reform proposals are presented

It takes explicitly into account three main characteristics of the postal sector: the ability of entrants to bypass the incumbent’s delivery network; the imposition on the incumbent, but not on entrants of universal service obligations; and the provision of access to both competitors and customers. The paper first develops analytical formulations of the optimal access charges and the incumbent’s end-to-end retail price. It then presents calibrated results illustrating the impact on prices and welfare of various scenarios. Copyright Springer 2006

L97|e-Communications: Investment and the Regulatory Framework|The EU regulatory framework for e-communications was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council in 2002, and became applicable from 2003. It has three primary objectives: (1) to promote competition; (2) to develop the single market; and (3) to promote citizens' rights. The European Commission's DG Information Society commissioned London Economics to estimate the level of e-communications investment in the EU and to examine its main drivers as part of a contributio to the Commission's 2006 review of the e-communications framework. This paper outlines some of the findings of that study. The paper provides a description of the process of collecting data on investment in physical infrastructure in the e-communciations sector by country and by sub-sector. It also presents the collected data, showing a decline in overall investment between 2001 and 2003 and a subsequent upturn in 2004. An econometric analysis of the drivers of investment over the period is undertaken, which suggests that better performing regulatory regimes, as measured by an OECD regulatory index, can contribute to higher levels of investment in the sector.

Considering the different regulatory regimes no one seems superior to the others. The limitation of the rate of return and price cap regulatory schemes are well known. Conditions under which franchising permits to reach first best solutions are very restrictive. Yardstick competition may obtain satisfactory results, if it is used with other regimes, and if the different situations in which enterprises work are taken into account.
L97|Restructuring Italian Utility Markets: Household Distributional Effects|Competition in public utility sectors has been encouraged in recent years throughout Europe. In this paper we try and analyse the welfare effects of these reforms in Italy, with particular attention to water and energy goods. The first step is to introduce a sensible measure of affordability of public utilities and to see how many households fall below a critical threshold. This issue is analysed stressing how climatic conditions dramatically affect households’ expenditure and how the affordability of utility bills varies a lot from region to region. So far, utilities’ reforms do not seem to have produced negative effects on the weaker group of households.
L97|U.S. Antitrust and EU Competition Policy: Where has the Former Been, Where is the Latter Going?|The earliest U.S. antitrust laws were adopted after technological changes — most importantly, the development of a national railway network — made the U.S. political union a single economic market. They were adopted with the stated, and no doubt largely sincere, purposes of preventing collusion and strategic entry-deterring behavior. Early application of the antitrust laws relied on a rule of competition to determine whether business conduct was or was not permitted. This has evolved into an explicit evaluation of the impact of businesses practices on consumer welfare, conceived of and measured in an economic sense. EU competition policy was adopted in advance of economic integration. It differed sharply from the traditional policies of the original EC6 member states toward business behavior. It was adopted with the stated, and most likely sincere, purpose of furthering economic integration, and to this end prohibited practices that were seen as distorting competition. Early applications of competition policy, particularly in the European Coal and Steel Community, may have had perverse effects. There are indications of an evolution towards an economic performance standard in the European Union as well.
L97|Competition Policy and EU Governance|This paper focuses on competition policy in the European Union from an economic, micro-governance point of view. It analyses recent developments in economic governance in the field of the common competition policy, which had for a long time been the exclusive competence of the European Commission (Community method), notably the nature and governance implications of recent developments associated with single market integration, the 5th EU enlargement, and the workload backlog of the Commission. The common competition policy has been subject to various changes against the background of increasing market integration and the expansion of the single market (for instance, the European merger regulation and the liberalisation of network industries, regulated at the national level), most recently by the new institutional framework (EC regulation 1/2003 by the EU Council) which entered into force on the day of the EU’s fifth enlargement on 1 May 2004 and which implies the direct and parallel application of EU anti-trust laws by national competition authorities (NCA).These developments in terms of the economic governance of competition policy render it important to analyse the competences of NCAs with respect to the European Commission but also in regard to each other and to sectoral national regulators. The paper concludes that although the single market and competition policy had looked profoundly Europeanised in the Community sphere, single market integration has not led to parallel centralisation at the Community level but to decentralisation and that challenges as to legal uncertainty and consistency of application remain to be resolved.

L97|De la evaluación a la gestión: acortar la brecha entre eficacia y efectividad|This article proposes three main arguments: that the clinical and health management acts to reduce the gap between the efficacy and the effectiveness, and that this is achieved by paying for results, and the management of the health organisations requires an active interaction with its environment. It seems logical to pay for the results in terms of public health and to use the incentive of the yardstick competition (competence by comparison). It would be suitable to put an end to the platitudes «more public health», «more education», «more I+D+i», and to strive in obtaining better health public, better education, better «I+D+i» applying what we already know. The evaluation, of any type, produces analytic knowledge, and it is normally convenient to investigate and to evaluate, but the real deficit is produced at the practical level: It is necessary to get things done, an implementation talent in order to turn knowledge into a better management, a talent which is obviously constrained by some limitations whose consideration would close this article.
L97|Restructuring Italian Utility Markets: Household Distributional Effects| Competition in public utility sectors has been encouraged in recent years throughout Europe. In this paper we try and analyse the welfare effects of these reforms in Italy, with particular attention to water and energy goods. The first step is to introduce a sensible measure of affordability of public utilities and to see how many households fall below a critical threshold. This issue is analysed stressing how climatic conditions dramatically affect households' expenditure and how the affordability of utility bills varies a lot from region to region. So far, utilities' reforms do not seem to have produced negative effects on the weaker group of households.
L97|Marco Regulatorio de los Servicios BÃ¡sicos en Chile|Este trabajo este trabajo discute la evoluciÃ³n de ciertos indicadores representativos del desempeÃ±o de cada una de los servicios bÃ¡sicos en Chile utilizando los elementos previamente descritos. Se concluye que el desempeÃ±o de estas industrias en los Ãºltimos 15 aÃ±os ha generado mayor bienestar para la sociedad que de haberse mantenido la tendencia regulatoria mostrada durante el rÃ©gimen militar. No obstante esa conclusiÃ³n, este trabajo argumenta que existe espacio para realizar una serie de polÃ­ticas modernizadoras a la actual institucionalidad reguladora de servicios bÃ¡sicos, entregÃ¡ndose algunas directrices que propicias para generar una discusiÃ³n en este tenor.
L97|Toward a Modern State in Chile: Institutions, Governance, and Market Regulation|Chile, as most Latin American countries, inherited the language, religion, and the institutions from 16th century Spanish conquerors. Most institutions have not changed since. This paper examines the institutional and economic structure of the State in Chile. It concludes that in several dimensions the current structure is incompatible with an adequate functioning of market economies, as those intended by the economic reforms implemented during the last three decades of the last century. The country needs to implement reforms in the administration of the State, the working of the Judiciary system, and the incentives and operation of regulatory agencies. Their combined negative effects imply that the benefits of reforms, privatization and market liberalization are partially dissipated in the form of inefficiency and rent seeking behaviour. In turn, this suggest that it is unlikely that the Chilean economy will reach the high growth rates necessary to overcome under development. Our main conclusion is that, in order to implement a framework in which the State acts mainly as regulator and competition supporter, it is necessary to undertake profound changes in the structure of incentives in which it currently operates. Five elements are at the center of this far-reaching evolution away from centralism, stagnation, and inefficiency: (1) the divestiture of state-owned enterprises, (2) the upgrade and update of regulatory agencies and the institutional framework in which they operate, (3) the improve of competition policy institutions, (4) the improvement of consumer rights protection, and (5) a substantial improvement in the working of the Judiciary system.
L97|Rate of Return Regulation: The Case of Spanish Ports|An original model is put forward in this article to explain and consider the behavior of some of the most important public services in Spain. The cost function approach and the input distance function approach are used to estimate the existence of overcapitalization as a result of rate of return regulation. The results show that overcapitalization generated by this regulation is too significant not to be taken into account. Copyright International Atlantic Economic Society 2005
