H74|La mejora de la situación de las finanzas públicas de las corporaciones locales en la última década|Las Corporaciones Locales han registrado desde 2012 un superávit fiscal, que contrasta con el déficit registrado en el resto de las Administraciones Públicas. A pesar de la heterogeneidad en la composición del sector, esta mejora en las finanzas públicas se extiende a una amplia mayoría de municipios. Su origen se remonta a la reducción y a la posterior contención de los gastos no financieros surgidas en 2012, especialmente relevantes en el caso del gasto en inversión pública. Las Corporaciones Locales han utilizado esta evolución favorable de sus presupuestos para mejorar significativamente su situación financiera. En particular, desde 2012 el sector ha iniciado un proceso de desendeudamiento, que, si bien presenta cierto grado de heterogeneidad, ha supuesto una reducción notable de su stock de deuda. Esta reducción del pasivo ha venido acompañada de una sustancial mejora de los activos financieros, materializada, en particular, en la acumulación de efectivo y depósitos. Si bien a escala agregada el sector presenta una situación financiera saneada, holgadamente compatible con los límites de deuda establecidos en la Ley Orgánica de Estabilidad Presupuestaria y Sostenibilidad Financiera, aún muestra cierto margen de mejora, en particular en el caso de los ayuntamientos de tamaño medio.
H74|"What went wrong?: The Puerto Rican debt crisis, the ""Treasury Put,"" and the failure of market discipline"|What went wrong? Why did seemingly rational bond investors continue to purchase Puerto Rican debt with only a modest risk premium, even though the macroeconomic fundamentals were dismal? Why did financial markets fail to exercise market discipline and restrict capital flows to Puerto Rico? Given gloomy macroeconomic fundamentals and relatively low risk premia, investors were either stunningly myopic/misinformed, or Puerto Rican debt was implicitly insured by the U.S. government. This paper examines the latter hypothesis, which we label the “Treasury Put.” The expectation of a federal bailout was perfectly reasonable given past behavior by the federal government, starting with the prior bailout of the city of New York. Evaluating the Treasury Put hypothesis with a minimal set of assumptions is possible given three unique features – the dire fiscal and economic conditions in Puerto Rico, a fortunate characteristic of Puerto Rican bond issuance, and a “seismic shock.” Regarding the second feature, Puerto Rico issued both uninsured and insured general obligation bonds on the same day and, in many cases, with the exact same maturity. The associated bond price data allow for an accurate computation of the risk premia on Puerto Rican bonds. The third feature is the non-bailout of the city of Detroit in 2013 that effectively extinguished the Treasury Put. Puerto Rican risk premia were stable before the Detroit bankruptcy and bracketed by the risk premia on Corporate Aaa and Baa bonds. However, after the Detroit bankruptcy, risk premia rose dramatically, thus identifying a sizeable Treasury Put of at least 300 basis points and a significant misallocation of capital to Puerto Rico. In effect, the Treasury Put was a form of regulatory forbearance. Institutional reforms that would eliminate the Treasury Put are considered, but none are found satisfactory.
H74|Setting the Stage for RMB Internationalisation - Liberalizing the Capital Account and Strengthening the Domestic Bond Market|Internationalizing the Renminbi pertains to the new era of China’s reform, starting at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party. It is not a technical reform, but a political one. The objective is threefold: to match China’s autonomy in economic policy, to further Asian integration, and to safeguard worldwide multilateralism against by the rise of protectionist forces. The challenge has been aggravated by the protectionist policies pursued by the US, degrading ipso facto the functions assumed by the dollar in the international payment system. China’s authorities have drawn lessons from the Asian crisis of 1997-98 and the systemic crisis of 2008-09. They are now searching for a second-best option in advocating a multilateral international payment system based on the SDR. The process of currency internationalization is linked to the modernization of domestic capital markets. Studying the progress in both dimensions makes the first two parts of the paper We ask the following questions. In the first part: which steps has China taken, and should take in the future, to complete the gradual process of currency internationalization currently under way? In the second part: how can China build the deep and resilient bond market required to attract international investors? A shorter third part examines why emerging market countries are incentivized to issue their government debt in their own currencies to attract foreign investors in the lingering context of ultra-low interest rates in the main convertible currencies. The status of a freely usable currency, already reached by the Renminbi in its prudent internationalization, together with a reform of the huge domestic bond market, should make China able to attract foreign saving. This is compatible with the Belt and Road Initiative, which is bound to mobilize massive capital exports in the form of long-term loans.
H74|Reach for Yield by U.S. Public Pension Funds|This paper studies whether U.S. public pension funds reach for yield by taking more investment risk in a low interest rate environment. To study fundsâ€™ risk-taking behavior, we first present a simple theoretical model relating risk-taking to the level of risk-free rates, to their underfunding, and to the fiscal condition of their state sponsors. The theory identifies two distinct channels through which interest rates and other factors may affect risk-taking: by altering plansâ€™ funding ratios, and by changing risk premia. The theory also shows the effect of state finances on fundsâ€™ risk-taking depends on incentives to shift risk to state debt holders. To study the determinants of risk-taking empirically, we create a new methodology for inferring fundsâ€™ risk from limited public information on their annual returns and portfolio weights for the interval 2002-2016. In order to better measure the extent of underfunding, we revalue fundsâ€™ liabilities using discount rate s that better reflect their risk. We find that funds on average took more risk when risk-free rates and funding ratios were lower, which is consistent with both the funding ratio and the risk-premia channels. Consistent with risk-shifting, we also find more risk-taking for funds affiliated with state or municipal sponsors with weaker public finances. We estimate that up to one-third of the fundsâ€™ total risk was related to underfunding and low interest rates at the end of our sample period.

H74|Russia’s Municipal and sub-federal debt market in 2018|According to the 2018 year-end data, the regional consolidated budgets and local government off-budget funds’ budgets ran a surplus of RUB 512.9 billion or 0.49 percent of GDP. To compare, the regional consolidated budgets and local government off-budget funds’ budgets ran a deficit of RUB 61.5 billion or 0.07 percent of GDP in 2017. In 2018, the budgets of subjects of the Russian Federation ran a surplus of RUB 491.5 billion, urban districts’ budgets ran a deficit of RUB 0.8 billion, federal-status cities’ inner-city municipalities’ budgets ran a surplus of RUB 0.4 billion, municipal areas’ budgets ran a surplus of RUB 16.0 billion, urban and rural settlements’ budgets ran a surplus of RUB 3.5 billion, local government off-budget funds’ budgets ran a surplus of RUB 2.7 billion.
H74|The impact women's leadership in local Governments: The case of Spain|The main objective of this paper is to analyse whether the gender of the mayor and the municipal council members affects compliance with the principles of budgetary stability and financial sustainability contained in Organic Law 2/2012 on Budgetary Stability and Financial sustainability. We find that in Spanish local governments during the period 2013–2016, the leadership of women mayors contributes to improving the financial situation of the local government. In particular, the presence of women mayors governing with a high proportion of female councillors increases the probability of compliance with regulations on budgetary stability, financial sustainability and the legal debt limit. Thus, the Law for Effective Equality of Women and Men favours compliance with the Law on Budgetary Stability and Financial Sustainability. In addition, the results show that in pre electoral periods, women mayors are less likely to employ strategies designed to enhance their re election chances.
H74|Rethinking China's Local Government Debt in the Frame of Modern Money Theory|Local government debt in China is increasing and presents a great threat to China's financial stability. In China's fiscal system, the central government often prioritizes reducing its fiscal deficit and can determine to a great extent the distribution of revenue and expenditure between itself and local governments. There is therefore a tendency for the fiscal burden to be shifted from the central government to the local governments. Resolving China's local government debt problem requires not only strengthening regulation, but also abandoning the central government's fiscal balance target, because this target may make regulation hard to sustain in times of economic downturn. This paper discusses central-local fiscal relations in the framework of Modern Money Theory, suggesting that, because a government with currency sovereignty can always afford any spending denominated in its own currency, China's central government should bear a greater fiscal burden.
H74|Decentralization and Overborrowing in a Fiscal Federation|We build an infinite horizon equilibrium model of fiscal federation, where anticipation of transfers from the central government creates incentives for local governments to overborrow. Absent commitment, the central government over-transfers, which distorts the central-local distribution of resources. Applying the model to fiscal decentralization, we find when decentralization widens local governments’ fiscal gap, borrowings by both local and central governments rise. Quantitatively, fiscal decentralization accounts for from 19 percent to 40 percent of changes in general government debt in Spain during 1988–2006. A macroprudential tax on local borrowing that implements Pareto optimal allocation would reduce debt by 27 percent and raise welfare by 3.75 percent.
H74|Improving Subnational Government Development Finance in Emerging and Developing Economies: Toward a Strategic Approach|Considerable attention has been given to enhancing subnational development finance in response to the 2008 global financial crisis and recent global development agendas, including the Sustainable Development Goals, Financing for Development, and Habitat III/New Urban Agenda. Much work on this topic is fragmented, focusing on specific elements of development finance: fiscal transfers, capital market access, public-sector lending agencies, or public–private partnerships. Most countries, however, have a range of subnational governments with varying needs and capacities that require different and evolving mixes of development finance mechanisms. Enabling greater subnational borrowing is often desirable but requires adoption of other reform policies to improve the fiscal capacity and creditworthiness of subnational governments over time. We review the rationale and potential for improving subnational development finance, outline the overall landscape of institutional arrangements available for this purpose, and consider broad challenges involved. Based on a review of global practice and experience in selected Asian developing countries with a range of special entities and innovations to enhance subnational investment, we propose a more integrated, strategic approach to building subnational development finance.
H74|The Northern Ireland Economy: Problems and Prospects|This paper examines the performance of the Northern Ireland economy in recent decades and shows that it has suffered from very low productivity growth. This has meant that the regional economy has grown very slowly and this performance compares badly with that of other regional economies, such as Scotland and East Germany. The key factor behind the poor productivity performance in Northern Ireland has been the low investment in physical and human capital. The failure to reform the education system to reduce the number of early school leavers and increase the numbers of graduates is the single most important factor in the low growth. Large transfers from central government have ensured that the standard of living in Northern Ireland is close to the UK average and above that of Ireland. However, the dependence of Northern Ireland on these transfers leaves it very vulnerable to shocks. Brexit will, undoubtedly, have serious negative consequences for the Northern Ireland economy. Possibly more serious for Northern Ireland are the changes taking place in the politics of the UK which could see a reduction in transfers in the future. The best economic outcome for Northern Ireland is one where future UK governments commit to providing continuing large transfers to Northern Ireland for at least a further decade in return for a change in regional economic policy aimed at promoting economic growth. Public expenditure needs to be reallocated from sustaining consumption, especially public services, to investing in education and infrastructure. While painful initially, it would move the Northern Ireland economy onto a sustainable growth path. Another option, Irish unity, if it involved ending transfers to Northern Ireland, would produce a dramatic fall in the standard of living there. Alternatively, unification, where Ireland took over responsibility for the transfers to Northern Ireland, would necessitate a major cut in the standard of living in Ireland of 5% to 10% in order to allow Northern Ireland to maintain a standard of living between 10% and 20% above the Irish standard of living. Whatever form Irish unity took there would be a heavy economic cost for both Northern Ireland and Ireland.
H74|Does fiscal consolidation hurt economic growth? Empirical evidence from Spanish regions|This article provides empirical evidence on the effect of fiscal consolidation in decentralized countries. The focus on Spain is justified for three reasons. First, it is one of the OECD countries that has been the most affected by the Great Recession in terms of both GDP and public deficit. Second, it is one of the most decentralized countries in the world. Third, the compliance with fiscal consolidation targets has been very diverse across regions. Using both time series econometrics and the synthetic control method approach (SCM), the authors show that compliance with fiscal targets at the regional level has not involved lower GDP growth rates in the short run.
H74|Ein Zukunftsfonds zur Tilgung der kommunalen Kassenkredite in Nordrhein-Westfalen: Handlungsempfehlungen für die Politik|"Die Verschuldung der Kommunen in Nordrhein-Westfalen (NRW) hat in den vergangenen 20 Jahren deutlich zugenommen. Dabei haben sich Bürgermeister und Kämmerer großzügig an Kassenkrediten bedient, die lediglich zur Liquiditätssicherung vorgesehen sind. Der kontinuierliche Anstieg der Kassenkredite zeigt jedoch, dass diese zur allgemeinen Haushaltsfinanzierung eingesetzt werden. Um Städten und Gemeinden wieder mehr Handlungsspielraum zu geben, ist ein Schuldenschnitt in Verbindung mit einer Konsolidierung der Aufwendungen in vielen Fällen erforderlich. Dabei sollten die Kassenkredite im Fokus stehen. Die Überschüsse der öffentlichen Hand bieten die Chance, Altschulden mittels eines ""kommunalen Zukunftsfonds NRW"" zurückzuführen. Für die Konzeptionierung des ""Zukunftsfonds"" kann sich die Politik an vergleichbaren Programmen in Hessen und Niedersachsen orientieren, die ebenfalls bei den Kassenkrediten ansetzen und einen Schuldenschnitt mit einer Haushaltskonsolidierung verknüpfen. Um solide wirtschaftenden Kommunen nicht vor den Kopf zu stoßen, sollte der Schuldenschnitt um eine Investitionsoffensive für Kommunen ohne oder mit nur geringen Kassenkrediten (bis maximal 750 Euro je Einwohner) ergänzt werden, die dafür nicht am Entschuldungsprogramm teilnehmen können. Nach diesen Kriterien nähmen 143 Kommunen in NRW an einem Schuldenschnitt teil, 253 Kommunen würden Investitionszuschüsse erhalten. Je nach Ausgestaltung würde der ""Zukunftsfonds NRW"" Finanzmittel in Höhe von bis zu 25 Milliarden Euro erfordern. Wichtig ist dabei, dass die Kommunen beim Entschuldungsprogramm einen Eigenanteil leisten. Das Land müsste danach rund 18 Milliarden Euro beisteuern. Als Einmalbetrag wirkt dieser Wert aus Landessicht zweifelsfrei hoch, bei einer Streckung auf mehrere Jahre relativiert sich jedoch der Umfang."
H74|Decentralization and intra-country transfers in the great recession: the case of EU|The classic arguments of Musgrave (1959) and Oates (1972) are that the redistribution and stabilization functions should be assigned to the federal level of government. The argument is that redistribution is difficult to achieve at lower levels because the public good nature of redistribution and the mobility of individuals and firms. Likewise, stabilization is difficult to achieve because fiscal stimulus of lower levels of government is likely to be underused due to spillover effects and a limited ability to service debt obligations. These arguments suggest that under-provision of redistributive spending should accompany greater decentralization. They also suggest that subnational policies aimed at macroeconomic stabilization are likely to be less effective than national ones, an important issue in an economic crisis. In this paper I examine data on intra-country social protection transfers in the EU before and after the crisis. The results support the classic federalism assignment. For both reasons of redistribution and stabilization, social protection expenditures are best assigned to the central level of government. Regression results indicate that greater decentralization lowers social protection expenditures and a greater vertical fiscal imbalance and greater subnational deficits result in more spending on things other than social protection.
H74|Federal Support for Financing State and Local Transportation and Water Infrastructure|State and local governments own much of the nationâ€™s transportation and water infrastructure, such as highways, mass transit systems, airports, and water treatment systems. The federal government helps states and localities finance investments in such infrastructure through tax-exempt bonds, tax credit bonds, state revolving funds and infrastructure banks, and direct federal credit programs.
H74|Politicians' Promotion Incentives and Bank Risk Exposure|This paper shows that politicians’ pressure to climb the career ladder increases bank risk exposure in their region. Chinese local politicians are set growth targets in their region that are relative to each other. Growth is stimulated by debt-financed programs which are mainly financed via bank loans. The stronger the performance pressure the riskier the respective local bank exposure becomes. This effect holds for local banks which are under some control of local politicians, it has increased with the release of stimulus packages requiring local co-financing and it is stronger if politicians hold chairmen positions in bank boards.

H74|Rethinking odious debt in the age of predatory lending: Old ideas for new problems|This essay suggests that odious debt needs a restatement to stay relevant in the face of important changes affecting state (i.e. “sovereign”) debt. Today, a major issue affecting creditor-debtor relations in the sovereign sector is the predicament of over-lending. Examples abound of reckless creditors pressuring vulnerable states to borrow for projects they do not need and at conditions they do not fully understand. This development, which recalls the aggressive business tactics used by predatory lenders in consumer lending, has become a ubiquitous problem affecting both developing and developed nations. Yet, this problem remains largely unaccounted for in international law and in the odious debt doctrine in particular. The future of odious debt depends upon a collective endeavor to make the legal doctrine more sensitive to issues of predatory lending. This essay offers insights into the benefits that such efforts may yield on states and their creditors.

H74|Who Sent You? Strategic Voting, Transfers and Bailouts in a Federation|Lower-level governments often receive federal support through transfers or bailouts. We study how the regional or local ties of federal politicians can steer this process. We build a two-tier model of government, where regionally elected federal legislators bargain over federal support aimed at their own constituency. This leads to strategic voting on the regional level. Federal legislators are strategically elected to watch over the interests of their own region, cushioning shocks to local consumption and driving down borrowing costs. Lower-level legislators anticipate this, which sets the stage for regional over-borrowing both if they receive annual grants, or when a bailout scheme is introduced during periods of crisis. Voters strategically select federal representatives with more extreme positions than the median voter, as long as federal co-funding schemes imply some degree of interregional redistribution. These theoretical predictions are confirmed by our empirical analysis, where we compare the political extremism of representatives elected to the EU Parliament with that of representatives elected to national Parliaments.
H74|Zur strukturellen Finanzlage der Länder: eine aktuelle Auswertung und Methodenkritik|Seit Einfuehrung der neuen Schuldenregel hat sich die Finanzlage der deutschen Bundeslaender deutlich verbessert. Nach unseren Berechnungen mit dem Aggregierten Quotierungsverfahren konnten die meisten Laender ihre strukturellen Budgetdefizite abbauen und im Jahr 2017 schon 14 Laender strukturelle Budgetueberschuesse erzielen; lediglich das Saarland und Nordrhein-Westfalen wiesen strukturelle Defizite auf. Die „strukturelle“ Besserung überzeichnet indes die Konsolidierungsfortschritte, denn sie ist zum grossen Teil dem historisch niedrigen Zinsniveau zu verdanken, das zu erheblichen Einsparungen beim Schuldendienst fuehrte. Da die Finanzierungskonditionen aber nicht dauerhaft so guenstig bleiben wie in den vergangenen Jahren, verdecken die Zinsersparnisse den bei vielen Laendern noch bestehenden Konsolidierungsbedarf. Wir plaedieren daher dafuer, nur nachhaltige Einsparungen bei den Zinslasten als strukturelle Besserung zu klassifizieren und entwickeln ein Bereinigungsverfahren, das neben den Konjunktureinfluessen auch die Verzerrung durch das aeusserst niedrige Zinsniveau beachtet. Unsere Simulationen zeigen, dass nach einer Bereinigung um die nicht nachhaltigen Einsparungen beim Schuldendienst nicht mehr 14, sondern nur neun Laender im Jahr 2017 einen strukturell mindestens ausgeglichenen Haushalt erzielt haben. Bei den verbleibenden sieben Laendern besteht teilweise noch erheblicher Konsolidierungsbedarf. Wir zeigen darueber hinaus, dass die zur quantitativen Vergleichbarkeit der Laenderfinanzen in der Regel verwandten Einwohner-Indikatoren wesentliche Strukturunterschiede zwischen den Laendern unberuecksichtigt lassen und damit zu irrefuehrenden Schlussfolgerungen fuehren koennen. Wir empfehlen daher, bei Laendervergleichen Kennzahlen zu verwenden, die strukturelle Unterschiede zwischen den Laendern bei Erwerbstaetigkeit und Produktivitaet beachten.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H74|Climate Finance for Canadian Cities: Is Debt Financing a Viable Alternative?|Municipalities are crucial stakeholders in the response to climate change. Cities are major sources of greenhouse gas emissions and, due to their higher building and population densities, will bear the brunt of the economic and social costs imposed by extreme weather and the impact of climate change. Ontario municipalities have traditionally funded their investments from property taxes, user fees, and transfers from higher levels of government, but these sources will not be sufficient to fund both current expenditures and future capital needs. This paper explores an alternative: climate finance, the provision of financing by private actors for projects intended to decrease carbon emissions or make cities more resilient to the impacts of climate change. It analyzes four climate financing tools used in other jurisdictions â€“ green bonds, environmental impact bonds, catastrophe bonds, and green banks â€“ and their feasibility under current Ontario regulations. Not all instruments would be equally suitable to Ontario municipalities; each offers trade-offs that must be weighed before implementation. Still, the potential for climate financing is huge and it has a role to play in long-term climate infrastructure projects requiring large upfront investments.

H74|Fiscal Rules for Sub-central Governments: Design and Impact|Against a background of mounting demands for spending on services provided by sub-central governments, this paper examines how fiscal rules can help to ensure that pressure on resources is minimised and available resources are used efficiently. Drawing on questionnaire responses and other sources, this paper gives a detailed picture of fiscal rules for sub-central governments in place among a number of OECD countries. The paper examines the rationales for using fiscal rules, the various impacts fiscal rules can have, the factors making for effective implementation and the interactions between the various types of rule. It then constructs a number of synthetic sub-indicators designed to assess the extent to which sub-central government fiscal frameworks exhibit favourable characteristics for the achievement of fiscal objectives. It concludes with the construction of a composite indicator based on the combined impacts in the different areas of fiscal policy. Règles budgétaires des collectivités territoriales : Leurs caractéristiques et leur impact Face à l’augmentation des dépenses au titre des services assurés par les collectivités territoriales, cette étude examine comment les règles budgétaires peuvent contribuer à atténuer les pressions sur les ressources et à garantir une utilisation efficiente des ressources disponibles. S’appuyant sur les réponses à des questionnaires et sur d’autres sources, elle présente une description détaillée des règles budgétaires applicables aux collectivités territoriales dans plusieurs pays de l’OCDE. Elle analyse les raisons qui motivent l’utilisation de règles budgétaires, les divers effets que ces règles peuvent avoir, les facteurs qui contribuent à l’efficacité de leur mise en œuvre et les interactions entre les divers types de règles. Un certain nombre d’indicateurs synthétiques sont ensuite élaborés dans le but de déterminer dans quelle mesure les règles budgétaires des collectivités territoriales présentent des caractéristiques favorisant la réalisation des objectifs de finances publiques. L’étude s’achève par la construction d’un indicateur composite des effets combinés dans les différents domaines de la politique budgétaire.
H74|Market mechanisms in public service provision|This paper compares and analyses the use of market mechanisms in core sub-central policy areas, namely education, health care, transport, social protection, and environment. Arrangements like tendering, outsourcing, user choice and competition, user fees and performance-related funding can help to improve quality of service provision or lower its cost. With around 32% of total public expenditure and often wide-ranging spending powers, sub-central governments (SCG) have considerable leeway for improving their services by relying on market mechanisms. The decentralised and often fragmented nature of sub-central government poses some special challenges to efficient arrangements, however, and may require central government support or stronger inter-jurisdictional co-operation. And while market mechanisms are being harnessed ever more broadly, limits to a more extensive use have become apparent, particularly in the potential trade-off between greater efficiency and equity objectives, or between efficiency and sub-central accountability..
H74|The spending power of sub-central governments: A pilot study|This pilot study presents indicators that assess sub-central government (SCG) spending power by policy area. Traditional indicators – such as the share of SCG in total government spending – are often misleading as they underestimate the impact of central government regulation on sub-central spending patterns. In order to gauge true spending power, a set of institutional indicators is established, based on a detailed assessment of institutional, regulatory and administrative control central government exerts over various SCG policy areas. Results tend to confirm the limited discretion of SCGs over their own budget. Education in particular – the main SCG budget item in most countries – is strongly shaped by central government regulation. Federal countries tend to grant more spending power to SCGs than unitary countries.
H74|Problematika zadluženosti municipalit na příkladu obcí Moravskoslezského kraje| Obce se při svém hospodaření mohou dostat do situace, kdy v rozpočtu nemají dostatečné množství finančních prostředků na pokrytí výdajů, jako je údržba, výstavba a rekonstrukce infrastruktury, či na rozvoj svého území. To je pak vede k hledání cizích zdrojů, buď ve formě nenávratných, nebo návratných finančních prostředků, a tedy k zadlužování. V České republice patří otázka zadluženosti obcí a územně samosprávných celků mezi diskutovaná témata. Důvodem je donedávna rostoucí objem zadluženosti obcí, který akceleroval v porevolučních letech velice rychlým tempem a dosud se dotýká více než poloviny obcí. Autoři tohoto článku si tak kladli za cíl zmapovat situaci problematiky zadlužení všech 300 obcí Moravskoslezského kraje, konkrétně schopnosti splácení jejich dluhů a zjistit, zda je splácení pro obce problém. Pro tento účel byl vybrán ukazatel podílu celkového dluhu na saldu běžného rozpočtu a obce byly monitorovány v období od roku 2010 do roku 2016. Na základě zjištěných výsledků byly obce rozděleny do 3 skupin podle míry rizika spojeného se splácením dluhu. Bylo zjištěno, že v případě indikátoru zadluženosti týkajícího se schopnosti splácet své závazky ve střednědobém horizontu, municipality v Moravskoslezském kraji jako celek nevykazují vysoký stupeň rizika, u více než šedesát procent z nich je situace stabilní a pouze málo obcí se musí zaměřit na její zlepšení.
H74|Je krytí závazků problémem obcí Moravskoslezského kraje?| Tento článek je zaměřen na problematiku krytí závazků, a to u všech 300 obcí Moravskoslezského kraje. Obce, podobně jako firmy, mohou při svém hospodaření řešit situace, kdy nedisponují dostatečným množstvím vlastních finančních zdrojů pro realizaci běžných výdajů na poskytování veřejných statků a služeb, popř. investičních výdajů. Řešením je použití cizích zdrojů, a to buď ve formě návratných, nebo nenávratných finančních prostředků, které ovšem mohou vést k zadlužování obcí. To, zda nedochází k předlužování, lze zjistit zhodnocením zatížení celkových aktiv obce externími zdroji, tedy mírou krytí závazků. Pro tento účel byly vybrány a následně analyzovány dva ukazatele – podíl cizích zdrojů na celkových aktivech včetně dotačních záloh a podíl cizích zdrojů na celkových aktivech bez dotačních záloh. Byl stanoven předpoklad, že dotační zálohy hrají důležitou roli v míře krytí závazků a mají podstatný vliv na to, jak jsou obce v tomto ohledu hodnoceny. Obce byly monitorovány v období od roku 2010 do roku 2016. Na základě provedené analýzy bylo zjištěno, že krytí závazků není pro municipality v Moravskoslezském kraji problémem, jak v případě započtení dotačních záloh, tak bez jejich zahrnutí. Více než osmdesát procent obcí vykazuje nízkou míru rizika pro finanční stabilitu a pouze dvě (resp. tři) procenta obcí se musí zaměřit na zlepšení své situace.
H74|Likvidita obcí Moravskoslezského kraje| Pokud obce nedisponují dostatečným množstvím svých finančních prostředků, nutných k financování běžných a investičních výdajů, musí nalézt cizí zdroje. To s sebou nese nejen pozitivní efekty v podobě zvyšování kvality života obcí, ale také efekty negativní v podobě neschopnosti výše uvedené cizí zdroje splácet a zvyšovat tak riziko finanční nestability obcí. Proto je nutno veřejné zdroje a jejich využívání monitorovat a kontrolovat. Jedním z významných ukazatelů monitoringu je likvidita a tento článek má za cíl vyhodnotit problematiku likvidity u všech (tři sta) obcí Moravskoslezského kraje, a to v období let 2010 až 2016. Pro tento účel byly vybrány a následně analyzovány dva ukazatele – podíl oběžných aktiv ke krátkodobým závazkům, tedy indikátor běžné (celkové) likvidity a podíl krátkodobého finančního majetku ke krátkodobým závazkům, tedy indikátor okamžité likvidity. Byl stanoven předpoklad, že monitorované obce budou v hodnocení okamžité likvidity ve větší míře spadat do rizikovějších skupin, než v případě likvidity běžné. Na základě provedené analýzy bylo zjištěno, že v případě počtu obcí s vysokou mírou rizika se tento předpoklad potvrdil, v případě obcí s rizikem středním byl předpoklad vyvrácen.
H74|Strategic Intertemporal Budget Allocation of Local Governments in the Model with Spillovers and Mergers|Mergers of local governments, commonly referred to as municipal mergers, have been implemented widely to internalize spillover effects. Many empirical studies point out that municipalities strategically increase their debt issuance before mergers, creating the `fiscal common pool problem', because of pooled budgets after mergers. However,this phenomenon has not yet been analyzed theoretically. Therefore, this paper examines the mechanism of increased debt issuance before municipal mergers. Our results show that three different effects influence intertemporal budget allocations of municipalities at the time of a merger and the existence of externalities may reduce the severity of the fiscal common pool problem.
H74|Creative Accounting and Municipal Mergers -A Theoretical and Empirical Approach-|This study investigates what causes governments to use creative accounting. It is difficult to grasp the mechanism of creative accounting and show its existence. This is because, although creative accounting is seemingly closely tied with increases in debt, whether creative accounting is a cause or result of the debt increase is ambiguous and finding the occurrence of creative accounting is not easy. However,by focusing on municipal mergers in Japan in the 2000s, we clarify that the incentive to increase debt causes the use of creative accounting and show the existence of creative accounting, theoretically and empirically. Our theoretical model shows that a government with a stronger incentive to increase debt rationally employs creative accounting more fiercely and that an improvement in fiscal transparency reduces both the use of creative accounting and the deficit amount. Corresponding to this finding,by using a difference-in-difference analysis and data on Japanese municipal mergers, we show that municipalities with a stronger incentive to increase debt tend to employ creative accounting.
H74|Resource Windfalls and Publics Debt: The Role of Political Myopia|We identify an adverse consequence of natural resource windfalls, which is particularly detrimental in advanced democracies. We construct a political economy model with endogenous public debt under exogenous resource windfall shocks, in which political myopia results from reelection prospects. Reelection-seeking politicians, while more accountable toward their electorate, are also more myopic. The latter effect gives rise to a budget defficit bias, with the ensuing debt build up that is exacerbated by resource windfalls. We find that the positive effect of resource windfalls on debt increases as the restrictions on reelection get laxer. We test the model's predictions using a panel of U.S. states over the period 1963-2007. Our identification strategy rests on constitutionally-entrenched differences in gubernatorial term limits that provide plausibly exogenous cross-sectional and time variation in political time horizon, and geographically-based cross-stated differences in natural endowments interacted with the international prices of oil and gas. The empirical findings corroborate the model's predictions. In particular, our baseline estimates indicate that a resource windfall of $1 induces an increase of approximately g14:7 in the public debt of states with no gubernatorial term limits.
H74|The welfare effects of third-degree price discrimination|The welfare effects of third-degree price discrimination are known to be negative when demand functions are linear, marginal cost is constant and all markets are served. This paper shows that discrimination lowers welfare for a more general class of demand functions. Demand varies across markets with additive and multiplicative shift factors. Total welfare (defined as consumer surplus plus profits) with discrimination is lower than with uniform pricing when the density function of consumer valuations satisfies a weak version of concavity that encompasses logconcavity. Most standard demand functions including linear, quadratic, probit, logit, exponential and iso-elastic ones, satisfy this assumption, which is also a weak sufficient condition for existence.
H74|Optymalizacja polityki finansowej samorządów|Dzięki modelowi optymalizacyjnemu polityki finansowej samorządów, zweryfikowane zostały hipotezy o wpływie wybranych czynników na optymalny poziom w relacji do dochodów bieżących: wydatków bieżących oraz inwestycyjnych. Potwierdzono hipotezę, że większa wartość infrastruktury powoduje zwiększenie wydatków bieżących samorządów. Pokazano także, iż wzrost: stopy deprecjacji infrastruktury, zadłużenia w relacji do dochodów bieżących i, w mniejszym stopniu, stopy współfinansowania inwestycji unijnych wpływa negatywnie na poziom wydatków bieżących w relacji do dochodów bieżących. Oddziaływanie stopy procentowej zaś okazało się być ujemne lub neutralne. Zwiększenie czynnika dyskontowego wywiera różny efekt na wydatki bieżące w zależności od okresu. Nieoczekiwany efekt zaobserwowano w odniesieniu do wskaźnika wydatków bieżących poniesionych przed rozpoczęciem modelowanego okresu. Wyższe przeszłe wydatki ograniczają przestrzeń na wydatki bieżące na początku badanego okresu, ale w kolejnym roku następuje efekt kompensacji, tj. uprzednie oszczędności umożliwiają większe wydatki w porównaniu ze scenariuszem bez oszczędności. Stwierdzono także, że dodatni wpływ na inwestycje zwykłe (tj. niewspółfinansowane ze środków unijnych) w relacji do dochodów bieżących ma wzrost stopy deprecjacji infrastruktury oraz czynnika dyskontowego. Potwierdzona została także hipoteza o ujemnym wpływie na inwestycje zwykłe w relacji do dochodów bieżących wzrostu: stopy procentowej, stopy zapadalności zadłużenia i wskaźnika infrastruktury. Pozytywnie zweryfikowano również hipotezę o ujemnym wpływie wzrostu limitu dochodów unijnych. W przypadku wskaźnika zadłużenia można także doszukać się efektu kompensacji - ujemny wpływ występuje tylko na początku okresu. Efekt ten występuje również w odniesieniu do wskaźnika inwestycji zwykłych w roli zmiennej objaśnianej i wskaźnika przeszłych wydatków bieżących jako zmiennej objaśniającej. Okazał się on nawet silniejszy niż w przypadku wydatków bieżących jako zmiennej objaśnianej. Optymalny poziom wydatków inwestycyjnych co do zasady maleje w czasie, co jest konsekwencją przyjętej funkcji użyteczności, która premiuje inwestycje poczynione we wcześniejszym okresie, gdyż poprawiona w ten sposób infrastruktura jest uwzględniana wielokrotnie w użyteczności.
H74|Does fiscal oversight matter?|A gradually introduced reform of local government accounting made it temporarily possible for municipalities in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia to avoid the effective control of their budget by the authorities in charge of overseeing local government budgets and enforcing the existing fiscal rules. Using this withdrawal of effective fiscal oversight, we identify the effects of fiscal restraints and their enforcement on fiscal outcomes. We find that the withdrawal of oversight has a significant and sizable effect on per capita debt of local governments that were previously constrained by fiscal oversight. Fiscal restraints are important, and oversight and enforcement are key requirements for their success.
H74|Zur strukturellen Finanzlage der Laender: eine aktuelle Auswertung und Methodenkritik|Seit Einfuehrung der neuen Schuldenregel hat sich die Finanzlage der deutschen Bundeslaender deutlich verbessert. Nach unseren Berechnungen mit dem Aggregierten Quotierungsverfahren konnten die meisten Laender ihre strukturellen Budgetdefizite abbauen und im Jahr 2017 schon 14 Laender strukturelle Budgetueberschuesse erzielen; lediglich das Saarland und Nordrhein-Westfalen wiesen strukturelle Defizite auf. Die „strukturelle“ Besserung überzeichnet indes die Konsolidierungsfortschritte, denn sie ist zum grossen Teil dem historisch niedrigen Zinsniveau zu verdanken, das zu erheblichen Einsparungen beim Schuldendienst fuehrte. Da die Finanzierungskonditionen aber nicht dauerhaft so guenstig bleiben wie in den vergangenen Jahren, verdecken die Zinsersparnisse den bei vielen Laendern noch bestehenden Konsolidierungsbedarf. Wir plaedieren daher dafuer, nur nachhaltige Einsparungen bei den Zinslasten als strukturelle Besserung zu klassifizieren und entwickeln ein Bereinigungsverfahren, das neben den Konjunktureinfluessen auch die Verzerrung durch das aeusserst niedrige Zinsniveau beachtet. Unsere Simulationen zeigen, dass nach einer Bereinigung um die nicht nachhaltigen Einsparungen beim Schuldendienst nicht mehr 14, sondern nur neun Laender im Jahr 2017 einen strukturell mindestens ausgeglichenen Haushalt erzielt haben. Bei den verbleibenden sieben Laendern besteht teilweise noch erheblicher Konsolidierungsbedarf. Wir zeigen darueber hinaus, dass die zur quantitativen Vergleichbarkeit der Laenderfinanzen in der Regel verwandten Einwohner-Indikatoren wesentliche Strukturunterschiede zwischen den Laendern unberuecksichtigt lassen und damit zu irrefuehrenden Schlussfolgerungen fuehren koennen. Wir empfehlen daher, bei Laendervergleichen Kennzahlen zu verwenden, die strukturelle Unterschiede zwischen den Laendern bei Erwerbstaetigkeit und Produktivitaet beachten.
H74|Is the debt brake behind Germany's successful fiscal consolidation?|"Both the German federal as well as the general government recorded a surplus for the fourth time in a row in 2017. The fast consolidation after the Great Recession coincided with the transition period for the full introduction of the federal debt brake, which is sometimes interpreted as causality. At the same time Germany's economic performance is better than that of many other countries. For this reason it is nearly impossible to overrate the symbolic power of the debt brake as a seeming success story. In this paper we scrutinise the seeming success story of the debt brake. We carry out a comparative analysis of the ""structural"" consolidation of public finances in Germany for the period from 1991 until 2017 showing that the German debt brake is not the cause of the successful budget consolidation in Germany since 2010. The improvement of the general government finances since 2010 was smaller than in previous consolidation phases and was strongly supported by a favourable macroeconomic environment, and one-off effects. Finally, neither the general government sector nor the federal government would be in such a good fiscal shape, had the economy evolved less favourably since 2010. Without the blessing of a strong upswing Germany would hardly have become the fiscal role model for Europe and the German debt brake would not have become the blueprint for the European Fiscal Compact."
H74|The Economic Effects of Public Financing: Evidence from Municipal Bond Ratings Recalibration|We show that municipalities’ financial constraints can have a significant impact on local employment and growth. We identify these effects by exploiting exogenous upgrades in U.S. municipal bond ratings caused by Moody’s recalibration of its ratings scale in 2010. We find that local governments increase expenditures because their debt capacity expands following a rating upgrade. These expenditures have an estimated local income multiplier of 1.9 and a cost per job of $20,000 per year. Our findings suggest that debt-financed increases in government spending can improve economic conditions during recessions.Received December 14, 2015; editorial decision February 28, 2017 by Editor Andrew Karolyi.
H74|U.S. municipal yields and unfunded state pension liabilities|We present empirical evidence that municipal bond yields are increasing in the pension debt towards U.S. state civil servants. However, positive yield effects of both pension and explicit debt are found only for the period since the start of the crisis, suggesting that the crisis triggered awareness of budgetary sustainability. The marginal yield effect of higher pension debt is smaller than that of higher explicit debt, but still economically meaningful. The effect of higher pension debt seems stronger when using market values of pension assets than actuarial values, suggesting that investors pay more attention to market values.
H74|Can Credit Rating Agencies Affect Election Outcomes?|We show that credit rating agency actions can have a significant effect on elections. We identify these effects by exploiting exogenous variation in municipal bond ratings due to Moody's recalibration of its scale in 2010. We find that incumbent politicians in upgraded municipalities experienced an increased likelihood of reelection and higher vote shares. Rating upgrades affect elections by improving voter perceptions of the quality of incumbents, and by producing wealth effects through voters' holdings of municipal bonds. We also establish a link between incumbents' reelection prospects and the improvements in economic conditions that are due to a debt-financed increase in government spending following rating upgrades.
H74|Sovereign bond market reactions to no-bailout clauses and fiscal rules – The Swiss experience|We analyse the effects of a credible no-bailout policy and stringent sub-national fiscal rules on the risk premia of Swiss sub-national government bonds in the period from 1981 to 2007. In July 2003, the Swiss Supreme Court decided that the canton of Valais is not liable for municipal debt. This landmark decision reduced cantonal risk premia by about 26 basis points and cut the link between cantonal risk premia and the financial situation of the municipalities that existed before. The result demonstrates that a not fully credible no-bailout commitment can entail high costs for the potential guarantor. Additionally, strong and credible balanced budget rules reduce risk premia.
H74|Sovereign defaults during the Great Depression: the role of fiscal fragility|The debt crisis of the early 1930s was probably the largest and most widespread in history. The defaults of national and sub-national governments were pivotal events of the Great Depression and contributed to shaping post-World War II finance in the United States and worldwide. I study the role of a so-far largely unexplored factor - fiscal fragility - in the crisis. In order to do this, I construct and analyse a dataset comprising a new measure of default size and new estimates of the size and composition of public debts for around 25 countries. The data accounts for maturity structures, sub-national borrowing as well as other key characteristics of debt burdens. I show econometrically that the severe deterioration in public revenues experienced by national and sub-national governments in a number of countries was a key determinant of the defaults above and beyond the Great Depression income shock. Countries hardest hit by the slump were more likely to renege on their external debts at both the national and subnational level, but countries whose public revenues fell more moderately were able avoid or limit the size of default. I furthermore show that the collapse in public revenues was not part of an explicit strategy to counter the slump through an active fiscal policy. On the contrary, the evidence indicates that fiscally weak countries saw their public expenditures collapse alongside revenues.
H74|Local Crowding Out in China|In China, between 2006 and 2013 local public debt crowded out the investment of private firms by tightening their funding constraints, while leaving state-owned firms’ investment unaffected. We establish this result using a purpose-built dataset for Chinese local public debt. Private firms invest less in cities with more public debt, the reduction in investment being larger for firms located farther from banks in other cities or more dependent on external funding. Moreover, in cities where public debt is high, private firms’ investment is more sensitive to internal cash .ow, also when cash-flow sensitivity is estimated jointly with the probability of being credit-constrained.
H74|Transparency in state debt disclosure|We develop a new measure of relative debt transparency by comparing the amount of state debt reported in the annual Census survey and the amount reported in the statistical section of the state Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR). GASB 44 requires states to start reporting their total debt in the CAFR statistical section in FY 2006. However, states are allowed to use accounting choices to exclude some dependent agencies’ debt, which contributes to a gap between the two data sources. The regression results suggest that the gap tends to increase when states face greater fiscal stress or less political competition. Such patterns are not found in the pre-GASB 44 period.
H74|Municipal and sub-federal debt market|According to the 2016 year-end data, the regional consolidated budget and local government off-budget funds’ budget ran a deficit of Rb 303.5m and thereby reached an almost deficit-free level. By comparison, the regional consolidated budget and local government off-budget funds’ budget amounted to Rb 178.7bn (0.22% of GDP) in 2015.
H74|On the Dynamics of Community Development|This paper presents a dynamic political economy model of community development. In each period, a community invests in a local public good. The community can grow, with new housing supplied by competitive developers. To finance investment, the community can tax residents and issue debt. In each period, fiscal decisions are made by current residents. The community's initial wealth (the value of its stock of public good less its debt) determines how it develops. High initial wealth leads to rapid development. Low initial wealth leads to gradual development that is fueled by community wealth accumulation. Wealth accumulation arises from the desire to attract more households to share the costs of the public good. The long run size of the community can be too large or too small and development may proceed too slowly. Nonetheless, some development occurs and, at all times, public good provision is efficient.
H74|Political Myopia, Public Debt, and Economic Growth|Can economic growth increase public debt? Previous studies on the debt-growth nexus focused on the effects of debt on growth. We present an opposite perspective by showing that growth can reinforce deficit spending. A political economy model of endogenous public debt indicates that the underlying cause is political short-sightedness induced by reelection prospects. Reelection yields accountability but at the same time shortens incumbents’ time horizon, giving rise to political myopia and the ensuing budget deficit bias. Our model shows that economic growth exacerbates this undesirable effect of reelection. We test the model’s predictions using a panel of U.S. states over the period 1963-2007. Our identification strategy rests on constitutionally-entrenched differences in gubernatorial term limits that provide plausibly exogenous cross-state variation in political time horizon, and aggregate national TFP shocks that are exogenous to individual states. Our more conservative estimates indicate that overa course of five years, a one standard deviation positive TFP shock induces an increase of approximately $494 in real per capita public debt in politically myopic states.
H74|Leadership and conflict|We model the choice of leaders of groups within society, where leaders influence both the mode of interaction between groups (either peaceful compromise or costly conflict) and the outcome of these interactions. Group members may choose leaders strategically/instrumentally or they may choose leaders expressively. We characterize the equilibria of the instrumental choice model and also argue that leadership elections may overemphasise the role of expressive considerations in the choice of leader, and that this may result in increased conflict between groups.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H74|The effects of the new fiscal rule and creative accounting: Empirical evidence from Japanese municipalities|The purpose of this paper is to analyze creative accounting by stock-flow adjustment in Japanese municipalities after the introduction of a new fiscal rule. We contribute to the literature by analyzing the interdependency of the new fiscal indexes, which comprise three flow indexes and one stock index. Our main contribution is the finding that municipalities tolerated an increase in their stock indexes while they decreased their flow indexes by reducing reserved funds to avoid exceeding the criteria of the new fiscal rule, as the stock index criterion is weaker than that of the three flow indexes.
H74|Debt Sustainability of States in India: An Assessment|The debt position of the state governments in India, which deteriorated sharply between 1997-98 and 2003-04, has witnessed significant improvement since 2004-05. Debt sustainability analysis based on empirical estimation of inter-temporal budget constraint and fiscal policy response function in a panel data framework, covering 20 Indian states for the period 1980-81 to 2015-16, indicates that the debt position at the state level is sustainable in the long run. The increase in contingent liabilities of states and take-over of large chunk of these liabilities through debt restructuring of State Power Distribution Companies, however, would adversely affect the debt position of states.

H74|Numerical fiscal rules: framework or barrier for public policymaking?|The paper aims to assess the role of fiscal rules in the process of consolidating public finances and maintaining macroeconomic stability in the EU Member States in the period of the economic crisis. Additionally, the paper presents the case study on the efficiency of fiscal rules at the self-government (local) level in Poland. The article puts forward the thesis that fiscal rules were not an effective instrument for ensuring fiscal discipline in times of crisis. It presents the most important issues of the process of evolution of the rules during the crisis. A review and an analysis of legislation and literature on reforms implemented in the area of fiscal rules, confirms this thesis. The paper points to the need to create such fiscal rules that could contribute not only to fiscal stability but also to macroeconomic stability of the economy and concludes with recommendations for the creation of effective fiscal rules and their desirable features. The rules should be based on the structural balance or the over the cycle balance (but, in order for such rules to be effective, the structural deficit should be relatively low). Effective enforcement of the rules is necessary as well as a strong legal basis for the rules.
H74|The Political Economy of Fiscal Supervision and Budget Deficits: Evidence from Germany|In many federal countries, local governments run large deficits, even when fiscal supervision by state authorities is tight. I investigate to which extent party alignment of governments and fiscal supervisors influences budget deficits. The dataset includes 427 German local governments for the period 2000-2004. I exploit a period after a far-reaching institutional reform that entirely re-distributed political powers on both the government level and the fiscal supervisor level. Results do not show that party alignments of governments and supervisors (co-partisanship) drive short-term deficits. Instead, I find that the ideology of partisan governments and supervisors matters: left-wing local governments run higher deficits than their right-wing counterparts; left-wing supervisors tolerate higher deficits than right-wing supervisors. These findings imply that political independence for fiscal supervisors is recommended.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H74|Do Fiscal Rules Matter?|Fiscal rules are laws aimed at reducing the incentive to accumulate debt, and many countries adopt them to discipline local governments. Yet, their effectiveness is disputed because of commitment and enforcement problems. We study their impact applying a quasi-experimental design in Italy. In 1999, the central government imposed fiscal rules on municipal governments, and in 2001 relaxed them below 5,000 inhabitants. We exploit the before/after and discontinuous policy variation, and show that relaxing fiscal rules increases deficits and lowers taxes. The effect is larger if the mayor can be reelected, the number of parties is higher, and voters are older.
H74|How well do subnational borrowing regulations work?|There are many positive aspects associated with subnational borrowing, including additional funding and promoting intergenerational equity. However, it may also endanger fiscal sustainability and macro stability due to moral hazard and soft budget constraints, making borrowing controls justified and common. This chapter reviews the different types of ex ante and ex post subnational borrowing regulations used in the international experience based on a large panel of developed and developing countries. Each type of regulation has advantages and disadvantages, with varying suitability to a countryâ€™s circumstances. It is found that the presence of subnational tax autonomy contributes to an increase in the general government primary balance but not significantly for subnational primary balances. A history of subnational bailouts is associated with lower primary balances, on average, at all levels. The â€˜golden ruleâ€™ and limits on debt and borrowing appear effective at all levels of government. However, none of the broad types of subnational borrowing regulations seem to have a distinct significant direct effect on the narrow definition of fiscal sustainability at the subnational level.
H74|Effects of Fiscal Rules - 85 Years' Experience in Switzerland|The paper investigates the fiscal effects of Swiss cantonal debt brakes by taking explicitly into account the rules’ coverage. An in-depth analysis provides unique evidence that suggests the following: First, fiscal rules at the cantonal level have a negative effect on public deficits, which is stronger the better the analyzed budget position corresponds with the variable targeted by the rules. Second, cantonal debt brakes are rather not associated with substantial evasive measures. Third, cantonal fiscal rules tend to mitigate political budget cycles and shock-related deficits.

Mediante la metodología de datos panel, se encontró que el cumplimiento de la Ley 358 de 1997, la dependencia fiscal y la actividad económica influyen de manera positiva en la sostenibilidad de la deuda de las entidades territoriales, medida a través de su capacidad de pago. Entre tanto, el esfuerzo fiscal y los pasivos contingentes inciden de manera negativa. Finalmente, características como la rendición de cuentas, calidad en ejecución de políticas y ciclo político presupuestal, tienen un impacto significativo en la capacidad de pago de la deuda de las entidades territoriales. ***** This paper shows empirical evidence about the effects of fiscal rules on regional public debt sustainability in Colombia. By using panel data methodology, we found that Law 358 of 1997, fiscal dependency and economic activity, all have a positive effect on regional debt sustainability. Meanwhile, fiscal effort and contingent liabilities, impact it negatively. Finally, features such as accountability, quality of implementation of public policies and political budget cycle, all have a significant effect on the capacity to pay sub-national debt.
H74|Los programas de saneamiento fiscal y financiero en las entidades territoriales colombianas|Este trabajo aporta evidencia empírica acerca de la incidencia de los Acuerdos de Reestructuración de Pasivos en el desempeño fiscal de los gobiernos subnacionales de Colombia, implementados por estos ante la crisis en sus finanzas de la década de los noventas. Mediante la metodología de datos de panel, se encontró que el cumplimiento de las normas de racionalización de gasto y de disciplina fiscal influyen en mejores resultados fiscales. De otro lado, los pasivos contingentes y la dependencia fiscal impactan de manera negativa. Finalmente, políticas como el fortalecimiento de los ingresos de recaudo propio y la rendición de cuentas demuestran un impacto positivo en el desempeño fiscal de las entidades territoriales.
H74|Public Debt and Private Firm Funding: Evidence from Chinese Cities|In China, local public debt issuance between 2006 and 2013 crowded out investment by private manufacturing firms by tightening their funding constraints, while it did not affect state-owned and foreign firms. Using novel data for local public debt issuance, we establish this result in three ways. First, local public debt is inversely correlated with the city-level investment ratio of domestic private manufacturing firms. Instrumental variable regressions indicate that this link is causal. Second, local public debt has a larger negative effect on investment by private firms in industries more dependent on external funding. Finally, in cities with high government debt, firm-level investment is more sensitive to internal funding, also when this sensitivity is estimated jointly with the firm?s likelihood of being credit-constrained. Altogether, these results suggest that, by curtailing private investment, the massive public debt issuance associated with the post-2008 fiscal stimulus sapped long-term growth prospects in China.
H74|Municipal Bond Liquidity and Default Risk|This paper examines the pricing of bonds issued by states and local governments. I use three distinct, complementary approaches to decompose municipal bond spreads into default and liquidity components, finding that default risk accounts for 74% to 84% of the average municipal bond spread after adjusting for tax-exempt status. The first approach estimates the liquidity component using transaction data, the second measures the default component with credit default swap data, and the third is a quasi-natural experiment that estimates changes in default risk around pre-refunding events. The price of default risk is high given the rare incidence of municipal default and implies a high risk premium.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H74|A study on the distribution of the foreclosure lag, its expected capital opportunity cost and its analyses|This paper presents models that help lenders to calculate the foreclosure lag and its expected capital opportunity cost. The empirical results show the foreclosure lag fits well with the exponential distribution after linear transformation. The value of the expected capital opportunity cost is nearly twice the mortgage rate. In addition, the economic situations, loan characteristic, and state foreclosure policies significantly influence the foreclosure lag. The extra foreclosure lag tends to be longer in judicial foreclosure states than in states with a redemption policy. Moreover, new U.S. foreclosure laws, enacted after 2008, effectively shorten the foreclosure lag and decrease its volatilities.
H74|Voluntary disclosure incentives: Evidence from the municipal bond market|I investigate the trade-off between capital market incentives, reputational concerns, and administrative costs in the public disclosure decisions of municipal bond issuers. After Ambac׳s bankruptcy, issuers of insured debt increase disclosure relative to issuers of uninsured debt. After local per capita income declines or expenditures increase, issuers, particularly those with strong electoral incentives and weak voter oversight, reduce disclosure. After the implementation of an online filing repository, issuers with few dissemination channels increase disclosure relative to other issuers. Overall, my findings support a positive relationship between voluntary disclosure, risk, and low-cost dissemination, to the extent reputational capital is not threatened.
H74|How do politicians save? Buffer-stock management of unemployment insurance finance|We fit an empirical structural model of forward looking government savings behavior to data from the U.S. state Unemployment Insurance (UI) programs 1976–2008. States increase benefits or lower taxes when Unemployment Trust fund balances are high, consistent with a desired target level of savings. This can be explained by the representative state program behaving like a Carroll (1992) buffer-stock consumer who trades off a desire to expend savings (impatience) against the fear of running out of funds (risk aversion). We calibrate the model to the data and find that statistics from model simulations match similar statistics produced from the data for reasonable levels of risk aversion and impatience.
H74|Revenue decentralization, central oversight and the political budget cycle: Evidence from Israel|This paper examines whether revenue decentralization and direct external financial supervision affect the incidence and strength of political budget cycles, using a panel of Israeli municipalities during the period 1999–2009. We find that high dependence on central government transfers – as reflected in a low share of locally raised revenues in the municipality's budget – exacerbates political budget cycles, while tight monitoring – exercised through central government appointment of external accountants to debt accumulating municipalities – eliminates them. We also find that this pattern is predominantly accounted for by development expenditures. These results suggest that political budget cycles can result from fiscal institutions that create soft budget constraints: that is, where incumbents and rational voters can expect that the costs of pre-election expansions will be partly covered later by the central government.
H74|Subnational government’s budget deficit targets in a Monetary Union: the Spanish case 1995-2010|We set out an analysis of the factors that explain subnational budget balances. Ours results suggest that long run deficit targets should not be distributed linearly across Autonomus Communities, and cannot be expected to be fulfilled in the same time-horizon. More important, financing agreements should be redesigned in order to avoid the central government having the opportunity to transfer its deficit to Autonomous Communities. Finally, more budgetary coordination is needed in order to prevent that Autonomous Communities circumvent central governments fiscal rules using their public entities.
H74|Political Economy in the Pseudo-Aristotelian Oeconomica II and the German Cameralist Klock|Montchrétien was decidedly mercantilist. He praises the ancients, their honour and their self-discipline, but he notes, like Serra, that there was no concept of Political Economy in Antiquity. The words, however, appear for the first time in the pseudoaristotelian Oeconomica II, where the householding by a king, the householding of the governor of a province, the administration of a city (polis) and the household of a private citizen are distinguished; the term applies to the financing of a city economy. The book contains a multitude of prescriptions of how to finance a city by means of varying forms of taxation, gifts, forced loans and by means of manipulating the currency. Especially the latter schemes are of extreme interest for the historian of economic thought, as they reveal a remarkable understanding of metallist and nominalist conception of money. The paper tries to explain the contexts and then goes on to compare these doctrines with cameralism, using the comments published in 1651 by the German cameralist Klock on Oeconomica II. He treats the proposals as if they were made by contemporaries, assessing them from practical and moral points of view in a way that suggests a parallelism of institutions and ideas.
H74|Premium Municipal Bonds and Issuer Fiscal Distress|Economic theory suggests that bond issuers of lower credit quality or higher opacity should be more likely to issue bonds with premium coupons (higher coupon rates relative to yields at issuance). Using a comprehensive data set of municipal bonds issued between 1992 and 2012 by more than 21,000 issuers, we show that this has not been the case until the early 2000s. We examine what changed in this market to bring it into greater alignment with economic principles. We argue that the Government Accounting Standards Board’s Statement 34 that required the use of accrual accounting rules in government financial reports deserves the credit.
H74|Sovereign Default in the US|In the absence of a judicial mechanism to reduce the debt burden of a sovereign member of our Union, the resolution process can be quick but perhaps too indifferent to the health, safety, and welfare of the affected residents. In this paper, I use evidence from the Arkansas state archives to provide a description of the events surrounding the default of the state in 1933. I examine the evolution of the negotiations, the outcomes, and the role of fiscal policy.
H74|Municipal and subfederal loan market|The regions’ consolidated budgets and the budgets of subnational state off-budget funds ran with a deficit of Rb 178.7bn (0.22% of GDP) at the 2015 year-end. In terms of percentage of GDP, the regions’ consolidated budget deficit was over three times as little as the value recorded in 2014. For example, in 2014, subnational budgets ran a deficit of Rb 485.6bn (0.68% of GDP).
H74|Intergovernmental fiscal relations and subnational finance in Russia in 2015| In 2015, the share of subnational budget expenditure of the Russian Federation consolidated budget dropped considerably from 39.7% in 2014 to 32.1% in 2015 (excluding expenditure for the Crimean Federal Okrug). The share of tax revenues shrank to a lesser extent, from 32.6% to 28.6%, during the same period. The decline in the share of subnational budget expenditure of the total volume of Russia’s consolidated budget expenditure is explained largely by faster-than-normal growth of the federal budget expenditure (by 5.6% in nominal terms). The federal budget expenditure increased first of all for ‘General National Issues’ (by 18.6%), ‘National Defense’ (by 28.3%), ‘Housing and Utilities’ (by 20.5%), ‘Social Policy’ (by 23.5%), ‘Municipal and Public Debt Servicing’ (by 24.8%). Subnational budget expenditure increased in the period under review by 1.4% (excluding expenditure for the Crimean Federal Okrug).

H74|Public Debt and Private Firm Funding. Evidence from Chinese Cities|In China local public debt issuance between 2006 and 2013 crowded out investment by private manufacturing firms by tightening their funding constraints, while it did not affect state-owned and foreign fi rms. Using novel data for local public debt issuance, we establish this result in three ways. First, local public debt is inversely correlated with the city-level investment ratio of domestic private manufacturing firms. Instrumental variable regressions indicate that this link is causal. Second, local public debt has a larger negative effect on investment by private firms in industries more dependent on external funding. Finally, in cities with high government debt, firm-level investment is more sensitive to internal funding, also when this sensitivity is estimated jointly with the firm's likelihood of being credit-constrained. Altogether, these results suggest that, by curtailing private investment, the massive public debt issuance associated with the post-2008 fiscal stimulus sapped long-term growth prospects in China.
H74|Spanish fiscal federalism at the crossroad: A survey|In just over three decades Spain became one of the most decentralized countries in the world, at least in the tax area. This paper aims to conduct a detailed analysis of this unplanned process, showing the successful aspects, but also its shortcomings and failures. Furthermore, this analysis will also help to understand current political tensions in Catalonia, and, to a lesser extent, the Basque Country. Our second aim is to review the way in which the Spanish sub-central levels of government have responded to the so-called “great recession”. Spain is a good laboratory for what actually works and what does not in the area of stability and fiscal sustainability in decentralized states, for two reasons. First, it is by far the country which has suffered the brunt of the economic and financial crisis most acutely among those with a federal structure. And second, subsequent different solutions for tackling the fiscal crisis of sub-central governments have been tested.
H74|An economic explanation of the nationalization of electoral politics|The literature on the nationalization of electoral politics focuses on the institutional characteristics of political regimes and the structure and organization of social cleavages. We argue that the nationalization of electoral politics is also driven by economic performance. Short-term economic perturbations increase vote transfers from large (and highly nationalized) parties to small (and weakly nationalized) parties. On the contrary, sharp improvements in economic performance may generate vote shifts towards large parties, and then nationalization should increase. Permissive electoral systems exacerbate the influence of economic performance on nationalization. Pooled cross-sectional time-series regression analysis is conducted on data from 43 countries and 475 elections between 1950 and 2012. The party-level mechanisms are shown through a closer look at Austria and Portugal.
H74|Rethinking the Political Economy of Decentralization: How Elections and Parties Shape the Provision of Local Public Goods|As more and more of the world’s states devolve power and resources to sub-national governments, decentralization has emerged as one of the most important global trends of the new century. Yet, there is still no consensus as to the benefits of decentralization and how to design institutions that can realize these benefits. We investigate the political conditions under which the decentralization of authority will improve the delivery of public goods. Building off Oates’ “decentralization theorem” to include inter-jurisdictional spillovers, we develop a new theory suggesting that the interaction of democratic decentralization (the popular election of sub-national governments) and party centralization (the power of national party leaders over sub-national office-seekers) will produce the best service delivery outcomes. To test this argument empirically, we develop a new dataset of sub-national political institutions. Our analyses, which examine educational and health service delivery in 135 countries across thirty years, provide support for our theoretical expectations.
H74|Amalgamation, free-rider behavior, and regulation|Abstract Amalgamation incentivizes municipalities to increase public debt because it allows them to subrogate their repayment and interest burden on the entire municipality after amalgamation. Smaller municipalities, in particular, tend to accumulate public debt in order to free-ride. Previous studies have shown this kind of opportunistic behavior in countries where municipalities can issue bonds freely in the market. However, in Japan, municipalities cannot issue bonds freely by regulation. When such regulation controls debt accumulation by the merging municipality, the free-rider effect should be weak. This study examines the relationship between the regulation of local government borrowing and free-rider behavior of Japanese municipalities. The difference-in-difference regression results confirm the existence of a free-rider effect in this regard. Moreover, the debt expenditure ratio, the index of the regulation of local public bond issues, has the same effect that prevents local public debt from increasing for both merging and never-merged municipalities. This fact shows that a merging municipality with a free-rider incentive cannot increase local public debt to excess by using the regulation. Therefore, the average free-rider effect per capita is approximately 7 % of the average local public debt per capita for the end of the pre-treatment period. This result is considerably lower than the effects of the Swedish cases.

H74|Legislative strategy for setting up an independent debt management agency|The Public Debt Management Agency (PDMA) is a body that issues public debt with the objective of keeping long term costs of government borrowing low. In India, the existing legal framework obliges the government to give the task of managing its debt to the RBI. Pursuant to its role as debt manager, RBI set up market infrastructure such as an exchange and a depository. Carve-outs were made in the regulation of securities, to allow the RBI to regulate the bond market. Over the last 20 years, the proposal to establish an independent PDMA has been repeatedly put forward. In this paper, we work out the legal strategy to set up a PDMA. We show the transition path for the roll out and for the movement of the functions, accounts, records and systems to the new agency in a phased manner.
H74|Evaluation of the fiscal effect on municipal mergers: Quasi-experimental evidence from Japanese municipal data|The purpose of this paper is to evaluate a fiscal common pool problem in Japanese municipal mergers. Specifically, we investigate whether the merged municipalities rapidly increase their expenditures and bonds just before mergers. Because the likelihood of Japanese municipal mergers depends on a municipality's characteristics such as population size, area, and fiscal conditions, municipal mergers are a non-voluntary and non-random phenomenon in Japan. Therefore, we identify causal effects by applying propensity score matching within a differences-in-differences framework to address the problems of endogeneity bias and sample selection bias. In particular, we focus on the subordinate merger partner in absorption-type mergers. Our results show that the subordinate merger partner suffers from adverse fiscal conditions and creates a fiscal common pool problem in public projects just before mergers.
H74|The Japan Municipal Bond Yield Curve: 2002 to the Present|The aim of this paper is to present the par yield curve for Japan’s Municipal Bonds, by examining daily data from 2002 to the present. Moreover, this paper contributes to current literature by making available for the first time additional long-run market data on Japan’s Municipal Bonds, and thereby enabling economists and practitioners to analyze the large municipal bond market of Japan in detail. We also investigate the fit of the well-known parametric and spline methods and are able to show that the spline method does, in fact, fit well as in previous studies. In keeping with our aim to make these data more widely available, we posted the data on the following website and expect to update this regularly: http://www.mcnnns77.net.
H74|Do equalization payments affect subnational borrowing? Evidence from regression discontinuity|According to the fiscal federalism literature, subcentral budget constraints become softer when local governments are more dependent on revenues over which they have no discretion. As a consequence of ‘transfer dependency’, subcentral governments can expect to be bailed out by the central government and therefore tend to accumulate higher levels of debt. We test this conjecture with data from Austrian municipalities. In fiscal terms, Austria is a highly centralized federation in which tax autonomy at the municipal level is rather weak. Our identification strategy is based on a discontinuity caused by the unique regulation of population weights in the tax-sharing agreement between central government and the municipalities. Our results indicate that, in line with theoretical expectations, municipalities with higher revenue dependency are responsible for higher net borrowing per capita. The size of the additional borrowing effect equals to about 5% of average municipal debt. We also find that almost one half of the observed discontinuity works through an investment channel.
H74|Impact of Government Borrowing on Financial Development (A case study of Pakistan)|Private sector of any country plays important role in the economic development of the country. It not only provides employment to the people of the country but also goods and services according to the taste of the people. Private investment depends mainly on private borrowing which proves to be the blood for private sector. Private borrowing or credit to private sector is important part of the financial development which measures the financial depth of it. The aim of this paper therefore, is to investigate the impact of government borrowing from central bank and commercial banks on financial development. In this Paper, government borrowing is used as Public domestic debt while credit to private sector (Private borrowing) is used as financial development. Normally, it is frequently observed that when government borrows more from banks, then less amount left for the private borrowing so in this way volume of private investment declines and this is found in this study. There are some other factors which also affected the private borrowing like, taxes, savings and inflation. This study has been done by using time series data of Pakistan from 1972-2015. ARDL Methodology has been used to investigate the relationship of variables. The data resource has been taken from WDI and the reports of state bank of Pakistan as well as different issues of economic survey of Pakistan.
H74|The role of IMF in Pakistanâ€™s economy|This study examines â€œThe role of IMF in the economy of Pakistanâ€ over the period of 1974 to 2013.The results of the auto regressive distributed lag (ARDL)model has been used for examining the cointegration among the variables of the model and vector error correction model is used for short run dynamics of the models. ARDL bound testing approach show that there is cointegration among the variables of the model. The long run results show that the coefficient of GDP and political instability have negative and insignificant relationship with government borrowing. There is negative and significant relationship between IMF charges and government borrowing. Exchange rate has positive and significant relationship with government borrowing. Political instability is treated as dummy variable in model.
H74|Debt Dynamics, Fiscal Deficit, and Stability in Government Borrowing in India: A Dynamic Panel Analysis|Despite the initiatives of the Finance Commission of India, fiscal performance has been deteriorating and increasingly diverging across Indian states. Given that the state governments are endowed with expenditure autonomy, this paper investigates whether the composition of expenditure of the subnational governments has an impact on the degree of indebtedness. A panel analysis for the 17 non-special category states over 1980–2013 indicates that apart from the budget structure, the state-specific factors affecting fiscal performance plays an important role in government borrowing. Curiously enough, government borrowing is more responsive to revenue expenditure than capital outlay and has more growth-augmenting effect through revenue expenditure.
H74|Government Decentralization Program in Indonesia|Without much preparation, Indonesia, in 2000, at a stroke replaced the previous system of centralized government and development planning with a wide range of decentralization programs. The reforms gave greater authority, political power, and financial resources directly to regencies and municipalities, bypassing the provinces. The powers transferred include those of executing a wide range of responsibilities in the areas of health, primary and middle-level education, public works, environment, communication, transport, agriculture, manufacturing, and other economic sectors. At the same time, the government replaced the antiquated cash-based, single-entry system of public finance with a modern double-entry accounting system that uses a single treasury account; is performance based; and has transparent management of the public treasury, tight expenditure and financial controls with performance indicators, computerized reporting, and a tightly scheduled auditing system. On the positive side, unlike in many developing and transition countries, the decentralization program in Indonesia has not caused major political or economic problems. However, the decentralization program was ill prepared and not carried out in a logical order for two reasons. First, the capacity of subnational governments to produce public and private goods, increase productivity and employment, and promote economic growth in their jurisdictions, was not increased. Because of the long tradition of centralization, local government never built the capacity to carry out economic planning and undertake initiatives to promote local economic growth. Before the reform, the local governments had mainly functioned as implementing agencies of national policies and programs. Second, the number of good financial managers, as required by the new laws of public treasury and auditing, was also limited and needed to be trained. The rising revenues of local governments do not follow their increasing government functions to promote economic development that could potentially cause fiscal imbalances.
H74|Frameworks for Central–Local Government Relations and Fiscal Sustainability|Sustainable and inclusive growth in emerging Asian economies requires continued high levels of public sector investment in areas such as infrastructure, education, health, and social services. These responsibilities, especially with regard to infrastructure investment, need to be devolved increasingly to the regional government level. However, growth of sources of revenue and financing for local governments has not necessarily kept pace, forcing them, in some cases, to increase borrowing or cut spending below needed levels. This paper reviews alternative models of the relationship between central and local governments, and provides an overview and assessment of different financing mechanisms for local governments, including tax revenues, central government transfers, bank loans, and bond issuance, with a focus on the context of emerging Asian economies. The paper also reviews financing mechanisms for local governments and mechanisms for maintaining fiscal stability and sustainability at both the central and local government levels. Based upon the evidence on the decentralization process in Asia, it proposes some policy implications for improving central-local government relations and fiscal sustainability.
H74|Fiscal decentralization and local budget deficits in Viet Nam: an empirical analysis|Since 1975, Viet Nam has gradually decentralized more fiscal responsibilities to local authorities. This chapter has two objectives: (i) to take stock of the current institutional framework for intergovernmental fiscal relations in Viet Nam, and (ii) to empirically assess the debt sustainability of local governments in Viet Nam. The empirical analysis uses two estimation methods: (i) fully modified ordinary least squares (OLS) to estimate the long-term correlations between co-integration equations, including vectors of co-integration variables, and stochastic regressor innovations; and (ii) fiscal reaction equations at the provincial level, based upon the Bohn (2008) model. The empirical results suggest that deficit levels are generally sustainable at the local level.
H74|Yerel Yönetimlerin Finansmanında Yerel Yönetim Bankacılığı Uygulaması, İller Bankası Örneği ve Türkiye İçin Öneriler|Although, debt requirements of local governments in Turkey were satisfied basically through two main venues, İller Bankası and commercial banks, recent years recorded an increase in usage towards commercial banks. Municipal Bond Banking Model, which has been used for raising funds from capital markets for local governments has been a videly used method in various countries under different procedures, is not seen as an active model in Turkey. In our study, aside from providing information about Municipal Bond Banking Model, we are putting emphasis on the availability of this model as an alternative source of local governments funding focusing on Tukey and İller Bankası operations.
H74|Vertical effects of fiscal rules: the Swiss experience|Abstract Formal fiscal rules have been introduced in many countries throughout the world. While most studies focus on the intra-jurisdictional effects of fiscal rules, vertical effects on the finances of other levels of government have yet to be explored thoroughly. From a theoretical point of view, vertical effects could work in opposite directions, i.e., improve and burden other levels’ finances. This paper is the first formally investigating the influence of Swiss debt brakes, which primarily target the cantonal level, on municipal finances. A difference-in-differences estimation (two-way fixed effects) of aggregated and disaggregated local panel data provides unique evidence that suggests little effect of budget constraints at the cantonal level on average municipal finances and fiscal decentralization. The results are confirmed by a wide range of robustness tests. If anything, cantonal debt brakes are associated with improved local finances and fiscal centralization. These findings run counter to popular fears and emphasize the possibility of positive spillover effects of fiscal rules.
H74|The Persistency of Public Debt|This paper shows that geographic patterns in public debt can be highly persistent despite drastic external shocks. I compare pre-Nazi debt in 60 districts and 132 large cities of the German Reich with current local government debt. German local government debt completely defaulted after WWII. I find that 1932 and 2012 debt is highly correlated in cities which saw a re-installation of their pre-Nazi mayor by the Allies in 1945. Comparable cities without personnel continuity do not exhibit a robust correlation. Intertemporal personnel links thus constitute a main channel through which to explain long-term persistency in public finance.
H74|Los mecanismos extraordinarios de pago a proveedores de las Administraciones Públicas en España|The economic crisis was initially associated with an increase in regional and local government payment periods and trade debt. Since 2012, central government has approved various extraordinary mechanisms for the payment of local and regional government suppliers that have significantly reduced the stock of trade debt and the average supplier-payment periods attributable to these levels of government. Successive plans have helped unblock payments and channel funds of close to €67 billion towards the private sector in somewhat less than three years. And against a background of economic weakness, fiscal consolidation and difficult conditions of access to lending, it is believed this has provided a considerable impetus to activity that has helped mitigate some of the adverse effects of the economic crisis. In parallel, the roll-out of the plan has entailed a substantial increase in local and regional government debt vis-à-vis the State. To prevent inappropriate incentives for the conduct of local and regional government from arising, the funding mechanisms agreed on require compliance with certain adjustment plans.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

H74|Determinants of fiscal distress in Italian municipalities|Abstract How important is to place limits on specific categories of local public spending in order to prevent municipalities’ defaults? In this paper we consider Italian municipalities from 2000 to 2012. We use a logit model to investigate which of the main budget indicators (debt repayments, current budget equilibrium, amount of residuals and personnel costs) is relatively more important in affecting the default probability. Our results suggest that a 10% rise in the share of loan repayment over total spending leads to an increase in default probability by 2.6% on average. These findings are robust to alternative model specifications and the inclusion of fixed effects, time dummies and macroeconomic control variables. Our analysis thus shows that Italian municipalities seem to be on the default path when they are incapable to fully internalize the effects of issuing new debt today on the current equilibrium of tomorrow. To place limits on specific types of public spending seems to be relatively less important.

H74|The default of special district financing: Evidence from California|In response to a series of legislative measures curbing property tax revenues, special taxation districts emerged as a mechanism of financing public infrastructure by local governments in many U.S. states. Community facilities districts (CFDs) in California are but one example. These districts are financed by issuing a special type of land-secured municipal bonds known as CFD or Mello–Roos bonds, and levying special taxes to service the debt. Using a unique comprehensive data set on California CFD bond issues since the moment of their inception until 2006, we study the default experience of these largely nonrated bonds. Contrary to the general belief that the “dirt” CFD bonds are very risky, we find that their lifetime performance is at least as good as that of Standard and Poor’s B to BBB rated municipal bonds. Using duration analysis, we explore the dependence of the likelihood of CFD default on issue characteristics and macroeconomic and industry factors. We find that the state of local economy and construction industry are strong predictors of CFD default. The default is positively linked to the risk premium of the CFD bonds measured as the spread between their interest rate and the AAA rated general obligation municipal bonds yield index. We also find aging effects and relate them to stages of CFD development.
H74|Common pool problems in voluntary municipal mergers|We analyze free-riding behavior of Finnish municipalities prior to voluntary municipal mergers. The merger process creates a temporary common pool problem, because of a delay from the initial decision to the actual merger during which municipalities stay autonomous. Using a difference-in-differences strategy, we find that the stronger free-riding incentive a municipality faced the more it increased its debt and spent its cash reserves. These funds were spent mostly on investments and current expenditures.
H74|Race to the debt trap? — Spatial econometric evidence on debt in German municipalities|Through an intertemporal budget constraint, jurisdictions may gain advantages in tax and spending competition by ‘competing’ on debt. While the existing spatial econometric literature focuses on tax and spending competition, very little is known about spatial interaction via public debt. If jurisdictions compete for mobile capital to finance public spending, they may compete in debt levels as well as taxes. We use a theoretical model to derive the reaction of jurisdictions' debt levels to their neighbors' debts. We then estimate the spatial interdependence of public debt among German municipalities using a panel on municipalities in the two largest German states from 1999 to 2006. We find significant and robust interaction effects between debt levels of neighboring municipalities, which we compare to spatial tax and spending interactions. The results indicate that a municipality increases its per capita debt by 16–33 Euro as a reaction to an increase of 100 Euro in neighboring municipalities.
H74|Italian Ordinary Statute Regions and Derivatives|Regions are first-level local administrations in Italy. Since 2003, regions have extensively used over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. Since the use of these derivatives is not clearly regulated, derivatives have been employed to hedge outstanding debt and its costs, but there is evidence that derivatives have also been used to pay current expenses. This study empirically investigates the dynamics the debt of Italian Ordinary Statute Regions and the impact of OTC derivatives during the 2007-2012 period, and the results show that derivatives – as measured by negative market value – have a positive and statistically significant relationship with debt.

H74|Debt Repayment Capacity Of Local Government Sector In Poland During The 2008-2013 Economic Slowdown Period|The crisis, which began in 2008, had a negative impact on the financial condition of local governments across the European Union. In Poland, the debt of the local government sector increased from 2.3% of GDP in 2008 to 4.2% of GDP in 2013. The growing indebtedness influenced the scope of countercyclical policies of local governments. At present, such policies appear as hardly sustainable in the context of future debt repayments and the required deleveraging process. The paper shows simulations concerning the ability of local governments to service their accumulated debt. In a moderately optimistic scenario when there is no new borrowing, over 25% of local governments will need more than 15 years to repay their existing debts. Although in 2013 the financial indicators showed sufficient space for debt servicing for 95% of local governments, the sector remains highly vulnerable to future adverse scenarios. The use of random sampling computational algorithms (Monte Carlo method) applied to the local government financial ratios based on free operating cash flow and net debt confirms the sectorâ€™s negative credit risk exposure. Even modestly adverse scenarios show that ca. 20 percent of local governments will reach alarmingly low levels of their debt service indicators in the near future. The larger municipalities appear to be the local government subcategory with the highest credit risk exposure.
H74|Overlapping political budget cycles in the legislative and the executive|We advance the literature on political budget cycles by testing separately for cycles in expenditures for elections in the legislative and the executive. Using municipal data, we can separately identify these cycles and account for general year effects. For the executive branch, we show that it is important whether the incumbent re-runs. To account for the potential endogeneity associated with this decision, we apply a unique instrumental variables approach based on age and pension eligibility rules. We find sizable and significant effects in expenditures before council elections and before joint elections when the incumbent re-runs.
H74|Subnational level fiscal health in India: stability and sustainability implications|Fiscal health of subnational governments is a priority area of concern in the contemporary policy debate in India. The central government has recently announced that Kerala, Punjab and West Bengal are fiscally unsound at the level of general category states. The study reviews this projection by recent and long-term trends of basic fiscal variables, and then assesses their financial stability and sustainability along the debt–deficit spiral over time. We found that a sharp rise in the revenue account gap caused fiscal deficit to grow steadily and hence a high-flying outstanding debt in all states during late 1990s to early 2000s. This enormous stock of debt emerged as a higher deviation of actual primary deficit from its stability level. Given that the rate of interest exceeded growth of output during this period, it increased debt stock above the level of primary deficit. Furthermore, none of the states accomplished fiscal sustainability fully. Excepting West Bengal, they attained partial sustainability as their debt–deficit system slowly restores the long run equilibrium. West Bengal is far away from sustainability because its future surpluses are not enough to service the debt. The study suggests that a sound adjustment in fiscal position on revenue account is essential for all states and that West Bengal needs a special attention to achieve the equilibrium in long run.

H74|A Good Crises: Canadian Municipal Credit Conditions after the Lehman Brothers Bankruptcy|Subnational governments in several countries struggled to borrow on credit markets during and after the global financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. Canadian municipalities were not immune. They, like many governments, were unable to borrow for a brief period after the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy of 2008. But municipal credit conditions improved markedly after the peak of the crisis. Interest rates plunged, demand for long-term bonds increased, and the investor base expanded. Municipal borrowers did not, however, fare as well as the federal and provincial governments, which saw even sharper declines in interest rates. This paper seeks to explain these developments. It links municipal success to factors underpinning low interest rates and stellar municipal creditworthiness, and attributes the superior conditions of federal and provincial borrowers to volatility in global financial markets and patterns of foreign investment in Canada’s government bond markets. The analysis reveals the resilience of Canada’s municipal borrowers in the face of global credit shocks and the virtues of Canada’s tightly regulated system of municipal borrowing.

H74|Empirical Analysis of Yield Determinants in Japan’s Municipal Bond Market: Does Credit Risk Premium Exist?|In this study, we examine the determinants of the yield spread between issuers in Japan’s municipal bond market using panel data and focus on identifying whether credit risk premium exists. The results of the panel data analysis reveal new evidence on the municipal bond market for FY 2002–2013. In the first half of the 2000s, the fundamental fiscal statistics, that is, the credit risk indicators, had no impact on the yield spreads, suggesting the absence of credit risk premium. Second, Yūbari city’s insolvency in 2006 led to a structural break and since then, investors have begun accounting for local governments’ outstanding debt. Third, when important financial events occur, other credit risk indicators also significantly impact the yield spread, suggesting that during such events, investors are more aware of credit risk presence. Finally, the findings of this study provide implications for, perhaps, financial institutions, market participants, regulators.

The empirical results suggest that first, China’s GDP growth rate, the borrowing costs and the financial markets’ development are key common determining factors for China’s debt structure; second, the highly indebted local governments and non-financial corporations could lead to potential risks for China’s financial stability. Nevertheless, China’s debt by sector is sound and sustainable in the near and medium term.

A tal fin, se estima, para todas las CCAA y para el periodo 2003-2012, el grado de incumplimiento de cada comunidad con su objetivo de déficit en función del cumplimiento en los ejercicios previos y de un conjunto de variables relacionadas con factores macroeconómicos, políticos, presupuestarios e institucionales. De acuerdo con los resultados obtenidos, el incumplimiento anterior de una comunidad autónoma aumenta su incumplimiento en el ejercicio corriente, mientras que el incumplimiento previo del conjunto del nivel autonómico estimula el cumplimiento individual. En año electoral, el grado de incumplimiento con los objetivos de estabilidad será mayor. Lo contrario sucede si el presidente de la comunidad pertenece al PSOE. Finalmente, unos menores ingresos per cápita o unos mayores gastos primarios per cápita también favorecen el incumplimiento de las reglas fiscales autonómicas. El efecto de los ingresos es mayor que el de los gastos y este último parece que se debe más al funcionamiento del mercado político en cada comunidad autónoma que a cambios en las necesidades de gasto.
H74|Schuldenbremse 2020: große Unterschiede beim Konsolidierungsbedarf der Länder|This article examines the scope for expenditure of each German federal state (including local governments) to achieve a balanced budget in 2020 when the debt brake fully enters into force. After deducting interest and pension burden, a major group of states could afford marked annual increases vis-à-vis 2013. Heavily indebted Bremen could raise expenditure only slightly, whereas Saarland would have to reduce it even given lower interest rate and pension increase assumptions. Some East German states also face major challenges despite 2013 budget surpluses, as special financial assistance will be phased out. Figures adjusted for price changes indicate needs for cuts in several states. Copyright ZBW and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015
H74|Local government debt and economic growth in China|​China’s local government debt (LGD) has recently become the focus of economic policy debates. However, information about LGD and its impact on economic growth in the Chinese economy is scarce. This paper attempts to present an empirical investigation of the impact of China’s LGD on economic growth. It is probably the first of its kind to focus on China and thus contributes to the general literature on the relationship between government debt and economic growth. The paper first provides an assessment of LGD in China’s regional economies, using recently released auditing statistics and other available secondary information. It then applies conventional growth analysis methods to examine the impact of LGD on regional growth in China. Various scenario and sensitivity analyses are also conducted, to accommodate the inadequacy and potentially poor quality of debt statistics.

H74|Fiscal Transfers and Fiscal Sustainability| We examine whether the U.S. and German state governments pursue sustainable fiscal policies taking into account fiscal transfers. Using panel data techniques we investigate whether the debt‐to‐GDP ratio had a positive influence on the primary surplus (Bohn model). We show that including/excluding fiscal transfers changes the results. If fiscal transfers are not included in the primary surplus, the test results do not indicate that the U.S. and German state governments pursued sustainable fiscal policies. Our results also suggest that fiscal transfers were positively related to debt. These findings indicate that intergovernmental transfers have implicitly subsidized debts.
H74|Politicians’ promotion incentives and bank risk exposure in China|This paper shows that politicians’ pressure to climb the career ladder increases bank risk exposure in their region. Chinese local politicians are set growth targets in their region that are relative to each other. Growth is stimulated by debt-financed programs which are mainly financed via bank loans. The stronger the performance pressure the riskier the respective local bank exposure becomes. This effect holds for local banks which are under some control of local politicians, it has increased with the release of stimulus packages requiring local co-financing and it is stronger if politicians hold chairmen positions in bank boards.
H74|The role of lenders' trust in determining borrowing conditions for sovereign debt: An analysis of one-period government bonds with default risk|"In this paper, the author considers the sovereign debt in the form of one-period government bonds with default risk, which can be purchased by and traded among domestic and foreign investors. She shows that the weight assigned to the lenders' interest by the borrowing government at the time of debt repayment, which captures the lenders' trust in the government's propensity to repay the debt and is denoted as », also determines the default risk: a higher » means a lower default risk ceteris paribus which leads to a lower risk premium, and vice versa. Since this relationship only holds in the ""good equilibrium"", the author further shows that the ""good equilibrium"" is the only stable equilibrium under some quite general assumptions while the ""bad equilibrium"" is an unstable one - a possible reason why in practice rather a negative correlation between » and the default risk as well as the corresponding risk premium is observed."
H74|A reconsideration of multiple equilibria in the analysis of one-period government bonds with default risk|"In this paper, the author considers sovereign debt in the form of one-period government bonds with default risk, which can be purchased by and traded among domestic and foreign investors. She shows that the ""good equilibrium"" is the only stable equilibrium under some quite general assumptions, while the ""bad equilibrium"" is an unstable one - a possible explanation for why the former is observed in practice. Given the ""good equilibrium"", the author further shows that the domestic debt share also determines the default risk: a higher domestic debt share means a lower default risk, ceteris paribus, which leads to a lower risk premium; while a lower domestic debt share means a higher default risk and a higher risk premium. Finally, she discusses some alternative interpretations of the domestic debt share."
H74|Do fiscal rules constrain fiscal policy? A meta-regression-analysis|We implement a meta-regression-analysis for the budgetary impact of numerical fiscal rules based on 30 studies published in the last decade. The existing empirical evidence points to a constraining effect of rules on fiscal aggregates. However, this seemingly optimistic message is strongly weakened as our analysis points to a bias if the potential endogeneity of fiscal rules is not explicitly taken into account. Furthermore, our analysis provides evidence for the presence of a publication bias. Both sources of bias reduce the statistical precision of obtained effects below usual levels of statistical significance. In addition, we offer suggestive evidence for the effect size based on a small coherent sub-sample and provide recommendations for future research on the budgetary impact of fiscal rules.

A 2011. július 1-én hatályba lépett jogszabály kiszélesítette az Állami Számvevőszék (ÁSZ) ellenőrzési jogosítványait, megerősítette a szervezet függetlenségét, és átláthatóbbá tette a számvevőszéki munkát. A törvény rendelkezése szerint az ÁSZ általános hatáskörrel végzi a közpénzekkel és az állami és önkormányzati vagyonnal való gazdálkodás ellenőrzését. Magyarországon az államháztartás ellenőrzésének rendszere három pilléren nyugszik, ezek alkotói a külső ellenőrzés, a kormányzati ellenőrzés és az államháztartás belső kontroll rendszere. A folyamat, „A kontrollok szerepének felértékelődése a közszférában” (Domokos, 2012.), az ÁSZ belső kontrollrendszer ellenőrzéseit követő jelentések megállapításainak hatására, az intézkedési tervek formájában nyer megerősítést.

The integrity audits, regulations and organisational measures strengthen the transparent and accountable use of public funds by local governments, organisations and organisational units, as well as, reduce the risk and the extent of abuse of public powers. During my lecture I will describe and evaluate the development process of local governments’ internal audit system and the professional management of audit activities and internal audit, in the absence of which the orderly, regulated, economic, effective, ethical and efficient use of public funds and public assets cannot be achieved. My lecture is based on the conclusions of the audits carried out by the State Audit Office in the years of 2012 and 2013, the results of the State Audit Office’s integrity survey and my audit experience, taking also into account the recommendations of INTOSAI.
H74|Fiscal Rules and Public Spending: Evidence from Italian Municipalities|The aim of this paper is to investigate the extent to which local budget spending composition reacts to fiscal rules variations. I consider the budget of Italian municipalities and exploit specific changes in the Domestic Stability Pact’s rules, to perform a difference-in-discontinuities analysis. The results show that not all rules are equally effective: imposing a cap on the total amount of consumption and investment is not as binding as two caps, one specific for consumption and a different one for investment spending. More specifically, the consumption variation is triggered by changes in the level of wages and services spending, while investment relies on infrastructure movements. In addition, there is evidence that when an increase in investment is achieved, there is also a higher budget deficit level.
H74|Staatsverschuldung in Extrahaushalten: Historischer Überblick und Implikationen für die Schuldenbremse in Deutschland|Regierungen können Extrahaushalte gründen, um die Finanzierung staatlicher Aufgaben aus dem Kernhaushalt auszulagern. Die bis zum Jahr 2009 bestehende deutsche Schuldenregel sah eine Ausnahme für Extrahaushalte vor und deshalb bestanden für den Bund und die Länder Anreize zur Verschuldung außerhalb ihrer Kernhaushalte. Ich gebe einen historischen Überblick der staatlichen Extrahaushalte seit Bestehen der Bundesrepublik Deutschland. Insbesondere die Gründung von Extrahaushalten zur Finanzierung der deutschen Wiedervereinigung und die Stützungsmaßnahmen für Banken infolge der Finanzkrise führten dazu, dass die staatliche Neuverschuldung in einigen Jahren deutlich höher ausfiel als die ausgewiesenen Defizite der Kernhaushalte. Ich diskutiere, inwieweit die neue deutsche Schuldenbremse die Staatsverschuldung in Extrahaushalten berücksichtigt und welche Gestaltungsmöglichkeiten der Bund und die Länder weiterhin zur Umgehung der erlaubten Kreditaufnahme über Extrahaushalte haben.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H74|Co-Partisan Buddies or Partisan Bullies? Why State Supervision of Local Government Borrowing Fails|In many federal countries, local governments run large deficits, even when supervision by state authorities is tight. I investigate whether party alignment of mayors and supervisors influences local government borrowing. The dataset includes 427 local German governments over the period 1999–2012. I exploit variation of a far-reaching institutional reform that entirely re-distributed political powers on both debt issuance and supervision. The results show that short-term deficits of local governments are not enabled by a vertical “buddy” relationship between a mayor and a supervisor affiliated with the same party (co-partisanship) but rather by an ideological “bully behavior” of partisan supervisors and supervisees: left-wing local governments issue more debt, while left-wing supervisory authorities tolerate more debt. These findings imply that political independence for state supervisory authorities is highly recommended.
H74|Decentralization in Colombia: Searching for social equity in a bumpy economic geography|Colombia’s decentralization was conceived to improve population’s access to social services, reduce poverty and equalize well-being across the territory. However, after more than 20 years of its implementation a big gap across municipalities still remains. This paper analyses the impact of the Colombia’s fiscal decentralization process over the achievement of social minimums as depicted by the average multidimensional gap and the multidimensional deprivation headcount. We implement an instrumental variable spatial autoregressive model with spatial autoregressive disturbances to take into consideration the spatial interrelated behaviour of deprivation in the Colombian context. This, while accounting for the endogeneity that arises when evaluating the impact of fiscal decentralization. We find strong statistically significant results across all the proven specifications that confirm causal diminishing effect of the share of own resources over multidimensional deprivation. Counterfactual scenarios of spatially differentiated decentralization policies highlight their grater effectiveness over geographically mute designs.
H74|Are elections debt brakes? Evidence from French municipalities|We show that voters are fiscal conservatives, although in the long run only: while the average (over the mandate) level of debt has a negative impact on the probability of reelection, pre-election debt accumulation by incumbents increases their probability of reelection. As the negative impact becomes larger as the debt level becomes higher, it compensates for the short run effect. Elections thus appear as a disciplining device, even if a weak one.
H74|The perfect finance minister: Whom to appoint as finance minister to balance the budget|The role and influence of the finance minister within the cabinet are discussed with increasing prominence in the theoretical literature on the political economy of budget deficits. It is generally assumed that the spending ministers can enhance their reputation purely with new or more extensive expenditure programs, whereas it is the sole interest of the finance minister to balance the budget. Using a dynamic panel model to study the development of public deficits, we test several personal characteristics of the finance ministers that could influence budgetary performance in the German states between 1960 and 2009. Her professional background, i.e., her field experience, seems to affect budget deficits but neither her individual preferences nor her education does. During times of fiscal stress, our results can guide prime ministers in the nomination of finance ministers in order to assure sound budgeting.
H74|Sub-national deficits in European countries: The impact of fiscal rules and tax autonomy|This paper empirically examines how fiscal rules and tax autonomy influence deficits of sub-national sectors across European countries. I use a new panel-data set to measure tax autonomy and the stringency of fiscal rules for EU15 regional and local government sectors over the period 1995 to 2008. I apply an instrumental variables approach to obtain an unbiased estimate of the impact of fiscal rules on deficits. I use political variables describing the central governments characteristics as instruments for fiscal rules at the sub-national level. The results show that the effectiveness of fiscal rules and tax autonomy depends on the constitutional structure. Fiscal rules decrease deficits only in unitary countries. Deficits of sub-national sectors in federations can be avoided through tax autonomy.
H74|Public Private Partnership Contracts Financing by Covered Bonds|The provision of public properties that generate income for the public sector, used as securitization in government bonds, is under consideration both from public and private sector during the last few years. The efficient exploitation of the long term contracts under Public Private Partnership schemes (either infrastructures or other real assets) that produce steady cash inflows can result to a lower cost of borrowing-funding for the State, by linking the efficiently priced future expected cash flows of PPPâ€™s, with a special form of sovereign covered bonds issued by the Government. This paper, after a review of covered bonds advantages and recent market developments, examines the major parameters that governmental authorities should review and assess in order to achieve optimal pricing from a market point of view of PPP contracts. Such parameters include Primary Objectives of the public sector, expectations about future developments in inflation, growth and interest rates, availability of government funding and key objectives about management of Public deficit and Public debt, as well as the pricing sensitivities of PPP contracts expected cash flows on some of these factors. Also the paper develops and assesses the possible uses of PPP contracts for the purposes of enhancing the credit quality of new Sovereign Covered Bonds (Linked with PPP contracts), together with the broader objective of efficiently mobilizing the Public assets portfolio in delivering to the State, efficiently priced and optimal Public services and under specific conditions, lower cost of funding or refinancing for the State, compared to the unsecured senior debt obligations of the Government. The standard market model of the public sector in pricing PPPâ€™s projects is extended and connected to optimization of quantitative objectives of the Public Sector in order to achieve specific targets under different assumptions about the underlying variables. Issues of legislation, marketability and liquidity of the proposed schemes as well as mutual benefits for the market participants are highlighted as well as market practices from the private sector covered bond market.
H74|Financial Innovations and Issuer Sophistication in Municipal Securities Markets|When local governments default or file for bankruptcy, it is often because public officials misunderstood the risks associated with innovative financial products. If unsophisticated municipal bond issuers were to widely adopt a high risk financial product, this could harm taxpayers and investors, as well as destabilize the financial system. This analysis uses municipal bond issuers’ total debt outstanding as a proxy for their sophistication and investigates the relationship between sophistication and adoption of financial innovations. Using comprehensive data on securities issued between 1992 and 2012, 25 innovations are identified. Products with these features were uncommon in the 1990s, and expanded their market share after 2000. The 600 issuers that back 75 percent of the outstanding debt adopted 21 innovations for a greater fraction of their new issuance, relative to the approximately 40,000 smaller market participants. When innovation-linked debt issuance is measured relative to annual expenditures, the mid-level jurisdictions adopted innovations to a significantly greater extent than either states and sophisticated jurisdictions or unsophisticated jurisdictions. The results suggest oversight should be concentrated on mid-level local governments where past innovations have made the greatest inroads.

H74|Who honor the rules of federalism? Party system nationalization and fiscal performance|This paper explores the impact of decentralization on countries’ fiscal outcomes paying attention to one aspect usually neglected in the literature: the relevance of self-interested local politics. Relevance that can be proxied by the nationalization of political party systems, namely the extent to which parties compete nationally oriented. Based on a sample of developed and developing countries over the period 1970-2011, our findings are twofold. First, fiscal decentralization has a positive effect on general governments' primary balance. Second, primary balance is negatively affected by the nationalization of party systems only when the latter is extremely weak.
H74|De la soutenabilité budgétaire des contrats de partenariat public-privé|Le rapport des sénateurs Sueur et Portelli établi au nom de la Commission des Lois du Sénat en juillet 2014 qualifie les PPP de bombes à retardement budgétaires suivant en ceci l'analyse jadis faite par Philippe Séguin alors Premier Président de la Cour des comptes qualifiant ces derniers de crédit revolving des collectivités. Cette communication vise à montrer de quelle façon les engagements liés aux contrats de PPP peuvent effectivement poser des problèmes en termes de soutenabilité budgétaire. Elle insiste notamment sur l'impact des garanties accordées à la société privée en charge de la réalisation du PPP, lesquelles ne sont que très imparfaitement reconnues dans la comptabilité d'engagements des personnes publiques concernées et ne font pas l'objet d'études d'impact budgétaire suffisamment approfondies.
H74|Vertical fiscal imbalances and the accumulation of government debt|The implications of delegating fiscal decision making power to sub-national governments has become an area of significant interest over the past two decades, in the expectation that these reforms will lead to better and more efficient provision of public goods and services. The move towards decentralization has, however, not been homogeneously implemented on the revenue and expenditure side: decentralization has materialized more substantially on the latter than on the former, creating vertical fiscal imbalances. These imbalances measure the extent to which sub-national governments' expenditures are financed through their own revenues. This mismatch between own revenues and expenditures may have negative consequences for public finances performance, for example by softening the budget constraint of sub-national governments. Using a large sample of countries covering a long time period from the IMF's Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, this paper is the first to examine the effects of vertical fiscal imbalances on fiscal performance through the accumulation of government debt. Our findings suggest that vertical fiscal imbalances are indeed relevant in explaining government debt accumulation, and call for a degree of caution when promoting fiscal decentralization.
H74|Determinants of local governments'­ reelection: New evidence based on a Bayesian approach|This paper analyzes the effect of public spending on the probability of municipal reelection of Spanish local governments during the 2000-2007 period, using Bayesian techniques. The results indicate that, in general, increases in local government spending positively impact on the chances of reelection of local governments. Moreover, the capital expenditure over the whole period affects positively to the reelection probability, although the pre-electoral one is preferred, and the electorate rewards increases in current expenditures only in the period before elections. The use of Bayesian techniques is particularly interesting, since results are not boiled down to a summary effect such as the average; on the contrary, it shows exactly how a given covariate affects the probability of being reelected.
H74|Public debts capitalize into property prices: empirical evidence for a new perspective on debt incidence|In economies with reasonably mobile individuals, the demand for property depends on current as well as future taxes and public services. As a consequence, the current level of public net debts, i.e. public debts minus assets, should capitalize into property prices. While debt capitalization has been unduly disregarded in the academic literature and policy debates, the Swiss Canton of Zurich provides an institutional setting for identification. Our results imply that public net debts capitalize into property prices. The extent of debt capitalization seems to be substantial but it widely varies over estimation strategies. The existence of debt capitalization offers new perspectives on debt incidence. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014
H74|Who Pays for Public Employee Health Costs?|We analyze the incidence of public-employee health benefits. Because these benefits are negotiated through the political process, relevant labor market institutions deviate significantly from the competitive, private-sector benchmark. Empirically, we find that roughly 15 percent of the cost of recent benefit growth was passed onto school district employees through reductions in wages and salaries. Strong teachers' unions were associated with relatively strong linkages between benefit growth and growth in total compensation. We further find that when economic conditions are poor, straining public budgets, benefit growth is more readily shifted back to public employees. Our analysis is consistent with the view that the costs of public workers' benefits are difficult to monitor, contributing to benefit oriented, and often under-funded, compensation schemes.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
