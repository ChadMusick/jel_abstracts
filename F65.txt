F65|Capital Inflows, Equity Issuance Activity, and Corporate Investment|This paper uses issuance-level data to study how equity capital inflows that enter emerging market economies affect equity issuance and corporate investment. It shows that foreign inflows are strongly correlated with country-level issuance. The relation especially reflects the behavior of large firms. To identify supply-side shocks, capital inflows into each country are instrumented with exogenous changes in other countriesâ€™ attractiveness to foreign investors. Shifts in the supply of foreign capital are important drivers of increased equity inflows. Instrumented contemporaneous and lagged capital inflows lead large firms to raise new equity, which they use to fund investment.
F65|FDI, banking crises and growth: direct and spill over effects|"This study suggests a new decomposition of the effect of foreign direct investment (FDI) on the long-term growth of developing countries. It reveals that FDI not only has a direct positive effect on growth, but also increases it by reducing the recessionary effect resulting from a banking crisis. However, these advantages are conditioned by the FDI threshold, which in turn depends on the ""absorption capacity"" of the host country. JEL: F65, F36, G01, G15"
F65|The China syndrome affects banks: the credit supply channel of foreign import competition|We study the effect of rising Chinese import competition in the early 2000s on banks’ credit supply policies. Using bank-firm-level data on the universe of Spanish corporate loans, we exploit heterogeneity across banks in the exposure of their loan portfolios towards firms competing with Chinese imports. Exposed banks rebalanced their loan portfolios by cutting the supply of credit to firms affected by Chinese competition, while raising their lending towards non-exposed sectors. This portfolio reallocation depressed further the economic activity of firms competing with Chinese imports
F65|Bank foreign currency funding and currency markets: the case of Mexico post GFC|This paper examines the impact of foreign currency hedging demand on the foreign exchange market. First, the paper documents deviations from covered interest parity (CIP) for Mexico after the global financial crisis (GFC), and then it evaluates the effect of two variables in a regression-based analysis: (i) the FX funding gap of domestic bank balance sheets and (ii) external foreign currency hedging demand. The main result is that both variables directly influenced CIP deviations in Mexico, and it was robust to including arbitrage funding and foreign exchange transaction costs in the regression. These results suggest hedging demand can be an important factor in emerging economies’ foreign exchange forward markets, even at short maturities. One of the implications is that banks’ ability to manage the currency mismatch is affected by global shocks in the foreign currency market.
F65|Interest rate spillovers from the United States: expectations, term premia and macro-financial vulnerabilities|We analyse how movements in the components of sovereign bond yields in the United States affect long-term rates in 10 advanced and 21 emerging economies. The paper documents significant global spillovers from both the expectations and term premia components of long-term rates in the United States. We find that spillovers to domestic long-term rates in emerging economies from the US expectations components tend to be more sizeable than those from the US term premia. Finally, spillovers from US term premia are larger when an emerging economy displays greater macro-financial vulnerabilities.
F65|Foreign competition and the durability of US firm investments|How does the exposure to product market competition affect the investment horizon of firms? We study if firms have an incentive to shift investments toward more short‐term assets when exposed to tougher competition. Based on a stylized firm investment model, we derive a within‐firm estimator using variation across investments with different durabilities. Exploiting the Chinese World Trade Organization (WTO) accession, we estimate the effects of product market competition on the composition of US firm investments. Firms that experienced tougher competition shifted their expenditures toward investments with a shorter durability. This effect is larger for firms with lower total factor productivity.
F65|Trade Shocks and Credit Reallocation|The effect of trade liberalization on welfare and economic activity remains one of the most important questions in economics. The literature identifies a number of key determinants that reduce the potential gains from trade, by focusing on frictions to labor mobility across regions or sectors. This paper contributes to this debate by exploring a novel channel, namely the reallocation of credit in the aftermath of a trade shock. We find that there are endogenous financial frictions that arise from trade liberalization and spillovers between losers and winners from trade that go through banks, as banks can be negatively affected by a trade shock through the portfolio of firms they lend to. Using data from the Italian credit registry, matched with bank and firm level data, we follow the evolution of bank and firm activities prior to and after the entry of China into the WTO. We identify the sectors most affected by import competition from China and estimate the transmission of this trade shock from firms to their lending banks, and the consequence of the shock on banks' lending to other firms. We find that, controlling for credit demand, banks exposed to the China shock decrease their lending relative to non-exposed banks. Importantly, this lending is reduced both for firms exposed to competition from China and to those that are not and that we should expect to expand. The main mechanism is related to the reduction of the core capital of banks, and their resulting funding capacity, through the rise of non-performing loans. We quantify the impact of this effect on real outcomes such as employment, investment, and output and we find relevant aggregate implications. These findings provide evidence that following a trade shock, bank lending has a key impact on the reallocation channel and on the potential gains from trade.
F65|Fiscal multipliers and foreign holdings of public debt|This paper explores a natural connection between fiscal multipliers and foreign holdings of public debt. Although fiscal expansions can raise domestic economic activity through various channels, they can also have crowding-out effects if the resources used to acquire public debt reduce domestic consumption and investment. Thus, these crowding-out effects are likely to be weaker when public debt is purchased by foreigners. We test this hypothesis on (i) post-war US data and (ii) data for a panel of 17 advanced economies from the 1980’s to the present. To do so, we assemble a novel database of public debt holdings by domestic and foreign creditors for a large set of advanced economies. We combine this data with standard measures of fiscal policy shocks and show that, indeed, the size of fiscal multipliers is increasing in the share of public debt held by foreigners. In particular, the fiscal multiplier is smaller than one when the foreign share is low, such as in the U.S. in the 1950’s and 1960’s and Japan today, and larger than one when the foreign share is high, such as in the U.S. and Ireland today
F65|Corporate Financial Distress of Industry Level Listings in an Emerging Market|Any critical analysis of the corporate financial distress of listed firms in international exchange would be incomplete without a serious dissection at the industry level because of the different levels of risks concerned. This paper considers the financial distress of listed firms at the industry level in Vietnam over the last decade. Two periods are considered, namely during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) (2007 - 2009) and post-GFC (2010 - 2017). The logit regression technique is used to estimate alternative models based on accounting and market factors. The paper also extends the analysis to include selected macroeconomic factors that are expected to affect the corporate financial distress of listed firms at the industry level in Vietnam. The empirical findings confirm that the corporate financial distress prediction model, which includes accounting factors with macroeconomic indicators, performs much better than alternative models. In addition, the evidence confirms that the GFC had a damaging impact on each sector, with the Health & Education sector demonstrating the most impressive recovery post-GFC, and the Utilities sector recording a dramatic increase in bankruptcies post-GFC.
F65|R* and the Global Economy|This paper provides a synthesis of explanations for why the natural rate of interest, r*, has fallen over the last several decades. Demographic factors, declining productivity, slower output growth, and increasing inequality likely all have been important factors. Perhaps less recognized is the role of increasing global demand for safe assets, particularly by foreign investors. Suggestive empirical evidence is presented showing that foreign demand for U.S. safe assets, particularly government-provided assets, has increased dramatically, and may now be playing a much larger role in the determination of U.S. interest rates than in the past. In addition, the buildup before the 2007-2009 financial crisis of quasi-government and privately-supplied safe assets, held by both domestic and foreign investors, rendered the financial system more vulnerable to shocks that adversely affected the perceived degree of “safeness” they provided.
F65|Complexity of Global Banks and their Foreign Operation in Hong Kong|This paper studies the relation between the complexity of global banking organizations and their foreign banking operations (FBOs) in Hong Kong. Our empirical evidence indicates that the complexity of the parent company has significant effects on their Hong Kong branch’s business model, liquidity management, risk-taking, and profitability. The more complex the global banking organizations, their Hong Kong FBOs are more likely to derive a larger share of revenues from fee-based activities, and incur a higher cost of production despite enjoying a funding cost advantage. Notwithstanding the FBOs in Hong Kong may serve as a funding hub for its parent company, FBOs of more complex global banks tend to hold more liquid assets. While our empirical evidence suggests that the complexity of global banks has significant effects on FBOs risk-taking and profitability, the relation depends on how complexity is measured. For example, both the BCBS complexity score and the measure of geographic complexity are significant in explaining FBO profitability, but they have different signs. Likewise, geographic complexity and scope complexity are often found to have significantly different effects on FBOs performance. Taken together, the concept of global bank complexity has multiple dimensions, where different facets could have qualitatively different effects on FBOs in Hong Kong.
F65|Corporate Yields and Sovereign Yields|We document that positive association between corporate and sovereign cost of funds borrowed on global capital markets weakens during periods of unusually high sovereign yields, when corporate borrowers are able to issue debt that is priced at lower rates than sovereign debt. This state-dependent sensitivity of corporate yields to sovereign yields has not been previously documented in the literature. We demonstrate that this stylized fact is observed across countries and industries as well as for a given borrower over time and is not explained by a different composition of borrowers issuing debt during periods of high sovereign yields or by the relationship between corporate and sovereign credit ratings. We show that even if we exclude high-yield episodes that accompany financial crises and IMF programs, the sensitivity of corporate yields to sovereign yields is lower when sovereign yields are high. We propose a simple information model that rationalizes our empirical observations: when sovereign yields are high and more volatile, corporate yields are less sensitive to sovereign yields.
F65|Subordinate financialization in emerging capitalist economies|In the explosion of literature on financialization, there is a much smaller but growing interest in what the phenomenon means for emerging capitalist economies (ECEs). We hold that for agents located in ECEs, the encounter with financialization is from a subordinate position: first, in relation to global production, ECE firms occupy subordinate locations in global production networks, providing cheap labor and raw, or at best, intermediate inputs; Second, in relation to global finance, ECEs are structurally subordinated to ACEs, that is, both trade and the most liquid capital markets are denominated in the currency of ACEs. Subordination in production means firms based in ECEs are able to capture less of the value created than firms higher in the hierarchy and must pay more to hedge macroeconomic risk. In circulation, strategies may emerge in ACEs wherein increased household indebtedness and/or asset market inflation maintain aggregate demand. In finance, ECEs’ subordinate position in relation to money and capital markets means that capital inflows are predominantly short-term, seeking financial yields rather than assuming productive risk. The results are continued volatility, external vulnerability and subordination to the currencies of the ACEs, which themselves serve to further deepen domestic financialization. We conclude that, while by no means pre-destined, financialization as experienced in ECEs may serve to further cement their subordinate position in the global structure.
F65|The impact of financialisation on the wage share: a theoretical clarification and empirical test|It is frequently asserted that financialisation has contributed to the decline in the wage share. This paper provides a theoretical clarification and a systematic empirical investigation. We identify four channels through which financialisation can affect the wage share: (1) enhanced exit options of firms; (2) rising price mark-ups due to financial overhead costs for businesses; (3) increased competition on capital markets and shareholder value orientation; and (4) the role of household debt in increasing workers’ financial vulnerability and undermining their class consciousness. The paper compiles a comprehensive set of empirical measures of financialisation and uses it to test these hypotheses with a panel regression of 14 OECD countries over the 1992-2014 period. We find strong evidence for negative effects of financial liberalisation and financial payments of non-financial corporations on the wage share that are in the same order of magnitude as the effects of globalisation.
F65|Boom - Bust Capital Flow Cycles|This paper examines the new trends in research on capital flows fueled by the 2007-2009 Global Crisis. Previous studies on capital flows focused on current-account imbalances and net capital flows. The Global Crisis changed that. The onset of this crisis was preceded by a dramatic increase in gross financial flows while net capital flows remained mostly subdued. The attention in academia zoomed in on gross inflows and outflows with special attention to cross border banking flows before the crisis erupted and the shift towards corporate bond issuance in its aftermath. The boom and bust in capital flows around the Global Crisis also stimulated a new area of research: capturing the â€œglobal factor.â€ This research adopts two different approaches. The traditional literature on the push-pull factors, which before the crisis was mostly focused on monetary policy in the financial center as the â€œpush factor,â€ started to explore what other factors contribute to the comovement of capital flows as well as to amplify the role of monetary policy in the financial center on capital flows to the periphery. This new research focuses on global banksâ€™ leverage, risk appetite, and global uncertainty. Since the â€œglobal factorâ€ is not known, a second branch of the literature has captured this factor indirectly using dynamic common factors extracted from actual capital flows or movements in asset prices.
F65|FDI, banking crisis and growth: direct and spill over effects|This study suggests a new decomposition of the effect of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) on long-term growth in developing countries. It reveals that FDI not only have a positive direct effect on growth, but also increase the latter by reducing the recessionary effect resulting from a banking crisis. Even more, they reduce its occurrence. JEL: F65, F36, G01, G15
F65|External debt financing and macroeconomic instability in emerging market economies|We study the relationship between external debt financing and risk to macroeconomic stability using a panel vector autoregression model for a sample of ten major emerging market economies. We also focus on the linkages of key channels of external debt financing, namely external debt securities and cross-border loans. We find that external debt securities substantially impact the yield spread and the exchange rate for emerging market economies, both before and after the global financial crisis of 2008. On the other hand, the impact of cross-border flows is found to be relatively subdued for these economies in the post-crisis period. We also find that emerging economies that were already receiving a high level of external debt securities inflows experienced a relatively larger yield compression and greater exchange rate pressure compared to the economies that had a low level of external debt securities flows. It indicates higher risk exposure for EMEs with larger external debt securities flows.
F65|Crises and emissions: New empirical evidence from a large sample|In this paper, we empirically assess by means of the local projection method, the impact of different types of financial crises on a variety of pollutant emissions categories for a sample of 86 countries between 1980 and 2012. We find that financial crises in general lead to a fall in CO2 and methane emissions. When hit by a debt crisis, a country experiences a rise in emissions stemming from either energy related activities or industrial processes. During periods of slack, financial crises in general had a positive impact on both methane and nitrous oxide emissions. If a financial crisis hit an economy when it was engaging in contractionary fiscal policies, this led to a negative response of CO2 and production-based emissions.
F65|Defaultnomics: Making Sense of the Barro-Ricardo Equivalence in a Financialized World|The 2008 crisis created a need to rethink many aspects of economic theory, including the role of public intervention in the economy. On this issue, we explore the Barro-Ricardo equivalence, which has played a decisive role in molding the economic policies that fostered the crisis. We analyze the equivalence and its theoretical underpinnings, concluding that: (1) it declares, but then forgets, that it does not matter whether the nature of debt and investment is public or private; (2) its most problematic assumption is the representative agent hypothesis, which does not allow for an explanation of financialization and cannot assess dangers coming from high levels of financial leverage; (3) social wealth cannot be based on any micro-foundation and is linked to the role of the state as provider of financial stability; and (4) default is always the optimal policy for the government, and this remains true even when relaxing many equivalence assumptions. We go on to discuss possible solutions to high levels of public debt in the real world, inferring that no general conclusions are possible and every solution or mix of solutions must be tailored to each specific case. We conclude by connecting different solutions to the political balance of forces in the current era of financialization, using Italy (and, by extension, the eurozone) as a concrete example to better illustrate the discussion.
F65|Evolving International Monetary and Financial Architecture and the Development Challenge: A Liquidity Preference Theoretical Perspective|This paper investigates the peculiar macroeconomic policy challenges faced by emerging economies in today's monetary (non)order and globalized finance. It reviews the evolution of the international monetary and financial architecture against the background of Keynes's original Bretton Woods vision, highlighting the US dollar's hegemonic status. Keynes's liquidity preference theory informs the analysis of the loss of policy space and widespread instabilities in emerging economies that are the consequence of financial hyperglobalization. While any benefits promised by mainstream promoters remain elusive, heightened vulnerabilities have emerged in the aftermath of the global crisis.
F65|Boom-Bust Capital Flow Cycles|This paper examines the new trends in research on capital flows fueled by the 2007-2009 Global Crisis. Previous studies on capital flows focused on current-account imbalances and net capital flows. The Global Crisis changed that. The onset of this crisis was preceded by a dramatic increase in gross financial flows while net capital flows remained mostly subdued. The attention in academia zoomed in on gross inflows and outflows with special attention to cross border banking flows before the crisis erupted and the shift towards corporate bond issuance in its aftermath. The boom and bust in capital flows around the Global Crisis also stimulated a new area of research: capturing the “global factor.” This research adopts two different approaches. The traditional literature on the push-pull factors, which before the crisis was mostly focused on monetary policy in the financial center as the “push factor,” started to explore what other factors contribute to the comovement of capital flows as well as to amplify the role of monetary policy in the financial center on capital flows to the periphery. This new research focuses on global banks’ leverage, risk appetite, and global uncertainty. Since the “global factor” is not known, a second branch of the literature has captured this factor indirectly using dynamic common factors extracted from actual capital flows or movements in asset prices.
F65|Search for Yield in Large International Corporate Bonds : Investor Behavior and Firm Responses|"Emerging market corporations have significantly increased their borrowing in international markets since 2008. This paper shows that this increase was driven by large-denomination bond issuances, most of them with face value of US$500 million. Large issuances are eligible for inclusion in international market indexes, which attract institutional investors. Emerging market firms were able to cut their cost of funds by roughly 100 basis points by issuing large-denomination bonds. Firms face a tradeoff: issue large, index-eligible bonds to borrow at a lower cost (about 100 basis points) but pay the expense of hoarding cash. Because of the""size yield discount,""many companies issued index-eligible bonds, increasing their cash holdings. The willingness to issue large bonds and hoard cash was greater for firms in countries with high carry trade opportunities. These post-2008 behaviors reflected a search for yield by institutional investors into higher-risk securities and are not apparent in developed economies."
F65|Blended Finance Funds and Facilities: 2018 Survey Results|The OECD Survey on Blended Finance Funds and Facilities represents a major step forward to consolidate evidence and provide further policy guidance in support of the OECD DAC Blended Finance Principles, whose focus is unlocking commercial finance for the Sustainable Development Goals.This working paper presents findings from the 2018 survey edition relating to the management, capital structure, investment strategy and portfolio allocation of the surveyed blended finance funds and facilities. The quantitative analysis is complemented by the OECD statistics on private finance mobilised by official development interventions and by information provided by Convergence. It will be followed by another OECD Development Co-operation working paper discussing the development strategy, performance tracking and evaluation approach.The 180 responses received illustrate to what extent blended finance funds and facilities vary widely in characteristics and functioning. Collectively, the managing organisations reported over USD 60.2 billion invested in 111 developing countries at the end of 2017. This new evidence confirms trends observed on the broader blended finance market (priority sectors, geographical coverage, targeted SDGs), while shedding light on additional aspects (e.g. investors, clients and investment instruments).
F65|Role of Credit Reference Bureau On Financial Intermediation: Evidence from The Commercial Banks in Kenya|This study discusses the role of the Credit Reference Bureau on financial intermediation among the commercial banks in Kenya. The study uses a descriptive survey research design. The study population consists of all the 45 commercial banks licensed by the central bank of Kenya under the banking act as at 31st May 2019. The study adopts a census population approach to study all the banks. The study uses secondary data collected from annual supervision reports of CBK, and the respective bank's audited accounts relate to the total loans, total non-performing loans, and interest earned on investments. Also, the credit reports done annually by reference bureaus were used to obtain data for the period between 2010 and 2018. Quantitative data collect was analyzed using the latest SPSS software, version 22.0. The study applies both descriptive and inferential statistics. Results generated are then presented in tables and explanations given in prose. Inferential statistics included the Pearson correlation analysis and Correlational relationships among the number of loans offered defaulted loans and the interest earnings on loans by commercial banks bank in Kenya. Linear regression analysis was conducted to establish the significance of the variables. ANOVA was used to test the relationship between independent variables and dependent variable. The Chi-Square test was also performed. Both the mean of the study and the mean before the introduction of CRB were used to check if there is a statistical difference between the means. The study establishes that credit reference bureau checks have a role in the financial intermediation (non-performing loans) in commercial banks in Kenya. Further, the study found that non-performing loans have a negative correlation with credit reference bureau checks. It can, therefore, be concluded that a relationship exists between credit reference bureau information and the level of financial intermediation as shown through non-performing loans in Kenya commercial banks.
F65|Explaining Monetary Spillovers: The Matrix Reloaded|This paper examines whether euro area unconventional monetary policies have affected the loss-absorbing buffers (that is the resilience) of the banking industry. We employ various measures to capture the effect of the broad array of programmes used by the ECB to implement balance sheet policies, while we control for the effect of conventional and negative (or very low) interest rate policy. The results suggest that, above and away from the zero-lower bound, looser interest rate policy tends to weaken our measure of euro area banks' loss-absorbing buffers. On the contrary, further lowering interest rates near and below the zero lower bound seems to strengthen (or weaken less) such buffers, which points towards non-linearities arising in the vicinity of the lower bound. Moreover, balance sheet easing policies enhance bank level resilience overall. However, unconventional monetary policies seem to have increased the fragility of banks in the member states hardest hit by the 2011 sovereign debt crisis. In fact, the evidence presented in this paper suggest that the resilience gains of unconventional monetary policies have accrued mostly to banks headquartered in the so-called core euro area countries (Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg and Netherlands). Finally, unconventional monetary policies seem to have enhanced more the resilience of banks that were relatively stronger, i.e. that were in the higher deciles of the distribution of loss-absorbing buffers.
F65|Digitalization and Firm Performance in Thailand: Evidence from Firm Dividend Payout Policy|Digitalization has continuously transformed economy in the global landscape, including developing countries in ASEAN region. Accordingly, Thailand has established a framework for digital economy development alongside with the ?Thailand 4.0? policy to enhance the country competitiveness. As part of this initiative, healthcare services are profoundly promoted and aimed to be Asia?s capital of health and wellness, as well as a number of digital projects are initiated to drive forward this digitalization. Consequently, businesses in both ICT and healthcare sector should be beneficial from this policy, and should reveal in their financial performance. In corporate finance, firm?s dividend decision could provide useful information about firm performance, and might be taken into consideration when making their investment decision. This paper examines the relationship between dividend per share and financial performance using panel data from Thailand listed firms in ICT and healthcare sectors during the period 2009-2018. In order to investigate such relationship, return on asset (ROA) is a proxy for firm financial performance while firm size, asset tangibility and leverage are treated as controlled variables. Regression results confirms the differences of such relationship between the two sectors. In ICT sector, both firm size and dividend per share shows positive and significant relationship to the firm performance, which provide evidence in support of both Signaling and Bird-in-hand hypotheses of dividend policy theory. Contrary, there is no clear evidence from firms in the Healthcare sector, whose financial performance only depends significantly on asset tangibility but not on dividend.
F65|Reforms’ Effects on Chinese stock markets world integration - An Empirical analysis with t-DCCGARCH model|In recent years the Chinese government has instituted a series of reforms to restructure and open the Chinese financial system. This paper studies the dynamic correlations and sensitivities between Chinese mainland stock market and five major stock markets with the multivariate t-DCC-GARCH model. We also consider a Normal-DCC model and results show that t-DCC improves slightly the results. The analysis of reforms’ effects on dynamic correlations and sensitivities prove that the Chinese mainland market is more closely tied to Asian stock markets over time, followed by the United States, and with relatively lower correlations with Europe and the United Kingdom. We highlight that the implementation of reforms changes theirs correlations and sensitivities over time. Since the reforms, the correlation between China and international stock markets has been reinforced.
F65|Search for Yield in Large International Corporate Bonds: Investor Behavior and Firm Responses|Emerging market corporations have significantly increased their borrowing in international markets since 2008. We show that this increase was driven by large-denomination bond issuances, most of them with face value of exactly US$500 million. Large issuances are eligible for inclusion in important international market indexes. These bonds appeal to institutional investors because they are more liquid and facilitate targeting market benchmarks. We find that the rewards of issuing index-eligible bonds rose drastically after 2008. Emerging market firms were able to cut their cost of funds by roughly 100 basis points by issuing bonds with a face value equal to or greater than US$500 million relative to smaller bonds. Firms contemplating whether to take advantage of this cost saving face a tradeoff: they can benefit from the lower yields associated with large, index-eligible bonds, but they pay the potential cost of having to hoard low-yielding cash assets if their investment opportunities are less than US$500 million. Because of the post-2008 “size yield discount,” many companies issued index-eligible bonds, while substantially increasing their cash holdings. The willingness to issue large bonds and hoard cash was greater for firms in countries with high carry trade opportunities that reduced the cost of holding cash. We present evidence suggesting that these post-2008 behaviors reflected a search for yield by institutional investors into higher-risk securities. These patterns are not apparent in the issuance of investment grade bonds by firms in developed economies.
F65|Global financial cycles since 1880|We analyze cyclical co-movement in credit, house prices, equity prices, and long-term interest rates across 17 advanced economies. Using a time-varying multi-level dynamic factor model and more than 130 years of data, we analyze the dynamics of co-movement at different levels of aggregation and compare recent developments to earlier episodes such as the early era of financial globalization from 1880 to 1913 and the Great Depression. We find that joint global dynamics across various financial quantities and prices as well as variable-specific global co-movements are important to explain fluctuations in the data. From a historical perspective, global co-movement in financial variables is not a new phenomenon, but its importance has increased for some variables since the 1980s. For equity prices, global cycles play currently a historically unprecedented role, explaining more than half of the fluctuations in the data. Global cycles in credit and housing have become much more pronounced and longer, but their importance in explaining dynamics has only increased for some economies including the US, the UK and Nordic European countries. We also include GDP in the analysis and find an increasing role for a global business cycle.

F65|China's Overseas Lending|"Compared with China's dominance in world trade, its expanding role in global finance is poorly documented and understood. Over the past decades, China has exported record amounts of capital to the rest of the world. Many of these financial flows are not reported to the IMF, the BIS or the World Bank. ""Hidden debts"" to China are especially significant for about three dozen developing countries, and distort the risk assessment in both policy surveillance and the market pricing of sovereign debt. We establish the size, destination, and characteristics of China's overseas lending. We identify three key distinguishing features. First, almost all of China's lending and investment abroad is official. As a result, the standard ""push"" and ""pull"" drivers of private cross-border flows do not play the same role in this case. Second, the documentation of China's capital exports is (at best) opaque. China does not report on its official lending and there is no comprehensive standardized data on Chinese overseas debt stocks and flows. Third, the type of flows is tailored by recipient. Advanced and higher middle-income countries tend to receive portfolio debt flows, via sovereign bond purchases of the People's Bank of China. Lower income developing economies mostly receive direct loans from China's state-owned banks, often at market rates and backed by collateral such as oil. Our new dataset covers a total of 1,974 Chinese loans and 2,947 Chinese grants to 152 countries from 1949 to 2017. We find that about one half of China's overseas loans to the developing world are ""hidden""."
F65|Corporate borrowing and debt maturity : the effects of market access and crises|This paper studies how access to different markets and crises impact debt financing and maturity. Using data on worldwide corporate issuance activity in domestic and international bond and syndicated loan markets during 1991-2014, the paper shows that these markets are affected differently by crises, while providing financing to different firms at distinct maturities. During the global financial crisis and domestic banking crises, large firms moved away from the crisis-hit markets toward less affected, longer-term ones, switching their financing sources. Hence, firms that switched markets compensated for the financing shocks and maintained, or increased, their borrowing maturity. Country-level maturities also remained stable or even lengthened. However, firms that did not move across markets typically experienced declining financing and shorter borrowing maturities. Firm movements across markets are consistent with credit tightening during crises due to supply-side shocks, significantly affecting debt composition, borrowing maturity, and credit redistribution across firms of different sizes.
F65|Looking through cross-border positions in investment funds: evidence from Italy|Motivated by the increasingly large weight of foreign investment funds on the portfolio of Italian residents, this paper provides an estimate of the composition, by instrument and by issuer country, of Italy’s portfolio assets after “looking through” cross-border positions in investment funds. Our main findings suggest that removing the statistical opacity arising from cross-border positions in investment funds has a significant impact on the composition of Italy’s portfolio investments. After “looking through” foreign funds’ holdings, the share of debt securities on portfolio assets, which is equal to 40 per cent in the unadjusted data, rises to 75 per cent. The country composition of external portfolio assets also fundamentally changes in the direction of increasing its geographical diversification. The United States becomes Italy’s main destination country; the shares of France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain also increase, while that of Luxembourg, where most of the foreign investment funds are domiciled, drastically falls.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F65|Financial development and FDI flows: evidence from advanced economies|Foreign direct investment (FDI) has grown dramatically as a major form of international capital transfer over the past decades. This rapid growth in cross border investment has to a large part been due to the reduction in trade and investment barriers, the harmonization and mutual recognition of regulation and the removal of domestic impediments through reform and privatization (see OECD, 2001). Amongst the numerous FDI determinants studied in the literature, the development and depth of the financial sector has gained importance during the last decade. According to the Paradox of Finance hypothesis, despite the fact that Multinational Corporations (MNCs) are not locally financially constrained their affiliates interact significantly with the domestic financial system. Hence, a deep and efficient financial system should act as a pull factor for FDI flows. Using up-to-date FDI data for advanced and emerging economies, this research explores the role of previously unavailable financial variables in attracting FDI flows. The results show that fostering an efficient financial sector with diversified funding sources for enterprises contributes to increased participation by Multinational Corporations in the host economy. This insightful policy implication for advanced economies is that the restructuring of the financial system can contribute to economic recovery through the FDI channel as well. Finally, the results highlight the importance for the full implementation of the Banking Union and the Capital Markets Union in the EU.
F65|Understanding International Long-Term Interest Rate Comovement|Long-term interest rates of small open economies correlate strongly with the US long-term rate. Can central banks in those countries decouple from the US? An estimated DSGE model for the UK (vis-`a-vis the US) establishes three structural empirical results. (1) Comovement arises due to nominal fluctuations, not through real rates or term premia. (2) The cause of comovement is the central bank of the small open economy accommodating foreign inflation trends, rather than systematically curbing them. (3) Small open economies may find themselves much more affected by changes in US inflation trends than the US itself.

F65|Inequality Aversion, Populism, and the Backlash Against Globalization|Motivated by the recent rise of populism in western democracies, we develop a model in which a populist backlash emerges endogenously in a growing economy. In the model, voters dislike inequality, especially the high consumption of “elites.” Economic growth exacerbates inequality due to heterogeneity in risk aversion. In response to rising inequality, rich-country voters optimally elect a populist promising to end globalization. Countries with more inequality, higher financial development, and trade deficits are more vulnerable to populism, both in the model and in the data. Evidence on who voted for Brexit and Trump in 2016 also supports the model.
F65|A quantitative analysis of the size of IMF resources|In this report, three methodological approaches are applied to assess the size of the International Monetary Fund: benchmarking Fund resources against a number of relevant global economic and financial indicators; an extrapolation of past and current IMF programme characteristics; and a shock scenario analysis. Overall, while the results of the different approaches depend on the assumptions and the timeframe considered, the quantitative analysis indicates that a prudent approach would call for maintaining Fund total resources at their current levels. Yet, the quantitative analysis of the size of the Fund made in this report should be seen only as one element to assess the adequacy of Fund resources. It does not take into account qualitative considerations, such as the increased resilience of the global economy and the efforts made to strengthen regulation and supervision since the financial crisis, which should complement the quantitative analysis to complete the analytical basis for decision makers. Moreover, the final decision on the appropriate size of Fund resources will need to include political judgement. Therefore, this report does not provide recommendations on the appropriate level of IMF resources after the expiration of borrowed resources. JEL Classification: F3, F32, F38, F42, F65, G28
F65|Cross-country linkages and spill-overs in early warning models for financial crises|This paper uses data on bilateral foreign exposures of domestic banking systems in order to construct early warning models for financial crises that take into account cross-country spill-overs of vulnerabilities. The empirical results show that incorporating cross-country financial linkages can improve the signalling performance of early warning models. The relative usefulness increases from 65% to 87% and the AUROC from 0.89 to 0.97 when weighted foreign variables are added to domestic variables in a multivariate logit early warning model. The findings of the paper also suggest that global variables still play a role in predicting financial crises, even when foreign variables are controlled for, which could suggest that both cross-country spill-overs and contagion are important factors for driving financial crises. A parsimonious model with nine variables that combines domestic, foreign and global variables yields an out-of-sample relative usefulness of 0.82 with Type I and Type II errors of 0.11 and 0.07.

F65|The global effects of global risk and uncertainty|In this paper, we analyse the effects of a shock to global financial uncertainty and risk aversion on real economic activity. To this end, we extract a global factor, which explains approximately 40% of the variance of about 1000 risky asset returns from around the world. We then study how shocks to the factor affect economic activity in 36 advanced and emerging small open economies by estimating local projections in a panel regression framework. We find the output responses to be quite heterogeneous across countries but, in general, negative and persistent. Furthermore, the effects of shocks to the global factor are stronger in countries with a higher degree of trade and/or financial openness, as well as in countries with higher levels of external debt, less developed financial sectors, and higher risk rating.

F65|Financial Credit Risk Evaluation Based on Core Enterprise Supply Chains|Supply chain finance has broken through traditional credit modes and advanced rapidly as a creative financial business discipline. Core enterprises have played a critical role in the credit enhancement of supply chain finance. Through the analysis of core enterprise credit risks in supply chain finance, by means of a ‘fuzzy analytical hierarchy process’ (FAHP), the paper constructs a supply chain financial credit risk evaluation system, making quantitative measurements and evaluation of core enterprise credit risk. This enables enterprises to take measures to control credit risk, thereby promoting the healthy development of supply chain finance. The examination of core enterprise supply chains suggests that a unified information file should be collected based on the core enterprise, including the operating conditions, asset status, industry status, credit record, effective information to the database, collecting related data upstream and downstream of the archives around the core enterprise, developing a data information system, electronic data information, and updating the database accurately using the latest information that might be available. Moreover, supply chain finance and modern information technology should be integrated to establish the sharing of information resources and realize the exchange of information flows, capital flows, and logistics between banks. This should reduce a variety of risks and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of supply chain finance.
F65|Financial Inclusion And Macroeconomic Stability In Emerging And Frontier Markets|Financial inclusion, being considered as a key enabler to reducing poverty and boosting prosperity in emerging and frontier markets such as Vietnam, is the process in which individuals and small businesses are provided with an access to useful and affordable financial products and services. The extant literature on the empirical evidence regarding the contribution of financial inclusion to macroeconomic stability is mixed. This paper investigates the linkages between financial inclusion and macroeconomic stability, which has not yet been thoroughly examined in the literature, for 22 emerging and frontier economies from 2008 to 2015, with particular focus on a potential optimal level. Using the panel threshold estimation technique, the empirical findings show that financial inclusion, as approximated by the growth rate in the number of bank branches over 100,000 account holders, is found to enhance financial stability under a certain threshold. Financial inclusion is also found to be of benefit to maintaining stable inflation and output growth. Policy implications are also discussed on the basis of the important empirical findings.
F65|Global trade finance, trade collapse and trade slowdown: a Granger causality analysis|This research paper provides a causality assessment on the linkage between declines in world trade finance and the world trade collapse in the period following the Financial Crisis of 2008 and 2009 as well as the ensuing global trade slowdown. The paper performs Granger Causality tests on two time series: World trade (volume data acquired from the CPB World Trade Monitor) and World trade finance (transaction data acquired from SWIFT), using global monthly data from January 2007 to May 2017. In the short run, Granger causality always runs one-way from world trade finance to world trade. We always find two-way Granger causality for lags longer than two years. Importantly Granger causality never runs one-way from world trade to world trade finance. Given the short-term nature of trade finance, we conclude that world trade finance Granger-causes world trade.
F65|Examining the Causal Relationship between Globalization and Insurance Activities in Large Emerging Market (LEM) Economies: Evidence from Bootstrap Panel Granger Causality|This study applies bootstrap panel Granger causality test of to examine the causal relationship between globalization and insurance market activities in large emerging market economies. Economic, social, political and overall globalization indices are considered separately, and 3 alternative measures of globalization (hybrid, de facto and de jure) are also used in each case for our estimations. The empirical results confirm the following; first, empirical outcomes are sensitive to the choice of globalization measure used. Second, cross-sectional dependence and cross-country heterogeneity exist among large emerging market economies. Third, causality varies across large emerging economies with different conditions, and social globalization has the most widespread effect on insurance market activities.
F65|The Spread of Deposit Insurance and the Global Rise in Bank Asset Risk since the 1970s|We construct a new measure of the changing generosity of deposit insurance for many countries, empirically model the international influences on the adoption and generosity of deposit insurance, and show that the expansion of deposit insurance generosity increased asset risk in banking systems. We consider three asset risk measures: higher loans-to-assets, a higher proportion of lending to households, and a higher proportion of mortgage lending. None of the observed increases in these indicators is offset by declines in banking system leverage. We show that increased asset risk explains at least part of the positive association between deposit insurance and the likelihood and severity of systemic banking crises.
F65|Net Direct Taxes and Double Taxation Avoidance|Double taxation can only arise in the case of direct taxes: taxes on income and wealth taxes, and adversely affect the international capital movement, the exchange of persons, goods, capital services and impedes the development of economic relations between countries. Given that the double taxation is a global problem that increases the fiscal pressure and diminishes the investment attractiveness, and it becomes necessary to improve the domestic tax system, we intend to analyze the imposition of revenues, by emphasizing the necessity, the measures and the methods undertaken to eliminate the double taxation. To this end, the analysis between two countries: of Romania and France has been carried out and we find that the application of the methods of avoiding double international taxation has contrary effects on the state of residence compared to the consequences of the company in question because the tax relief is advantageous for the company but constitutes a disadvantage for the granting State; but it is fundamental to choose a method because the amount of tax revenue, is maximum in the absence of a tax convention between the two signatory states. By international agreement, taxpayers are guaranteed that their income will not be subject to double taxation and are protected against fiscal discrimination in the Contracting State in which they operate.
F65|Is Panama Really Your Tax Haven? Secrecy Jurisdictions and the Countries They Harm|Secrecy jurisdictions provide services that enable the residents of other countries to escape the laws and regulations of their home economies, evade tax, or hide their legally or illegally obtained assets. Recent offshore leaks offer only a limited and biased view of the world of financial secrecy. In this paper we quantify which secrecy jurisdictions provide secrecy to which countries and assess how successful countries are in targeting these jurisdictions with their policies. To that objective we develop the Bilateral Financial Secrecy Index (BFSI) and estimate it for 86 countries by quantifying the financial secrecy supplied to them by up to 100 secrecy jurisdictions. We then evaluate two major recent policy efforts by comparing them with the results of the BFSI. First, we focus on the blacklisting process of the European Commission and find that most of the important secrecy jurisdictions for EU member states have been identified by the lists. Second, we link the results to data on active bilateral automatic information exchange treaties to assess how well-aimed are the policymakers’ limited resources. We argue that while low-secrecy jurisdictions’ gains are maximized if a large share of received secrecy is covered by automatic information exchange, tax havens aim not to activate these relationships with countries to which they supply secrecy. Our results show that so far, some major secrecy jurisdictions successfully keep their most prominent relationships uncovered by automatic information exchange, and activating these relationships may thus be an effective tool to curb secrecy.
F65|Towards a Marxist theory of financialised capitalism|In the rapid growth of the literature on financialisation, the term risks becoming meaningless (‘take x, add finance’). This contribution first reviews this literature, highlighting characteristic empirical features at the macroeconomic level and their variegation across different institutional contexts, then turning to meso- and micro-level multidisciplinary studies of how processes of financialisation have manifest in the transformed behaviour of firms, states and households, as well as in the changing mode of provision of public services and the appropriation of the commons. Marxist attempts to theorize the essences of financialisation are examined and found wanting. Two proposals are made in the spirit of advancing this project. First, financialisation as cyclical process must be disentangled from financialised capitalism as secular stage. Second, it is argued that the emergence of financialised capitalism as a new stage within mature capitalism is linked with the central role played by finance in the internationalisation of the circuit of production.
F65|The distance effect in banking and trade|The empirical gravity literature finds geographical distance to be a large and growing obstacle to trade, contradicting the popular notion that globalization heralds “the end of geography”. This distance puzzle disappears, however, when measuring the effect of cross-border distance relative to that of domestic distance (Yotov, 2012). We uncover the same result for banking when comparing cross-border positions with domestic credit, using the most extensive dataset on global bank linkages between countries. The role of distance remains substantial for trade as well as for banking where transport cost is immaterial – pointing to the role of information frictions as a common driver. A second contribution is to show that the forces of globalization are also evident in other, less prominent, parts of the gravity framework.
F65|On international integration of emerging sovereign bond markets|The paper investigates the international integration of EM sovereign dollar-denominated and local-currency bond markets. Factor analysis is used to examine movements in bond yields and common sources of variation. Results suggest that EM dollar-denominated debt markets are highly integrated; one common factor, highly correlated with US and EU interest rates, explains 80% of the total variability in yields. Local currency bond markets are not as internationally integrated, and three common factors explain 74% of total variability. But a global interest rates factor still explains 63% of the yield variation accounted for by common factors. Heterogeneity among EMs is explored.
F65|Capital inflows, equity issuance activity, and corporate investment|This paper uses issuance-level data to study how equity capital inflows that enter emerging market economies affect equity issuance and corporate investment. It shows that foreign inflows are strongly correlated with country-level issuance. The relation especially reflects the behavior of large firms, defined as those with large market value of equity. To identify supply-side shocks, capital inflows into each country are instrumented with exogenous changes in other countries'attractiveness to foreign investors. Shifts in the supply of foreign capital are important drivers of increased equity inflows. Instrumented contemporaneous and lagged capital inflows lead large firms to raise new equity, which they use to fund investment. The results indicate that inflows imply more than a transfer of equity ownership from domestic to foreign investors. Foreign purchases of equity have financial and real consequences for firms.

F65|Financial Globalisation and Economic Growth in South Asia|The paper examines the relationship between financial globalization and growth. While the existing literature suggests divergent conclusions and mostly in the case of de-veloped countries, there is dearth of such studies in the case of developing countries, and South Asia is not an exception. Here, an attempt has been made to study the relationship between financial globalization and growth in seven South Asian countries namely Bhu-tan, Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Following the framework suggested by Bekaert et al. (2005) and with the help of Panel VAR and Panel causality (in GMM framework) models, the study concludes that the causation from financial globalization to growth in the region appears to be weak. Rather there appears a reverse causation running from growth to financial globalization. This suggests that it is the domestic macroeconomic policies (fiscal prudence, strong domestic financial sector and better growth policies) that act as pull factors for foreign capital. At the individual country level, the results are found to be divergent. The study finds that output growth appears to cause financial globalization in countries such as India, Paki-stan, Maldives, and Nepal. However, in countries such as Sri Lanka and Bhutan, it clearly suggests that foreign capital has a significant positive impact on output growth. In Bang-ladesh, the impact seems to be through indirect channel, where foreign capital seems to have disciplining impact on domestic financial markets, which in turn causes output growth. Similar indirect channel is found in the case of Sri Lanka and this is in addition to the direct channel of financial globalization causing growth.
F65|OECD Progress Update on Approaches to Mobilising Institutional Investment for Sustainable Infrastructure|The large need for investments in sustainable infrastructure will require investments from the private sector, including institutional investors. This working paper contributes to scaling up investments by analysing public project-level interventions for projects involving institutional investors. It presents findings from an updated database on institutional investments in environmentally sustainable infrastructure with project-level intervention by the public sector.
F65|The Covered Interest Parity Puzzle and the Evolution of the Japan Premium| A disturbance or breakdown of the first stage of the monetary transmission mechanism tends to be synonymous with high and volatile money market risk premia. Such market indicators include violations of the covered interest parity (CIP). This was not only evident during the financial crisis of 2007–08, but already during the Japanese banking crisis in the late 1990s, when it became referred to as the “Japan Premium.” Despite extraordinary policy measures by central banks in recent years, however, deviations from the CIP indicate continuing or even elevated stress in the international monetary system. This paper examines a string of distinct, but closely interconnected, assumptions and perceptions regarding CIP arbitrage. By doing so, it not only sheds some fresh light on the recent “CIP puzzle” but also on the era of the Japan Premium during the 1990s and its aftermath.
F65|Incentives for the finance sector: How the ECB affects banks' business assembling|Central banks implement negative interest rate policies (NIRP) to incentivize economic subjects to spend and invest money for long term economic growth. Although nominal negative interest rates can not be effectively explained by economic theory, when inflation is included there are currently real negative interest rates in almost all industrial nations. We investigate the difference in banks' performances regarding their core business composition in the short run after zero interest rate policy is announced first. Assigning European banks in the interval from a pure commercial bank to an investment bank leads to the observed heterogeneity within the industry.
F65|The impact of financialisation on the wage share. A theoretical clarification and empirical test|It is frequently asserted that financialisation has contributed to the decline in the wage share. This paper provides a theoretical clarification and a systematic empirical investigation. We identify four channels through which financialisation can affect the wage share: (1) enhanced exit options of firms; (2) rising price mark-ups due to financial overhead costs for businesses; (3) increased competition on capital markets and shareholder value orientation; and (4) the role of household debt in increasing workers’ financial vulnerability and undermining their class consciousness. The paper compiles a comprehensive set of empirical measures of financialisation and uses it to test these hypotheses with a panel regression of 14 OECD countries over the 1992-2014 period. We find strong evidence for negative effects of financial liberalisation and financial payments of non-financial corporations on the wage share that are in the same order of magnitude as the effects of globalisation.
F65|Les transferts de fonds des migrants contribuent elles à l'inclusivité de la croissance en Afrique Subsaharienne?<BR>[Do remittances contribute to inclusive growth in Subsaharan Africa?]|The purpose of this study is to assess the contribution of remittances on the improvement of inclusive growth in sub-Saharan Africa. The role of institutions is highlighted through three indicators from International Country Risk Guide (IRCG) such as investment profile, control of corruption and law and order. Estimates of panel macroeconomic data over the period 1985-2014 with 5 years intervals are made using the System Generalized Method of Moment (SGMM). Inclusive growth is captured by the quality growth index (QGI) that we have calculated for the 24 countries of our sample, following closely the Mlachila et al (2014) approach. Our results suggest that remittances enhance inclusive growth in Sub Saharan Africa. More precisely, a 10% increase in remittances leads to a 0.2%; 0.15% and 0.33% increase in the quality growth index depending on different specifications. When taking into account institutional context, only “law and order” enhance the ability of remittances to promote inclusive growth in SSA. These results indicate that governments should not only create conditions in order to attract more remittances, but additional incentives (better institutions) are needed to get beneficiary households and individuals to use remittances productively and thus, they would better contribute to inclusive growth which is nowadays one of the most important solution to a deep reduction of poverty and inequality.
F65|Alternative finance: theoretical and empirical consideration|Alternative finance presents a stream that has boomed several years ago. These finance tools are often described with attributes such as ?non-traditional?, ?online? or ?innovative?. Since this research area is relatively new, there are scholar and practitioner discussions about what kind of financial tool belongs to the label ?alternative finance? and which one not. Indeed, alternative finance segment is on the rise and has to be understood as a reliable source of financing business ventures (even more not only ventures with business attribute). The aim of this paper is to provide theoretical and empirical remarks to this research stream. Authors continue with this paper with their research interest and present a part of gained information during their research. The paper is articulated as follows: first the alternative finance sphere is discussed including the taxonomy and current state of knowledge about this segment mainly on the European level. Second, follow-up empirical research is provided answering four hypotheses related to alternative finance attributes and general awareness among society. In conclusion final remarks and future perspectives are highlighted.
F65|The Effect of Tax Treaties on Market Based Finance: Evidence using Firm-Level Data|Tax arbitrage is often cited as a potential motive for the substantial growth and complexity of market based finance. Tax treaties are an important feature of the international tax system and can be used to reduce the tax burden on cross-border capital flows. Using an EU firm-level dataset and a number of alternative tax treaty measures, this paper investigates the importance of tax treaties on the investment decisions of a large sample of non-bank financial institutions. The novel dataset includes conduits such as special purpose entities which are often used to channel cross-border investments. Our results show that tax treaties influence the extensive margin of non-bank financial FDI with conduit related investments particularly sensitive to international taxation.
F65|International tax cooperation and sovereign debt crisis resolution: reforming global governance to ensure no one is left behind|The paper focuses on two crucial issues that hinder the fiscal sovereignty of developing countries: the reduced level of international tax cooperation, and the lack of appropriate procedures for sovereign debt crisis resolution. The low level of international tax cooperation enables a ‘race to the bottom’ in tax rates among countries, tax avoidance through profit-shifting activities by companies and tax evasion by individuals and companies, based on the existence of non-cooperative jurisdictions. In the last five years, the international community has made some improvements in this field, but the situation remains far from satisfactory. On the other hand, the current procedure for sovereign debt resolution, through negotiations at the Paris Club with the support of the IMF, is not only unfair, but also inefficient. The paper explores alternatives in both fields. Appropriate responses to these international problems would have to show benefits in terms of efficiency and welfare at the global level, and establish fundamentals for countries to take full advantage of their resources, which is a necessary condition for funding policies that will not leave (or push) any nation or social sector behind.
F65|Capital Inflows, Equity Issuance Activity, and Corporate Investment|We use issuance-level data to study how equity capital inflows that enter emerging market economies affect equity issuance and corporate investment. We show that foreign inflows are strongly correlated with country-level issuance. The relation reflects the behavior of large issuers issuing in domestic equity markets and that of firms issuing in international markets. Those larger, more liquid, and highly valued firms are the ones more likely to raise equity when their country receives capital inflows. To identify supply-side shocks, we instrument capital inflows into each country with exogenous changes in other countries’ attractiveness to foreign investors. Shifts in the supply of foreign capital are important drivers of increased equity inflows. Instrumented inflows lead a subset of firms (large domestic issuers and foreign issuers) to raise new equity, which they use mainly to fund investment. Corporate investment increases between one-tenth and four-tenths the amount of foreign equity capital entering the country.
F65|Corporate debt maturity in developing countries: Sources of long and short‐termism|This paper documents to what extent firms from developing countries borrow short versus long term, using data on corporate bond and syndicated loan markets. Contrary to claims in the literature based on firm balance sheets, firms from developing countries borrow through bonds and syndicated loans at maturities similar to those obtained by developed country firms. There are relevant differences across the debt markets composing this aggregate pattern. Firms from developing countries borrow shorter term in domestic bond markets. But the differences in international issuances (accounting for most of the proceeds) are significantly smaller. Moreover, developing country firms borrow longer term in syndicated loan markets. However, only large firms from developing countries (similar in size to those from developed ones) issue bonds and syndicated loans. The short‐termism in developing countries is partly explained by a lower proportion of firms using these markets, with more firms relying on other shorter‐term instruments.
F65|Changing Business Models In International Bank Funding|This paper investigates the foreign funding mix of globally active banks. Using BIS international banking statistics for a panel of 12 advanced economies, we detect a structural break in international bank funding at the onset of the great financial crisis. In their postbreak business model, banks rely less on cross‐border liabilities and, instead, tap funds from outside their jurisdictions by making more active use of their subsidiaries and branches, as well as interoffice accounts within the same banking group. (JEL C32, F65, G21)
F65|How Important is the Global Financial Cycle? Evidence from Capital Flows|Abstract We quantify the importance of a Global Financial Cycle (GFCy) for capital flows. We use capital flow data disaggregated by direction and type between 1990Q1 and 2015Q4 for 85 countries, and conventional techniques, models and metrics. Since the GFCy is unobservable, we use two methods to represent it: directly observable variables in center economies often linked to it, such as the VIX, and indirect manifestations, proxied by common dynamic factors extracted from actual capital flows. Our evidence seems mostly inconsistent with a significant and conspicuous GFCy for capital flows; both methods combined rarely explain more than a quarter of the variation for most types of capital flows, in most countries, for most of the time. Succinctly, most variation in capital flows does not seem to be the result of common shocks nor stem from observables in a central country like the USA.
F65|Asset prices and macroeconomic outcomes: A survey|This paper surveys the literature on the linkages between asset prices and macroeconomic outcomes. It focuses on three major questions. First, what are the basic theoretical linkages between asset prices and macroeconomic outcomes? Second, what is the empirical evidence supporting these linkages? And third, what are the main challenges to the theoretical and empirical findings? The survey addresses these questions in the context of four major asset price categories: equity prices, house prices, exchange rates and interest rates, with a particular focus on their international dimensions. It also puts into perspective the evolution of the literature on the determinants of asset prices and their linkages with macroeconomic outcomes, and discusses possible future research directions.
F65|Macroeconomic Implications of Financial Imperfections: A Survey|This paper surveys the theoretical and empirical literature on the macroeconomic implications of financial imperfections. It focuses on two major channels through which financial imperfections can affect macroeconomic outcomes. The first channel, which operates through the demand side of finance and is captured by financial accelerator-type mechanisms, describes how changes in borrowers’ balance sheets can affect their access to finance and thereby amplify and propagate economic and financial shocks. The second channel, which is associated with the supply side of finance, emphasizes the implications of changes in financial intermediaries’ balance sheets for the supply of credit, liquidity and asset prices, and, consequently, for macroeconomic outcomes. These channels have been shown to be important in explaining the linkages between the real economy and the financial sector. That said, many questions remain.
F65|International expansion and riskiness of Banks|We exploit an original dataset on European G-SIBs to assess how expansion in foreign markets affects their riskiness. We find a robust negative correlation between foreign expansion and bank risk (proxied by various individual and systemic risk metrics). Given individual bank riskiness, banks’expansion reduces the average riskiness of the banks’ pool (between effect). Moreover, foreign expansion of any given bank reduces its own risk (within effect). Diversification, competition and regulation channels are all important. Expansion in destination countries with different business cycle co-movement, stricter regulations and higher competition than the origin country decreases a bank’s riskiness.
F65|Deadly Embrace: Sovereign and Financial Balance Sheets Doom Loops|The recent unravelling of the Eurozone’s financial integration raised concerns about feedback loops between sovereign and banking insolvency. This article provides a theory of the feedback loop that allows for both domestic bailouts of the banking system and sovereign debt forgiveness by international creditors or solidarity by other countries. Our theory has important implications for the re-nationalization of sovereign debt, macroprudential regulation, and the rationale for banking unions.
F65|Estructura de varianzas entre el mercado financiero mundial y de Colombia|Este trabajo tiene como objetivo analizar, a través de un análisis econométrico de las series de tiempo de los índices de Morgan Stanley en los últimos 5 años, las variaciones de los precios de los títulos de valor que cotizan en el mercado bursátil de Colombia y su comportamiento con respecto al resto del mundo. Con este propósito, se estimará un modelo DCC GARCH y se realizará una inspección en las cuentas de la balanza de pagos para explicar sus fluctuaciones. Los resultados obtenidos apuntan hacia una baja integración del país al mercado financiero mundial como resultado de la disminución en la entrada de capitales durante el periodo observado.
F65|Mapping the interconnectedness between EU banks and shadow banking entities|This paper provides a unique snapshot of the exposures of EU banks to shadow banking entities within the global financial system. Drawing on a rich and novel dataset, the paper documents the cross-sector and cross-border linkages and considers which are the most relevant for systemic risk monitoring. From a macroprudential perspective, the identification of potential feedback and contagion channels arising from the linkages of banks and shadow banking entities is particularly challenging when shadow banking entities are domiciled in different jurisdictions. The analysis shows that many of the EU banks’ exposures are towards non-EU entities, particularly US-domiciled shadow banking entities. At the individual level, banks’ exposures are diversified although this diversification leads to high overlap across different types of shadow banking entities. JEL Classification: F65, G21, G23
F65|Cross-border acquisitions and restructuring: Multinational enterprises and private equity-firms|An increasingly large share of cross-border acquisitions are undertaken by private equity-firms (PE-firms) and not by traditional multinational enterprises (MNEs). We propose a model of cross-border acquisitions in which MNEs and PE-firms compete over domestic assets and which incorporates endogenous financial frictions. MNEs’ advantages lie in firm-specific synergies and access to internal capital markets, whereas PE-firms are good at reorganizing target firms. We show that stronger firm-specific synergies, lower restructuring advantages for PE-firms, higher exit costs for PE-firms, better access to internal capital markets, a higher risk premium on lending, higher moral hazard problems, and higher trade costs all favor MNEs over PE-firms. We also present cross-country correlations that are consistent with these predictions.
F65|International Monetary Relations: Taking Finance Seriously|In this essay, we highlight the interactions of the international monetary system with financial conditions, not just with the output, inflation, and balance of payments goals usually discussed. We review how financial conditions and outright financial crises have posed difficulties for each of the main international monetary systems in the last 150 years or so: the gold standard, the interwar period, the Bretton Woods system, and the current system of floating exchange rates. We argue that even as the world economy has evolved and sentiments have shifted among widely different policy regimes, there remain three fundamental challenges for any international monetary and financial system: How should exchange rates between national currencies be determined? How can countries with balance of payments deficits reduce these without sharply contracting their economies and with minimal risk of possible negative spillovers abroad? How can the international system ensure that countries have access to an adequate supply of international liquidity—financial resources generally acceptable to foreigners in all circumstances? In concluding, we evaluate how the current international monetary system answers these questions.
F65|Asset Purchase Bailouts and Implicit Guarantees|This paper shows that bailouts of private agents can optimally take the form of asset purchases, even if this also means paying off external asset holders, in the presence of borrowing constraints and asymmetric information on liquidity needs. The combination of these two ingredients make direct compensation through loans and/or net transfers imperfect. Thus, when more constrained agents are also more exposed to the asset, the compensation through asset purchases becomes desirable. Anticipating these purchases, private agents engage in a collective bet on the defaulting asset, leading to an equilibrium implicit guarantee, where even an intrinsically worthless asset can be traded at a positive price.
F65|The source of global stock market risk: A viewpoint of economic policy uncertainty|This study explores the effect of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) in four countries or regions (China, Japan, Europe, and the United States) on the contagion risk of investments in the global stock market. The stock returns of 22 stock markets worldwide are analyzed to determine which region’s EPU exhibits the greatest effect on regional systematic risk in the global stock market and on volatility risk in individual stock markets. First, all of the samples, the markets of different continents and the spillover indices of the developed and emerging markets, are calculated to observe the dynamic correlation among these markets with the aim of quantifying regional systematic risk and further examining the contagion risk effect of EPU. The results indicate the following: EPU in China is the most influential, and its contagion risk spreads to different regional markets, except for Europe; the effect of EPU in the United States is inferior to that in China; EPU in Japan merely influences contagion risk in emerging markets; contagion risk in European markets is not influenced by the four EPU indices; and EPU in Europe is not influenced by contagion risk in the global stock market. However, according to the volatility risk in each market, the EPU in Europe and China respectively influence Asian countries and European countries the most. These results may be attributable to the extremely high trade dependence among these countries because the performance of international enterprises is mainly determined by the economic policies of their trading partners.
F65|Asymmetric determinants of CDS spreads: U.S. industry-level evidence through the NARDL approach|This paper investigates the presence of asymmetries in the short- and long-run relationships between the 5-year CDS index spreads at the U.S. industry level and a set of major macroeconomic and financial variables, namely the corresponding industry stock indices, the VIX index, the 5-year Treasury bond yield and the crude oil price, using the NARDL approach. The empirical results provide significant evidence of both short-run and long-run asymmetries in the linkage between ten industry CDS spreads and the potential driving factors common for all industries, confirming the importance of asymmetric nonlinearity in this context. It is also shown that the industry equity prices, the VIX, the 5-year Treasury bond rate and, to a lesser extent, the crude oil price constitute important asymmetric determinants of these U.S. industry CDS spreads. The findings of this study have relevant implications for investors, speculators, arbitrageurs and policy makers interested in credit risk at the industry level.
F65|Estimating the speed of adjustment to target levels: The case of energy prices|In this paper, we propose a model that estimates the speed of energy price adjustment to its target level. We also explain the source of price adjustment. Moreover, we extract energy price bubbles and show that bubbles help explain price adjustment. Since ours is the first paper that develops an energy price adjustment model and links it to bubbles, several avenues for future research have emerged from our analysis. The first is to provide a theoretical framework for the bubbles and price adjustment mechanism. The second direction of research will be to continue the search for other potential determinants of price adjustment.
F65|Are investors really home-biased when investing at home?|Investors who only invest in their domestic market are typically referred to as being home-biased. We refer to firm-level internationalization and call into question whether investing in domestic stock indices actually leads to home bias. We use three measures of firm-level internationalization based on percentages of foreign sales, employees in foreign countries, and foreign tax payments. We aggregate firm-level results to determine the degree of internationalization of German, French, UK and US stock indices. French and UK stock indices exhibit the largest degree of internationalization. The German index provides slightly less internationalization, whereas internationalization of the US index is lowest but nonetheless considerable. This means that investors who invest in their domestic market do not necessarily suffer from home bias. Instead, investing in domestic stock indices more likely prevents investors from a home bias instead of entrapping them to insufficient portfolios.
F65|Asset prices and macroeconomic outcomes: a survey|This paper surveys the literature on the linkages between asset prices and macroeconomic outcomes. It focuses on three major questions. First, what are the basic theoretical linkages between asset prices and macroeconomic outcomes? Second, what is the empirical evidence supporting these linkages? And third, what are the main challenges to the theoretical and empirical findings? The survey addresses these questions in the context of four major asset price categories: equity prices, house prices, exchange rates and interest rates, with a particular focus on their international dimensions. It also puts into perspective the evolution of the literature on the determinants of asset prices and their linkages with macroeconomic outcomes, and discusses possible future research directions.
F65|Firm financing and growth in the Arab region|This paper documents how firms in Arab countries use equity, corporate bond and syndicated loan markets to obtain financing and grow. Working with a new dataset on issuance activity in domestic and international markets and firm performance, the paper finds that capital raising through these markets has grown rapidly since the early 1990s and involved an increasing number of firms. Whereas the amounts raised in equity and loan markets (relative to gross domestic product) stand well relative to international standards, bond issuance activity lags behind. However, bond financing has gained importance over time. Equity issuances take place primarily in domestic markets, whereas bonds and loans are mostly issued internationally, display long maturities and entail low levels of credit risk. Issuing firms from the Arab region are very large compared to international standards. They also tend to be larger, faster growing and more leveraged than non-issuing firms in Arab countries.
F65|Cross-border Vertical Integration and Intra-firm Trade: New Evidence from Korean and Japanese Firm-level Data|This paper establishes two facts about cross-border vertical integration and intra-firm trade of firms in Korean and Japanese manufacturing industries. First, the intra-firm trade between a parent firm and its affiliates is highly concentrated in a small number of large multinational corporations. Second, the input–output coefficient between the parent firm's industry and the affiliate's industry is weakly related to the presence and magnitude of intra-firm trade between the parent firm and its affiliates. Furthermore, these two characteristics are also found in domestic vertically integrated firms. In particular, the second point identifies a need for further research on the motivation of cross-border vertical integration between two manufacturers, the final good producers at home and the input suppliers abroad.
F65|International financial spillovers to emerging market economies: How important are economic fundamentals?|We assess the importance of economic fundamentals in the transmission of international shocks to financial markets in various emerging market economies (EMEs), covering the so-called taper-tantrum episode of 2013 and seven other episodes of severe EME-wide financial stress since the mid-1990s. Cross-country regressions lead us to the following results: (1) EMEs with relatively better economic fundamentals suffered less deterioration in financial markets during the 2013 taper-tantrum episode. (2) Differentiation among EMEs set in relatively early and persisted through this episode. (3) During the taper tantrum, while controlling for the EMEs’ economic fundamentals, financial conditions also deteriorated more in those EMEs that had earlier experienced larger private capital inflows and greater exchange rate appreciation. (4) During the EME crises of the 1990s and early 2000s, we find little evidence of investor differentiation across EMEs being explained by differences in their relative vulnerabilities. (5) However, differentiation across EMEs based on fundamentals does not appear to be unique to the 2013 episode; it also occurred during the global financial crisis of 2008 and, subsequently, during financial stress episodes related to the European sovereign crisis in 2011 and China’s financial market stresses in 2015.
F65|Asset Purchase Bailouts and Implicit Guarantees|This paper shows that bailouts of private agents can optimally take the form of asset purchases, even if this also means paying off external asset holders, in the presence of borrowing constraints and asymmetric information on liquidity needs. The combination of these two ingredients make direct compensation through loans and/or net transfers imperfect. Thus, when more constrained agents are also more exposed to the asset, the compensation through asset purchases becomes desirable. Anticipating these purchases, private agents engage in a collective bet on the defaulting asset, leading to an equilibrium implicit guarantee, where even an intrinsically worthless asset can be traded at a positive price.
F65|Productive Processes, Costs And Competitiveness: The Case Of A Company Producer Of Tequila Artesanal, Procesos Productivos, Costos Y Competitividad: Caso Empresa Productora De Tequila Artesanal|This paper presents production processes used in a traditional company. Production processes are sequential, and apply to companies making mass production. This study refers to a company dedicated to the production of tequila a typical Mexican drink. We can perfectly identify the processes needed for the preparation. Many companies carry out their processes in a traditional way. However, these companies have had to adapt to technological changes to be competitive. Production processes applied to the production of tequila are well defined and allow the allocation of costs in each of the processes. The importance of this procedure has to do with training production, which makes a difference in quality, and is reflected in lower costs
F65|The Lead-Lag Relationship among East Asian Economies: A Wavelet Analysis|Recently, the issue of market linkages (and price discovery) between stock indices and the lead-lag relationship is a topic of interest to financial economists, financial managers and analysts, especially that involves the East Asian countries. In this study, to investigate the financial market leader in East Asian countries after the US financial crisis, we employ several conventional time-series techniques and a newly introduced method – wavelet analysis - to economics and finance. Daily return data covering the period from 15th September 2008 to 1st March 2016 for five major international stock price indices in East Asia are analyzed. Our findings tend to, more or less, suggest that the Shanghai stock exchange composite index is the only exogenous variable, whereas the remaining variables are endogenous. Such finding implies that the Shanghai stock exchange composite index is the financial market leader whereas the rest of variables are follower, which includes Nikkei 225 (Japan). In order to check the robustness of our results, we also employed wavelet correlation and cross-correlation techniques. Interestingly, based on the results, the leading role of Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index is very clear at short scales; whereas, the leading role disappears at the long scales. This study shows that wavelet analysis can provide a valuable alternative to the existing conventional methodologies in identifying lead-lag (causality) relationship between financial/economic variables, since wavelets considered heterogeneous agents who making decisions over different time horizons.
F65|Autocorrelation in an unobservable global trend: does it help to forecast market returns?| In this paper, a Kalman filter-type model is used to extract a global stochastic trend from discrete non-synchronous data on daily stock market index returns from different markets. The model allows for the autocorrelation in the global stochastic trend, which means that its increments are predictable. It does not necessarily mean the predictability of market returns, since the global trend is unobservable. The performance of the model for the forecast of market returns is explored for three markets: Japan, UK, USA.
F65|Macroeconomic implications of financial imperfections: a survey|This paper surveys the theoretical and empirical literature on the macroeconomic implications of financial imperfections. It focuses on two major channels through which financial imperfections can affect macroeconomic outcomes. The first channel, which operates through the demand side of finance and is captured by financial accelerator-type mechanisms, describes how changes in borrowers' balance sheets can affect their access to finance and thereby amplify and propagate economic and financial shocks. The second channel, which is associated with the supply side of finance, emphasises the implications of changes in financial intermediaries' balance sheets for the supply of credit, liquidity and asset prices, and, consequently, for macroeconomic outcomes. These channels have been shown to be important in explaining the linkages between the real economy and the financial sector. That said, many questions remain.
F65|Monetary Policy Trilemma, Inflation Targeting And Global Financial Crisis|We empirically investigate the validity of the monetary policy trilemma postulation for emerging market (EME) and advanced (AE) economies under different exchange rate and monetary policy regimes before and after the recent global financial crisis (GFC). Consistent with the dilemma proposition, domestic interest rates are determined by global financial conditions and the FED rate even under floating exchange rate regimes (ERR) in the long-run. The impact of the FED rates is higher in EME than AE and EME are much more sensitive to global financial cycle under managed than floating ERR. The spillover from the FED rate substantially increases after the GFC in EME with floating ERR and AE. The results from the monetary policy reaction functions based on equilibrium correction mechanism specifications suggest that domestic interest rates respond to inflation and output gaps especially under inflation targeting (IT) in the short-run. The response to inflation gap tends to be smaller in IT AE after the GFC.
F65|Government debt and corporate leverage: International evidence|We empirically investigate the impact of government debt on corporate financing decisions in an international setting. We show a negative relation between government debt and corporate leverage using data on 40 countries between 1990–2014. This negative relation is stronger for government debt that is financed domestically, for firms that are larger and more profitable, and in countries with more developed equity markets. To address potential endogeneity concerns, we use an instrumental variable approach based on military spending and a quasi-natural experiment based on the introduction of the Euro currency. Our findings suggest that government debt crowds out corporate debt.
F65|Predicting Relative Returns|Across a variety of asset classes, we show that relative returns are highly predictable in the time series in and out of sample, much more so than aggregate returns. For Treasuries, slope is more predictable than level. For equities, dominant principal components of anomaly long-short strategies are more predictable than the market. For foreign exchange, a carry portfolio is more predictable than a basket of all currencies against the dollar. We show the commonly used practice to predict each individual asset is often equivalent to predicting only their first principal component, the index, which obscures the predictability of relative returns. Our findings highlight that focusing on important dimensions of the cross-section allows one to uncover additional economically relevant and statistically robust patterns of predictability.
F65|The Center and the Periphery: Two Hundred Years of International Borrowing Cycles|A common belief in both academic and policy circles is that capital flows to the emerging periphery are excessive and ending in crises. One of the most frequently mentioned culprits is the cycles of monetary easing and tightening in the financial center. Also, many focus on the role of crises in the financial center, pointing to excess international borrowing predating crises in the financial center and global retrenchment in capital flows in its aftermath. I re-examine these views using a newly-constructed database on capital flows spanning two hundred years. Extending the study of capital flows to the first episode of financial globalization has two major advantages: During this episode, monetary policy in the financial center is constrained by the adherence to the Gold Standard, thus providing a benchmark for capital flow cycles in the absence of an active role of central banks in the financial centers. Second, panics in the financial center are rare disasters that need to be examined in a longer historical episode. I find that boom-bust capital flow cycles in the periphery are milder in the second episode of financial globalization when the financial center follows a cyclical monetary policy. Also, cyclical monetary policy in the financial center is far more pronounced in times of crises in the financial center, cutting short capital flow bonanzas in the periphery and injecting liquidity in the aftermath of the crisis.
F65|The Rise, the Fall, and the Resurrection of Iceland|This paper documents how the Icelandic banking system grew from 100 percent of GDP in 1998 to 9 times GDP in 2008 when it failed. We base the analysis on data from the banks that was made public when the Icelandic parliament lifted among others bank secrecy laws to investigate the run up to the financial crisis. We document how the banks were funded, and where the money went with a comprehensive analysis of their lending. We also analyze policies implemented after the crash, including emergency legislation, capital control, alleviation of balance of payment risks and preservation of the financial stability. We estimate the output costs of the crisis, which was about average relative to the 147 banking crisis documented Laeven and Valencia (2012) and the 100 banking crisis documented by Reinhart and Rogoff (2014). Our computation of the governments direct costs, reveals that the recently concluded negotiation with foreign creditors may leave the Icelandic government in net surplus as a consequence of the crisis, although there is still some uncertainty about the ultimate cost and our benchmark estimate is a cost corresponding to 5 percent of GDP. We summarize several lessons from the episode.
F65|Bank efficiency, productivity, and convergence in EU countries: a weighted Russell directional distance model| The objective of this study is three-fold. First we estimate and analyse bank efficiency and productivity changes in the EU28 countries with the application of a novel approach, a weighted Russell directional distance model. Second, we take a disaggregated approach and analyse the contribution of the individual bank inputs on bank efficiency and productivity growth. Third, we test for convergence in EU28 bank productivity as well as in the inefficiency of individual bank inputs. We find that bank efficiency has been undermined by the financial crisis in banks notably from the EU15 countries. We also argue that bank efficiency and productivity in EU countries vary across the banking sector with banks from the ‘old’ EU showing higher efficiency levels. Nonetheless, a noticeable catching up process is observed for banks from the ‘new’ EU countries. Consequently, we do not find evidence of group convergence for bank productivity but there is evidence of convergence in bank efficiency change and technical change among the EU28 countries throughout the period 2005–2014. The driving force seems to be convergent technical change from the old EU member states’ banks. On the other hand, almost no convergence is detected for the banks’ individual inputs while the transition paths show heightened diversity during the crisis years.
F65|Modeling the „Visitors to Rome“ effect: Reputation Building in Anglo-Saxon Buyout Funds in Japan|Stereotypes pose a major challenge to agents entering a foreign market. In order to overcome these stereotypes, visitor agents may decide to emulate domestic behavior. We develop a simple model of reputation building in transactions where identities are revealed and show that this tendency may even imply over-assimilation if stereotypes are sticky and assimilation efforts are not overly costly. The model predictions are tested using data on private equity-led buyout transactions in Japan from 1998 to 2015. While early transactions by Anglo-Saxon investors display marked differences, there is a strong tendency toward approximation of domestic standards, which eventually leads to over-compensation.
F65|The Center and the Periphery: Two Hundred Years of International Borrowing Cycles|A common belief in both academic and policy circles is that cyclical monetary policy in the United States increases the volatility of capital flows to the periphery. More recently, many studies on capital flows also focus on the U.S. Subprime Crisis. These studies emphasize the excessive international borrowing predating that crisis and the dramatic global retrenchment in capital flows in its aftermath. I re-examine these views using a new database I constructed of capital flows spanning two hundred years. Extending the study of capital flows to the first episode of financial globalization has two major advantages. First, during this episode, monetary policy in the financial center is constrained by the adherence to the Gold Standard, thus providing a benchmark for capital flow cycles in the absence of an active role of the central bank in the financial center. Second, panics in the financial center are rare disasters that need to be examined in a longer historical episode. The evidence from the new database indicates that capital flows to the periphery have become less volatile since the restart of globalization in the 1970s. But not all cycles are less pronounced, only those cycles around panics in the financial center. It is in times of crises at the epicenter that countercyclical monetary policy in the financial center is far more aggressive, with severe tightenings predating these crises and drastic easings in their aftermath. This policy cuts short capital flow bonanzas before these crises erupt and mitigates sudden stops in their aftermath.
F65|Portfolio Homogenization and Systemic Risk of Financial Network|In this paper, we argue that systemic risk should be understood from two different perspectives, the homogeneity of portfolios (or called asset homogeneity) and the contagion mechanism. The homogenization of portfolios held by different financial institutions increases the positive correlations among them and therefore the probability of simultaneous collapses of a considerable part of the network, which are prerequisites and amplifiers of contagion. We first theoretically analyze the influence of asset homogeneity on the initial risk, fragility and systemic risk of the network. Based on the theoretical predictions, we perform simulations on regular networks and Poisson random networks to illustrate the effects of portfolio homogeneity on systemic risk. It is shown that the relationship between asset homogeneity and systemic risk is not always positively related. When the network contagion is weak, then a high asset homogeneity will lead to a high systemic risk. However, if the network contagion is considerably strong, the systemic risk is quite likely to be negative related to the asset homogeneity, so that a high homogeneity will produce a low systemic risk. Moreover, networks with strong contagion and low asset homogeneity tend to have the greatest systemic risk. Results from logistic regression analysis further clarify the relationships between systemic risk and asset homogeneity.
F65|A new approach to measuring universal banking|This paper proposes a novel measure of universal banking constructed using the relative contribution of each operating segment to total assets. Using a sample of international banks, we evaluate the extent to which our proposed metric affects banks’ profitability, stability, liquidity and capitalisation. In addition, we evaluate the implications of a more complex business model, featured by th interaction of universal banking and globalization. Results suggest that a higher degree of diversification enhances financial stability and capitalisation when the Universal Banking Index (UBI) is used as a proxy of universal banking. However, a more complex structure, conceived as the combination of universal and global business models, is associated with lower levels of capital and is less desirable from a financial stability perspective
F65|Corporate Overseas Debt Issuance in the Context of Global Liquidity Transmission|Given the rising importance of non-financial corporate overseas debt issuance in the overall international capital flow activities, this paper tries to understand the determinants of corporate overseas bond issuance in 32 countries during the sample period 1993-2015. The results suggest that the compression in risk premium in advanced economies has encouraged the corporates in emerging markets to borrow more from international bond markets. This effect is more prevalent in countries where policy makers impose tighter international capital control, so that corporates outside financial regulation serve as surrogate financial intermediaries at the border. Besides, corporates hold short-term assets in domestic currency as collateral for outstanding overseas debt, in expecting domestic currency appreciation, a behavior often phased as price arbitrage or carry trade position. Our results suggest a potential systematic shift in international financial risk transmission through corporate fixed-income markets and a possible external shock transmission channeled through the monetary policy spillover effect.
F65|Critical Issues in Accounting|The world has numerous languages to communicate, understand and interpret problems. The language of finance, business and numerical figures is recognized as accounting. The roots of accounting sprouted in the Middle East, but flourished in Europe. The concept of accounting is thousands of years old, where ancient citizens used it to deal with money problems, majorly in the cases of recording expenditures, and trading goods. The modern accounting has merged countless latest techniques to improve the practice and implementation in practical life. Accounting plays a significant role in many ways to resolve financial dilemmas.
F65|Barriers to the functioning of the bitcoin system ? user assessment|Bitcoin is a system created to service micro-payments in e-commerce, as well as the digital unit of value functioning in the system's environment. When analysed, the behaviour of market participants indicates that the introduction of investment applications of the cryptocurrency, in parallel with its original payment application, had a tremendous impact on the larger-scale functioning of the system. This was aided by the functioning of many trading platforms allowing for exchange into traditional currencies and a high volatility of quotations. Without doubt, bitcoin may be branded a ground-breaking financial innovation or a work of genius. However, the growing, and even global use of bitcoin has brought some of the system's imperfections to light. As the system developed, bitcoin users started to have a better view of the threats to the correct functioning of the system arising from its construction. The paper aims to indicate the main barriers limiting the functioning of the bitcoin system, and its use in payments in particular. The work has adopted the following research hypothesis: In the early stages of bitcoin functioning, users had little awareness of the technological flaws of the system. The study analyses the literature on the subject and the results of a survey carried out among Polish bitcoin users. The analysis confirms of the research hypothesis, as it shows that in the system?s first several years, users identified the following threats to the system?s functioning: the speculative nature of bitcoin, the lack of adequate awareness in society which would allow for a widespread use of the innovation, potential too strict regulation of the cryptocurrencies market or its banning. The authors also present threats to the functioning of the system which in their opinion are of greatest importance at the moment. These relate to the existence of intermediaries, the lack of systemic incentives addressed to bitcoin merchants, growing costs and payment processing time. The authors intend to indicate those aspects of bitcoin's functioning in order to make the use of cryptocurrencies more conscious and contribute to limiting financial risk of system users.
F65|The Effects of Global Economic Crisis of 2008 to Financial Statements and Liquidity Ratios Which Companies are Settled In BIST Energy Sector (2005-2013 Term Review)|Aim of this study is to compare and analyze whether the 2008 global economic crisis affected the balance of the energy companies which are listed in the Ä°stanbul Stock Exchange and have shown continuity in 2005-2013 period by using a variety of analyzing methods. Companies that demonstrate continuity between the years 2005-2013 were not assessed in this study. Horizontal and vertical analyses were made on the financial statements of the companies which are evaluated and liquidity ratios were assessed. As a result of the analysis the companies have been found to be affected to different degrees by the crisis.
F65|Decomposing financial (in)stability in emerging economies|The build-up of risks in advanced economies has seen a lot of research efforts in the recent years, while similar research efforts on emerging economies have not been so strong and, when undertaken, have focused mostly on its international dimension. Simultaneously, the financial system of the emerging economies has substantially developed and deepened. In our paper, we construct an index of vulnerabilities in emerging countries, relying solely on data available at international organisations. We group indicators around four poles: valuation and risk appetite, imbalances in the non-financial sector, financial sector vulnerabilities, and global vulnerabilities. On purpose, we depart from early warning models or any other kind of complex econometric constructs. Simplicity and usability are the two key characteristics we have tried to embed into our index of vulnerabilities. We use the results to try to create a narrative of the evolution of vulnerabilities in emerging economies from 2005 to the third quarter of 2015, using innovative data visualisation tools as well as correlations and Granger causalities. We complement our analysis with a comparison between our index of vulnerabilities and the Credit-to-GDP gap. JEL Classification: E44, F65, G01, G15, G21, G23
F65|Mapping the interconnectedness between EU banks and shadow banking entities|This paper provides a unique snapshot of the exposures of EU banks to shadow banking entities within the global financial system. Drawing on a rich and novel dataset, the paper documents the cross-sector and cross-border linkages and considers which are the most relevant for systemic risk monitoring. From a macroprudential perspective, the identification of potential feedback and contagion channels arising from the linkages of banks and shadow banking entities is particularly challenging when shadow banking entities are domiciled in different jurisdictions. The analysis shows that many of the EU banks' exposures are towards non-EU entities, particularly US-domiciled shadow banking entities. At the individual level, banks' exposures are diversified although this diversification leads to high overlap across different types of shadow banking entities.
F65|Banking integration and house price comovement|The correlation across US states in house price growth increased steadily between 1976 and 2000. This paper shows that the contemporaneous geographic integration of the US banking market, via the emergence of large banks, was a primary driver of this phenomenon. To this end, we first theoretically derive an appropriate measure of banking integration across state pairs and document that house price growth correlation is strongly related to this measure of financial integration. Our IV estimates suggest that banking integration can explain up to one fourth of the rise in house price correlation over this period. JEL Classification: G21, F65, R30
F65|Volatility : As a Driving Factor of Stock Market Co-movement|There is a strand of finance literature showing that correlation between markets increases during times of high volatility. This paper revisits this finding by comparing contribution of relative volatility to correlations between S&P 500 Index returns and global equity markets' returns before and after the Global Financial Crisis. Our results show that degree and direction of contribution of volatility to correlation has changed in some countries after the crisis. It has implications in the context of international portfolio diversification to reduce portfolio risks. In addition, introducing an extended version of contagion analysis helps to identify contagion and interdependence effects in more detail.
F65|Deepening and Widening of Production Networks in ASEAN|This paper assesses the recent widening and deepening of machinery production networks in ASEAN by using highly disaggregated international trade data over 2007–13. Based on both traditional trade value data analysis and a novel approach to the diversification of exported products and destinations, we confirm the steady development of back-and-forth trade links, notably with East Asian partners, centering on Singapore and Thailand. In addition to the five ASEAN forerunners, Vietnam is an increasingly active player in such networking. Although their degree of participation is still limited, Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar also show signs of joining production networks.
F65|Trade Liberalization and the Aggregate Matching Function in India|This paper investigates the link between trade liberalization and the job-matching process in India by estimating an aggregate matching function by incorporating trade openness as a proxy for trade liberalization. Monthly data are drawn from the National Employment Service's Employment Exchange, India's only public employment service. The results show that trade liberalization leads to a decline in the number of new hires. This implies the exacerbation of matching efficiency, described by an outward shift of the Beveridge curve. This finding is in accordance with a widely held public view that trade liberalization increases unemployment. Therefore, the Indian government should continue carrying out structural reforms for the Indian economy to deal with the inefficiencies in the labor market due to external liberalization.
F65|Internationalization of Indian Enterprises: Patterns, Determinants, and Policy Issues|This paper examines the emerging patterns and economic implications of Indian overseas direct investment (ODI) from a historical perspective. The novelty of the analysis lies in its specific focus on the implications of the liberalization reforms initiated in the early 1990s and the resultant changes in the overall investment climate for the internationalisation of domestic companies. The findings cast doubts on the popular perception that the recent surge in ODI from India is an unmixed economic blessing, a sign of “coming of age” of Indian companies in global business. Given the remaining distortion in the domestic investment climate, the net national gains from these investments could be much less than what the reported absolute numbers suggest.
F65|Managing Economic Stability under Volatile Capital Flows: East Asia Perspectives|The extent of financial globalization and volatilities of short-term capital flows create many challenges for policies of individual economies as well as challenges to global and regional mechanisms that should provide effective safety nets for countries to maintain financial stability. To maintain economic stability, countries—particularly emerging market economies—need to make use of appropriate policy tools, including monetary and exchange rate policy, reserves accumulation, and, when needed, capital control and macro-prudential measures. In addition, liquidity support mechanisms, whether bilateral, global, or regional can make a crucial difference in times of stress. Bilateral arrangements are by nature political so may not be reliable for many countries. Global (IMF) and East Asian regional arrangements (Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization) still do not have effective designs that will make them attractive to countries in the region. Recommendations are put forward on how these facilities can be modified to make them more attractive and effective.
F65|Government Support and R&D Investment Effectiveness in Chinese SMEs: A Complex Relationship|This paper investigates the combined role of innovation support policies and firm's own innovative activities on the performance of Chinese small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in high-tech sectors. By distinguishing two components of innovative activities—research and development (R&D) investments and embedded innovative capacity—the paper develops and tests an integrative moderated moderation model. The results suggest that in Chinese high-tech SMEs innovation-support policies positively moderate the relationship between R&D investments and performance, but this positive effect diminishes when there are higher levels of embedded innovative capacity. These results highlight that the relationship between government innovation policies and a firm's own R&D investments is not only reciprocal but also more complex than the one so far analyzed in the literature. The results show in particular that the effects of innovation-support policies on R&D investments is not as neat as it seems, because of the internal balance within the firm between investment in R&D and other sources of innovation. Therefore, although innovation support policies have been found to help Chinese SMEs in high-tech sectors benefit from their R&D investments, these policies are particularly effective only when R&D investments are significantly driving firms’ innovative activities. This highlights the relevance of both government support and a firm's own efforts in the competitive modernization of Chinese SMEs.
F65|RMBI or RMBR? Is the Renminbi Destined to Become a Global or Regional Currency?|Previous studies have focused on when the renminbi will play a significant role as an international currency, but less attention has been paid to where. We fill this gap by contrasting two answers to the question. One is that the renminbi will assume the role of a global currency similar to the U.S. dollar. Supporters point to China's widely diversified trade and financial flows and to its institutional initiatives, not just in Asia but around the world. The other is that the renminbi will play a regional role in Asia equivalent to that of the euro in Greater Europe. Proponents of this view argue that China has a natural advantage in leveraging regional supply chains and deepening its links with other Asian countries as well as in developing regional institutions. Asia, they argue on these grounds, will become the natural habitat for the renminbi.
F65|The Size and Costs of Bribes in Malaysia: An Analysis Based on Convicted Bribe Givers|A bribe-giving function was tested for Malaysia using data on 449 convicted bribe givers. Both the size of bribes and the probability of paying a large bribe were found to be positively and significantly associated with the size of fines and length of imprisonment avoided through bribery. Both the size of bribes and the probability of paying a large bribe increased with fines for bribery, however, but decreased with length of imprisonment. Our findings suggest that a reduction in human involvement in apprehending bribe givers, stricter enforcement, higher conviction rates, and more severe punishments could discourage bribes.
F65|China's Growth Slowdown and Prospects for Becoming a High-Income Developed Economy|After decades of hyper growth, China's economy has slowed significantly in recent years, causing widespread anxiety both within and outside the country. Although economists have not reached a consensus about China's growth potential, it is undeniable that the country has switched gears toward a “new normal” of moderate growth amidst ongoing structural change. To assess China's growth performance and prospects, this study modifies Masahiko Aoki's analytical framework of a unified growth theory into a multi-sector model and applies it to identify the sources of China's per capita income growth in recent decades. The analysis confirms Aoki's early observation that China entered the so-called “Kuznets phase” of development in the 1980s, which then became overlapped by the H-phase, in which human capital–based growth is characterized by high labor productivity growth. This study provides evidence that China's labor productivity growth has been predominantly driven by fixed capital formation. It also reveals that the Kuznets effect (with its labor reallocation effect) has now passed its peak and is fading away. The most alarming finding is that net total factor productivity (TFP) growth in the latest period has slowed to a near halt. This trend is particularly worrisome given that China has exhausted its past demographic dividend and its industrial structure has evolved to the end of industrialization stage. Meanwhile, demographic projections clearly indicate that China has entered what Aoki defined as the development phase of “post demographic transition.” Whether China can reverse the downward trend of TFP growth will determine how soon it can achieve the goal of becoming a high-income developed economy.
F65|Macroprudential policy and intra-group dynamics: The effects of reserve requirements in Brazil|This paper examines whether intra-group dynamics matter for the transmission of macroprudential policy. Using novel bank-level data on the Brazilian banking system, we investigate the effect of reserve requirements targeting headquarter banks' deposit share on credit supply by their municipal bank branches. For identification purposes, we exploit that reserve requirements are adjusted following global economic cycles. Our results reveal a lending channel of reserve requirements for branches whose parent banks are more exposed to targeted deposits. Branch ownership and exposure to internal liquidity are central in explaining the results. Our findings reveal limitations in current macroprudential policy frameworks.
F65|European versus Anglo-Saxon credit view: Evidence from the eurozone sovereign debt crisis|"We analyse whether different levels of country ties to Europe among the rating agencies Moody's, S&P, and Fitch affect the assignment of sovereign credit ratings, using the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis of 2009-2012 as a natural laboratory. We find that Fitch, the rating agency among the ""Big Three"" with significantly stronger ties to Europe compared to its two more US-tied peers, assigned on average more favourable ratings to Eurozone issuers during the crisis. However, Fitch's better ratings for Eurozone issuers seem to be neglected by investors as they rather follow the rating actions of Moody's and S&P. Our results thus doubt the often proposed need for an independent European credit rating agency."
F65|The International Impact of Financial Shocks: A Global VAR and Connectedness Measures Approach|This paper examines the international impact of shocks to a large array of measures of financial frictions and financial stress. The methodology employed in this paper is twofold, it firstly utilities the Global VAR (GVAR) approach and then employs a set of Generalized Connectedness Measures (GCM) to summarise the results of this analysis. These two methodologies provide a way to rank the relative importance of different measures of financial shocks on countries and macroeconomic variables. The methodologies are applied to a data set of 17 countries, over the period 1981Q1 to 2013Q1, with 12 separate measures of financial frictions and financial stress. Utilising connectedness index measures, it is found that financial stress measures constructed from the corporate bond market are the most in uential on global macroeconomic variables and that this result is also consistent across individual countries. It is found that many proposed measures of financial stress are not net transmitters of influence but are more dependent on external factors. The paper finds little evidence to support the use of credit as a financial shock variable as is common in the literature. This variable is found to be a weak transmitter of shocks and highly influenced by shocks to other variables.
F65|Globalization and Asset Returns|We provide a comprehensive analysis of the impact of economic and financial globalization on asset return comovements over the past 35 years. Our globalization indicators draw a distinction between de jure openness that results from changes in the regulatory environment and de facto or realized openness, as well as between capital market restrictions across different asset classes. Although globalization has trended positively for most of our sample, the global financial crisis and its aftermath have provided new headwinds. Equity, bond, and foreign exchange returns often have different responses to globalization. We generally find weak evidence of comovement measures reacting to globalization and often find other economic factors to be equally or more important determinants.
F65|Systemic and Idiosyncratic Sovereign Debt Crises|The theoretical literature on sovereign defaults has focused on adverse shocks to debtors' economies, suggesting that defaults are of an idiosyncratic nature. Still, sovereign debt crises are also of a systemic nature, clustered around panics in the financial center, such as the European Sovereign Debt Crisis in the aftermath of the US Subprime Crisis in 2008. Crises in the financial centers are rare disasters and, thus, their effects on the periphery can only be captured by examining long episodes. In this paper, we examine sovereign defaults from 1820 to the Great Depression, with a focus on Latin America. We find that 63% of the crises are of a systemic nature. These crises are different. Both the international collapse of liquidity and the growth slowdown in the financial centers are at their core. These global shocks trigger longer default spells and larger losses for investors.

F65|Fundamentals and Sovereign Risk of Emerging Markets|We empirically assess the relative importance of various economic fundamentals in accounting for the sovereign credit default swap (CDS) spreads of emerging markets during 2004-2012, which encompasses the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. Inflation, state fragility, external debt, and commodity terms of trade volatility were positively associated, while trade openness and more favourable fiscal balance/GDP ratio were negatively associated with sovereign CDS spreads. Yet the relative importance of economic fundamentals in the pricing of sovereign risk varies over time. The key factors are trade openness and state fragility in the pre-crisis period, external debt/GDP ratio and inflation in the crisis period, and inflation and public debt/GDP ratio in the post- crisis period. Asian countries enjoy lower sovereign spreads than Latin American countries, and this gap widened during and after the crisis. Trade openness was the biggest factor behind Asia's lower sovereign spreads before the crisis, and inflation during and after the crisis. The results imply that external factors were paramount in pricing sovereign risk prior to the crisis, but internal factors associated with the capacity to adjust to adverse shocks gained prominence during and after the crisis.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F65|Did Globalisation Influence Credit Market Deregulation?|We investigate whether globalization influenced credit market deregulation over the period 1970-2010. Globalization is measured by the KOF indices of globalization. Credit market deregulation is measured by the credit market freedom indicators of the Fraser Institute. The results from both cross-sectional and panel regressions using ordinary least squares indicate a positive correlation between globalization and credit market deregulation. We account for reverse causality by using predicted trade openness as an instrumental variable and show that this approach gives rise to different conclusions. Two-stage least squares estimations do not show that globalization had a causal influence on credit market deregulation.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F65|Determinants of Foreign Investment in the Brazilian Stock Market|The purpose of this paper is to identify determinants for foreign portfolio investment in the Brazilian stock market. From the viewpoint of the investors who have already allocated their resources in Brazilian Market, it was found that periods of greater local liquidity and lower correlation with developed markets promoted their activities (buys and sales); the Brazilian country risk (EMBI Br), domestic and external interest rates and recent past performance of the domestic market also showed as significant determinants for additional buys. For net inflows into the local stock market, as robust determinants were found the performance of developed markets and the domestic prime interest rate; the development of BM&F-Bovespa Stock Exchange, crisis environments, the recent Brazilian investment grade and the local diversification (in relation to a developed market) would be particularly relevant to the dynamics of foreign portfolio inflows in Brazil.
F65|Financial Development and Inequality in the Global Economy|We build a heterogeneous firms model with firm‐specific wages and credit frictions to study the role of financial development for inequality in the global economy. If there are many small (non‐exporting) firms, better access to external funds reduces wage and profit inequality as well as unemployment. In contrast, if there are many large (exporting) firms, financial development might have opposite effects – especially if trade costs are low. In summary, the implications of financial development for inequality depend on the size distribution of firms and on the costs of exporting. Trade liberalization, however, raises inequality unambiguously.
F65|Market Integration and Global Crashes|We develop an equilibrium model of real and financial market integration in which real firms and financial investors independently decide on their investment into different locations (countries). We show that, in the presence financial frictions, firms' real investment choices become strategic complements, leading to multiple, self-fulfilling equilibria. This fragility may lead to a global crash in which severe underinvestment into countries with under-developed financial markets spills over to countries connected to them by real investment linkages. We show that such global crashes are particularly severe when frictions are sufficiently symmetric across countries. By contrast, with enough asymmetry, the economy is likely to end up in a local crash equilibrium in which countries with low real investment barriers suffer the most.
F65|Is there macroprudential policy without international cooperation?|In this paper we address three questions: (1) Does global finance require a common prudential standard? (2) Does global finance require international cooperation in overseeing the system’s safety and soundness? And (3), does global finance require notification, cooperation and coordination of dynamic regulatory-policy adjustments? Our answer to the first question is that global finance does require a common prudential standard, defined as a level of required resilience, applied appropriately to all parts of the financial system. Without adoption of a common resilience standard, the international financial system will fragment and balkanize. In addressing the second question, we explain why shared, collective analysis is necessary to identify and mitigate stability-threatening shortfalls against that standard for resilience. This will be possible only with increased public and private transparency. Finally, we examine the daunting, but essential, task of implementing a dynamic prudential framework that maintains the system’s resilience even as its structure and risk-taking behaviors change. The policy implications of our analysis focus on the need for global agreement, implementation monitoring, information sharing and even, sometimes given damaging spillovers, collective regulatory responses to emerging threats. Institutions will need to be adapted to make all this feasible.
F65|Market Integration and Global Crashes|We develop an equilibrium model of real and financial market integration in which real firms and financial actors independently decide on their investment into different locations (countries). We show that, in the presence of financial frictions, firms' real investment choices may become strategic complements, leading to multiple, self-fulfilling equilibria, as well as to real fragility, whereby a small change in one country's fundamentals triggers a large large change in real investment everywhere. This fragility may lead to a global crash in which severe underinvestment into countries with under-developed financial markets spills over all other countries. We show that such global crashes are particularly severe when frictions are sufficiently symmetric across countries. By contrast, with enough asymmetry, the economy is likely to end up in a local crash equilibrium in which countries with low real investment barriers suffer the most.
F65|The Integration of International Financial Markets: An Attempt to Quantify Contagion in an Input-Output-Type Analysis|The increasing integration of international financial markets means that credit defaults in one country have to be covered by creditors in other countries. If the principle of creditor liability were applied systematically, the financial losses incurred by the financial institution that provided the credit and is thus directly affected by the default would be “passed on” through its domestic and foreign shareholders and debt holders, as well as their creditors, to the original savers. In this paper, this contagion effect will be estimated by taking international capital linkages into account. Analogously to an input-output analysis of interindustry linkages, savings used for investments in one country are traced back to the countries from which the funds originated. This also reveals the important role of international financial centers, which essentially serve as distributors of investment risks, while the financial losses are ultimately borne by larger countries with higher levels of savings.
F65|Dealing with large and volatile capital flows and the role of the IMF|The last decade has been characterised by the pronounced volatility of capital flows. While cross-border capital flows can have many benefits for both advanced and emerging market economies, they may also carry risks, which require appropriate policy responses. Disentangling the push from the pull factors driving capital flows is key to designing appropriate policies to deal with them. Strong institutions, sound fundamentals and a large domestic investor base tend to shield economies from adverse global conditions and attract less volatile types of capital. However, when the policy space for using traditional macroeconomic policies is limited, countries may also turn to macroprudential and capital flow management policies in a pragmatic manner. The IMF can play an important role in helping countries to deal with capital flows, through its surveillance and lending policy and through international cooperation.

F65|Limited Risk Sharing and International Equity Returns|I study international risk sharing with limited stock market participation and preference heterogeneity in each country. An incomplete market model jointly generates high cross-country equity return correlation and low aggregate consumption growth correlation, while matching salient features of asset prices. The model further generates several implications that I show in the data: 1) The stockholders' cross-country consumption growth correlation is considerably higher than that of the aggregate; 2) International bond flows help agents share the labor income risk only, while the country-specific financial income fluctuations are negatively correlated with equity inflows only; 3) The stockholders' consumption risk is priced in both the home and foreign equity markets. I show that the financial integration significantly improves the stockholders' welfare without benefiting the non-stockholders.
F65|Does Dividend Announcement Generate Market Signal? Evidence from Pakistan|This study is aimed at investigating the signaling effect of cash dividend announcements by employing the standard event methodology over the companies listed on Karachi Stock Exchange. The companies are randomly selected from different sectors that have announced cash dividends during calendar year 2010 and total 30 companies are included in the study. The standard event methodology is applied to explore the impact of cash dividend announcements upon stock returns and an event window of 15 days with dividend announcement date as the event day is constructed. The results show that the average abnormal returns (AARs), by and large, remained positive and statistically significant in post-event window days. The results of study tend to support dividend signaling hypothesis indicating that the dividend announcement may be used as a tool to generate positive signals in the market
F65|Interest Rate Liberalization, Quality institutions and Stock Market Development in Selected Sub-Saharan African Countries|The paper examines the long run effects of interest rate liberalization and institutional quality on the development of stock market in seven selected subSaharan African (SSA) countries using panel dataset that spans 1990-2013. The study employs dynamic heterogeneous panel method using the technique of pooled mean group. The results reveal that on the average liberalizing the interest rates has a negative long run impact on the development of the stock markets in the seven selected SSA economies. Institutional quality on the other hand has significant positive relationship with the development of stock market. The policy recommendation as a result of this finding is that liberalization of interest rates in the SSA region should be a guided one.
F65|The Impact of Working Capital Management on Firms Financial Performance: Evidence from Pakistan|The purpose of this study was to empirically explore the impact of working capital management (WCM) on firms performance of chosen manufacturing firms listed in Karachi stock exchange (KSE). The quantitative research methods, correlation matrix and multiple regressions, secondary data and purposive sampling have been worked out. Arandom sample of 50 listed non-financial companies on Pakistani Stock Market was selected for the period ranging from year 2005 to 2014. The WCM has been used as an independent variable, i.e., inventory turnover (ITO), cash conversion cycle (CCC), average collection period (ACP), and average payment period (APP). The firm performance (FP) has been used as dependent variable, i.e., return on asset (ROA), return on equity (ROE) and earning per share (EPS). The results of multiple regression articulated that the APP, ITO and CCC have negative and significant impact on ROA but ACP has positive and significant impact on ROA. While APP has negative significant impact on ROE. The ITO has negative significant impact on EPS while ACP has positive and statistically significant impact on. The study results advocated that the FP of selected firms is influenced by WCM. By validating the findings with previous researchers, this endeavor will contribute to the literature. It will be beneficial to the academic, social and practical deportment. The study findings endowed with deeper insights into WCM practices and present recommendations that in turn bring improvements in the FP of the targeted firms.
F65|The Effect of Financial Liberalization through the General Agreement on Trade and Services on Economic Growth in Developing Countries|This study investigates the influence of financial liberalization on economic growth in developing countries indirectly through their effect on financial development. It selects the size and activity of the financial system as indicators of financial development. The general agreement on trade and services (GATS) is a very useful option for developing countries to consolidate their financial sector reform to give foreign investors more certainty about financial investment opportunities in the economies of developing countries. This study chooses the level of commitments taking by developing countries in the GATS in banking sector as a measure of financial liberalization. The main objective is to examine the effect of developing countries financial liberalization commitments at the GATS on economic growth through their effect on the size and activity of the financial sector. According to the analysis conducted, the results show no real effect of the level of commitments taking by developing countries in the GATS on economic growth through their effect on the size and activity of financial development. Even though the effect of financial development on economic growth is positive, the effect of financial liberalization through the GATS on financial development is almost zero.
F65|The Role of the Gulf Cooperation Council’s Sovereign Wealth Funds in the New Era of Oil|Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) are investment vehicles by which governments invest some of a nation’s wealth in domestic and international financial markets. They are important for savings and stabilization economies, where long-term investments are key feature of successful SWFs’ investment strategies. Successful SWFs do not seek only for financial returns, but also social returns are critically considered as they play a vital role in their countries’ socioeconomic development. Considering the amount of capital accumulated in the global SWFs in general and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) funds in particular, oil prices plunge has forced the GCC’s to reassess income sources and spending. Precisely, extra attention has been paid for not only further investment plans, but also for developing critical strategies that aim to diversifying the GCC economies through the efficient allocation for resources and thereby provide economic development and independency. Therefore, this paper aim to analyse the current status of GCC’s SWFs and provide further suggestions in the new era of oil prices to enhance their role in the region. To do so, insights from other global successful SWFs, such that of Norway, have been considered. The main findings reveal that transparency is a key feature for SWFs growth and the gradual movement towards better practices in structure, governance, and investment behaviour. Knowledge transfers and foreign direct investment are also significant factors for local economic growth.
F65|Political risk and international valuation|Measuring the impact of political risk on investment projects is one of the most vexing issues in international business. One popular approach is to assume that the sovereign yield spread captures political risk and to augment the project discount rate by this spread. We show that this approach is flawed. While the sovereign spread is influenced by political risk, it also reflects other risks that are likely included in the valuation analysis — leading to the double counting of risks. We propose to use “political risk spreads” to undo the double counting in the evaluation of international investment projects.
F65|The Elephant In The Ground: Managing Oil And Sovereign Wealth|One of the most important developments in international finance and resource economics in the past twenty years is the rapid and widespread emergence of the $6 trillion sovereign wealth fund industry. Oil exporters typically ignore below-ground assets when allocating these funds, and ignore above-ground assets when extracting oil. We present a unified stylized framework for considering both. Subsoil oil should alter a fund’s portfolio through additional leverage and hedging. First-best spending should be a share of total wealth, and any unhedgeable volatility must be managed by precautionary savings. If oil prices are pro-cyclical, oil should be extracted faster than the Hotelling rule to generate a risk premium on oil wealth. Finally, we discuss how our analysis could improve the management of Norway’s fund in practice.
F65|Escaping financial crises? Macro evidence from sovereign wealth funds' investment behaviour|This paper investigates the determinants of the investment activity of Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) at a macro level, with special emphasis on the possible reaction to a financial crisis in a potential target economy. The analysis relies upon a specially built proprietary database, which encompasses 1,903 acquisition deals spanning the period 1995–2010 and involving 29 out of the 79 existing SWFs. According to a three-step modelling approach, we find that this class of investors prefers to invest in countries with a higher degree of economic development, larger and more liquid financial markets, institutions that offer better protection of legal rights, and a more stable macroeconomic environment. Most importantly, and in stark contrast with the existing empirical literature on other major institutional investors, SWFs seem to engage in ‘contrarian’ investment behaviour, i.e. increasing their acquisitions in countries where crises hit. The results are shown to be valid if we consider both the likelihood of a country being the target of SWFs' investments and the amount SWFs choose to invest in each country. Capital flows stemming from SWFs' acquisition activity worldwide may therefore have a stabilizing effect on local markets during periods of financial turmoil, protecting the targeted countries from foreign shocks instead of propagating them globally.
F65|Volatility spillovers across stock index futures in Asian markets: Evidence from range volatility estimators|This paper investigates the channels of volatility transmission across stock index futures in 6 major developed and emerging markets in Asia. We analyse whether the popular volatility spillovers tests are susceptible to the choice of range volatility estimators. Our results demonstrate strong linkages between markets within the Asian region, indicating that the signal receiving markets are sensitive to both negative and positive volatility shocks, which reveals the asymmetric nature of volatility transmission channels. We find that some markets play a destabilizing role while other countries - contrary to popular belief - have a stabilizing effect on other markets in Asia.
F65|Credit rating agency downgrades and the Eurozone sovereign debt crises|This paper studies the reaction of the Euro's value against major currencies to sovereign rating announcements from Moody's, S&P and Fitch CRAs during the Eurozone debt crisis in 2010–2012 based on event study methodology combined with GARCH models. We also analyze how the yields of French, Italian, German and Spanish government long-term bonds were affected by CRA announcements. Our results reveal that CRA downgrades, watchlist and outlook announcements had no impact on the value of the Euro currency but increased exchange rate volatility. At the same time, downgrades as well as negative outlook announcements increased the yields of French, Italian, and Spanish bonds and even affected the German bond's yields. This shows that the monetary union has led to a breakdown of the consequences of the rating shocks between currency value and sovereign bond yields. The reason is that part of the rating shock is absorbed by an internal repricing of sovereign bonds.
F65|Sovereign Wealth Funds' Internationalization Strategies: The Use of Investment Vehicles|In this paper, we examine the strategies used by sovereign wealth fund (SWF) investments in their cross-border investments. We investigate how SWFs internationalize their activities, specifically whether the use of investment vehicles as signal of passive investment approach to access foreign markets is influenced by SWF- and deal-specific characteristics and the presence of bilateral trade agreements between the SWFs and the target country. Our probit and multinomial logit estimates show that fund opacity, fund politicization, strategic industry targets, and majority ownership choices lead to a more likely use of vehicles, while bilateral trade agreements negatively affect such investment strategy. We also find that fund opacity increases the likelihood to use SWF-controlled vehicles, while fund politicization, strategic industry targets, and majority ownership choices increase the likelihood to use a corporate vehicle. Bilateral trade agreements reduce the use of corporate vehicles. Our results also indicate that politicized foreign SWFs are more likely to invest through vehicles located in third countries. On the other hand, when strategic industries are targeted, investment vehicles are likely to be located in the target country. Our results control for SWFs' strategic goals, SWF experience (reliance on external managers or advisors, fund size), type of funding sources, crisis period, deal-specific effects, and legal and institutional differences across countries and over time.
F65|Capital controls in Brazil: Effective?|A large theoretical literature emerged in recent years analyzing the positive and normative effects of capital controls, begging for empirical studies to validate it. No emerging market experimented as actively with controls on capital inflows as Brazil did since late 2009. This paper analyzes the impact of those measures. These policies had some success in segmenting the Brazilian from global financial markets, as measured by the spread between onshore and offshore dollar interest rates, as well as ADR premia relative to the underlying local stocks. The measures adopted from late 2009 to mid-2011 did not translate into significant changes in the exchange rate, suggesting limited success in mitigating exchange rate appreciation. However, the exchange rate strongly depreciates after a tax on the notional amount of derivatives is adopted in mid-2011. The last of the three restrictions studied may have depreciated the Brazilian real in the range from 4 to 10 percent. That strong response may have been driven by complementarities with the previous measures, as well as an unexpected easing in monetary policy.
F65|Do the size, value, and momentum factors drive stock returns in emerging markets?|This paper investigates the size, value, and momentum effects in 18 emerging stock markets during the period 1990–2013. We find that size and momentum strategies generally fail to generate superior returns in emerging markets. The value effect exists in all markets except Brazil, and it is robust to different periods and market conditions. Value premiums tend to move positively together across different markets, and such inter-market comovements increase overtime and during the global financial crisis.
F65|Linkages between financial sector CDS spreads and macroeconomic influence in a nonlinear setting|This paper investigates the asymmetric and nonlinear transmission of financial and energy prices to US five-year financial CDS sector index spreads for the banking, financial services and insurance sectors in the short- and long-run over the recent periods revolving around the global financial crisis. We employ the nonlinear ARDL (NARDL) model to account for the short- and long-run asymmetries in the sensitivity of those CDS sector index spreads to their determinants. Our findings suggest that there is evidence of short- and long-run nonlinearities and asymmetries in the adjustment process of the three CDS variables. There are also short- and long-run asymmetries in the influences of macroeconomic and financial variables on the CDS sector spreads. These findings are important for policymakers who deal with credit risks at the sector levels.
F65|The Global Value Chain and the Competitiveness of Asian Countries|This paper examines the competitiveness of industries in six Asian countries—China, India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan—using the World Input–Output Database tables from 1995 to 2011. Competitiveness is measured by the value-added that industries contribute to the production of final goods, which we refer to as global value chain (GVC) income, rather than by gross exports. We find that, unlike EU countries, Asian countries have generally been able to combine increasing GVC job opportunities with a rise in real income. The GVC income in Asian countries presents a different picture to that in European countries.
F65|The Process Towards The Centralisation Of The European Financial Supervisory Architecture; The Case Of The Banking Union|The EU’s institutional architecture for financial regulation, based upon the principles of decentralisation across countries, segmentation across sectors, and voluntary cooperation among national regulators was clearly unsuitable to deal with overall financial stability risks arising from the internationalisation and conglomeration of financial firms. Oppositions to a true European arrangement for burden-sharing, and potential distributional consequences in the event of a crisis of a cross border bank have been the main hurdle to centralisation at European-level financial supervision. At the same time, the objective to create a levelled playing field in the EU single market has been always considered the necessary condition to promote the openness of national financial markets and cross-border banking. The paper aims to demonstrate that, since a single EU financial regulator in a multi-currency area is definitely a no viable alternative, the banking union’s design is just a partial solution for financial stability problems arising from the fragmentation of the single market in the event of idiosyncratic or systemic banking crises. The analysis performed on non-euro countries’ assessments of the pros and cons in joining the banking union clearly shows that until the fiscal responsibility for financial stability remains at the national level, the regulatory centralisation at the EU level cannot severe the traditional divide between home and host supervisors.
F65|Macroeconomic and financial sector policies to better serve the economy and society|Financialisation processes have been generated by the widespread liberalization and deregulation measures adopted in most developed and emerging economies. The result of these processes has been an unparalleled increase in the size of financial systems. Recent empirical research is showing that the relation between the size of financial system and economic activity is not a linear one and that in many countries we can talk of a an excessive size of financial systems as far as the current size of finances is well above the threshold that leads to a negative impact of finance on economic activity and growth and welfare. On the other hand, financialisation has come in parallel, fuelling them and being fuelled by, a change in the macroeconomic policy strategy (with the dominance of a monetary policy focused on price stability), a re-distribution of income in favour of top incomes and capital incomes, and a de-regulation and liberalization of financial markets and institutions. The paper argues that to promote a better financial system, economic authorities must adopt measures rationalizing (i.e., reducing) the size of financial markets at the same time that a more strict regulation of all financial markets and units be implemented. Moreover, the strategy of macroeconomic policy must be reformed, upgrading the current role given to fiscal policy and giving more relevance to real economic objectives, like economic growth and full employment. Finally, there must be an income redistribution in favour of lowest incomes and labour incomes.
F65|Bad Bad Contagion|Bad contagion, the downside component of contagion in international stock markets, has negative implications for financial stability. I propose a measure for the occurrence and severity of global contagion that combines the factor-model approach in Bekaert et al. (2005) with the model-free or co-exceedance approach in Bae et al. (2003). Contagion is measured as the proportion of international stock markets that simultaneously experience unexpected returns beyond a certain threshold. I decompose contagion into its downside or bad component (the co-exceedance of low returns) and its upside or good component (the co-exceedance of high returns). I find that episodes of bad contagion are followed by a significant drop in country-level stock index prices and by a deterioration of financial stability indicators, especially for more open economies.
F65|Systemic and Idiosyncratic Sovereign Debt Crises|The theoretical literature on sovereign defaults has focused on adverse shocks to debtorsâ€™ economies, suggesting that defaults are of an idiosyncratic nature. Still, sovereign debt crises are also of a systemic nature, clustered around panics in the financial center such as the European Sovereign Debt Crisis in the aftermath of the U.S. Subprime Crisis in 2008. Crises in the financial centers are rare disasters and thus, their effects on the periphery can only be captured by examining long episodes. This paper examines sovereign defaults from 1820 to the Great Depression, with a focus on Latin America. We find that 63% of the crises are of a systemic nature. These crises are different. Both the international collapse of liquidity and the growth slowdown in the financial centers are at their core. These global shocks trigger longer default spells and larger investorsâ€™ losses.
F65|The Dollar dominance : recent episode of trade invoicing and debt issuance|The international monetary system is known to be asymmetric given the dominant use of a few international currencies. The international trade of developing countries is mainly invoiced in US dollars, unlike industrialized countries which invoice a much higher share of their exports in their home currencies. The same logic is at work in the issuance of international debt. While the attempts to challenge the supremacy of the US dollars have failed in most cases, China is coming to the fore and is increasing its use of the Renminbi, even supported by its growing recognition within the International Monetary Fund. By reassessing the relevance of existing academic works, this paper demonstrates how monetary asymmetries have been reinforced in recent decades, and offers explanations related to currency choices. Finally, this paper offers the conclusion that international monetary reform is necessary. One cannot overlook that the monetary system embodies a major constraint on the sovereignty of developing countries and that some developing countries have set out to challenge the US dollar usage
F65|A long-term perspective on private equity ownership|Private equity companies are targets to a never-ending controversy debate about their contribution to the economy. The existing empirical data provide, on the one hand, strong evidence that private equity activity contribute positively to efficiency of companies, but they are often viewed as short-term investors who utilize firms’ resources. In this paper I find no empirical support for that claim. By a unique dataset that covers all majority buyouts in Sweden by Swedish private equity firms from 1997-2010 I end up following 680 portfolio firms before and after the buyout as well as after the exit and a peer group defined by industry, size, age and financial performance. I do, however, find that the firms actually performs better after they exit from the private equity firm, which might be a result of sustainable long-term investments rather than short-termism.
F65|Do Economic Reforms Spur Bancarisation Rate in the CEMAC Region? Empirical Analysis|The aim of this paper is to empirically analyze the effect of the economic reforms on the bancarisation rate in the Central Africa Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC). Data of six countries from the sub-region from 2001 to 2011 was used in a generalized method of moment (GMM) modeling framework. The following results are obtained: Financial liberalization has facilitated the opening of bank accounts. The opening of bank accounts demand is an increasing function of Gross Domestic Product per capita. The literacy rate contributes to the improvement of financial and banking services. Public and private infrastructures promote decentralization and delocalization of the banking network to smaller cities and rural areas. Institutional reforms work best for increasing the bancarisation rate where financial and banking activities are weak. So, the economic policy to be implemented is to continue the economic and financial reforms and ameliorate the quality of the institutions in the CEMAC region.
F65|A magyar bankrendszer tulajdonosi struktúrájának átalakulása<BR>[Transformation of the ownership structure of the Hungarian banking system]|A cikk a szakirodalmi áttekintést követően az elmúlt három évtized magyar banktörténelmén keresztül vizsgálja meg, hogy milyen szerepe volt a bankrendszerek tulajdonosi struktúrájának a válság kialakulásában, illetve a válság negatív hatásainak leküzdésében. Az 1988-ban létrehozott - többségi állami, illetve szűk belföldi tulajdonosi háttérrel jellemezhető - magyar bankrendszer összerogyott az 1990-es transzformációs válságának súlya alatt, viszont az ezredfordulón kialakult, többségi külföldi tulajdonnal jellemezhető struktúra ellenállónak bizonyult a 2008-as válság idején. A jelenlegi, az állam erőteljes szerepvállalásával kialakulóban lévő új banktulajdonosi szerkezet - amelyben a külföldi befektetők kiszorulnak, s előnyt élveznek a hazai szűk tulajdonosi hátterű bankok - nem feltétlenül erősíti a bankrendszer válsággal szembeni ellenálló képességét. A struktúraváltás mellett felhozott érvek az irodalom és a banktörténelem fényében nem tűnnek megalapozottnak.* Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) kód: F21, F23, F65, G01, G21, G28.
F65|Financial and Econometric Study of the Sustainability and Evaluation of Scenarios of Reforms for the Civil Regime of Moroccan|The decline in the demographic ratio corollary to the maturity of the regime and in particular its generosity raise the question of the medium-and long-term financial sustainability of the civil pension scheme of the Moroccan pension fund. This article studies the financial sustainability of civil regimes and evaluates the options for reforms envisaged by the government mainly parametric reform. In this framework, an actuarial and financial model based on demographic assumptions and macroeconomic parameters is constructed and used to analyze the financial sustainability of the status quo regime and the projected regime and also to test the parametric reform. We also use econometric tests such as non-stationarity, causality and cointegration between technical recipes and technical expenditures to empirically evaluate the sustainability of civil scheme of pensions. This paper concludes that the parametric reform of our civil pay-as-you-go system is unsustainable. It would therefore be in favor of other remedial measures and reform strategies to improve and enhance the financial sustainability of the fund, such as the model based on the addition of a funded pillar, and unification of all funds in a single integrated system.
F65|Financial Contagion in EFA Markets in Crisis Periods: A Multivariate GARCH Dynamic Conditional Correlation Framework|This paper uses the multivariate GARCH dynamic conditional correlation framework proposed by Engle (2002) to investigate time-varying conditional correlation between developed markets and emerging and frontier Asian (EFA) markets. It employs monthly returns data for 2000–14 to capture the potential contagion in developed (the US, Europe and Japan) and EFA stock markets. A key finding is the increasing conditional correlation among EFA and developed markets, especially during the 2008 financial crisis. The study finds that, during periods of financial turmoil, EFA markets are exposed to shocks and spillover effects from developed markets along with a substantial shift in the regime of conditional correlation. This has important implications for investors interested in diversifying portfolios in EFA markets during financial crises.
F65|Import Competition and the Composition of Firm Investments|We study how foreign competition affects the composition of investments inside firms. A parsimonious model predicts that firms have an incentive to shift their investments towards more short-term assets when exposed to tougher competition. Using data on expenditures of listed US companies into various asset classes with different lifespans, we document empirical evidence that is consistent with this prediction. Over a fifteen year period between 1995 and 2009, the rise in import competition is associated with a reduction of the firm-specific asset lifespan by about 4.5% on average. We additionally exploit the Chinese WTO accession as an exogenous shock in firm expectations about future exposure to competition.
F65|Real Exchange Rates and Growth|This paper empirically investigates the impact of real exchange rates (RER) on growth of a large number of advanced (AE) and developing economies (DE) by employing the recent non-stationary panel data estimation procedures to estimate conventional growth models augmented with global financial and monetary conditions variables. Our results suggest that, the expansionary depreciation findings for DE are often based on a misinterpretation of an error correction mechanism coefficient. We find that external variables representing global financial and monetary conditions are strongly significant in explaining growth in DE along with the conventional variables including trade openness, human capital, domestic savings. Our data support the view that RER depreciations are contractionary for DE with high external debt and expansionary for AE. Higher trade openness enhances the contractionary impact of RER depreciations in both AE and DE. These results are found to be robust for different RER and per capita real income measures.
F65|Key features of the Chinese bond market|In the 21st century, China ranks among the global leaders based on quantitative factors, not only from a real economy perspective but also from a financial one. It is the largest exporter and one of the biggest economies in the world. Based on the IMF’s decision, the Chinese currency will be included in the SDR basket containing the major currencies of the world. Currently, the world’s third largest bond market is found in China. It is huge both in real economy and financial terms, and foreign investors are gradually being granted access to this market, at the pace and to the extent determined by Chinese regulators. The onshore bond market that has been opening up at an increasing pace recently and the offshore bond market that will mark its 10th anniversary next year may be uncharted territory for financial institutions. Entry to the market may be facilitated by gaining information about the characteristics of the market. This article presents the key features of the Chinese bond markets from both the issuer and the investor side, examining the individual market segments as well, and pointing out the opportunities and expected paths of development on the markets. In addition, we demonstrate how the Chinese bond markets fit into the political efforts targeting the achievement of global currency status for RMB.
F65|Prudential measures in dealing with capital flows – case of Poland|In the run up to the financial crisis of 2007-2009 many emerging market economies, including Poland, were affected by considerable inflows of capital – capital that their financial systems found difficult to absorb. One of a number of policy options to respond to such inflows are currency-based measures (CBMs) directed at banks that are, in principle, motivated by (macro-)prudential concerns. These measures are bank regulations that apply a discrimination on the basis of the currency of an operation, typically foreign currencies. This paper presents and analyses a dataset of CBMs directed at banks in Poland between 2005 and 2013. We denote the motivations for imposing CBMs and assess their effectiveness by measuring their impact on capital flows. We find that there is evidence of negative impact of CBMs on capital inflows in the first quarter after the measure starts to be in effect. It means that actions have targeted capital inflows – despite the declared (macro-)prudential purpose of the measures. However, we also find that the model implies a stronger effect when the variable of unweighted CBMs is used. Moreover, the model implies a strong relationship between capital inflows and the exchange rate. However, we do not find the impact of CBMs on the exchange rate.
F65|International Borrowing Cycles: A New Historical Database|The ongoing slowdown in international capital flows has brought again to the attention the booms and bust cycles in international borrowing. Many suggest that capital flow bonanzas are excessive, ending in crises. One of the most frequently mentioned culprits are the cycles of monetary easing and tightening in the financial centers. More recently, the 2008 Subprime Crisis in the United States has also been blamed for the retrenchment in capital flows to both developed and developing countries. To further understand international capital flow cycles, I construct a new database on capital flows spanning the first episode of financial globalization from 1820 to 1931. During this episode, monetary policy in the financial center is constrained by the adherence to the Gold Standard, thus providing a benchmark for global cycles in the absence of an active role of central banks in the financial centers. Also, panics in the financial center are rare disasters that can only be studied in this longer episode of financial globalization. This paper presents the historical data with an example for Latin America.
F65|Basel III: In quest for criteria and scenarios of the banking regulation reform advancement|The article looks into the spillover effect of the sweeping overhaul of financial regulation, also known as Basel III, for credit institutions. We found that new standards of capital adequacy will inevitably put downward pressure on ROE that in turn will further diminish post-crisis recovery of the banking industry. Under these circumstances, resilience of systemically important banks could be maintained through cost optimization, repricing, and return to homogeneity of their operating models, while application of macroprudential regulation by embedding it into new regulatory paradigm would minimize the effect of risk multiplication at micro level. Based on the research we develop recommendations for financial regulatory reform in Russia and for shaping integrated banking regulation in the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU).
F65|Assessment of the place of the Russian Federation in the global financial market|The article presents the results of the study that assesses the place of Russia in the global financial market. The current ratings of the global competitiveness of national financial markets and financial centers are based on objective and subjective assessment of the competitive factors. Our approach is based on objective indicators, characterizing the results of the competition, including the proportion of countries in the global financial market, P/E, and others. The article presents the results of calculations of Russia’s place in the global financial market, based on which the conclusions about the causes of the loss of positions, weak links of the Russian financial market, competitors success factors are made.
F65|Tax Havens in the Offshore World|The research on tax havens started because of the “Panama Papers” scandal. Tax havens exist because of taxation. Taxation is vital for any society because it is a revenue source for government. Through taxation governments get money to fulfil their role in society. It plays a major role in investment decisions and can be also an innoportunity for taxpayers. Tax havens are tax free areas that have the status of states and function legally. Their main business is to attract money by creating taxpayers friendly environments and by total secrecy. Panama is the biggest USinfluenced tax haven. Tax evasion through tax havens is illegal and is the evading of declaring and paying taxes. Tax avoidance through tax havens is the legally avoiding of declaring and paying taxes. Tax havens are not illegal but are immoral because vast amounts of money drain from the states around the world to them.
F65|Analysis of Revenues and Expenditures of a Carrier for a Voyage Charter Trip|Private finance is financial relations which runs between autonomous individuals and legal entities other than the state or public institutions, all as subjects who are under commercial law. Creation and use of financial resources in this area takes place on the basis of revenue and expenditure drawn up and approved, under their own operation statutes approved and registered with state institutions, and the control over how their execution runs and is reported is also stated in the statute.
F65|Peru's selective default: A stain on its creditworthiness|In the 1970s, while a leftist military dictatorship ruled Peru, more than 22 million acres of cultivated or grazing farmland -- one-third of Peru’s total agricultural acreage -- were expropriated from thousands of large owners as part of a property reform intended to benefit up to 400,000 landless peasant families. The compensation provided to landowners was miserly, however: on average, it was less than one-tenth the then-prevailing market price of water-accessible, cultivated land. Moreover, about 85 percent of total recognized land values were settled not in cash but with long-term Agrarian Debt Bonds, which committed future governments to honor fixed coupons on obligations maturing in 20 to 30 years. These bonds became worthless during the 1980s, however, because hyperinflation raged and the Peruvian currency lost most of its value. In the wake of the filing of hundreds of lawsuits seeking judicial redress, in 2001 the country’s Constitutional Tribunal ruled that the government should resume payment of the land-reform debt after updating its nominal value on an actuarial basis. And yet, successive administrations did not act on this ruling, despite the fact that since the mid-1990s Peru has exhibited vigorous economic growth, significantly strengthened public finances, and substantially improved creditworthiness, such that governments have had more than the necessary ample fiscal resources to redeem the land-reform bonds at their full, original value. This paper examines the evidence and concludes that we are in the presence of a case of blatant unwillingness to pay, one which undermines Peru’s claim to be a nation that is creditworthy, investor-friendly, and respectful of the rule of law.
F65|Uniunea Pietelor de capital - un proiect esential pentru Europa<BR>[Capital Markets Union - a vital project for Europe]|Within the optimisation effort associated with the European financial markets integration special attention is paid to two important initiatives: the Banking Union and the Capital Markets Union (CMU). Both projects are also important for Romania, considering the current status of the economy and financial market, as well as the country’s long and medium term priorities. Banking Union is targeting a full integration of the banking markets by employing a Single Supervisory Mechanism and Single Resolution Mechanism and a single deposit guarantee framework. In a similar manner, CMU is aiming at the creation of a single capital market across Europe in order to maximise the benefits associated with cross – border risk sharing and bring the highest possible level of compatibility when it comes to national legal frameworks. CMU is focused on identifying new and improved solutions for an efficient use of the available financial resources – making such resources available where they are needed, especially when it comes to infrastructure projects and SME financing.
F65|Sovereign Debt Restructuring After Argentina|Abstract Sovereign debt restructurings may experience marginal changes as a result of recent modifications in contractual terms being incorporated into new bond issues, but for the most part they will likely resemble what has generally worked so well in recent decades to the satisfaction of most governments and private creditors. The statutory reforms that have been proposed to date are highly unlikely to gain traction for a variety of reasons, including the prospect that they would have been stymied when confronted with a rogue sovereign debtor such as Argentina.
F65|The Origins of Argentina’s Litigation and Arbitration Saga, 2002-2016|The voluminous and protracted litigation and arbitration saga featuring the Republic of Argentina (mostly as defendant or respondent, respectively) established important legal and arbitral precedents, as illustrated by three cases involving Argentina which were appealed all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court and were settled in 2014. At first glance, the scale of Argentina-related litigation activity might be explained by the sheer size of the government’s 2001 default, the world’s largest-ever up to that point. However, its true origins were the unusually coercive, aggressive way that the authorities in that country went about defaulting on, and restructuring, their sovereign debt obligations, as well as the radical, seemingly irreversible changes to the “rules of the game” affecting foreign strategic investors, which broke binding commitments prior governments had made in multiple bilateral investment treaties.
F65|The process towards centralisation of the European financial supervisory architecture: The case of the Banking Union|The evolution of the EU supervisory architecture has demonstrated that it took the risk of a euro break-up to just barely overcome the political resistances to centralisation by Member States and their supervisors. In the two-tier Europe that is emerging after the euro crisis, the integrity of the single market seems today crucially interlinked with the success of the banking union and its attractiveness for non-euro countries. The banking union’s design, without a credible common fiscal backstop, remains however a partial solution to the financial stability issues arising from the fragmentation of the EU financial market in the event of banking crises. The analysis performed on non-euro countries’ assessments of the pros and cons of joining the banking union aims to show that until fiscal responsibility for financial stability remains at the national level, regulatory centralisation cannot sever the traditional divide between home and host supervisors.
F65|Comparison Of The Profitability Of Top 1000 Firms In Canada And Usa|This study examines large Canadian and US firms to decompose the variation of firm profitability into year, industry, year-industry and firm components. Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE) and Return on Sales (ROS) provide three measures of firm profitability. For all three measures and both countries, firm effects provide the biggest contribution to the variability in firm profits with year-industry effects second, year effects third, and industry effects last. These results match those of previous studies. Comparing Canadian and US firms, firm effects explain more of the variation in the profitability of Canadian firms. Finally, the combination of industry, year and firm factors explain more the overall variation in profitability of our sample of Canadian firms than our sample of US firms.
F65|Reforms to the European Union Financial Supervisory and Regulatory Architecture and Their Implications for Asia|European Union (EU) countries offer a unique experience of financial regulatory and supervisory integration, complementing various other European integration efforts following the Second World War. Financial regulatory and supervisory integration was a very slow process before 2008, despite significant cross-border integration, especially of wholesale financial markets. However, the policy framework proved inadequate in the context of the major financial crisis in the EU starting in 2007, and especially in the euro area after 2010. That crisis triggered major changes to European financial regulation and to the financial supervisory architecture, most prominently with the creation of three new European supervisory authorities in 2011 and the gradual establishment of European banking union starting in 2012. The banking union is a major structural institutional change for the EU, arguably the most significant since the introduction of the euro. Even in its current highly incomplete form, and with no prospects for rapid completion, the banking union has improved financial supervision in the euro area and increased the euro area’s resilience. Asian financial integration lags well behind Europe, and there is no comparable political and legal integration. Nevertheless, Asia can draw useful lessons from European experiences in multiple areas that include the harmonization of the microprudential framework, proper macroprudential structures, and participation in global financial authorities.
F65|Do foreign banks take more risk? Evidence from emerging economies|This paper addresses the impact of foreign ownership on the risk-taking behavior of banks. Using bank-level panel data of more than 1300 commercial banks in 32 emerging economies during 2000–2013, we find that foreign owned banks take on more risk than their domestic counterparts. We further examine several factors that may potentially contribute to foreign banks’ differentiated riskiness from four perspectives, namely, foreign banks’ informational disadvantages, agency problems, the contagious effect of parent banks’ financial conditions and the disparity between home and host markets. We find supportive evidence that these factors play a significant role in affecting foreign banks’ risk-taking.
F65|The Dollar Dominance : Recent Episode of Trade Invoicing and Debt Issuance|The international monetary system is known to be asymmetric given the dominant use of a few international currencies. The international trade of developing countries is mainly invoiced in US dollars, unlike industrialized countries which invoice a much higher share of their exports in their home currencies. The same logic is at work in the issuance of international debt. While the attempts to challenge the supremacy of the US dollars have failed in most cases, China is coming to the fore and is increasing its use of the Renminbi, even supported by its growing recognition within the International Monetary Fund. By reassessing the relevance of existing academic works, this paper demonstrates how monetary asymmetries have been reinforced in recent decades, and offers explanations related to currency choices. Finally, this paper offers the conclusion that international monetary reform is necessary. One cannot overlook that the monetary system embodies a major constraint on the sovereignty of developing countries and that some developing countries have set out to challenge the US dollar usage.
F65|The role of financial institutions in advancing responsible value chains|2015 was a landmark year for making businesses aware of the consequences of their actions on society. The adoption by the UN of the Global Goals for Sustainable Development and the Paris Climate Agreement are important steps in this regard. The private sector has an important role to play in the realization of the promises made. The financial services sector should be a key driver of public and private sectors to support (by research) and realize (by co-funding) this agenda. It is a business opportunity and a societal obligation. This article explores why and how this sector may become the key driver for the transformative momentum, what it can do itself, and how others (governments, civil society organizations) should support and enable it.
F65|The Analysis of the Efficiency of Capital Investments in Trade of Serbia|The capital investments are significant factor of efficiency of trading companies business. The aim of this work is to empirically research the efficiency of capital expenditure in fixed assets of trading companies, with detailed insight into Serbia. All the relevant methods of research are applied, above all comparative and statistical analysis. The results of the research show that the efficiency of fixed capital expenditure of trading companies in Serbia are significantly lower compared to countries with developed market economy and EU. It is the result of unfavourable business conditions and low purchasing power of citizens. The main contribution of this work is to indicate the need of undertaking relevant measures by managers of trading companies so as to improve efficiency of capital expenditures in fixed assets, as important determinant of overall performance. These measures are primarily related to stronger implementation of modern technology, faster development of electronic trade, research, development and innovation.
F65|What drives cross-border bank expansion? Answers from Kenya|"This paper investigates the drivers of bank foreign expansion in East Africa. Our results support the view that institutional quality is vital at the planning phase of banksâ€™ going-abroad decision but its importance is muted once the decision has been taken. Second, relatively competitive markets and weak market power at home seem to ""push"" banks abroad. Third, banks seek to exploit the benefits of their relative efficiency through regional expansion. Fourth, relatively higher foreign country inflation is a deterrent to banks expansion abroad. Finally, desire for greater earnings, economic integration, and follow-the-client hypothesis do not explain banksâ€™ foreign expansion decisions."
F65|FDI in Central and Eastern Europeâ€™s (CEE) Agribusiness|Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) had adopted restricted industrialization policy until 1990. The economic and social transition started after 1990, providing free atmosphere for foreign investments in CEE. Due to such interference, the early eminent countries were replaced by new eminent ones. This article examines the affirmative as well as unimpressed role of foreign direct investment (FDI) in agribusiness in CEE during 1990sâ€“2000s. Like CEE, India was also a restricted economy until 1991. As a part of continuing reforms, India has recently allowed a bulk of FDI in agribusiness sectors which have prompted farmers and local industrialists to raise their voice against such decision. Agriculture, being a livelihood of major population, needs a better farmâ€“firm link through investment. Evidence from the CEE has proved many positive outcome of FDI. However, India cannot ignore some eccentric lessons from CEE.
F65|Impact Of The Global Financial Crises On The Major Asian Countries And Usa Stock Markets And Inter-Linkages Among Them|This study set out to examine impact of the global financial crisis on the stock markets returns of China, Japan, India, and USA through E-GARCH model and further it investigates the nature of volatility spillovers between stock indices during the global financial meltdown using Granger Causality test. Daily stock prices are used for the period from 6th of January, 2006 to 22nd of April 2011. The main findings are as follows; in all stock markets high volatility and setback on the daily returns exist due to the financial crisis. Further the global financial crisis less affected China?s stock exchange than the other stock markets whereas it influenced USA stock markets in large extent. Also stock returns volatility get moderated in the major Asian Countries stock markets after post crisis period but it has been remained in USA stock exchanges. Granger causality test shows that after the onset of the financial crisis, the USA stock markets have bidirectional influences on each other, but didn?t receive any volatility spillover from major Asian Countries stock markets. Indian stock market receives volatility spillover from all the stock markets. Japanese stock market receives volatility spillover only from USA stock markets. Chinese stock exchange doesn?t receive any volatility spillover from stock exchanges which examined in this paper.
F65|Impact Of The Global Financial Crises On The Major Asian Countries And Usa Stock Markets And Inter-Linkages Among Them|This study examines the impact of the global financial crisis on the stock markets returns of China, Japan, India, and USA through E-GARCH model. In addition, it investigates the nature of volatility spillovers between stock indices during the global financial meltdown employing Granger Causality test. Daily stock prices are used for the period from 6th of January, 2006 to 22nd of April 2011. The main findings are as follows. First, in all stock markets high volatility and setback on the daily returns exist due to the financial crisis. Further the global financial crisis less affected Shanghai stock exchange than the other stock markets whereas it influenced the USA stock markets in large extent. Also stock returns volatility get moderated in the major Asian Countries stock markets after post crisis period but it has been remained in the USA stock exchanges. Secondly, Granger causality test shows that after the onset of the financial crisis, the USA stock markets have bidirectional influences on the each of other market, but didn?t receive any volatility spillover from major Asian Countries stock markets. Indian stock market experiences volatility spillover from all the stock markets. Japanese stock market receives volatility spillover only from USA stock markets. However, Shanghai stock exchange doesn?t experience any volatility spillover from the other stock markets.
F65|The banking sector and the Swiss financial account during the financial and European debt crises:|The US financial crisis and the later Eurozone crisis have substantially affected capital flows into and out of financial centers like Switzerland. We focus on the pattern of capital flows involving the Swiss banking industry. We first rely on balance-of-payment statistics and show that net banking inflows rose during the acute phases of the crises, albeit with a contrasting pattern. In the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, net inflows were driven by a large retrenchment towards the domestic market by Swiss banks. By contrast, the net inflows from mid-2011 to mid-2012 were driven by large flows into Switzerland by foreign banks. We then use more detailed data from the Swiss banking statistics which allow us to contrast the situation across different banks and currencies. We show that the cycle during the US crisis in bank flows was driven strongly by exposures in US dollars, and to a large extent by Swiss-owned banks. During the Eurozone crisis by contrast, the flight to the Swiss franc and the move away from the Euro was also driven by banks that are located in Switzerland, yet are foreign-owned. In addition, while the demand for the franc was driven by both foreign and domestic customers during mid-2011 to early 2013, domestic demand took a prominent role thereafter.
F65|Macro-financial linkages and bank behaviour: evidence from the second-round effects of the global financial crisis on East Asia|Abstract This paper studies the link between macro-financial variability and bank behaviour, which justifies the second-round effects of the global financial crisis on East Asia. Following Gallego et al. (The impact of the global economic and financial crisis on Central Eastern and South Eastern Europe (CESEE) and Latin America, 2010), the second round effects are defined as the adverse feedback loop from the slumps in economic activities and sharp financial market deterioration, which may influence the financial performance of bank, inter alia via deteriorating credit quality, declining profitability and increasing problems in retaining necessary capitalization. Differentiating itself from other research, this study stresses adjustments in four dimensions of bank performance and behaviour: asset quality, profitability, capital adequacy, and lending behaviour, assuming that any change in a bank-specific characteristic is induced by endogenous adjustments of the others. The empirical results based on partial adjustment models and two-step system GMM estimation show that bank’s adjustment behaviour is subject to the variation in the macro-financial environment and the stress condition in the global financial market. There is no convincing evidence to support the effectiveness of policy rate cut to boots bank lending and to avoid a financial accelerator effect.
F65|Capital market financing, firm growth, and firm size distribution|How many and which firms issue equity and bonds in domestic and international markets, how do these firms grow relative to non-issuing firms, and how does firm performance vary along the firm size distribution? To evaluate these questions, a new data set is constructed by matching data on firm-level capital raising activity with balance sheet data for 45,527 listed firms in 51 countries. Three main patterns emerge from the analysis. (1) Only a few large firms issue equity or bonds, and among them a small subset has raised a large proportion of the funds raised during the 1990s and 2000s. (2) Issuers grow faster than non-issuers in assets, sales, and employment, that is, firms do not simply use securities markets to adjust their financial accounts. (3) The firm size distribution of issuers evolves differently from that of non-issuers, tightening among issuers and widening among non-issuers.
F65|Financial development and inequality in the global economy|We build a heterogeneous-firms model with firm-specific wages and credit frictions to study the role of financial development for inequality in the global economy. If there are many small firms, better access to external funds reduces wage inequality and unemployment. In contrast, if there are many high-productive firms (those that export), financial development may have opposite effects -- especially if trade costs are low. In sum, the implications of financial development for inequality depend on the size distribution of firms and on the costs of exporting. Trade liberalization, however, raises inequality unambiguously.
F65|Nonlinearities and Parameter Instability in the Finance-Growth Nexus|This paper offers a re-assessment of the finance-growth nexus in a framework that allows to distinguish between short-run versus long-run effects. Our dataset contains information on 45 developed and developing countries over the period 1995-2011. We make use of the integration and cointegration properties of the data, establish a cointegrating relation and derive the long-run elasticities of per capita GDP with respect to employment, the physical capital stock, and financial development. We employ these results to specify an error correction model and assess whether the years of crisis have changed the relationship between finance and growth.
F65|Explaining Foreign Holdings of Asia's Debt Securities: The Feldstein-Horioka Paradox Revisited|In this paper, we find that home bias is still present in all economies and regions, especially in the case of short-term debt securities, but that there are substantial variations among economies and regions in the strength of home bias, with the Eurozone economies, the US, and developing Asia showing relatively weak home bias and advanced Asia, especially Japan, showing relatively strong home bias. We then examine trends over time in foreign holdings of debt securities and find that capital has been flowing from the US and the Eurozone economies to both advanced Asia (especially Japan) and developing Asia and that foreign holdings of debt securities have been increasing in advanced as well as developing Asia but for different reasons. The main reason in the case of advanced Asia (especially Japan) appears to be higher risk-adjusted returns, whereas the main reason in the case of developing Asia appears to be the growth of debt securities markets combined with relatively weak home bias and (in the case of short-term securities) lower exchange rate volatility. Finally, we find that since the Global Financial Crisis, foreign holdings of debt securities have declined (i.e., that home bias has strengthened) in all economies and regions except developing Asia, where they have increased (except for a temporary decline in 2008) but where their share is still much lower than the optimal share warranted by the capital asset pricing market model.
F65|The Development Of The Romanian’S Capital Market And Its Importance In The European Economy|A modern competitive economy, able to adapt to the current globalization is not conceivable without the existence and function of efficient capital markets. Capital is the lifeblood that feeds the economy, and if the channels in which the sap is insufficient, non-existent or wrong cut, economic progress is questioned. Capital market through its specific mechanisms, materializes and centralize capital, especially should provide tools and products to ensure the fruition of investments and hedging. It is a market that offers the most diverse investment opportunities and in which success depends on the training and knowledge. The international financial markets, the extent and speed with which it evolves in a process of unprecedented change. By their functioning stock markets have always been characterized by a high degree of sensitivity to changes that occur at the level of investors, the developments and prospects of the real economy and the financial system. The international economy is continuously restructuring and transition, impacting all nations, they are forced to adapt to the rapid changes taking place in the world. This restructuring is driven by two dynamic forces and interdependent: deepening of globalization of the world economy and the emergence and development of regional economic arrangements. Due to inadequate risk management, risk assessment of weaknesses in the credit rating agencies of failure to properly apply the rules and supervision, the existing regulatory and supervisory framework failed to prevent the crisis. Against the backdrop of globalization and integration of capital in the single market of the European Union, we made a radiograph of the domestic capital market to capture the main problems faced and developments and prospects.
F65|Financial Inclusion, Rather Than Size, Is The Key To Tackling Income Inequality|In this paper, we assess empirically whether financial inclusion contributes to reducing income inequality when controlling for other key factors, such as economic development and fiscal policy. We conclude that financial inclusion contributes to reducing income inequality to a significant degree, while the size of the financial sector does not. Although our results are still preliminary and constrained by data limitations, they still bear significant policy implications. More specifically, fostering financial inclusion has one more important by-product, which had hardly been analyzed yet, namely reducing income inequality. More specifically, given the broad definition of financial inclusion used in our analysis, promoting financial inclusion implies facilitating the use of credit to low-income households, as well as granting credit to small and medium-sized enterprises.
F65|International monetary spillovers|In recent years, interest rates have moved closely together worldwide, even though business cycles have been at different stages across countries. Boris Hofmann and Elod Takáts (BIS) ask how far international monetary spillovers have driven this co-movement, ie whether interest rates in core advanced economies are driving interest rates elsewhere. Studying 30 emerging market and smaller open advanced economies since 2000, they find that (i) US short- and long-term interest rates significantly affect the corresponding rates in other economies and (ii) these price spillovers do in part reflect policy spillovers. In other words, US monetary policy rates do influence policy rates in other countries more than might be expected from normal spillovers of macroeconomic conditions.
F65|The Basel Iii Approach On Liquidity Risk|The Basel III agreement has emerged due to the need for a more efficient risk management in banking in order to prevent banking crises. The vision presented by Basel III and then taken over by European regulations is much stricter than earlier agreements, one of the novelties brought by this agreement being the introduction of indicators to monitor the liquidity risk. Through this work we aim to perform an analysis on how to determine the indicators, because in general, these indicators are present only in their synthetic shape but the practical determination is complex and causes difficulties, particularly for small banks.
F65|Foreign Direct Investment Inflows To Africa: Overview And Current Trends (Toky Priamych Zahraničných Investícií Do Afriky: Prehľad A Súčasné Trendy)|Africa has in the long-term been the lowest-income and the most underdeveloped region of the world economy with a marginal share in world GDP and influence on the international economic order. Most of its inhabitants suffer from a lack of basic human needs. However, nowadays some African countries are seeing rapid GDP growth and increasing FDI inflows for various reasons. The aim of this paper is to present the current economic situation in Africa and to examine its FDI inflows and their relations to economic progress in Africa. The paper’s conclusions, based especially on an analysis of foreign scientific papers and reports published by international organizations, indicate some forms of a relation between GDP growth and FDI inflows in Africa, but also admit that this positive economic progress has not yet had a greater impact on improving the living conditions of Africa’s inhabitants. (Z dlhodobého hľadiska je Afrika svetovým regiónom s najnižšou úrovňou príjmu. Ide o jednu z najzaostalejších častí svetovej ekonomiky s malým podielom na svetovom HDP a nízkym vplyvom na svetové ekonomické dianie a poriadok. Väčšina obyvateľov trpí nemožnosťou uspokojenia základných ľudských potrieb. V súčasnosti však mnohé africké krajiny zaznamenávajú vysoký rast HDP a prílev priamych zahraničných investícií. Cieľom predkladaného článku je analyzovať súčasnú ekonomickú situáciu na africkom kontinente, preskúmať determinanty prílevu priamych zahraničných investícií do Afriky a ich súvislosť s ekonomickým rozvojom. Výsledky nášho výskumu poukazujú na existenciu vzťahu medzi rastom HDP a prílevom PZI, pripúšťajú však, že hospodársky rast zatiaľ nemal väčší vplyv na zlepšenie životných podmienok obyvateľov Afriky.)
F65|Location decisions of non‐bank financial foreign direct investment: Firm‐level evidence from Europe|The non‐bank financial sector in Europe has more than doubled in size between 2005 and 2015 reflecting the substantial growth in shadow banking activities. However, a large proportion of the non‐bank financial sector that remains unmapped as granular balance sheet information is not available for over half of the sector. Motivated by these data gaps and employing firm‐level data, this paper examines the location decisions of newly incorporated foreign affiliates in the non‐bank financial sector across 27 European countries over the period 2004 to 2012. The probability of a country being chosen as the location for a new foreign affiliate is found to be negatively associated with higher corporate tax rates and geographic distance but increases with the size and financial development of the host country. The financial regulatory regime in the host country and gravity related controls such as the home and host country sharing a common legal system, language, border, and currency are also found to impact the likelihood of non‐bank financial FDI.
F65|The Financial Secrecy Index: Shedding New Light on the Geography of Secrecy - Working Paper 404|Both academic research and public policy debate around tax havens and offshore finance typically suffer from a lack of definitional consistency. Unsurprisingly then, there is little agreement about which jurisdictions ought to be considered as tax havens—or which policy measures would result in their not being so considered. In this article we explore and make operational an alternative concept, that of a secrecy jurisdiction and present the findings of the resulting Financial Secrecy Index (FSI). The FSI ranks countries and jurisdictions according to their contribution to opacity in global financial flows, revealing a quite different geography of financial secrecy from the image of small island tax havens that may still dominate popular perceptions and some of the literature on offshore finance. Some major (secrecy-supplying) economies now come into focus. Instead of a binary division between tax havens and others, the results show a secrecy spectrum, on which all jurisdictions can be situated, and that adjustment lfor the scale of business is necessary in order to compare impact propensity. This approach has the potential to support more precise and granular research findings and policy recommendations.
F65|The Implementation Of Single Euro Payments Area In Romania And The Effects On Efficiency|Adoption of the single currency, euro, on 1 January 2002, in 12 countries, then in other seven states, represents a step towards closer economic and monetary integration in the European Union. The banking market remains fragmented after euro adoption and cross-border transactions in the single currency involves high costs and long periods of settlement and clearing. European Union response to this problem came in the form of the Single Euro Payments Area. The objective of the papers is to analyze the degree of implementation of SEPA in Romania and to investigate the impact on banking efficiency. The results showed low degree of implementation, especially on direct debit, but Romania hasmore time until October 31, 2016 to make the necessary changes. The consumers will benefit from a quicker settlement and clearing and at lower costs.
F65|What Does Bitcoin Look Like?|The paper seeks to address what Bitcoin looks like. Specifically, we attempt to identify the main determinants of Bitcoin price by means of rigorous evaluation through ARDL Bounds Testing method. Our findings reveal the extremely speculative behavior of Bitcoin, its partial usefulness in trade trans- actions without overlooking its dependence to the Shangai stock market and the hash rate. There is no sign of Bitcoin being a safe haven. Taking a step further, we re-investigate the focal link by accounting for the Chinese trad- ing bankruptcy. The results appear fairly robust. Bitcoin is still perceived as speculative foolery and thus far from being a long-term promise.
F65|Internationale Verflechtung der Finanzmärkte: ein Versuch zur Quantifizierung des Dominoeffekts in Anlehnung an die Input-Output-Analyse|Die internationale Verflechtung der Finanzmärkte führt dazu, dass der Ausfall von Krediten in einem Land auch von Geldgebern in anderen Ländern getragen werden muss. Bei einer konsequenten Anwendung des Prinzips der Gläubigerhaftung würde der Vermögensverlust von dem unmittelbar betroffenen Kreditinstitut über dessen in- und ausländische Anteilseigner und Kreditgeber sowie deren Gläubiger bis zu den ursprünglichen Sparern „durchgereicht“. Dieser Effekt soll hier in Anlehnung an die Input-Output-Analyse der sektoralen Produktionsverflechtung einer Volkswirtschaft ermittelt werden, indem die für Investitionen in einem bestimmten Land eingesetzten Sparfonds unter Berücksichtigung der internationalen Kapitalverflechtung den ursprünglichen Herkunftsländern zugerechnet werden. Dabei wird auch die Rolle von internationalen Finanzzentren deutlich, die im wesentlichen als Verteiler von Investitionsrisiken fungieren, während die Verluste letzten Endes von den großen Ländern mit hohem Sparvermögen zu tragen sind.
F65|Explaining Foreign Holdings of Asia's Debt Securities: The Feldstein-Horioka Paradox Revisited| In this paper, we find that home bias is still present in all economies and regions, especially in the case of short-term debt securities, but that there are substantial variations among economies and regions in the strength of home bias, with the Eurozone economies, the US, and developing Asia showing relatively weak home bias and advanced Asia, especially Japan, showing relatively strong home bias. We then examine trends over time in foreign holdings of debt securities and find that capital has been flowing from the US and the Eurozone economies to both advanced Asia (especially Japan) and developing Asia and that foreign holdings of debt securities have been increasing in advanced as well as developing Asia but for different reasons. The main reason in the case of advanced Asia (especially Japan) appears to be higher risk-adjusted returns, whereas the main reason in the case of developing Asia appears to be the growth of debt securities markets combined with relatively weak home bias and (in the case of short-term securities) lower exchange rate volatility. Finally, we find that since the Global Financial Crisis, foreign holdings of debt securities have declined (i.e., that home bias has strengthened) in all economies and regions except developing Asia, where they have increased (except for a temporary decline in 2008) but where their share is still much lower than the optimal share warranted by the capital asset pricing market model.
F65|Stock market volatility spillovers and portfolio hedging: BRICS and the financial crisis|The paper investigates the dynamic risk–return properties of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) capital markets and models potential time-varying correlations and volatility spillover effects with the US stock market. A VAR(1)–GARCH(1,1) framework contributes useful insight into US–BRICS market interactions and expands on a thin past empirical literature. A disaggregated approach pays attention to critical US–BRICS business sectors, namely the industrial and financial sectors. Significant return and volatility transmission dynamics are identified between the US and BRICS stock markets and business sectors. This is a critical input that can affect efficient global portfolio diversification and risk management strategies. Based on this empirical evidence, the study proceeds to assess effective portfolio hedge ratios and to construct optimal portfolio weights for diversified asset allocation to US–BRICS markets and business sectors.
