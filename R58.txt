R58|R&D Subsidies and Firms’ Debt Financing|This study investigates the impact of public subsidies for research and development (R&D) on the debt financing of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). It examines a public program implemented in the Marche region of Italy during the period 2005–2012. The study combines matching methods with a difference-in-difference estimator to examine whether receiving public subsidies affects total indebtedness, the structure and cost of debt of awarded firms. The results indicate that R&D subsidies modify firms’ (especially young firms’) debt structure in favor of long-term financing, and help firms to limit the average cost of debt. Subsidies also foster the use of bank financing, but do not affect the overall level of debt. Taken together, these findings suggest that public funding of SMEs’ innovation projects plays a certification role in access to external financial resources for firms receiving subsidies.
R58|The economic effects of big events: evidence from the Great Jubilee 2000 in Rome|This paper assesses the short- and long-term economic impact of the Great Jubilee 2000 on the city of Rome’s economy; this is an important Catholic event that occurs every 25 years. By applying the synthetic control approach, we find that the value added per capita increases slightly in the short term while in the long term it is not significantly different from what it would have been if Rome had not hosted the Jubilee. However, we do find a significant effect on the employment rate. Consistently with these findings, we document a shift of the local economy towards less productive sectors, such as construction and services requiring a lower skill content, and an overall productivity loss for/in Rome with respect to the counterfactual scenario. The investment in infrastructure, facilities and urban requalification did not significantly affect tourism or house prices in the long run, with exception of peripheral residential areas which experienced an appreciation.
R58|Anything new in town? The local effects of Urban Regeneration Policies in Italy|The paper estimates the local effects of urban regeneration policies by using evidence from interventions that took place in small and medium-sized cities in the Centre and North of Italy over the period 2008-12. By using an Oaxaca-Blinder reweighting estimator, we find little support for the idea that urban regeneration projects could stimulate local economic growth in the short to medium term. Only the largest scale interventions that focused on improving the public realm seem to have led to an increase in house prices, but they have had no impact on other economic outcomes.
R58|Planificación urbana en América Latina: el caso de Valledupar (Colombia)|Los estudios de caso sobre desarrollo urbano en Colombia se han concentrado en dos de las ciudades más pobladas: Bogotá y Medellín (Salazar, 2007; Beuf, 2012). Mientras tanto, el éxito en la planificación de otras ciudades con menor población ha sido menos visible. Este es el caso de Valledupar en la región del Caribe: a pesar de que ha sido destacado como un proceso exitoso de planificación urbana (Rojas y Daughters, 1998; Maldonado, 2004), permanece en gran parte sin explorar. El objetivo de este documento es reconstruir las diferentes etapas de la planificación urbana en Valledupar utilizando cartografía, archivos históricos, periódicos, entrevistas, documentos e imágenes. El período analizado abarca desde principios del siglo XX hasta las primeras décadas del siglo XXI. En su conjunto, la experiencia de Valledupar señala la importancia de formular y hacer cumplir los planes de desarrollo urbano. Igualmente, destaca el fortalecimiento institucional como un aspecto clave para el progreso local. **** ABSTRACT: The majority of studies on urban development in Colombia have concentrated in two of the biggest cities: Bogotá and Medellín (Salazar, 2007; Beuf, 2012). Meanwhile, the success of other smaller cities remains less visible. This is the case of Valledupar in the Colombian Caribbean region: although it has been highlighted by many authors as a case of successful urban planning, it remains largely unexplored (Rojas y Daughters, 1998; Maldonado, 2004). The aim of this paper is to reconstruct the different stages of urban planning in Valledupar using cartography, historical archives, newspapers, interviews, documents, and images. The period analyzed comprises from the beginning of the twentieth century to the first decades of the twenty-first century. In the aggregate, the experience of Valledupar points out the importance of formulating and enforcing urban development plans. In addition, strengthening of institutions appear to be of outmost importance for local progress.
R58|La era de Trump y sus impactos en la frontera norte de México|A partir del triunfo como presidente de Estados Unidos de Donald Trump, al que le anteceden discursos reaccionarios y polémicos en temas sensibles entre México y Estados Unido, se hace obligado el planteamiento de posibles de escenarios en materia política, social, económica y ambiental para la frontera norte de México. Un grupo de investigadores de El Colegio de la Frontera Norte (México) se reunió para reflexionar sobre estos temas y elaborar algunas recomendaciones para los tomadores de decisiones, en particular para los gobiernos de los seis estados de la frontera norte de México. En este cuaderno de trabajo se presentan algunas de sus reflexiones.
R58|Diversificación productiva y especializaciones sectoriales en Chile|El trabajo busca explorar las condiciones de diversificación o concentración productiva de las regiones en Chile, identificando sus especializaciones sectoriales relativas. Para lo anterior, para cada región se calculan indicadores de diversificación/concentración productiva -Índice de Herfindahl (IH)- e indicadores de especialización sectorial -Coeficiente de Especialización (CE)- utilizando fuentes de información secundaria. Los resultados indican que, en general, las regiones de Chile se muestran como territorios diversificados. En efecto, algunas regiones se especializan en actividades económicas para las cuales disfrutan de ventajas comparativas, como es el caso de las regiones mineras del norte, mientras que otras se benefician de la diversificación de su base productiva, como ocurre en la Región Metropolitana. No obstante, en algunas regiones, y a nivel nacional, existe una excesiva dependencia de los recursos naturales, lo cual puede comprometer el potencial de desarrollo de las regiones, y del país en su conjunto.

R58|The economic effects of density: A synthesis|This paper synthesises the state of knowledge on the economic effects of density. We consider 347 estimates of density elasticities of a broad range of outcomes ranging from wages, innovation, rents, various amenities, the cost of providing public services, transport- and environment-related outcomes to health and wellbeing. More than 100 of these estimates have not been previously published and have been provided by authors on request or inferred from published results in auxiliary analyses. We contribute original estimates of density elasticities of 16 distinct outcome variables that belong to categories where the evidence base is thin, inconsistent or non-existent. Along with a critical discussion of the quality and the quantity of the evidence base we present a set of recommended elasticities. Applying them to a scenario that roughly corresponds to an average high-income city, we find that density seems to be a net-amenity that is associated with positive external welfare effects. Densification policies may be welfare enhancing, but the distributional effects may be regressive, especially if residents are immobile and housing supply is inelastic.
R58|Government institutions and the dynamics of urban growth in China|Economic growth in China in recent decades has largely rested on the dynamism of its cities. High economic growth has coincided with measures aimed at improving the efficiency of local governments and with a mounting political drive to curb corruption. Yet the connection between government institutions and urban growth in China remains poorly understood. This paper is the first to look into the link between government efficiency and corruption, on the one hand, and urban growth in China, on the other hand and to assess what is the role of institutions relative to more traditional factors for economic growth in Chinese cities. Using panel data for 283 cities over the period between 2003 and 2014, the results show that the urban growth in China is a consequence of a combination of favorable human capital, innovation, density, local conditions, foreign direct investment, and city‐level government institutions. Both government quality—especially for those cities with the best governments—and the fight against corruption at the city level have a direct effect on urban growth. Measures to tackle corruption at the provincial level matter in a more indirect way, by raising or lowering the returns of other growth‐inducing factors.
R58|International City Network and Public-Private Cooperation Japanese Public Water Services’ Overseas Expansion|Urbanization has progressed in parallel with rapid economic development in Asia, and people living in the region’s megacities face severe urban environmental problems, with the water-environment problem being especially serious. Such cities must develop the infrastructure to provide clean water and process sewage in densely populated areas. Meanwhile, water-supply and sewerage services in Japan are conducted by municipalities as a public service, but their revenues are shrinking in response to a decreasing birthrate, an aging population, and the waterconservation movement. In this study, we investigated the overseas expansion of Japanese public water services as an effort to improve the living environment in developing Asian countries and to advance the sustainability of public water services. The research methods included scrutinizing preliminary research, conducting case studies through text analysis of materials issued by national and local governments, and conducting interviews with municipalities. We examined four urban municipal water services, including ones in Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka, and Kitakyushu, that developed publicprivate cooperative platform associations for expanding abroad. As a result of the research, we first identified the overseas expansion of public water services as a collaborative model—based on an international inter-city network—for solving urban problems. Japan’s water-related public and private sectors have a motivation to share their technologies and experiences of solving urban waterrelated environmental problems with the growing cities of Asia, but it is difficult for Japanese public water services to sustain a unilateral contribution to developing countries because their business environment is becoming less hospitable in a shrinking domestic market. Therefore, with national governmental support, major municipal water services in Japan have aimed to expand their business abroad to achieve regional economic development, relying on trust based on the solidarity and cooperation of the international cities to reduce the transaction cost of international water-related project development. Second, we clarify that the public-private cooperative platform established by the leadership of municipalities enhances the accountability and transparency of the overseas expansion projects of public water services. Municipalities hold themselves accountable to be fair to citizens and stakeholders. The Public and private cooperative platform established by Japanese public water service, as an intermediate organization, not only develops the implementation capacity but also strengthens accountability and transparency of the international public water service 5 expansion projects’ sharing information about the water-environment problems of each cities and selecting project partner companies. Third, we find that the international city networks that municipalities build are evolving from one-to-one mutual networks to multilateral networks. To date, municipalities have developed international sister-city networks that centered more on cultural and educational administrative exchanges. Recent years, however, have witnessed the rise of more pragmatic city networks that focus on problem-solving city liaisons. Municipalities are realizing the efficiency of mutual project-making and of participating in international associations or organizations of cities for specific purposes. They even organize international meetings or conferences at which they seek business partner cities, promote their environment technologies to their region, and enhance their brand images as regional technology hubs.
R58|Interaction of Public and Private Employment: Evidence from a German Government Move|We use the German government move from Bonn to Berlin in 1999 to test competing views about the impact of public employment on private sector activity in a local labor market. A relocated public sector job might create new jobs in an area as it increases demand for locally-produced goods and services, or crowd out existing jobs due to upward pressure on housing rents. Using employment data from a panel of a 50% sample of establishments across 190 Berlin postcodes, we apply a treatment intensity approach which takes the possibility of spillovers into account. Results indicate that the arrival of 100 public sector jobs into an area generates 55 additional jobs in the private sector. There is evidence of spillovers: relocations up to a distance of 1km from a postcode boundary increases employment in the private sector by 36 jobs. These effects are coming through job gains in the service sector, while manufacturing employment is not influenced by the relocation.
R58|Cluster externalities, firm capabilities, and the recessionary shock: How the macro-to-micro-transition shapes firm performance during stable times and times of crisis|In this paper, we examine the macro-to-micro-transition of cluster externalities to firms and how it is affected by the macroeconomic instability caused by the recessionary shock of 2008/2009. Using data from 16,166 manufacturing and business services firms nested in 390 German regions, we employ within-firm regression techniques to estimate the impact of cross-level interactions between firm- and cluster-level determinants on phase-related differences in firm performance between a pre-crisis (2004-2007) and a crisis period (2009-2011). The empirical results validate the existence of a macro-to-micro-transition that evolves best in the case of broad firm-level capabilities and variety-driven externalities. Furthermore, the results indicate that the transition strongly depends on the macroeconomic cycle. While the transition particularly benefits from a stable macroeconomic environment (2004-2007), its mechanisms are interrupted when being exposed to economic turmoil (2009-2011). Yet, the crisis-induced interruption of the transition is mainly restricted to the national recession in 2009. As soon as the macroeconomic pressure diminishes (2010-2011), we observe a reversion of the transmission mechanisms to the pre-crisis level. Our study contributes to the existing literature by corroborating previous findings that the economic performance of firms depends on a working macro-to-micro transition of external resources, which presupposes sufficient cluster externalities and adequate firm-level combinative capabilities. In contrast to previous studies on this topic, the transition mechanism is not modeled as time-invariant. Instead, it is coupled to the prevailing macroeconomic regime.
R58|Lagging-behind Areas as a Challenge to the Regional Development Strategy: What Insights can New and Evolutionary Economic Geography Offer?|Lagging-behind areas, as an example of convergence failure within a country, have attracted the attention of many researchers who try to adopt appropriate policies and strategies to overcome the problem of low growth paths. The current study concentrates on policy recommendations in the framework of New Economic Geography and Evolutionary Economic Geography for the lagging regions. The agglomerated industry, as a fundamental element of the new economic geography, has limited the potentials of policy prescriptions for lagging-behind areas. Constructing regional advantages, as a policy in evolutionary economic geography, has helped diversifying the policy options for the lagging-behind regions. However, this approach is faced with multi-level challenges in lagging-behind areas including the lack of critical mass in the case of low related variety and the knowledge base gap between the lagging and prosperous regions. Therefore, the policy should provide a structure for the simulation of external knowledge links and differentiate the nature of various related industries if it is going to be a basis for constructing regional advantages.
R58|Political Hedgehogs: The Geographical Sorting of Refugees in Sweden|This study shows that in Sweden, contrary to other European countries, refugees have been disproportionately placed in peripheral and rural areas with high unemployment and rapid native depopulation where the prospects for integration, both socially and economically, are poor. We explore and evaluate some potential reasons for this outcome. Factors such as an intimidating political and intellectual climate in favor of receiving large numbers of asylum seekers and immigrants and the economic support given by the central government to municipalities that accept refugees are not sufficient to understand the actions of rural local governments. Instead, we argue that Tetlock’s seminal work on “expert political judgment” may provide a useful approach for understanding the seemingly irrational actions of local politicians in rural and peripheral municipalities.​
R58|How Term Limits Constrain the Emergence of Agency and Resilience|This paper investigates how timing norms affect the emergence of agency in regional resilience. It forwards three arguments: timing norms establish the boundary for action and generates corollary timing norms that schedule adaptive strategies, term limits shape incentives for institutional work, and the interplay of term limits, institutional work, and agency, shape the path of regions for adaptation or adaptability. Findings show that incentives for policy action arises at the beginning of terms, term limits generate incentives for types of institutional work. Layering is not effective in maintaining resource allocation to agendas, affecting regional tendencies for adaptation and adaptability.
R58|Trinity of Change Agency: Connecting Agency and Structure in Studies of Regional Development|The promise of connecting agency and structure in studies of regional development is to disentangle causal effects and to better understand to what extent and how individuals, groups of individuals, and organisations can shape regional trajectories. This is not without challenges because agency and structure are deep theoretical constructs, which are not easily translated into empirical research. We have devoted a research project to study how agency and structure are connected in the context of regional development and have faced many difficulties on the way. Here, we would like to share our experiences and proposed solutions grouped into six challenges, which were present in all of the 12 comparative case studies in Finland, Norway and Sweden. The challenges refer to the ontology of agency and structure, the research design, the time period of study, the spatial scale, the research instrument, and the data collection.
R58|Effects of multilevel policy mix of public R&D subsidies: Empirical evidence from Japanese local SMEs|Regional innovation policies have been implemented in several countries. In Japan, controlled decentralization of traditionally centralized innovation policy is ongoing, so that we can observe multilevel policy mix of public R&D subsidies by national, prefecture and city governments. Based on original survey data and financial data of manufacturing SMEs, we empirically estimate their TFP (Total Factor Productivity) and investigate the effects of public R&D subsidies by national, prefecture and city governments. We employ firm-level fixed effect panel estimation in order to control for the effects of any time-invariant factors. We find that only the prefecture subsidy has a positive and significant impact on the TFP of recipient firms, while interactive effect with city subsidy is also positive and significant, if we consider remaining effects after subsidy period. These results suggest that multilevel policy mix of R&D subsidies significantly increase recipients' productivity and that this effect if durable.
R58|Transportation Project Evaluation Methods/Approaches|In this paper, I briefly review the key methods to evaluate transportation projects. These methods are: Financial analysis; Cost benefit (economic analysis); Multi-criteria analysis; Cost-effectiveness analysis; Social welfare analysis; and Risk analysis (Monte Carlo simulation). The importance of understanding these methods lies in the fact that transportation projects offer huge social benefits and costs; some are impossible or very complex to measure in monetary terms.

In contrast to previous studies on this topic, the transition mechanism is not modeled as time-invariant. Instead, it is coupled to the prevailing macroeconomic regime.
R58|Development-Induced Displacement: The Case of Dam Construction in Slovakia and the Czech Republic|The paper deals with the topic of development-induced displacement based on Slovak and Czech historical experience with dam construction projects. Favourable natural conditions in the Central European area, such as hydropower potential and relief, have enabled many hydroelectric plants to be constructed, whereby no negligible number of cases have been accompanied by resettlement of the affected population. Such processes had significant social and economic consequences. In the present study we predominantly focus on the ways of compensation and treatment of the displaced, whereby comparative approach is applied. Besides, results of key informant interviews are debated in detail. The paper is concluded by policy recommendations regarding potential future development-induced displacement.
R58|The Economic Impact of Small Regional Commissions: Evidence from the Delta Regional Authority|Factors such as falling U.S. migration rates and diverging regional economic fortunes have heightened interest in place-based policies. Indeed, the U.S. has had many such federal efforts including recently enacted Opportunity Zones. Historically, substantial federal funding has gone to regional economic development programs such as the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC). Yet, little is known about the benefits of some of the smaller place-based programs. We extend the literature on regional commissions by analyzing the economic gains to the Delta Regional Authority (DRA). The DRA was founded in 2000 to provide enhanced development aid to 252 Lower Mississippi Valley counties. Using data over the 1997 to 2016 period, we assess the DRA’s impact on employment, income, migration, and poverty. One-to-one propensity score matching is used to generate a set of counterfactual counties. Due to the endogenous nature of the treatment, we instrument for counties being included in the DRA using a dummy for whether the county is within the Lower Mississippi Watershed. The ensuing results reflects an estimation of the intent- to-treat benefits of the DRA. We find that the DRA is associated with income gains and decreases in unemployment; however, no impact on poverty or migration. In sum, the DRA produces economic benefits that greatly exceed its direct costs.
R58|Regional Efficiency Dispersion, Convergence, and Efficiency Clusters: Evidence from the Provinces of Indonesia 1990-2010|This paper studies efficiency convergence across provinces in Indonesia over the 1990-2010 period. Through the lens of both classical and distributional convergence frameworks, the dispersion dynamics of pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency are contrasted. The results suggest that—on average—there is regional convergence in both measures of efficiency. However, results from the distributional framework indicate the existence of two separate convergence clusters within the pure technical efficiency distribution. Moreover, since scale efficiency is characterized by only one convergence cluster, the two clusters of pure technical efficiency appear to be driving the overall efficiency dynamics of Indonesia.
R58|Regional fiscal equalization. A simultaneous equation approach to assess the economic effects of fiscal policy|Regional fiscal equalization in Germany aims to reduce fiscal disparities by allocating financial resources to less promising regions in order to support the supply of public goods. This paper aims to analyse secondary economic effects of regional fiscal equalization on several economic in- and output variables. Additionally, the paper examines the potential regional characteristics to influence the transformation of fiscal inputs into economic outcomes. Lastly, I compare the effects of fiscal equalization to these of the major German structural funding program GRW. My findings reveal a significant positive effect of fiscal equalization on the regional employment rate. Moreover, the findings suggest different transmission channels of fiscal equalization in East and West Germany. Particularly, I find higher effects in right-wing CDU/CSU preferring regions on the employment, human capital and private-sector investment rate. Finally, while structural funding affects more economic variables significantly, the magnitude of the estimated economic responses of fiscal equalization compared to these of German structural funding are not statistically different.
R58|The impact of place-based policies on perceived regional living conditions across German labor market regions. Examining the impacts on migration flows|The paper analyzes the impact of the two major German regional development and redistribution policies, the municipal fiscal equalization scheme and the economic funds GRW, on perceived regional living conditions, measured through interregional migration between German labor market regions. Using a spatial vector-autoregressive panel model (SpVar), we find evidence that equalization transfers have a significant positive impact on perceived living conditions and contribute to the aim of regional equity. These effects are especially found for regions with low endogenous fiscal capacities. GRW funding reveals no significant effects on net migration rates in total, but short-term effects in rural regions.
R58|Effects of R&D subsidies on regional economic dynamics: Evidence from Chinese provinces|We investigate the impact of research and development (R&D) subsidies on R&D inputs of large- and medium-sized firms and on additional innovation and economic activities in Chinese provinces. A panel vector autoregressive (VAR) model and corresponding impulse response function (IRF) analysis allow us to differentiate between direct and indirect effects, which add up to total effects. We find that an increase of R&D subsidies significantly decreases private R&D investments, although there is a significant positive effect on the R&D personnel employed in firms. We interpret these findings as a partial crowding-out effect because public funds substitute some private funds while total R&D inputs still increase. Complementarily, we find a positive secondary effect on the provincial patent activity, our measure of technological progress. Interestingly, we also find potentially unintended effects of R&D subsidies on increases in the investment rate in physical capital and residential buildings. Although R&D subsidies fail to incentivize private R&D expenditures, firms increase total R&D inputs, and provincial economies benefit from secondary effects on technological progress and capital deepening.
R58|R&D Subsidies and Firms' Debt Financing|This study investigates the impact of public subsidies for research and development (R&D) on the debt financing of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). It examines a public program implemented in the Marche region of Italy during the period 2005â€“2012. The study combines matching methods with a difference-in-difference estimator to examine whether receiving public subsidies affects total indebtedness, the structure and cost of debt of awarded firms. The results indicate that R&D subsidies modify firms' (especially young firms') debt structure in favor of long-term financing, and help firms to limit the average cost of debt. Subsidies also foster the use of bank financing, but do not affect the overall level of debt. Taken together, these findings suggest that public funding of SMEs' innovation projects plays a certification role in access to external financial resources for firms receiving subsidies.
R58|An Integrated Approach For Building A Sustainable City Development Assessment Model|In recent years, countries around the world have proposed the vision of future cities such as ?smart cities?, ?sustainable cities? and ?inclusive cities?. Cities have also proposed relevant policies and measures, and hope to create a livable place. However, the composition of the city is wide and complex, and the future city is not only able to consider only one aspect. The planning of the future city should incorporate the concept of smartness, suatainability and inclusiveness. With the application of novel technologies in the future, the effective use and management of urban resources can be achieved, and the social network of citizens tends to be fair and harmonious, which enables the city to move towards sustainable urban development. Based on the planning criteria of smart cities, sustainable cities, and inclusive cities, this study will construct an assessment framework that is consistent with future cities. Through the Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) and the Analytic Network Process (ANP), the future urban development evaluation model is constructed considering the priority of its evaluation criteria. Finally, an empirical analysis of the future urban assessment model for Taichung City, Taiwan will be conducted to verify the suitability of the model and propose further planning strategies.
R58|To join or not to join? The impact of social interactions on local participation decisions|This paper investigates how social interactions impact the decision to participate in one’s local environment. Existing work often reports correlations between social interactions and local participation, but it is unclear what the causal direction of this relationship is. A key contribution of this paper is that we are able to estimate the causal effect of social interactions on the decision to participate by systematically varying social attributes in a choice experiment. Based on a large-scale survey in one Dutch municipality we analyze 3894 choice observations of 435 respondents. Our sample includes respondents who currently participate and respondents who do not. We find that at the recruitment stage being asked by a friend or acquaintance significantly increases the chances to volunteer. We also find significant homophily effects in terms of age as well as for the characteristics of the group already participating. Financial incentives have significant negative impacts on the decision to participate.
R58|Participatory Value Evaluation: a novel method to evaluate future urban mobility investments|Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) is a widely applied economic appraisal tool to support the planning and decision-making process for transport projects. However, in the planning literature CBA has been criticized for at least three reasons: 1) CBA focuses on traditional transport system related planning goals and poorly considers the broader goals of urban transport planning such as social equity; 2) CBA corrodes and degrades the forward looking nature of the planning proficiency. The instrument can be conceived as a backward looking methodology as it assumes that people’s past decisions in a (private) market setting reflect their normative ideas regarding their preferred future urban mobility system; 3) CBA fails to recognize the specific (local) features of the problem which a transport project aspires to solve as practical CBA studies use generic price tags to value impacts of a transport project. Participatory Value Evaluation (PVE) is a novel evaluation approach specifically designed to overcome these criticisms while preserving the positive aspects that CBA brings to planning. This paper illustrates the PVE method with a case study on the evaluation of a transport investment scheme of the Transport Authority Amsterdam. In total 2,498 citizens participated in the PVE. We find that projects with the highest social value focus on safety and improvements for cyclists and pedestrians, whereas projects that focus on reducing travel times for car users have lower value. Moreover, we establish that PVE captures citizens’ preferences towards broader goals of transport planning such as improving health and the environment, fostering city cycling as well as the inclusion of ethical considerations such as spatial equality. PVE also allows for the inclusion of citizens’ normative ideas regarding their preferred future urban mobility system and local characteristics of the transport problem/solution.
R58|Situazione socio-economica e politica di coesione in Emilia-Romagna a fine 2018|Lâ€™anno in corso Ã¨ il penultimo del periodo di programmazione 2014-2020 della politica di coesione dellâ€™Unione europea condotta dallâ€™Amministrazione regionale in Emilia-Romagna. Pertanto, sembra opportuno avviare la valutazione dei risultati che si stanno conseguendo in termini economico-finanziari, senza attendere la conclusione del settennio. A tale scopo si prestano alcuni documenti ufficiali che sono stati recentemente diffusi in cui si presentano, da un lato, gli esiti delle misure realizzate nellâ€™ambito di tale politica contabilizzati alla fine del 2018 e, dallâ€™altro, i valori assunti dalle principali variabili socio-economiche nel contesto emiliano-romagnolo nel corso degli ultimi anni. Il quadro che si ottiene da tale confronto appare contrastante, riproponendo lâ€™annoso conflitto tra efficienza ed equitÃ che caratterizza la disciplina della politica economica in generale e, in particolar modo, la sua componente avente come obiettivo il riequilibrio inter- o intra-regionale.
R58|Desarrollo económico regional, especializaciones productivas y cooperación empresarial. Un estudio comparado de Chile, El Salvador, Paraguay y Uruguay|This research has two aims. First, it characterizes regional development in the four selected countries. Second, it analyzes cooperation networks between firms and organizations, in 24 clusters in different regions of the four countries. Regarding the first aim, the work analyzes in each region the generation of wealth, the development of small business sector and socioeconomic conditions of the environment, complemented by the identification of the productive specializations in each region. Results show that economic development is not evenly distributed in the territory. Certain sub-national patterns in terms of economic development were found. In addition, there is a strong concentration of economic activity in the regions where the national capitals are located (except for the regions rich in mining or energy resources). The analysis of local business development and the socioeconomic environment shows that, in addition to external factors, a region must develop its own local capacities to take advantage of these external impulses and transform them into local development. Regarding the second objective, the study of 24 cooperation networks in clusters proves that organizations are the key actors to keep the networks connected. On the other hand, the level of cooperation among firms is, on average, low. In this sense, the countries under study do not present, in general, regions with high levels of local business capacity that can be the main support of cooperation networks. Therefore, organizations play an intermediary role between firms and provide access to external sources of innovation that can be disseminated through the network. Finally, the combination of social network analysis with econometric regression techniques revealed a positive relationship between the cooperation in networks and the economic performance of firms.
R58|Subnational government finances and capabilities for regional economic development in Uruguay: 1990-2016|The purpose of this work is to reflect on the relationship between subnational finance and the capabilities for regional economic development in Uruguay. It presents rigorous evidence of recent work on the relationships between fiscal decentralization, intergovernmental transfers and regional disparities in Uruguay. This is analyzed together with new available information on the evolution of subnational finances and a critical analysis of the productive policies developed in the country. It seeks to contribute to the current debate on the relationships between territorial development, decentralization and the role of public policy to reduce regional disparities. In this regard, it is concluded that these challenges require a better financing scheme for local development, with greater management capacity for decision-making at the local level. For this, as a prerequisite, it is urgent to improve the technical and management capacities of subnational governments.
R58|European Social Fund’s lifelong learning and regional development: a case study|The aim of this paper is to evaluate the first impacts of the European Social Fund (hereafter ESF) lifelong learning interventions on the regional development. As is well known, lifelong learning is defined as the all purposeful learning activity, undertaken throughout life, on an ongoing basis, with the aim of improving knowledge, skills, and competence within a personal, civic, social and/or employment-related perspective (CEC, 2000). Beyond the benefits, lifelong learning represents an advantage for the regional economy that could be measured in terms of both estimation of direct impact on domestic demand and evaluation of impacts on the performance of the local economies. The combination of these two kinds of effects generates a positive impact on a wider scale: a higher and skilled workforce attracts more investment, contributing to improve the well-being of a local economy. The case study is the Veneto region. The applied methodologies used in the case study are both a survey and an econometric model. In the first case, the utilized method approaches the topic from a microeconomic perspective, while in the second case the approach is purely macroeconomic.
R58|Cluster externalities, firm capabilities, and the recessionary shock: How the macro-to-micro-transition shapes firm performance during stable times and times of crisis|In this paper, we examine the macro-to-micro-transition of cluster externalities to firms and how it is affected by the macroeconomic instability caused by the recessionary shock of 2008/2009. Using data from 16,166 manufacturing and business services firms nested in 390 German regions, we employ within-firm regression techniques to estimate the impact of crosslevel interactions between firm- and cluster-level determinants on phase-related differences in firm performance between a pre-crisis (2004-2007) and a crisis period (2009-2011). The empirical results validate the existence of a macro-to-micro-transition that evolves best in the case of broad firm-level capabilities and variety-driven externalities. Furthermore, the results indicate that the transition strongly depends on the macroeconomic cycle. While the transition particularly benefits from a stable macroeconomic environment (2004-2007), its mechanisms are interrupted when being exposed to economic turmoil (2009-2011). Yet, the crisisinduced interruption of the transition is mainly restricted to the national recession in 2009. As soon as the macroeconomic pressure diminishes (2010-2011), we observe a reversion of the transmission mechanisms to the pre-crisis level. Our study contributes to the existing literature by corroborating previous findings that the economic performance of firms depends on a working macro-to-micro transition of external resources, which presupposes sufficient cluster externalities and adequate firm-level combinative capabilities. In contrast to previous studies on this topic, the transition mechanism is not modeled as time-invariant. Instead, it is coupled to the prevailing macroeconomic regime.
R58|A retrospective study on the regional benefits and spillover effects of high-speed broadband networks: Evidence from German counties|There is still hardly any empirical evidence on how divergent broadband technologies, and, by extension, bandwidth levels, influence GDP growth, or on the extent of spatial externalities at a regional level. Our study aims to assess the economic benefits of high-speed broadband networks within and across neighbouring counties in Germany. Utilizing a balanced panel dataset of 401 German counties with data from 2010-2015 as well as different panel estimation techniques, we find that the availability of high-speed broadband (which enables transfer rates of 50 Mbit/sec and higher) has a small but significant positive effect on regional GDP growth in the average German county, when compared to normal broadband availability. Furthermore, we find that broadband deployment in German counties induces substantial economic benefits in terms of direct effects and regional externalities. According to our main estimation results, an increase in bandwidth coverage of 50 Mbit/sec and higher by one percentage point induces arise in regional GDP of 0.05%. This effect is almost doubled if we also take regional externalities into account and is of particular relevance for urban counties. Furthermore, our cost-benefit analysis suggests substantial efficiency gains, as the total economic benefits of subsidy programs to encourage broadband expansion substantially exceeded their associated costs.
R58|Distribution of Industrial Research & Innovation Activities: An Application of Technology Readiness Levels|The Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) approach is relevant to map the functional decomposition of companies' R&D value chains. TRLs matter for corporate location choices. Knowing what distinct types of R&D&I activities (or TRLs) stay, go and come back in EU territories â€“ and why â€“ is central for policies supporting local industrial and innovation ecosystems and clusters, and the identification and integration into strategic value chains. Fast-developing local strengths of Asian countries such as China, Japan and South Korea, in Automotive, and in Electronics and related fields are shaping companies' geographical decomposition of R&D&I activities. While the EU has strong value chains in e.g. automotive (network of combustion engine) and pharma (highly skilled labour force and strong research institutions), corporate R&D&I investments are finding their way to novel applications in emerging technologies in Asia.
R58|Smart Specialisation Evaluation: Setting the Scene|This report presents a set of preliminary conceptual and practical considerations on the evaluation of the Smart Specialisation policy. It opens a discussion that aims to set the scene for more articulated and detailed reflections. It is important that evaluation exercises are focused on selected elements of the policy scheme; this facilitates identifying suitable evaluation questions and methodologies. Evaluation is meaningful only in the presence of well-specified evaluation questions, stemming from the specific information needs of the actors involved in Smart Specialisation Strategies. A well-defined intervention logic, linking clear ends with means, is essential for evaluation. Monitoring systems act as early-warning mechanisms signalling critical aspects in the implementation, which call for deeper assessment and understanding through evaluation exercises. To plan useful evaluations and increase the chances of their results being used require an ongoing commitment to develop a learning culture and build evaluation capabilities across institutions and stakeholders.
R58|Smart Specialisation from Concept to Practice: A Preliminary Assessment|This study assesses how and to what extent the principles characterising the Smart Specialisation approach are actually translated in policy implementation, by examining three of its complementary aspects: the nature of the priority areas for policy intervention, the mechanisms for project selection, and the type of policy measures. The results shows that regions and countries tend to circumvent the selective approach of Smart Specialisation. Priority areas broadly defined, loose alignment of policy instruments with priorities and the scarce customisation of policy measures to the specific innovation needs of the identified priorities are the tangible signs of this circumvention process. We advance the hypothesis that this could be the result of lobbying activities, higher political return from widespread support measures, risk-aversion, and lack of adequate institutional and administrative capacity. An additional explanation may lie in the incentive structure established at European Union level which did not fully support the intervention logic of Smart Specialisation. To assess the effects of Smart Specialisation, we suggest focusing on interventions that (i) address priorities consistently defined, (ii) apply policy measures selectively to those priorities, (iii) design policy measures around the specificities of each priority.
R58|Upward pressure on wages and the interregional trade spillover effects under demand-side shocks|The paper illustrates the effect of a permanent demand-side shock in the perturbed regions and the associated spillover effects in the non-perturbed regions using the RHOMOLO spatial-numerical general equilibrium model of the EU economy. We test to what extent gradual upward pressure on wages generated by a domestic increase in demand alters the magnitude of the economic impacts in the long-run and the degree to which this could result in changes in trade patterns. We also assess the size and the direction of the effects with varying trade substitution elasticities and under both perfectly and imperfectly competitive product markets.
R58|Does decentralization of governance promote urban diversity? Evidence from Spain|The worldwide trend to decentralize the responsibilities and budgets of governments impacts local firm dynamics in various ways. We use the example of Spain to test empirically whether the decentralization of governance has been conducive to increased diversification and a more even city-size distribution in the Spanish urban system during a period of continuous reductions in transport costs. To this end we develop a bivariate probit regression framework to assess the probability that cities diversify or specialize over time, using a sample of 69 urban areas in Spain during the period 1995-2007. We exploit unique firm-level and time-varying transport-cost data to control for the role of a city's market potential, city size, transport costs, labor-force skill composition, product standardization and historical patterns of specialization. We find a high probability that a city will diversify if it is the capital of a regional government or located in a relatively decentralized region, while the opposite is true for the probability that a city will specialize. Also, we find that a city's status as a regional capital reinforces the positive effect of a high (low) internal market potential on the probability of diversification (specialization). A high (low) external market potential only increases the probability that a city will become specialized (diversified) if it is a regional capital. We argue that the link between decentralization and specialization patterns in the urban system deserves more attention in the empirical literature on decentralization's impact on economic growth, income inequality and regional disparities.
R58|The impact of the Grand Paris Express on the European regions: a RHOMOLO analysis|This technical report illustrates a simulation performed to assess the likely economic impact of the Grand Paris Express investments on the ÃŽle-de-France and the other European Union regions, under the working assumption of a combined 1% increase in labour productivity due to better matching between skill supply and demand and a 1% increase in accessibility due to the project. Our simulations suggest an overall medium-term positive GDP impact for the EU as a whole (0.18%), for France (0.79%) and for ÃŽle-de-France (2.61%).
R58|Property Tax Reform and Land Use: Evidence from Japan|It is often said that farmland conservation in urban areas (i.e., cities and inner suburbs) is not desirable because it hinders converting farmland into residential areas, thereby deterring urbanization. If the preferential treatment of property taxes on farmland is rectified, these problems can be solved. In this paper, we study two property tax preferential treatment reforms that took place in Japan during the 1990s. We examine the effects of these reforms by theoretical and empirical investigation. The econometric results are consistent with our theoretic modelâ€™s main predictions; the proportion of farmland in the major cities in the three metropolitan areas (Tokyo, Chubu, and Kansai) decreased following the reforms. However, since landlords did not replace all the farmland with housing lots, the problem of obstructed urbanization remains to be solved.
R58|Does tax competition drive cooperation in local economic development policies? Evidence on inter-local business parks in Germany|An increasing number of municipalities cooperates in the field of economic development. In this paper, we focus on a specific instrument in this field, namely the development of joint business parks. We apply a hazard model to data from West-German municipalities between 2000 and 2015. We find inter-local business parks to be more frequent among small municipalities and in constellations where suitable land is scarce. Our main focus rests on the role of tax competition. An analogy building on the literature on international tax coordination supports the hypothesis that inter-local business parks are more likely in regions where tax competition is intense. The evidence is affirmative: We find that the likelihood of inter-local business park formation to increase in the intensity of local tax competition.
R58|Detecting multidimensional clustering across EU regions.Focus on R&I smart specialisation strategies and on socio-economic and demographic conditions|This paper applies multidimensional clustering of EU-28 regions to identify similar specialisation strategies and socioeconomic characteristics. It builds on an original dataset where the EU-28 regions are classified according to their socioeconomic and demographic features and to the strategic priorities outlined in their research and innovation smart specialisations strategy (RIS3). The socioeconomic and demographic classification associates each region to one categorical variable (with 19 modalities), while the classification of the RIS3 priorities clustering was performed separately on â€œdescriptionsâ€ (21 Boolean categories) and â€œcodesâ€ (11 Boolean Categories) of regionsâ€™ RIS3. Three techniques of clustering have been applied: Infomap multilayer algorithm, Correspondence Analysis plus Cluster Analysis and cross tabulation. The most effective clustering, in terms of both the characteristics of the data and the emerging results, is that obtained on the results of the Correspondence Analysis. By contrast, due to the very dense network induced by the data characteristics, the Infomap algorithm does not produce significant results. Finally, cross tabulation is the most detailed tool to identify groups of regions with similar characteristics. In particular, in the paper we present an application of cross tabulation to focus on the regions investing in sustainable development priorities. Policy implications of methods implemented in this paper are discussed as a contribution to the current debate on post-2020 European Cohesion Policy, which aims at orienting public policies toward the reduction of regional disparities and the enhancement of complementarities and synergies within macroregions.
R58|Inter-municipal cooperation as a solution for public services delivery? The case of Unioni di Comuni in Emilia-Romagna Region|Inter municipal cooperation (IMC) represents a solution adopted all around the world in order to jointly provide services considering the complexity of contemporary socio-economic contexts. However, empirical evidence on IMC solutions is still week. The purpose of this paper is to analyse associations of municipalities (Unioni di Comuni, UC), the prevalent kind of IMC established in Italy, as a possible solution for sustainable public services delivery. Our research questions refer to the main features of Unioni di Comuni as an IMC for public services delivery in Emilia-Romagna Region (Italy), to the explanation of those characteristics, and to the evaluation of UCs and their features in terms of autonomy, resilience and sustainability. In order to meet our objectives, we accomplished a cluster analysis, considering administrative and socio-economic data; in addition, we examined specific characteristics within each cluster to proceed with a comparison between clusters in terms of revenues from transfers from other governments layers, own revenues, current expenses and financial autonomy index in the last years. Our results suggest a general tendency: to provide services through UC in E-R; and to enhance their development in terms of public service special-ization. But at the same time, UCs generally decreased their own financial autonomy, relying on transfers from other public institutions. In line with Resource-Dependence Theory (RDT), our empirical analysis finds different clusters of UCs which act as new centres for public service delivery in Emilia-Romagna Region in order to reduce uncertainty over resources through the creation of new inter-institutional balances. However, the statement that strong UCs com-pensate weak starting territorial features of municipalities is not self-evident.
R58|RIS3 in macro-regional strategies: tools to design and monitor integrated territorial development paths|Building on the broad and diverse picture of strategic interventions on regions' re-search and innovation strategies for smart specialisation (RIS3) and on macro-regional strategies, this paper outlines a comparative framework to analyse regions' RIS3 priorities (to outline the intended development path that regions aim at) and socioeconomic condi-tions (to describe the structural features, as they emerge from Eurostat data). The paper integrates results developed in two companion papers, by Pavone et al. (2018) and by Pagliacci et al. (2018), thus providing a multidimensional perspective on similarity across regions. Identifying which are the similarities is essential in a comparative analysis that aims to measure and monitor the impact of integrated investments on the development of the territory across sectors. Implications of the methodology proposed in the paper are discussed with suggestions for policy makers.
R58|R&I smart specialisation strategies: classification of EU regions’ priorities. Results from automatic text analysis|Building on automatic text analysis, this paper proposes an original categorization of Research and Innovation Smart Specialisation Strategy (RIS3) priorities and provides a common language (with detailed dictionaries) to classify priorities and then to associate EU regions to multiclass categories of priorities. This result is a powerful tool to interpret the current state of diversification across regions, with its potential of complementarities and synergies that might support territorial integrated development paths. It would also support regions in their future strategic programmes on RIS3. A case study on the Alpine macro-region shows innovation development paths to outline macroregion strategic planning
R58|Poverty and Social Exclusion in the European Union: SouthEastern Territorial Patterns|Despite the ambitious goals of promoting inclusive growth in the Europe 2020 strategy, the number of people at risk of poverty in European Union is still growing. The paper moves from the hypothesis that poverty may show distinctive social patterns, which couple with a given spatial dimension and therefore can be defined as a spatially heterogeneous phenomenon at both national and sub-national level. Using the available data from Eurostat on income and living conditions (EUSILC) at NUTS2 level, the paper highlights the different territorial patterns in shaping the risk of exclusion across the EU regions. Focusing on the regions of the Southern and Eastern peripheral EU Member States (MSs), the paper outlines the differences emerging from the results achieved by the EU MSs in applying the Europe 2020 Strategy. Moreover, it deepens the analysis of the poverty drivers at the regional level. The paper shows that the peripheral countries of EU are more vulnerable to poverty but different patterns emerge when comparing Mediterranean and Eastern countries, especially with regard to the material deprivation and the drivers influencing poverty and risk of exclusion.
R58|The Contrasting Importance of Quality of Life and Quality of Business for Domestic and International Migrants|We examine whether bilateral regional migration flows are driven by the city’s quality of life (QL) or quality of business (QB). The QL and QB measures are constructed using (quality-adjusted) rents and wages in each city. QL and QB reflect the willingness to pay of households and firms, respectively, for local amenities. The measures are constructed for 31 urban areas in New Zealand using five-yearly census data covering 1986 to 2013. We adopt a gravity model of regional migration – augmented by destination and origin QL and QB – to model bilateral flows of working-age migrants (post tertiary education and pre-retirement age). We also model flows between urban and rural areas and flows for the urban areas to and from overseas locations. We find different attractors for international versus domestic migrants according to the type of city amenity. International migrants are more attracted to cities with productive amenities whereas domestic migrants are more attracted to places with consumption amenities. Thus, in deciding on the type of city amenity to enhance, city officials implicitly choose the type of migrant that they attract as well as the type of city that may result.
R58|Spatial Misallocation: Evaluating Place-Based Policies Using a Natural Experiment in China|Using the mass closure of development zones in 2004 as a natural experiment, we examine the causal effect of development zones on firm level TFP in China. The difference-in-difference estimator shows that on average, loss of development zone policies results in 6.5% loss of firms’ TFP. Locational heterogeneity is important. Within 500 kilometers from the three major seaports in China, closure of zones reduced firm-level TFP by 9.62%, whereas closure of zones farther away did not show significant effects. Market potential and local within-industry spillover effects can explain much of this locational heterogeneity. We conclude that China’s strategy of using development zones as a place-based policy to encourage inland development may have led to spatial misallocation.
R58|Making the most of tourism in Indonesia to promote sustainable regional development|Tourism has boomed in Indonesia in recent years and is already one of the main sources of foreign-currency earnings. Indonesia has rich and diverse natural assets, whose tourism potential remains underutilised. The government has an ambitious target of attracting 20 million tourists by 2019, up from nearly 14 million in 2017. The main destination will continue to be Bali. Using Bali as the preferred development model, the government wants to develop other destinations, particularly through infrastructure programmes to improve connectivity, which is a longstanding challenge for tourism as well as for regional development more generally. Enhancing the tourism-related skills of local populations will provide them with expanded job opportunities. This calls for reforms to vocational education and training. Moreover, recent efforts by the authorities to improve the business environment need to continue, including through helping firms embrace digitalisation. Tourism may be growing too fast in some destinations without adequately taking into account sustainability issues, both for the environment and local communities. Better planning and co-ordination at all levels of government and across relevant policy areas can facilitate more sustainable tourism development.This Working Paper relates to the 2018 OECD Economic Survey of Indonesia (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-indonesia.htm).
R58|Realising regional potentials through better market integration in China|China’s regions have been experiencing impressive growth over the past decades, but their potentials could be better exploited by creating a single product and labour market. Local protectionism increases transaction costs and hinders competition, thereby taking a toll on productivity. Administrative monopolies have long thrived and are hard to dismantle. Restrictions on the hukou and the fragmented pension system limit labour mobility. Local regulations aim at, among other things, securing the collection of local taxes, without which cities could not afford to offer the same public services to migrants as to urbanites. Hence, dismantling local regulations and creating a single product and labour market needs to go hand-in-hand with the reform of inter-governmental finances. Recent measures on both the product and labour market front appear to aim at making up for the slow progress over the past decade or so. There are signs that these efforts are helping China’s regions at various levels to converge toward each other. Disparities are shrinking faster across provinces, compared to within provinces. Integration of product and labour markets will boost productivity over the medium-to long term by reducing transaction costs, but could potentially widen regional disparities, which are already relatively high. This will necessitate enhanced transfers and re-centralisation of the financing of spending in some key categories such as education and health. Policies to help catching up of laggard regions by better connectivity through infrastructure investment are bearing fruit, but such investments should be subject to rigorous cost-benefit criteria to enhance capital allocation efficiency and should take into account externalities. Notwithstanding significant disparities along multiple dimensions across provinces, inequalities, be it in terms of income, wealth or education, are actually most striking along the rural-urban dimension. The rural revitalisation strategy, a novel element of the 19th Party Congress outcomes, is expected to address this issue. The other recent strategy of nurturing the formation of city groups will also likely benefit rural areas in-between those cities.This Working Paper relates to the 2019 OECD Economic Survey of China (http://www.oecd.org/economy/china-economic-snapshot/).
R58|Indigenous economic development and well-being in a place-based context|This paper adapts the OECD Regional Development framework to places with an Indigenous population.

R58|Rural study of Korea|This paper examines the role of rural regions in the economic transformation of Korea. The analysis at regional level reveals that, while having experiencing continued urbanisation and rapid demographic shift of aging and depopulation, the Korean rural areas performs well in terms of productivity growth thanks to the relatively higher share of tradable sectors in rural economies. It also provides the overview of how the rural policy in Korea, which has evolved in response to the socio-economic changes and growing well-being concerns. With the balanced national development at the centre of the national agenda for decades, regional policy approaches have diversified from state-led large projects to flexible policy packages and functional approaches to enhance rural economies and well-being. Finally, the paper presents a number of international policy approaches that can be useful for Korea, including the case of France, Italy and Sweden.
R58|Classifying small (TL3) regions based on metropolitan population, low density and remoteness|This paper provides a method to classify TL3regions across OECD countries based on their level of access to metropolitan areas. TL3 regions are classified as ‘metropolitan’ if more than half of their population lives in one or more functional urban area (FUA) of at least 250 thousand inhabitants and as ‘non-metropolitan’ otherwise. The method sub-classifies metropolitan regions into ‘large metro’ or ‘metro’ regions based on the population size of the FUAs located within those regions. Non-metropolitan TL3 regions are sub-classified into: with accessto a metro, with access to a small/medium city, or remote based on their level of access to a FUA with population above a predetermined threshold. The method relies on publicly available grid-level population data and localised information on driving conditions.
R58|Integrating gender analysis into food & nutrition security early warning systems in West Africa|Integrating gender dimensions into early warning systems is critical to support equitable crisis prevention and response. This paper investigates the extent to which food and nutrition security early warning systems (FNS EWS) in the Sahel and West Africa are gender-responsive and highlights existing gaps at national and regional levels. Progress has been made by key partners and stakeholders towards strengthening the gender analysis of FNS EWS, however, these efforts have not led to a unified reconfiguration of joint FNS EWS mechanisms to be more gender-responsive. More concerted efforts are required to assess and track the gender dimensions of FNS EWS to inform more equitable emergency prevention and response. This paper provides timely policy directions to support stakeholders’ efforts in strengthening the gender-responsiveness of early warning systems in the Sahel and West Africa.
R58|Intégrer l’analyse sexospécifique dans les systèmes d’alerte précoce pour la sécurité alimentaire et nutritionnelle en Afrique de l’Ouest|L’intégration de la problématique femmes-hommes dans les systèmes d’alerte précoce est essentielle afin de prévenir et gérer les crises de façon plus équitable. Cette Note examine la prise en compte dans les systèmes d’alerte précoce pour la sécurité alimentaire et nutritionnelle (SAP-SAN) au Sahel et en Afrique de l’Ouest du genre. Elle identifie les lacunes aux niveaux national et régional. Il en ressort que les partenaires et parties prenantes ont renforcé la capacité d’analyse sexospécifique de ces systèmes. Mais ces avancées n’ont pas abouti à une refonte uniforme des mécanismes conjoints auxquels font appel les SAP-SAN afin de les rendre plus sensibles aux disparités qui existent entre les sexes. Des efforts plus concertés s’imposent pour déterminer les aspects de la problématique femmes-hommes à intégrer dans les SAP-SAN et en assurer le suivi pour des systèmes de prévention et de gestion de crise plus équitables. Ce document présente des pistes pour appuyer ces efforts.
R58|Future-Proofing the WA Economy: A roadmap to industrial diversification and regional growth|Future-Proofing the WA Economy is the fourth report in the Bankwest Curtin Economics Centre’s Focus on Industry report series. The report recommends the implementation of a ‘smart specialisation’ approach to regional diversification, to ensure that new development opportunities build on existing regional capabilities and capitalise on local conditions and networks. Of course, this doesn’t mean taking our ‘foot off the gas’ in the parts of the economy that are going well. A fundamental element of smart specialisation is to support those industries that the regions are leading in. But the smart specialisation policy is useful to encourage diversification into new industries that build on WA’s existing advantages. This report contributes an important new evidence base to inform the State’s diversification strategy, based on a data-driven approach to identify current industry strengths and emerging opportunities in each of WA’s ten regions. The report puts forward a series of recommendations to support the State’s diversification strategies. In doing so, our hope is that more economic development opportunities in Western Australia will be seized rather than lost.
R58|Populist Voting and Losersâ€™ Discontent: Does Redistribution Matter?|Economic roots of populism in Western countries are quite well understood but much less is known about policy implications. We study a large redistribution program that conveyed, within the EU cohesion framework, a relevant amount of money to some Italian municipalities. Our identification strategy is based on a spatial regression discontinuity design, which exploits the allocation rule of funds. We focus on the 2013 general elections and show that municipalities favored by redistribution exhibit a drop in populism of about 5% of the mean of the dependent variable.
R58|EU regions and the upgrading for the digital age|In this work we use patent data from the European patent office (EPO) to assess the capabilities of EU regions in developing digital technologies especially focusing on those that are more closely related to the digital transformation. More specifically, we measure ICT patents by considering those containing digital codes, as defined by the OECD. The penetration of digital technologies in the development of innovative products is instead captured by the co-occurrence of digital and non-digital codes within patent documents; we call these patents ICT-combining patents.
R58|Smart Specialisation at work: Assessing investment priorities|This paper provides a methodology to assess how national and regional authorities define their research and innovation investment priorities for smart specialisation. It then tests the methodology empirically, based on a significant sample of research and innovation strategies for smart specialisation from Italy and Poland. The paper helps to fill a gap in the emerging literature on smart specialisation regarding the definition of investment priority areas, while providing useful analytical elements to orient policy impact evaluation exercises. We found that research and innovation priorities in Italy and Poland are defined in line with a multi-level, tree-like structure whose higher hierarchical level usually contains a few broad dimensions, and whose branches cover several specific activities. When considered individually, most of those activities represent suitable smart specialisation priorities. Yet, some of the examined strategies contain priorities that do not fully reflect the smart specialisation logic. Several strategies encompass tens or even hundreds of activities. It is beyond the scope of the present study to evaluate the appropriateness of a certain set of investment priorities in relation to the characteristics of a region or country. However, our analysis raises an important question about the capacity of the strategy management bodies to effectively support the development of huge sets of activities each of which potentially requires specific competences and dedicated administrative and technical resources. Also, large sets of priorities may de facto circumvent the smart specialisation principle of selective intervention, as the strategies ultimately cover broad economic areas.
R58|Smart Specialisation at work: The policy makers' view on strategy design and implementation|This paper illustrates the results of a survey on the Smart Specialisation experience across European regions and countries. By collecting and analysing the views of national and regional authorities, the survey intended to take stock of Smart Specialisation Strategies implementation, identify critical issues and challenges while drawing some lessons and recommendations in light of the debate on the post-2020 Cohesion Policy. Overall, despite being considered particularly challenging in terms of policy intelligence, skills and capabilities for public authorities and other stakeholders, Smart Specialisation experience is positively valued by the vast majority of respondents. Substantial improvements are detected with respect to: stakeholder engagement, priority setting, concentration of funding, level of trust and emergence of innovation potential; whereas, more efforts are needed in relation to the quality and effectiveness of monitoring activities and strategiesâ€™ outward-looking perspective. Further progress is still required as regards the policy regulatory framework, governance and institutional capabilities along with the involvement of relevant actors (notably SMEs and civil-society groups) who have remained at the margin of the decision making process thus far. With respect to the ultimate objective of the policy, national and regional actors are not observing significant progresses towards economic transformation yet. Respondents recommend to maintain the current policy framework for the future, while introducing new elements to improve strategiesâ€™ efficacy and make Smart Specialisation more responsive to the specific needs of different territories.
R58|Transport liberalization and regional imbalances with endogenous freight rates|This paper develops a tractable two-region New Economic Geography model with footloose capital and endogenous freight rates to investigate the welfare implications and long-run industry reallocation patterns triggered by transport liberalization. Two policy scenarios are considered: one where a unique tariff per route is imposed, independently of the direction of shipment, and one of complete deregulation. Carriers in fully deregulated transport markets are shown to charge higher markups in shipments towards the periphery. This pricing behavior counterbalances the welfare-decreasing agglomeration forces associated with lowering trade costs and ensures welfare gains in both region in the short and long run.
R58|Creative Differences? Measuring Creative Economy Employment in the US and UK Using Microdata|Using high-quality administrative microdata spanning 2011-2013, this paper develops new routines to compare creative economies using the creative trident framework, and applies them to the UK and US national and regional contexts. We find the UK creative economy is larger in workforce shares, and grows faster over the study period; the US' is absolutely larger, and is distributed more evenly across industries. Regional results are shaped by deeper differences in national urban systems. The paper highlights possibilities for widely varying national configurations of creative economies, considers potential mechanisms driving differentiation, and reflects on the usefulness of the creative trident approach.
R58|Incubators, Accelerators and Regional Economic Development|A growing wave of co-location programmes promises to boost growth for young firms. Despite great public and policy interest we have little idea whether such programmes are effective. This paper categorises accelerators and incubators within a larger family of 'co-location' interventions. We then develop a single framework to theorise workspace-level impacts. We summarise available evaluation evidence and sketch implications for regional economic policy. We find clear evidence programmes are effective overall. But we know little about how effects operate - or who benefits. Providers and policymakers should experiment further to establish optimal designs.
R58|How Do Regional Price Levels Affect Income Inequality? Household-level Evidence From 21 Countries|Regional differences in prices levels are substantial in many countries, but little is known about how important they are for income inequality and relative poverty. To bridge this gap, we provide new evidence on the basis of the best available data and a novel two-step approach. First, we collect the largest cross-country dataset of regional price level estimates from 12 countries and use it to predict regional price levels in other countries. We then combine all these regional prices levels with household-level data from the Luxembourg Income Study, which gives us results for a final sample of 21 countries. We find that for some countries Gini coefficients and headcount poverty ratios are statistically significantly different when adjusted for regional price levels. For example, we show that adjusting for regional price levels would lower the Gini coefficients by 2% for Italy, 3% for Columbia and by 4% for Georgia, while it would increase the headcount poverty ratio by 6% for France and by 7% for Ireland. We conclude that regional price levels affect income inequality to a varying extent and should be taken into account by policy makers and in future research.
R58|The Challenge for Regional Development| This working paper reproduces the speech by Professor Geoffrey J.D. Hewings at the Nomination Ceremony as Member of the Andalusian Regional Science Academy, on 28 May 2018 at Loyola Andalusia University.Professor Hewings reviews the evolution of Regional Science since the sixties, highlighting the key and forgotten role of the space when the outcomes of the economic policies are assessed in terms of developments. In addition,the challenges posed by demographic change are drawn, pointing out the future research directions to be addressed by regional modelers.
R58|The allocation of responsabilities between the central state and local authorities in the countries of the alpine area An empirical investigation based on PISA data from Italy|This work deals with the topic of the allocation of responsibilities between the central state and local authorities, with a specific territorial focus: it takes into consideration six European countries that are covered by the EUSALP Strategy (namely, the EU Strategy for the Alpine Region): Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Slovenia and Switzerland. Despite such a common EU Strategy, and a generalised need for defining a reference framework to compare policies supporting innovation in territorial ecosystems, some major differences characterise the forms of States and the regional authorities in the aforementioned countries. Thus, moving from some general indications on the regional territorial organization of national countries, this study aims to return the main characteristics of the allocation of the legislative (and partly the administrative) responsibilities in the six countries of the Alpine region.
R58|Federalism, Fiscal Asymmetries and Economic Convergence: Evidence from Indian States|This paper tests economic convergence across States in India by incorporating federal fiscal asymmetries and differentials in gross fixed capital formation at the state level. Using dynamic panel models, it is observed that there is no unconditional convergence of economic growth. Controlling for state-wise asymmetries in fiscal policy variables, financial parameters, capital formation and human development outcomes using Arenallo and Bond (1991) panel data methodology, no strong evidence for conditional convergence is observed. It is observed from the GMM estimations that public capital spending has positive and significant relationship with economic growth. It is also observed that the quality of human capital formation is a pre-requisite for economic growth, both for club and (aggregate) conditional convergence.
R58|Who are the beneficiaries of the structural funds and the cohesion fund and how does the cohesion policy impact firm-level performance?|This paper exploits a new database that is unique in its scale and scope containing detailed information on over two million projects carried out by one million firms that benefited from the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund in 25 EU member countries during the multi-annual financial framework 2007-2013. This database is used to get a better understanding of the characteristics of the beneficiaries of European funds and to assess the impact of the European funds on the beneficiaries’ performance in terms of employment growth, growth in fixed assets, and total factor productivity. While the data reveals substantial heterogeneity of beneficiaries and projects across and within countries, in terms of the number of projects, their total values, the average firm size and other aspects, some patterns are identified. The majority of co-funding goes to manufacturing firms as well as public institutions. The Cohesion Fund co-finances larger projects, carried out by larger, more capital-intensive firms that typically conduct large-scale infrastructure projects. In contrast, the European Social Fund co-finances smaller projects related to human capital and initiatives on the labour market. In terms of volume, the European Regional and Development Fund has the largest budget in total and co-finances a large variety of projects. Using propensity score matching techniques, we find mixed effects of structural and cohesion funds on the performance of a sample of manufacturing firms in six European countries. On average, firms that receive financial assistance hire more workers and increase their capital stock more. However, there is little evidence of additional positive total factor productivity effects for the beneficiaries.
R58|Problematika zadluženosti municipalit na příkladu obcí Moravskoslezského kraje| Obce se při svém hospodaření mohou dostat do situace, kdy v rozpočtu nemají dostatečné množství finančních prostředků na pokrytí výdajů, jako je údržba, výstavba a rekonstrukce infrastruktury, či na rozvoj svého území. To je pak vede k hledání cizích zdrojů, buď ve formě nenávratných, nebo návratných finančních prostředků, a tedy k zadlužování. V České republice patří otázka zadluženosti obcí a územně samosprávných celků mezi diskutovaná témata. Důvodem je donedávna rostoucí objem zadluženosti obcí, který akceleroval v porevolučních letech velice rychlým tempem a dosud se dotýká více než poloviny obcí. Autoři tohoto článku si tak kladli za cíl zmapovat situaci problematiky zadlužení všech 300 obcí Moravskoslezského kraje, konkrétně schopnosti splácení jejich dluhů a zjistit, zda je splácení pro obce problém. Pro tento účel byl vybrán ukazatel podílu celkového dluhu na saldu běžného rozpočtu a obce byly monitorovány v období od roku 2010 do roku 2016. Na základě zjištěných výsledků byly obce rozděleny do 3 skupin podle míry rizika spojeného se splácením dluhu. Bylo zjištěno, že v případě indikátoru zadluženosti týkajícího se schopnosti splácet své závazky ve střednědobém horizontu, municipality v Moravskoslezském kraji jako celek nevykazují vysoký stupeň rizika, u více než šedesát procent z nich je situace stabilní a pouze málo obcí se musí zaměřit na její zlepšení.
R58| Variegated dependence: The geographically differentiated economic outcomes of resource-based development in Peru, 2001-2015| The economic impacts of resource-based development are distributed unevenly across national space, and not even mining regions experience economic development in the same way. We build on the methodology of Rehner et. al. (2014) to typify resource-based economic development in Peru in the period 2001- 2015 and compare it with the case of mineral-abundant Chile. What we find is a nuanced version of the same dependency-related resource curse phenomenon. With the commodity cycle: (i) export specialization is not the same in all places; (ii) regional growth volatility is much higher in Peru than in Chile; (iii) the Dutch disease does not clearly manifest itself; and therefore (iv) economic dependence within Peru is variegated. At the national level, gold-and-copper-dependent Peru is not as vulnerable as copper-dependent Chile to external shocks. At the subnational level, outside Lima in particular, dependence-related volatility can be very high for clusters of regions. The results of the quantitative analysis are attuned to a theoretical framework of variegated dependence, which, while acknowledging the centrality of the center-and-periphery supranational structure for economic development, attributes variation in resource curse phenomena to subnational differences across space and over time in economic- geography configurations and institutional regimes.

R58|Regionale und lokale Wirtschaftsförderung: Meran und Brixen im Kontext der Regionalökonomie Südtirols<BR>[Regional and Local Economic Development: Merano and Bressanone within the Context of South Tyrol’s Regional Economy]|The present study takes stock of the regional economy of the Autonomous Province of Bolzano-Alto Adige/Bozen-Südtirol (South Tyrol) and the local economies of the cities of Merano/Meran and Bressanone/Brixen. In particular, the stocktaking exercise covers the sectoral structure of the economy, the role of retail and culture, and the state of tourism development in the two cities. Further, the study assesses agents and initiatives of local and regional economic development in both cities and on the provincial level. The stocktaking exercise takes into consideration the role of European structural policy and notably the province’s smart specialisation strategy. Based on the regional and local economic analysis, stylized conclusions are drawn and preliminary recommendations are given on how to develop the regional and local economies analyzed over the course of the coming years.
R58|The Mediation Effect of Regional Development in Relationship Between Community Participation to Sustainable Transportation in The City of Medan, North Sumatra Indonesia|The paper aims is to investigate the mediation effect of regional development on the relationship between community participation to sustainable transportation in the city of Medan, North Sumatra Indonesia. This research was conducted by an explanatory approach using primary data with purposive sampling technique method based on criteria of 300 respondents. Data analysis techniques used was SEM (Structural Equation Modeling). The results of this study indicate that community participation has positive influence on regional development in the city of Medan, regional development has positive direct effect on sustainable transportation in the city of Medan, community participation has positive direct effect on sustainable transportation in the city of Medan, and community participation has positive indirect effect on sustainable transportation in the city of Medan. Regional development has positive mediation effect between community participation to sustainable transportation in the city of Medan, North Sumatra Indonesia.
R58|Rural waste disposal issues within urban borders|The paper examines the waste management issues in the villages annexed to administrative-territorial units of the Romanian cities which have been frequently neglected by urban waste operators. The lack of waste collection services in such peri-urban communities favored the illegal waste disposal practices particularly prior to EU accession. The extension of waste collection services from main cities to such areas is compulsory in order to mitigate the environmental risks and the public health threats. The paper estimates the amounts of household waste susceptible to be uncontrolled disposed of by peri-urban villages in different geographical areas of NorthEast region with a particular focus on Neamt county. The paper points out that these rural settlements should receive the same attention concerning the municipal waste management services as the main urban areas. Traditional recovery of waste fractions at the household level (e.g., home composting) should be further promoted in such areas in order to avoid illegal dumping issue and to prevent the landfill of biodegradable waste as requested by EU regulations.
R58|Assessment of waste dumping practices in mountain creeks|The paper examines the exposure of mountain creeks towards illegal waste disposal practices related to the lack of waste collection services in rural areas of Romania prior to EU accession and the low waste collection efficiency following the closure of rural wild dumps in 2009-2010. The paper estimates the amounts of household waste uncollected and disposed in selected small Carpathian rivers in the North-East development region. The expansion of built-up areas along the water courses leads to waste dumping practices across mountain villages in the context of poor waste management facilities. Particular morphology of villages and hydrological characteristics of the creeks may influence the magnitude of such bad practices. The paper points out the role of flash floods in cleaning upstream catchments from debris, thus, polluting the downstream rivers and human settlements. An efficient waste collection system in mountain areas has a crucial role to play in mitigating and ultimately preventing the waste dumping practices in water bodies.
R58|Integrierte Wirtschaftsförderung in Kufstein<BR>[Integrated Local Economic Development in Kufstein]|The present study takes stock of the local economy of Kufstein, Austria within the context of the regional economy of the Austrian state of Tyrol. Based on the findings of the analysis, the study proposes ideas for local economic development in Kufstein. The study characterizes the local economy of Kufstein sectorally and stakes stock of relevant agents and programs of local and regional economic development. The ideas elaborated on the basis of the analysis suggest a strategy of local economic development for Kufstein that integrates aspects of innovation and entrepreneurship support, tourism development, city marketing, and retail trade promotion and that is synchronized with the general orientation of the regional economic development policy pursued by the state of Tyrol.
R58|Hierarchically structured determinants and phase-related patterns of economic resilience – An empirical case study for European regions|Our paper seeks to provide empirical evidence for a spatial-temporal system of (short-term) regional resilience determinants. Based on groundwork from Martin (2012) and Martin and Sunley (2015), we employ a nested hierarchy of regional and national determinants to constitute the spatial dimension, while we model the temporal dimension through a resistance and a recovery phase. Utilising hierarchical panel data models for a sample of 22 European countries, we can confirm the presence of a spatial-temporal system as we find significant determinants at both spatial levels that are connected via cross-level interactions and reveal varying, if not opposing directions of influences across the sensitivity and recovery phase.
R58|Environmental Risks between Conceptualization and Action|Changes in the contemporary world materialized in particular through population growth and mobility, urbanization, and economic expansion also result in an increased exposure of people and assets to extreme events and impose, implicitly, adequate management of induced risks. The occurrence of natural and anthropogenic risk phenomena, known as hazards, puts a heavy tribute on disaster-sensitive human communities regardless of their level of development. The magnitude of the disasters and their increasing frequency and severity imply the need for their approach by the entire world community and for global action. Knowledge of risks becomes a sine qua condition in carrying out impact studies, risk prevention plans, spatial planning plans, and, in general, a condition for effective management of natural resources or sustainable development projects.
R58|The Cross Border Cooperation between Romania and Hungary|Abstract: European territorial cooperation means a balanced development of the whole community area by encouraging cooperation and exchange of best practices among all the EU regions, which was organized across three axes: cross-border, transnational and inter-regional cooperation. Cross-border cooperation is not just about financing and creating infrastructure, but also aimed to strengthen cooperation: one of the most important concepts of cross-border cooperation programs is to facilitate the joint development of geographically related areas, sharing resources separated by artificial boundaries. Strengthening economic and social cohesion in the border region can be achieved by investing in business infrastructure by supporting cross-border business cooperation and tourism development between the two countries.

R58|Absorptive capacity, economic freedom and the conditional effects of regional policy|This paper analyzes the role played by regional conditioning factors, namely absorptive capacity and economic freedom, for the working of regional policy in Germany. We construct synthetic composite indicators to measure differences in these factors across German regions and stratify regions by their respective values. We then identify the subsample-specific transmission channels of regional policies in a spatial panel vector-autoregressive (VAR) framework and compare the direction and magnitude of effects by impulse-response function analysis and ex-post t-tests. The results point to two main channels of policy impact: While regions with low levels of absorptive capacity and economic freedom benefit from public funding only in terms of a traditional funding channel (i.e. higher investment rates and partly increased human capital levels), the link between regional policy, GDP and technology growth is very weak for these regions. In comparison, our findings hint at significant positive effects on regional GDP per workforce and patent activity for regions with a high absorptive capacity and economic freedom (i.e. a knowledge-based funding channel). This underlines the role of regional conditions for the direction and magnitude of funding effects and should be considered by policy makers as a means to trigger policy effectiveness in times of stagnating or decreasing funding volumes.
R58|Locational (In-)Efficiency of Renewable Power Generation Feeding in the Electricity Grid: A Spatial Regression Analysis|This paper analyzes the negative external effects caused by the introduction of variable renewable energy sources into an inflexible power system. We investigate the costs that arise due to the need for temporarily reducing their output to relief grid overstress in the case of high electricity feed-in. The responsible system operator has to remunerate the power plant operator for this lost output. The resulting costs for the system operator, the so-called feed-in management costs, are passed on to the end-consumers in the respective region via the grid use tariff scheme. In this paper, we develop a two-part regression model that explains (i) the occurrence of feed-in management and (ii) the regional variation of feed-in management costs. In the first part, we use a logit model to explain why some regions experienced feed-in management in recent years and others did not. The second part covers an augmented spatial econometric model that investigates the interregional variability of feed-in management costs. The estimates of both models show that especially the installed capacity of wind energy connected to the medium and high voltage level have a negative impact on feed-in management and that high load in a region reduces the need for feed-in management measures. The augmented spatial model indicates for the case of four major DSOs in Germany that an increase by 1 MW of wind energy capacity at the medium and high voltage level lead to an increase in feed-in management costs by 1.9% and 0.9% in regions that already experienced feed-in management, respectively. The policy implication of this finding is that price signals for the reinforcement of the grid infrastructure or for the siting of VRES should be given.
R58|European Funds As Stimulative Support In Developing The Marketing Strategy For Tourism Of Vojvodina|In many European Union countries, regional and rural development strategies also include rural tourism, which helps to retain the local population, creates new jobs and contributes to the socio-economic progress of underdeveloped areas. Through specialized institutions and funds, the European Union helps and through various forms directly participates in tourism development in rural areas, and the strengthening of rural development policy has become one of the highest priorities of the European Union. Although not a member of the EU, the Republic of Serbia has defined its path of development, which implies strengthening the competitiveness and attractiveness of tourism products, taking into account new world experiences, while relying on own innovations and pre-accession EU funds. This aspect was the starting point for the development of these research and the aim of the authors was to point out one of the ways to use the excess labor force in the tourism sector, how to develop rural tourism and how to use the European funds for the development of regional tourism in the region of Vojvodina.
R58|Regional Differences in Consumption Patterns in Turkey: An Analysis of Income and Price Elasticities|Studies on regional income and consumption disparities have always attracted the attentions of not only the economists but also of the social scientists in various fields. These differences are usually taken into account in designing regional development policies in many countries. There is a considerable amount of studies on regional income differences but studies on consumption differences are relatively limited. The purpose of the paper is to investigate if there are considerable differences in household consumption patterns across 26 regions of Turkey. We estimate income and price elasticites of demand for 12 groups of goods and services for the period from 2005 to 2013 by using the Geographically Weighted Panel Regression (GWPR) recently developed by Bruna and Yu (2013). The technique suggests that a set of global regression coefficients would not adequately take into account the underlying data generating process of the observed geographic dataset. For various reasons such as intrinsic varying mechanisms or potential misspecification, the relation between dependent and explanatory variables would differ from one location to other. GWR overcomes this shortcoming by estimating local coefficients along with global coefficients. The empirical results reveal that demand elasticities of price and income for shelter, furniture and beverages are similar between the east and the west regions; while demand elasticities for food, clothing, communication and education are varied across the regions.
R58|Maintenance of the railway user?under?the aging society in Tokyo metropolitan suburban area|Japan has been facing problems related to decline of population and aging. Also Tokyo metropolitan area is estimated depopulation and hard aging. Additionally a new urban planning that targets the reduction of automobile dependence and the use of public transit is required for realization of sustainable city. Tokyo metropolitan area is originally excellent in railway usage on commuting transit. Under this situation it is important that railway passengers preserve. I study the influence of land use patterns, aging and traffic means to railway station around above 580 railway stations on railway passengers from the viewpoint of sustainable rail transit service, especially viewpoint of TOD (Transit Oriented Development) using multiple regression analysis. In this study I set railway station influence area 800m in land use analysis and 500m in population aging analysis. I use railway passenger?s data from 1999 to 2015. In this study land use classification is farmland, forest, low-rise housing, crowd low-rise housing, middle and high-rise housing, commercial and business use, park and green land, manufacturing, public institution and development land. Traffic means to railway station in this study analysis are bicycle, bus, motor bicycle and working. As a result, it?s found that aging around railway station affect decrease railway passengers and mixed land use around railway stations has a constant effect on the increase and retention of the number of railway passengers. On the other hand, traffic means to railway station is not related to maintenance of the railway user. In addition aging around railway station is related to land use. Namely, in high component of low-rise housing areas hard aging is advancing. I will introduce success example of railway passengers? maintenance. It is important to perform mixed land use around railway station, urban redevelopment around railway station at high component of low-rise housing area, especially, unplanned sprawl area.
R58|Characteristics of Non-participants in Community Development Activities in Taiwan, a Case Study of a Rural Community in Tainan|Participatory Community Development (PCD) is a method to solve problems in a community by residents who have common concern about their community?s condition. Taiwan has advanced PCD since the comprehensive community development policy was implemented in 1994. This study aims to clarify characteristics of non-participants in PCD activities based on a certain social dimension. Previous studies have improved PCD technologies, such as clarifying success factors for the community revitalization and developing measures to support PCD mainly focusing on the participant-group, although some researchers pointed out a PCD problem of which participants were a segment of the residents. However, it would be difficult to ensure the continuity of PCD activities which is an entrance to construct a sustainable community, if specialists just focus on participants. Thus, it is worth focusing on the non-participant and considering its reasons from the viewpoint of PCD study. The research field is an agricultural village of R district in B division in Tainan-city. The survey was conducted three times from 2011 to 2018. The PCD?s leader is a pastor in R district and the research already found that participants were almost all Christians and non-participants were almost all Tao-people as it was stated earlier. Based on non-participants? narratives, the study roughly highlighted characteristics of their daily lives as follows:1. They revere ancestors as well as Tao?s gods. They have a specific time for worship in their house every day. In contrast, they visit a temple in the district twice a month for regular rites. They attend worship alone or as a family and there is usually no occasion to communicate with other residents. 2. They frankly visit each other, while there are no relationships beyond the chatting level.3. They do not share memories about the family and the temple between generations.4. They tend to frankly join activities in the district regardless of religions or anything else if they can get information. Therefore, a characteristic of non-participants can be summarized as a more individual-lifestyle, which is more individualistic than Christian participants who have more opportunities to gather in the church. The results indicate that the non-participation is caused by those lifestyles rather than a difference in religions which is generally said in the area. Moreover, the importance of the social dimension as an influential factor was suggested. A micro-perspective based on the locality will be required more and more in the PCD study.
R58|Actual Condition Of Employee Number In Japanese Local Cities? Central Areas|In Japan, the decline of the central district is one of the most serious urban problems.It is caused by decreased commercial function and the urban sprawl with disorderly constructed large commercial complex and motorization. In this study, we investigate employee number trend in the central district and suburban area. This study targets 35 cities with population ranging from over 100,000 to less than 400,000 that do not fall in the three major metropolitan areas (Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka) and We confirm actual employee number in central district from 2009 to 2014 and population from 2010 to 2015 .This study analyses the relationship between population and employee number , especially paying attention to ? Wholesale and retail trade? , ? Finance and insurance? ,? Scientific research, professional and technical service ?, ? Accommodations eating and drinking service?, ? Education, learning support? and ? Medical, health care and welfare? which account for a higher proportion in all industry types in central district and have distinctive trends.As a result the following points were demonstrated. A: Although the employee number in almost cities is on a decreasing trend, the employee number of? Medical, health care and welfare? in central district clearly is clearly on an increasing trend in all cities.B: Although the employee number of almost industry types is clearly on a decreasing trend, the employee number of ? Scientific research, professional and technical service ? and ? Education, learning support? is a more slowly decreasing trend than others.
R58|The effects of foreign direct investment on regional growth and productivity| To promote regional economic growth in the current global environment, nations have begun methodically combining internal assets with external capabilities. Against this backdrop, this paper demonstrates how foreign direct investment (FDI) — a major channel for participating in the global production network — influences regional economic development. Its key findings are as follows: 1) Korea has reached the stage where outbound overseas investments outpace inbound FDI, 2) FDI in Korea is heavily concentrated in a handful of regions and in particular the Seoul capital region, 3) inbound FDI has a statistically significant positive impact on regional growth and productivity and 4) outbound foreign investment weighs negatively on regional growth and productivity. The paper concludes by arguing the necessity of utilizing a global perspective in regional policymaking.
R58|Institutional change and the development of lagging regions in Europe|According to the dominant economic theories, economic growth is the result of a combination of three factors – physical capital, human capital or labour, and innovation –plus a residual factor or error term, which represents what we do not know or cannotexplain. Depending on whether a neoclassical growth (Solow, 1956; Swan, 1956) or an endogenous growth approach is adopted (Romer, 1986: Lucas, 1988), the weight attributed to each of the components varies, but they remain, in different guises the fundamental drivers informing development policies across the world. The European Union’s (EU) regional development and cohesion policy has been no exception. The bulk of cohesion investments have been channelled towards improving the infrastructure endowment and accessibility of the least developed regions of the EU, as well as increasing the availability and quality of human resources, and developing the innovative capacity of individuals and firms across lagging areas of Europe.

R58|Incubators, Accelerators and Regional Economic Development|A growing wave of co-location programmes promises to boost growth for entrepreneurs and young firms. Despite great public and policy interest we have little idea whether such programmes are effective. This paper categorises accelerators and incubators within a larger family of co-location interventions. We then develop a single framework to theorise workspace-level impacts. We summarise available evaluation evidence and sketch implications for regional economic policy. We find clear evidence programmes are effective overall. But we know little about how effects operate – or who benefits. Providers and policymakers should experiment further to establish optimal designs.
R58|One or Many Cohesion Policies of the European Union? On the Diverging Impacts of Cohesion Policy across Member States|Do regions in all Member States (MSs) of the European Union (EU) benefit from Cohesion Policy? Are regional impacts persistently diversified across countries? In order to answer these questions this paper explores how the impact of the EU Cohesion Policy on growth and employment varies across countries. A spatial Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) makes it possible estimate distinct but fully comparable impacts for each individual MS both before the Great Recession and during recovery. The results show that Cohesion Policy has exerted a positive and significant EU-wide impact on both regional economic growth and employment. However, regional impacts are not evenly distributed across MSs. Large part of the regional growth bonus generated by Cohesion Policy is concentrated in Germany. Conversely, impacts on regional employment are confined to the United Kingdom. The picture for beneficiary regions in Southern European Member States is less rosy with positive impacts on employment in Italy until the Great Recession and on economic growth in the recovery period in Spain.
R58|Cohesion Policy Incentives for Collaborative Industrial Research. The Evaluation of a Smart Specialisation Forerunner Programme|This paper evaluates a program of subsidies for Collaborative Industrial Research (co-)funded by the EU Cohesion Policy in Italy mobilizing over 1 billion euros. This program anticipated in the 2007-2013 funding cycle some of the key features of Smart Specialization Strategy (S3) programmes, offering evidence-based insights on potential challenges to the practical application of the S3 approach. The programme was not successful in boosting investments, value added or employment of beneficiary firms. The collaborative dimension of the projects added limited value and a more generous level funding would have not improved effectiveness. However, positive impacts emerged in low tech sectors.
R58|Las zonas económicas especiales en el suroeste de México y el desarrollo regional|En 2016, el congreso mexicano decretó la creación de cuatro Zonas Económicas Especiales (ZEE) en los puertos de Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán, Puerto Chiapas, Chiapas, Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, y Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, cuya transferencia de recursos no será suficiente para superar en el largo plazo la difícil situación socioeconómica de marginación y pobreza que prevalece en la región suroeste de México. En este texto se analizan las ZEE mediante la comparación de información, acciones, beneficios económico-fiscales promovidos por el sector gubernamental y el impacto de dicha política pública para el desarrollo regional. Para una mayor compresión del funcionamiento de las ZEE en México y el mundo, se describirá la experiencia rescatada en 30 años de estudio por el Banco Mundial (BM), particularmente aquella promovida en países asiáticos donde se concentra 90% del empleo de las ZEE.
R58|Desarrollo regional reflexiones y propuestas desde la economía|Las personas en los diferentes territorios de un país aspiran al desarrollo de su región, localidad, o espacio geográfico en donde viven, trabajan y sueñan. Probablemente los motiva conocer su retraso relativo que se traduce en menor bienestar y calidad de vida frente al que se disfruta en otras regiones. Ese atraso tiene que ver con niveles reducidos de productividad pero también con falta de competitividad de las unidades productoras ubicadas en el territorio. Las razones son múltiples incluyendo las carencias de infraestructura y de acceso a bienes meritorios como educación y salud. El desarrollo regional no ocurre por casualidad sino es consecuencia de la aplicación de determinadas políticas públicas. Estas son responsabilidad del Estado, nacional, regional o local según sus competencias. A partir de políticas diferenciadas se esperaría que las diferentes regiones y localidades del país, en particular las áreas rurales, converjan con las más desarrolladas en sus niveles de ingreso per cápita para la gran mayoría de su población.

R58|Regional lobbying and structural funds. Do regional representation offices in Brussels deliver?|In recent years regional representation offices have proliferated in Brussels. Among the many aims of these offices are influencing the allocation and securing the transfer of European Structural and Cohesion funds to their respective regions. However, our knowledge about whether they have succeeded in this goal is limited. In this paper we assess the extent to which regional offices in Brussels have managed to affect the territorial commitment and payment of Structural and Cohesion funds for regional development beyond the main officially stated economic criteria of eligibility. The paper uses a custom-made survey of regional offices in Brussels, complemented by economic, institutional, and political data involving factors that should determine how much money is channelled to and disbursed in each region. The results of the Fixed Effects and Instrumental Variable analyses for a total of 123 regions over the period 2009-2013 highlight that the capacity - proxied by the budget and staff of the office - of the regional representation offices to influence the commitment and payment of Structural and Cohesion funds has been negligible, when not outright negative. Regional lobbying in Brussels does not lead to more funds or to an easier disbursement of regional development funds.
R58|Regional inequality in Europe: evidence, theory and policy implications|Regional economic divergence has become a threat to economic progress, social cohesion and political stability in Europe. Market processes and policies that are supposed to spread prosperity and opportunity are no longer sufficiently effective. The evidence points to the existence of several different modes of regional economic performance in Europe, responding to different development challenges and opportunities. Both mainstream and heterodox theories have gaps in their ability to explain the existence of these different regional trajectories and the weakness of the convergence processes among them. Therefore, a different approach is required, one that strengthens Europe’s strongest regions but develops new approaches to promote opportunity in industrial declining and less-developed regions. There is ample new theory and evidence to support such an approach, which we have labelled ‘place-sensitive distributed development policy’.
R58|Economic Shocks and Internal Migration|Previous literature shows that internal migration rates are strongly procyclical. This would seem to imply that geographic relocation does not help mitigate negative local economic shocks during recessions. This paper shows that this is not the case. I document that net in-migration rates decreased in areas more affected by the Great Recession. Using various IV strategies that rely on the importance of the construction sector and the indebtedness of households before the crisis, I conclude that internal migration might help to alleviate up to one third of the effects of the crisis on wages in the most affected locations. This is due to a disproportionate decrease in in-migration into those locations rather than an increase in out-migration. More generally, I show that differences in population growth rates across locations are mainly explained by differences in in-migration rates rather than in out-migration rates. I introduce a model to guide the empirical analysis and to quantify the spill-over effects caused by internal migration.
R58|Regional lobbying and Structural funds. Do regional representation offices in Brussels deliver?|In recent years regional representation offices have proliferated in Brussels. Among the many aims of these offices are influencing the allocation and securing the transfer of European Structural and Cohesion funds to their respective regions. However, our knowledge about whether they have succeeded in this goal is limited. In this paper we assess the extent to which regional offices in Brussels have managed to affect the territorial commitment and payment of Structural and Cohesion funds for regional development beyond the main officially stated economic criteria of eligibility. The paper uses a custom-made survey of regional offices in Brussels, complemented by economic, institutional, and political data involving factors that should determine how much money is channelled to and disbursed in each region. The results of the Fixed Effects and Instrumental Variable analyses for a total of 123 regions over the period 2009-2013 highlight that the capacity - proxied by the budget and staff of the office - of the regional representation offices to influence the commitment and payment of Structural and Cohesion funds has been negligible, when not outright negative. Regional lobbying in Brussels does not lead to more funds or to an easier disbursement of regional development funds.
R58|Does federal contracting spur development? Federal contracts, income, output, and jobs in US cities|Firms and governments alike frequently court federal government contracts to generate more jobs and trigger economic growth. However, the employment and output impact of government contracts remains controversial. We use georeferenced data on United States (US) federal contracts, distinguishing between the location of the recipient and the location of the activity, for the years 2005–2014 in order to assess the employment and output impacts of federal contracting in metropolitan areas of the US. We resort to a shift-share instrument and precise location-specific fixed effects to estimate the causal impact of spending. Cities that receive more contract expenditure witness an expansion in output – with contracts generating $1.4 per dollar spent – but experience only modest increases in employment. The impact is also constrained geographically and short-lived. The results suggest that, on average, the effects of federal contracting on local economies are modest, meaning that attracting federal contracts may not be an effective urban development strategy.
R58|How Do Regional Price Levels Affect Income Inequality? Household-Level Evidence from 21 Countries|Regional differences in prices levels are substantial in many countries, but little is known about how important they are for income inequality and relative poverty. To bridge this gap, we provide new evidence on the basis of the best available data and a novel two-step approach. First, we collect the largest cross-country dataset of regional price level estimates from 12 countries and use it to predict regional price levels in other countries. We then combine all these regional prices levels with household-level data from the Luxembourg Income Study, which gives us results for a final sample of 21 countries. We find that for some countries Gini coefficients and headcount poverty ratios are statistically significantly different when adjusted for regional price levels. For example, we show that adjusting for regional price levels would lower the Gini coefficients by 2% for Italy, 3% for Columbia and by 4% for Georgia, while it would increase the headcount poverty ratio by 6% for France and by 7% for Ireland. We conclude that regional price levels affect income inequality to a varying extent and should be taken into account by policy makers and in future research.
R58|Institutional change and the development of lagging regions in Europe|The success of the policy in delivering greater economic convergence does not hide the fact that we are witnessing a decline in the returns of intervention in the three main growth axes. There is, for example, growing concern about a potential exhaustion of additional investments in transport infrastructure and of improvements in accessibility as drivers of growth in certain lagging regions of Europe (Crescenzi and Rodríguez-Pose, 2012). While this issue remains controversial, the truth is that physical capital, human capital, and technology can explain a waning share of the variation in regional economic growth in Europe. Growth theories that accounted for differences in economic performance relatively well two decades ago are becoming less capable of doing so. The residual factor is growing, meaning that, in spite of improvements in growth theory, we tend to know less about what determines regional growth in Europe.
R58|Rural waste disposal issues within urban borders|The paper examines the waste management issues in the villages annexed to administrative-territorial units of the Romanian cities which have been frequently neglected by urban waste operators. The lack of waste collection services in such peri-urban communities favored the illegal waste disposal practices particularly prior to EU accession. The extension of waste collection services from main cities to such areas is compulsory in order to mitigate the environmental risks and the public health threats. The paper estimates the amounts of household waste susceptible to be uncontrolled disposed of by peri-urban villages in different geographical areas of North-East region with a particular focus on Neamt county. The paper points out that these rural settlements should receive the same attention concerning the municipal waste management services as the main urban areas. Traditional recovery of waste fractions at the household level (e.g., home composting) should be further promoted in such areas in order to avoid illegal dumping issue and to prevent the landfill of biodegradable waste as requested by EU regulations.
R58|Sustainable regional development policy formation: role of industrial ecology and logistics|"The impossibility to define the clear and uniform operational guidelines for the implementation of sustainable development policy globally proves the necessity to consider the regional level as the key in terms of developing and implementing modern models of sustainable development, in particular, eco-industrial parks and circular economy projects. It substantiates the need to develop and use the modern innovative methodological approaches to the formation of the relevant regional policy. The circular economy proceeds from the flow-based understanding of the character of the production, distribution, exchange, and consumption of goods in the socio-economic system and, consequently, the turnover of resources and energy within this system. It determines the need for complex analysis and regulation of material and energy flows. These issues constitute the scope of research of industrial ecology and, at the same time, logistics. This causes the question of the integration of these disciplines within the system of scientific and methodological support of the processes of formation and implementation of the policy of sustainable region's development that is as yet little investigated. The article studies the theoretical and methodological foundations of the industrial ecology and logistics, such as objects, goals, methodological principles and approaches, methods, organizational forms, etc. On this basis the ontological unity of these disciplines is brought to light: they simultaneously study the different, mutually reinforcing aspects of the industrial system's performance through the accentuation of the flow form of the organization of the movement of resources, information, and energy as an object of regulation in such system. The integration of the ""environmental"" vision of material flows of the regional system, as is characteristic of the industrial ecology, with their ""economic"" content, which characterizes the structure of the regional economic system and constitutes the object of the logistics studies, should be considered as the basis for the formation and implementation of the policy aimed to achieve the region's sustainable development goals."
R58|Social Accounting Matrix: A user manual for village economies|The application of Social Accounting Matrices (SAM) is well established at the national level and provides a comprehensive economic framework. The procedure for developing national SAMs is extensively documented in literature. However, it can also be constructed for smaller economies, such as a village. Studies dealing with village SAMs are rare. In addition, there are hardly any guidelines for design. This gap will be addressed in this paper, which provides a manual for the construction of a village SAM. Theoretical principles and data requirements are discussed. A hypothetical village SAM is constructed by using numerical examples. Subsequently, the SAM of a real-world village case study from Zambia is analyzed. It is demonstrated how macroeconomic indicators can be calculated and microeconomic information obtained. Furthermore, a village SAM provides the database for scientific modelling approaches which are presented. Village SAMs are thus a useful management tool and support policy planning at local and regional level.
R58|Place-based entrepreneurship and innovation policy for industrial diversification|This paper proposes a conceptual and analytical framework for the development of place-based entrepreneurship and innovation policies aiming at industrial diversification. The starting point for this paper is the entrepreneurial ecosystem concept, which is frequently used to inform such policies. However, this concept does not specify the causal mechanisms driving industrial diversification. Furthermore, it remains questionable to what extent the concept can be applied to different regional contexts. In order to address these shortfalls, this paper i) discusses the barriers and opportunities for industrial diversification in different regional contexts, and ii) introduces a place-based policy framework for new industrial path development through entrepreneurship and innovation policies.
R58|The Multiple Roles of Demand in Regional Development A Conceptual Analysis|This paper contributes to the literature on new regional industrial path development by highlighting the multiple roles that demand can play in regional development. We develop a conceptual framework relating different roles of demand to different types of new path development. Based on the literature on regional development, we differentiate among the role of demand as anonymous consumer, sophisticated buyer, active co-developer, public procurer, and norm and value setter. These roles influence different types of new path development, including path extension, path renewal and new path creation. New path development can be triggered by changing norms and values in the society (e.g. environmental concerns and the growing demand for cleaner technologies), public procurement for innovation (governments demand new products or services and thereby steer economic development) or by users modifying existing products or developing novel solutions that are not yet on the market (e.g. user innovations). In order to foster a new industrial growth path in a region, local firms need to sustain, establish and grow their market shares, focusing on the role of anonymous consumers. The various roles of demand, as well as its effect on new path development, depend on the geographical context. Changes of demand in one region might contribute to path extension, path renewal or new path creation in other regions. We argue that taking a nuanced view toward demand will add a novel dimension to the debate on new path development.
R58|Green industrial path development in different types of regions|As response to environmental challenges such as global warming and the extinction of species sustainable regional development has become a key policy objective. Regions, however, vary in their preconditions for green industrial path development. Taking existing regional industrial specialization patterns as a starting point, this paper develops a new typology linking regional preconditions to various pathways for green industrial path development. This provides the foundation for identifying place-based policy implications for growing clean industries in different types of regions, grounded in the emerging perspective in innovation studies on policies for transformative change. The paper thereby helps to understand the pathways for greening the economy in different regional contexts and how such green pathways can be promoted through policy.
R58|Do Living Labs Live in Russia?|Innovation infrastructure plays a crucial role in the establishment of links among knowledge producers, intermediaries, and exploiters to deal with socio-economic challenges. Traditionally, the representatives of public sector, business and academia have been considered as the key stakeholders; however today there is a shift of interest towards end users or consumers of products and services. Users, especially citizens, are able to bring new insights of their experience while taking part in testing and validation of innovative products and / or services. Hence, it is essential to decide, which forms of innovation infrastructure units enable successful involvement of users into the design and innovation process. Since mid-2000, the European Union has successfully introduced a platform for testing and experimentation based on the users’ engagement – a living laboratory. The study investigates the features of living labs, including their possible business applications, and searching for the living labs’ analogous among the existing forms of innovation infrastructure units in Russia. Business Model Canvas and comparative analysis are employed to do the research. Taken together, our results support the idea that a living lab is a very special form of innovation infrastructure unit, since it brings a product, technology, or service closer to the market, based on the insights from the end users’ engagement in testing and experimentation
R58|What Shapes Local Innovation Policies? Empirical Evidence from Japanese Cities|Increasing attention has been paid to regional innovation systems. However, previous studies have so far only focused on (the regional impact of) national policies or specific regions. To date, no studies have been carried out on the implementation and variety of local research and development (R&D) subsidy programs at the municipality level. Our research fills this gap by using information on R&D subsidy programs from local authorities in Japan collected via websites and our original survey. Our research confirms 151 R&D subsidy programs conducted by 131 cities among all cities in 2015 and investigates the determinants of the implementation and design of local R&D subsidy programs at city level (length and upper limit of subsidies, and flexibility of subsidy conditions) considering both demand- and supply-side factors. The empirical results suggest that, after controlling for city type and population size, supply-side factors including local government conditions significantly affect the implementation of public R&D subsidy programs. In contrast, we find that demand-side factors matter more for the design of subsidy programs than supply-side factors.
R58|Picture or Playground: Valuing Coastal Amenities|As the world continues to urbanise, understanding housing market preferences can help planners accommodate the growth of cities. Housing is a bundle of both structural attributes and locational amenities, with “blue space” coastal amenities including both aesthetic (picture) and recreational (playground) services. We examine the effect of these different “blue space” coastal amenities, using both a novel measure of views, suitable for large datasets, and a dataset of almost 500,000 real estate listings, covering both sale and rental markets in Ireland for the period 2006-2017. We find that proximity to beaches and similar shorelines is rewarded in both sale and rental markets, as is the breadth and depth of sea-views. There is no evidence that urban sale or rental price premiums are larger (or smaller) than rural ones. However, there is clear evidence that sale price premiums are typically larger than their rental equivalents. In addition, sale price premiums are larger in times of falling prices, a finding consistent with “property ladder” effects in tighter markets.
R58|The Eurasian customs union and the economic geography of Belarus: A panel convergence approach|This study presents novel research on the economic geography of Belarus. The 118 regions of Belarus are examined in relation to the Eurasian Customs Union (EACU) through the period 2005-2014. Spatial clusters and outliers are identified and compared across the periods prior and after the establishment of the EACU. We observe that EACU membership corresponds to a slowdown in the process of regional economic convergence in Belarus, and intensified economic competition with a geographical dimension among regions. We also observe that urban regions have benefited more from the EACU than less urbanised areas.
R58|Inequalities, spatial disparities and agglomeration of economic activity in European regions|European Union defines economic and social cohesion as one of the main priorities, however some theoretical and empirical evidence of regional inequalities in Europe, indicates that a process of convergence has been taking place between countries but not within regions inside countries. The first aim of the paper is that of giving an assessment of the existing spatial inequalities and of their recent evolution in the last 15 years for regions of 22 EU members. Our empirical evidence confirms wider disparities at regional level than at country level,and a growing disconnection between the geography of production, that becomes more unequal, and the geography of incomes (so that we might have regional convergence but not regional cohesion). Alsoin the case of Italy this seems to be proved. The second objective of the present work is twofold: on the one hand it investigates how the process of spatial economic concentration is affecting growth and disparities among European regions. On the other hand, the paper takes the opportunity to verify the impact of spatial inequalities to social inequalities. Our results suggest that interpersonal inequalities are affected by spatial disparities and agglomeration of economic activity has a defined role in this process. Other determinants, such as social expenditure and the level of wealth,mitigate but do not cancelthe effect of spatial inequalities.Moreover, the positive relationship between growth of regional disparities and GDP could suggest a possible trade-off between spatial equity and growth with the implication that on policy ground EU has to make a choice whether reversing or not the process of economic concentration. In addition to this the recent changes in inter-regional inequalitiesadvices a reconsideration of the usual framework underlying policy,especially the people-versus-place division in policy formulation.
R58|Tourism Observatories 3.0: A Transnational Experiment in the MED|Following the precedent set by the Virtual Tourism Observatory run by the European Commission-DG GROW a few years ago, several initiatives have taken place to design and manage tourism observatories at both the transnational and local level. However, these initiatives do not yet seem able to provide adequate operational responses to the challenges that the Commission launched with the original VTO. While the opportunities offered by the Web 3.0 still do not seem to have been sufficiently taken advantage of, such initiatives also have not yet developed suitable methodologies to operationally include the tourism industry in the studies and monitoring performed by the OTs. This work presents an OT prototype including a participatory DSS (PDSS) designed specifically to overcome the aforementioned limits. The prototype was tested in 2017 on the entire eligible area of the 2014-2020 MED Programme covering 52 regions. The potentialities of this PDSS are shown through two case studies, one Italian and the other Portuguese.
R58|Euroscepticism and EU Cohesion Policy: The Impact of Micro-Level Policy Effectiveness on Voting Behavior|This study investigates whether there is a link between the successful implementation of European cohesion policy and the voters' attitudes towards the EU. Using the French presidential elections in 2017 as a case study, we do not solely consider regional funds expenditures but also its induced effects in a region as further potential determinant of pro-European or eurosceptic voting behavior. In order to measure the effectiveness of EU structural funds and Cohesion Fund assignment, firm-level employment effects in French NUTS-2 regions stemming from project allocation during the multi-annual financial framework 2007-2013 are estimated. The obtained average treatment effects are, in a next step, used together with other regional characteristics to capture the citizens' perceived exposure to the EU in an empirical voting model for the French presidential election in 2017. The estimation results reveal a significant negative relationship between the effectiveness of EU funds allocation and the vote share of the eurosceptic candidate Marine Le Pen.

R58|Measuring Financial Capability of the Street Vendors|Financial capability of an individual is the ability to use and manage financial products for current and future financial needs with adequate financial knowledge. This paper examines financial capability on four dimensionsfinancial management to meet current needs, future financial planning, financial products management, and financial knowledge using a sample of street vendors in Bhubaneswar, India. A financial capability index for each individual in the sample has been calculated in a manner that satisfies monotonicity, anonymity, normalisation, uniformity, shortfall sensitivity and hiatus sensitivity to level axioms. We find that education, age, business experience, and daily turnover significantly affect the financial capability of an individual. Moreover, street vendors in regions with higher number of bank branches are found to have significantly higher financial capability
R58|Governance of policy at a local level LEADER programs analysis|This report is the final deliverable of TRUSTEE task 3.3. It present the research protocol, the methodology used and most of results. LEADER is qualified as down-up approach combining EU policy framework and local strategy. The implementation is quite heterogeneous dependend on institutional factors and political choices at national level, structural characteristics and socio-political local factors. Our findings highlight the diversity of LEADER implementations in the three countries under study (France, Germany, Italy) and the influence of institutional factors. The design of the programs influence, for example, via the setting of funding conditions or demands on institutional settings at the local level, the extent to which local actors from different spheres get involved in local development via LEADER.
R58|Reforming the migration governance system|This paper analyzes and identifies the deficiencies in the current migration governance system, delineates pressing and structural challenges to global governance of forced migration and recommends pathways through which the Group 20, which is an informal forum comprised of the 19 most influential economies in the world and the EU, could play a seminal role to mobilize reform in the current global refugee management system, advocate for better policy formulation and enhanced policy coherence, encourage equitable burden sharing and improve refugee transport and resettlement services in origin, first asylum, transition and destination countries.
R58|Sorting in an urban housing market - is there a response to demographic change?|"In urban areas, there is considerable neighbourhood-level variation in population characteristics. Using Dortmund as a case study we analyse whether and to what extent rents, housing prices and segregation dynamics corresponded with demographic ageing in urban neighbourhoods between 2007 and 2016. We find that in Dortmund so far there has been no slump of the housing market in neighbourhoods where the population ages more rapidly. Nevertheless, over the study period demographic segregation was on the rise and, according to a hedonic analysis, prices for apartments were higher in districts with a comparatively ""younger"" population. In the course of further demographic change in Germany, which has come to a contemporary halt due to immigration, the response to ageing on urban housing markets in terms of location choice and prices may therefore become more evident. A large-scale urban regeneration project has revitalised the housing market of a declining Dortmund community during this decade. Since local ageing has not affected housing markets severely so far, it appears to be within the scope of urban policy to upgrade the attractiveness of ageing neighbourhoods as perceived by younger generations."
R58|Energy efficiency as an instrument of regional development policy? Trading-off the benefits of an economic stimulus and energy rebound effects|Previous studies show that improving efficiency in household energy use can stimulate a national economy through an increase and change in the pattern of the aggregate demand. However, this may impact competitiveness. Here we find that in an open region, interregional migration of workers may give additional momentum to the economic expansion, by relieving pressure on the real wage and the CPI. Furthermore, the stimulus will be further enhanced by the greater fiscal autonomy that Scotland is set shortly to enjoy. By considering a range of CGE simulation scenarios we show that there is a tension between the economic stimulus from energy efficiency and the scale of rebound effects. However, we also show that household energy efficiency increases do typically generate a â€œdouble dividendâ€ of increased regional economic activity and a reduction in carbon emissions.
R58|The impact of highways on population redistribution: The role of land development restrictions|We study the role of land development restrictions for the effects of highway expansion on the spatial distribution of population. We demonstrate that these restrictions strongly interfered with the effects of highways in the Netherlands. Introducing an IV approach to address endogenous interaction variables, our findings show that new highways accelerated population growth in peripheral areas, but had no such effect in central cities and suburban municipalities. We find that due to development restrictions near larger cities, the highway expansion caused a ‘leapfrog’ pattern, in which suburban growth skipped development-restricted areas and expanded into farther located peripheral areas.
R58|The entrepreuneurial context, a factor of Economic Growth in the Europe Union? A GWR analysis on the EU Regions|Recently the literature has paid more attention to the entrepreneurial environment, to explain the role of entrepreneurship in the economic development. However nowadays very little empirical contributions demonstrate that the entrepreneurial environment really counts (Acs et al., 2014; Szerb et al., 2015; Acs et al., 2017) in promoting quality entrepreneurship. By using the GWR, we explored the spatial heterogeneity of the role of entrepreneurial context to explain differences in levels of regional development. In our study, the entrepreneurial environment is measured by the Regional Entrepreneurship and Development Index (REDI) for the EU regions. The results show that the entrepreneurial environment on the level of regional development suggests some positive or negative impact, depending on the location of the regions.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
R58|Especializaciones productivas y desarrollo económico regional en Uruguay|The main aim of this research is to characterize the provinces of Uruguay according to their economic activities, productive specializations and their levels of economic development. Based on the analysis of these economic-productive territorial dynamics, the document intends to study its implications in economic policy, in particular, from an approach that seeks to promote the local and regional development of the country. To achieve these goals, the paper analyzes in detail the productive capacity of the territory, the provincial sectorial specializations, the degree of enterprise development and the socioeconomic conditions of the environment. From these exercises, the results are synthesized in an indicator of departmental economic development and indicators on the degree of diversification and the productive specializations of each province. These provincial characterizations highlight the need to combine the local scale with an interpretation of productive dynamics and sectoral specializations on a larger regional or inter-provincial scale. In this way, interpretations are proposed that allow to overcome the legal-administrative limits of the provincial scale. As a main conclusion, it is derived that the consideration of the regional scale is the great challenge to be able to plan and implement policies of productive development that allow to successfully promote local productive development and contribute in an important way to national economic development.
R58|Local Poverty and Inequality in Albania| This article presents the results of the latest poverty and inequality mapping update using the 2012 Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) survey and the 2011 census. This mapping builds on the methodology outlined by Chris Elbers and colleagues and further innovates by including new methodological developments. The results presented here allow better understanding of the regional inequalities in welfare across Albania, and thus can help policy makers address them. This is particularly needed because internal migration over the past decade led to large-scale urbanization in some areas and severe depopulation in others. Internal migration is multifaceted, but mostly flows toward Tirana.
R58|The Rise of the Sharing Economy in Tourism: Exploring Airbnb Attributes for the Veneto Region|In just a couple of years, the sharing economy grew out to become a significant segment of the holiday accommodation market. Online peer-to-peer marketplaces allow people to offer rooms or entire houses to tourists, with Airbnb being the biggest and most famous example. This paper aims to give an insight into explaining which factors and attributes influence the success of Airbnb accommodations in the Veneto Region, using occupancy as a proxy. We analysed characteristics of 19624 Airbnb accommodations. The logistic regression model identifies a number of influential attributes which can be divided between locational characteristics, being located in attractive tourism destinations, and accommodation characteristics, for example the price, rating, number of previous bookings and the status of the host. The quantitative analysis allows to create an attractiveness scale, which is analysed for geographic patterns.
R58|European Disparities in Regional Health R&I Performance|Health represents one of the thematic priorities for smart specialisation. Until now the difficulty in properly measuring research and innovation (R&I) in Health sector has represented a barrier to address specific policies in favour of less performing regions. This is due to two factors: a lack of available data particularly at regional level; and the difficulty in clearly defining the boundaries of the Health sector. Data provided by European Commission, focusing on Health as FP7 thematic priority, as well as recent data on ongoing clinical trials and Health infrastructure at regional level developed by university of Trieste allow the use of a novel regional and sectorial breakdown to deeper investigate the mechanisms supporting R&I in European Regions. The paper provides an analysis of possible determinants of EU regional Health R&I inequalities, disentangling the factors related to publications propensity from those related to patents propensity. The results show that despite one of the most relevant determinants of R&I in the Health sector remain the level of R&D expenditure, other factors such as the size or degree of Health specialisation of the region should also be taken into account. While patenting activity in this sector remains a prerogative of regions with already technological and industry capacity, publications activities result less context specific being present also in peripheral regions. Our results are in line with the new place-based smart specialisation- type policy thinking.
R58|Aktuelle Entwicklungen und Trends in den Regionen Mittelost-/Südosteuropas und des Donauraums|Zusammenfassung Aktuelle Entwicklungen und Trends in den Regionen Mittelost-/Südosteuropas und des Donauraums Die Studie analysiert aktuelle Entwicklungen und Trends in den Ländern Zentral- und Osteuropas sowie Süd- und Südosteuropas und deren Implikationen für die österreichische Regionalpolitik. Das Ziel der Studie ist, einen Beitrag zur Evaluierung der gegenwärtigen Regionalpolitik innerhalb Österreichs wie auch der EU zu leisten. Dafür untersucht die Studie überblicksmäßig folgende Punkte a) aktuelle wirtschaftliche Trends in Österreich und den Ländern des Donauraums (inklusive Polen), b) die Verknüpfung Österreichs mit diesen Ländern hinsichtlich Außenhandel, Investitionen, Arbeitsmärkte, Transport und Tourismus und c) die österreichische Regionalpolitik im nationalen sowie im europäischen Kontext. Auf Basis der Analyseergebnisse ergeben sich Rückschlüsse und Empfehlungen für die Entwicklung von Politikinitiativen in Österreich und der EU. English Summary Current developments and trends in the regions of Central, East and Southeast Europe and the Danube region The study analyses recent trends and developments in the Central and East European (CEE) and Southeast European (SEE) countries and the implication for Austrian regional policy. The aim of the study is to contribute to the evaluation of current Austrian and European regional policy instruments as well as to the Austrian preparation of the post-2020 EU Cohesion policy. In an overview, the study analyses a) the main (economic) trends in Austria and the CEE/SEE countries; b) their trade, investment, labour market, transport and tourism relationships; and c) Austrian regional policy in the national and European context. The results of the analysis allow drawing conclusions and recommendations for developing policy initiatives in Austria and the EU.
R58|Economic Challenges of Lagging Regions III: Recent Investment Trends and Needs|This report focuses on investment in eight EU Member States and their lagging regions. Additionally, the analysis assesses the regional development strategies of the eight Member States and evaluates the main investment needs and complementary alternative support options of the lagging regions over the next ten years. The analysis is performed in two steps. The first step identifies the investment needs of the lagging regions from the countries’ own as well as from a European perspective. It analyses to what extent and in what form investments in the lagging regions have to be supported in order to satisfy the needs. The identification of investment needs is approached from two sides, a) the countries’ own assessments of investment needs and b) a comparative analysis of the lagging regions with more prosperous EU-28 regions that had similar economic development characteristics as the (Southern) lagging regions. The second step analyses the main national and regional investment trends over the last 10-15 years, and covers different types of investment, depending on whether they are seen from a National Accounts, European or international perspective.
R58|Economic Challenges of Lagging Regions IV: Case Studies|This report presents the findings of three case studies of lagging regions in the EU to deepen the findings of wiiw Research Reports 421 to 423. The three (NUTS 2) case study regions are the Italian Campania, the Portuguese Norte and the Romanian Nord-Est region. While each of these regions faces specific challenges due to their economic, social and geographic characteristics, they are at the same time to some extent representative of other EU regions that share similar characteristics and/or challenges. Each case study covers the economic development in the respective region, highlighting the main strengths and weaknesses in the region’s performance. Furthermore, each case study identifies the major, region-specific, causes of the observed developments. By focusing on those causes, each analysis develops a region-specific storyline on the success and failures in the regions’ economic development. Finally, each case study derives conclusions based on the above analysis. These conclusions should be indicative of potential development opportunities for each region and the necessary policy measures to overcome existing challenges in order to exploit these opportunities.
R58|Spotlight on the beneficiaries of EU regional funds: A new firm-level dataset|This study introduces a new firm-level dataset containing over two million projects co-funded by the European Union's (EU) structural and Cohesion funds in 25 EU member states in the multi-annual financial framework 2007-2013. Information on individual beneficiary firms and institutions published by regional authorities is linked with business data from Bureau van Dijk's ORBIS database. Moreover, we show how modern text mining techniques can be used to categorise EU funded projects into fifteen thematic categories proposed by the European Commission. A first analysis of the dataset reveals substantial heterogeneity of beneficiaries and projects across and within countries. While in the majority of lagging regions the largest project expenditure is dedicated to transportation and energy infrastructure, in most other regions the major part is assigned to innovation and technological development as well as business (including SME) support. In an econometric analysis we control for project and firm characteristics and find that the highest single project values are associated with older beneficiary firms that are larger in size. Furthermore, the projects with topmost expenditure are carried out in Dutch and British regions.
R58|Spotlight on the beneficiaries of EU regional funds: A new firm-level dataset|This study introduces a new firm-level dataset containing over two million projects co-funded by the European Union’s (EU) structural and Cohesion funds in 25 EU member states in the multi-annual financial framework 2007-2013. Information on individual beneficiary firms and institutions published by regional authorities is linked with business data from Bureau van Dijk’s ORBIS database. Moreover, we show how modern text mining techniques can be used to categorise EU funded projects into fifteen thematic categories proposed by the European Commission. A first analysis of the dataset reveals substantial heterogeneity of beneficiaries and projects across and within countries. While in the majority of lagging regions the largest project expenditure is dedicated to transportation and energy infrastructure, in most other regions the major part is assigned to innovation and technological development as well as business (including SME) support.

R58|The Economic Impact of City-County Consolidations: A Synthetic Control Approach|Although more rapid development is a primary motivation behind city-county consolidations, relatively few empirical papers explore the actual impact of consolidation on development. This study uses the synthetic control method (SCM) to examine the long-term impact of city-county consolidations on per capita income, population, and employment. The results from the three cases explored indicate that consolidation does not guarantee development and can actually have negative effects. Additionally, the effects vary based upon the county, time horizon, and development measure.
R58|La despoblación en Aragón, 2000-2016: tendencias, datos y reflexiones para el diseño de políticas|En este trabajo se analizan las principales tendencias demográficas de Aragón entre 2000 y 2008. El análisis se hace tanto a escala comarcal como municipal para dos subperiodos: 2000-2008 y 2008-2016. El primero coincide con una etapa de crecimiento económico y expansión demográfica; el segundo con una profunda crisis y retroceso demográfico. Se concluye que es, sobre todo, la llegada de inmigrantes procedentes del extranjero la principal causa del crecimiento de la población en la primera etapa. También se estudian las políticas frente a la despoblación desarrolladas y se realizan una serie de recomendaciones para orientar las políticas futuras.
R58|Input for and output of local governance in rural development|Support for balanced regional development with participatory approaches has a long tradition in EU funding programmes for rural development. LEADER started 25 years ago and now has 2600 Local Action Groups (LAGs). These LAGs collaborate as a kind of a public-private partnership on the basis of an integrated local development strategy and administer own budgets to support projects. To examine the contributions of LEADER to local governance, we can present results from the ex-post-evaluation of Rural Development Programs (2007-2013) in six federal states in Germany. A mixture of qualitative and quantitative methods has been used. In addition first evaluation results are shown for the 2014-2020 funding period, especially from a survey of 115 LAGs in four German federal states. To examine governance matters on the input-side we look at the type and structure of participa-tion while on the output-side we focus on contributions to rural development. On the input-side the involvement of civil society and economy actors was successful, but inade-quate funding conditions for private actors set limitations for their involvement in project imple-mentation. In addition, the LAG-compositions show a lack of underprivileged groups and note-worthy shortfalls in gender representation. Looking at the output-side and the factors favoring the success of governance arrangements like LEADER, the estimations of LAG-managers show that the most important factors are: commit-ment, financial/material resources, involvement of key-personalities as driving forces, level of acceptance/cooperation and support from local/regional political actors. Remarkably, the quality of the local development strategies was rated less important but still relevant.
R58|The displacement and attraction effects in interurban migration: An application of the input-output scheme to the case of large cities in Korea|In this paper, two migratory impact-assessment schemes are constructed within the framework of Ghoshian and Leontief input-output analysis. These schemes are designed to estimate the rural-to-urban migration-induced and the urban-to-rural migration-induced effects on interurban migration, where the former effect is termed the replacement effect, while the latter the attraction effect. The established input-output schemes are empirically applied to the 2012 data on interregional migration in Korea. The results show that an arrival of migrants to and/or a departure of residents from the 20 largest cities in Korea induce direct and indirect ripples of population flow between those cities. A combination of the displacement and the attraction effects yields a classification of cities by which the 20 largest cities are grouped into four different types.
R58|Determinants Of Weanling Thoroughbred Auction Prices| Determinants of prices of 1,302 weanling Thoroughbreds sold at the 2010 November Breeding Stock Sale at the Keeneland Association, Inc. are investigated. Weanlings, who are less than one-year-old, are of unknown breeding and racing quality; still, prices at auctions display high variability. A hedonic price analysis is utilized to identify the determinants of weanling sales prices, and the corresponding marginal values of those determinants are estimated. Prices were highly responsive to variables related to pedigree quality, including the sire’s stud fee, whether the sire was relatively new in his breeding career or not, and whether the dam or the dam’s progeny had earned black type. In addition, prices were influenced by individual characteristics such as gender, age, state of birth. The weanling’s placement in the sale and pinhooked weanlings also influenced price. Results can be used as a decision tool by both buyers and sellers.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
R58|Las finanzas públicas de Valledupar, 2005-2015|La situación de insolvencia registrada llevó a que Valledupar firmara un Acuerdo de Reestructuración de Pasivos en 2014. Este trabajo analiza la evolución de las finanzas públicas de este municipio antes y después de firmado el acuerdo, comparando dicha evolución con lo que se registró en ciudades de similar desarrollo y población. Con base en información de las ejecuciones presupuestales se evidencia que, si bien los ingresos totales del municipio han crecido a tasas similares a las de los municipios comparables, los gastos en Valledupar muestran una tendencia insostenible en el mediano plazo, lo que ha repercutido en un déficit de capital que comprometen la viabilidad fiscal del ente territorial y el cumplimiento de los compromisos adquiridos con el acuerdo de reestructuración. ******ABSTRACT: The situation of insolvency led Valledupar to sign a Restructuring Agreement of Liabilities in 2014. This work analyzes the evolution of public finances of this municipality before and after signing the agreement, comparing this evolution with what was recorded in cities of similar development and population. Based on information from the budget executions, it is evident that expenditures in Valledupar show an unsustainable trend in the medium term. Although the total income of the municipality has grown at rates similar to those of comparable municipalities, the capital deficit of Valledupar compromises the fiscal viability and the fulfillment of the commitments acquired in the restructuring agreement of this territorial entity.

R58|The Compact City in Empirical Research: A Quantitative Literature Review|The 'compact city' is one of the most prominent concepts to have emerged in the global urban policy debate, though it is difficult to ascertain to what extent its theorised positive outcomes can be substantiated by evidence. Our review of the theoretical literature identifies three main compact city characteristics that have effects on 15 categories of outcomes: economic density, morphological density and mixed land use. The scope of our quantitative evidence-review comprises all theoretically relevant combinations of characteristics and outcomes. We review 321 empirical analyses in 189 studies for which we encode the qualitative result along with a range of study characteristics. In line with theoretical expectations, 69% of the included analyses find normatively positive effects associated with compact urban form, although the mean finding is negative for almost half of the combinations of outcomes and characteristics.
R58|Impact of macro‐structural reforms on the productivity growth of regions: Distance to the frontier matters|Using a panel of 265 regions from 24 OECD countries from 1997 to 2007, we explore the impact of nation‐wide macroeconomic and structural policies on the productivity growth of subnational regions. We find that average relationships between nation‐wide policies and regional productivity growth can hide strong differentiated effects according to the distance to the frontier: relaxing employment protection legislation on temporary contracts, lowering barriers to trade and investment and increasing trade openness enhances productivity growth in lagging regions, whereas reducing barriers to entrepreneurship or higher levels of government debt has a positive effect on regions closer to the productivity frontier. Se utiliza un panel de 265 regiones de 24 países de la OCDE entre 1997 y 2007 para examinar el impacto de las políticas macroeconómicas y estructurales a nivel nacional en el crecimiento de la productividad de las regiones subnacionales. Las relaciones habituales entre las políticas nacionales y el crecimiento de la productividad regional pueden ocultar fuertes efectos diferenciados en función de la distancia a la frontera: la relajación de la legislación de protección del empleo en materia de contratos temporales, la reducción de las barreras al comercio y a la inversión, y el aumento de la apertura comercial aumentan el crecimiento de la productividad en las regiones más rezagadas, mientras que la reducción de las barreras al espíritu emprendedor empresarial o el aumento de los niveles de endeudamiento público tienen un efecto positivo en las regiones más próximas a la frontera productiva. 本稿では、経済協力開発機構の24の加盟国における265の地域の1997年~2007年のパネルデータを用いて、地方行政区の生産性向上に対する、国全体の規模のマクロ経済の構造的な政策の影響を検討する。国全体の規模の政策と地域の生産性向上との平均的な関連性は、境界までの距離に比例した強力な差別効果を隠すことができると考えられる。すなわち、期間契約に関する雇用保護規制 (employment protection legislation)の緩和、取引と投資の規制緩和、取引の開放性の増加が不景気の地域において生産性向上を促進するが、一方でアントレプレナーシップまたは高水準の政府の負債に対する規制緩和が生産性の境界に近い地域に正の影響を与えている。
R58|La localización como factor crítico. Aná- lisis del programa “Mi casa, mi vida”. Córdoba, Argentina|El objetivo de este artículo es evaluar los impactos del programa “Mi casa, mi vida” sobre los procesos segregativos en la ciudad de Córdoba (Argentina) a comienzos del siglo xxi. A partir de un análisis de autocorrelación espacial de información censal, se midieron los niveles y patrones de la segregación residencial socioeconómica en 2001 y 2008 y se determinó en qué medida dicho programa puede haber contribuido a esos cambios. Los resultados sugieren que, si bien se mejoraron las condiciones habitacionales de casi 8.000 personas, se observa la conformación de conglomerados homogéneos de pobreza escasamente integrados como consecuencia de la localización de los nuevos conjuntos habitacionales. ***** The goal of this paper is evaluate the impacts that the “Mi casa, mi vida” program had on the processes of segregation in the city of Cordoba (Argentina) at the beginning of the 21st Century. Using a spatial autocorrelation analysis of census data, we measured the levels and patterns of socioeconomic residential segregation in 2001 and 2008, and we determined to what extent the program may have contributed to these changes. The results suggest, as the living conditions of almost 8,000 people were improved, that homogeneous clusters of poverty were poorly integrated as a consequence of the location of new housing complexes.

R58|The impact of Urban Enterprise Zones on establishment location decisions and labor market outcomes: evidence from France|In this article, we study the impact of a French enterprise zone program—the ‘Zones Franches Urbaines’ (ZFUs) policy—on establishment location decisions and on labor market outcomes. Our main identification strategy, which combines spatial and time differencing, shows that conditional on locating in a municipality that hosts a ZFU, the policy has a positive and sizable impact on the probability to locate in the ZFU part rather than in the non-ZFU part of municipalities. However, the impact is highly heterogeneous across zones, industries and firms. We also show that this positive effect is entirely due to within-municipality diversion effects. Regarding labor market outcomes, the policy has a positive effect on employment, especially for low-wage workers. As for wages, the effect is null for low-wage workers, and negative for high-wage ones.
R58|Can Urban Renewal Policies Reverse Neighborhood Ethnic Dynamics?|This paper assesses the impact on neighborhood population dynamics of a major urban renewal policy implemented in Catalonia Spain) between 2004 and 2010. Some of the most deprived neighborhoods in the region received large investments in their public spaces and facilities with the aim of attracting natives and high income individuals and of reducing the concentration of poverty and immigration. The control group comprises rejected projects and projects accepted towards the end of the program that, due to a fall in public tax revenues, were never executed. The results suggest that the urban renewal projects had little (if any) effects on population dynamics, suggesting that substantial investment in deprived neighborhoods is insufficient to attract natives and/or high income households. Interestingly, the sole exception were the interventions made in Barcelona's historic districts, where the policy seems to have augmented ongoing processes of urban revival into its most deprived neighborhoods furthering processes of gentrification.
R58|Smart Specialisation at work: Analysis of the calls launched under ERDF Operational Programmes|The goal of this paper is to assess how and to what extent resources under Thematic Objective 1 (TO1) of national and regional Operational Programmes for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) were allocated to operations falling within the innovation and research priorities set in the respective national and regional smart specialisation strategies (S3) during the first phase of the 2014-2020 programming period. The analysis is based on information drawn from calls for proposals launched under 46 Operational Programmes in Italy, Poland, Portugal, Czech Republic, Hungary, Lithuania and Slovenia and published by 31 December 2016. In particular, the study assesses the coherence of calls with S3 priorities; it also looks at the concentration of resources on priorities by calculating the share of ERDF-TO1 funding made available to S3-related projects through calls. Moreover, the analysis explores the range of S3 priorities tackled by individual calls for projects, identifies the policy instruments utilised and the types of beneficiaries targeted by those instruments. The examination reveals that the S3 approach is being translated into practice from a formal point of view. In most of the examined calls, S3 alignment is a binding eligibility condition for funding. Nearly the total amount of the ERDF-TO1 resources made available through calls supports project proposals falling exclusively within S3 priority areas. This could be interpreted as positive evidence of improved prioritisation and more strategic spending patterns, yet results should be taken with caution given the relatively short time-span of the analysis.
R58|Smart Specialisation, seizing new industrial opportunities|This study offers a novel analytical approach to inform the regional search for new industrial opportunities, as promoted by smart specialisation in the EU Cohesion policy context. The analysis departs from the challenges of practicing smart specialisation and its entrepreneurial discovery process in a dynamic perspective. It argues that the adoption of a dynamic approach to identify new opportunities implies mapping regional business and innovation assets as well as, assessing their position within the global technological and industrial landscape. The study brings a case study of Lombardy region, spurring the S3 Lab initiative (in collaboration with Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Catalonia and Lapland), together with a comparative analysis of its technological profile. The empirical study combines patent data from OECD REGPAT and territorial proprietary micro-data from Lombardy region on firm creation in emerging industries (EI) â€“ new industrial sectors or existing sectors evolving into new industries (European Cluster Observatory). These industries represent a priority area for Lombardy's innovation-led development strategy. The initial observations confirm the importance of such industries in the region; they represent more than one-third of employment, almost a half of the regional value-added and feature together the majority of start-ups, suggesting the relevance of the regional strategic development choices. Also, in terms of productive advantages, Lombardy ranks high in some key EI. The mapping of technological competences through patent indicators, e.g. specialisation, diversification and ability to specialise in fast-growing and niche fields gives relevant insights on the technological potential of the region, providing further guidance for better targeted interventions.
R58|Migration, Education and Work Opportunities|I study individual location, education and work decisions in a dynamic life-cycle model in a developing country. I estimate the model exploiting panel data on migrants and stayers in Burkina Faso, and cross-sectional data on permanent emigrants. Individuals self-select into migration and locations based on education. Migration to urban centres increases with education, while migrants at the extremes of the education distribution tend to move abroad. Local unemployment rates, skilled work opportunities and returns to education result in differential expected income gains across locations and hereby explain the complex migration pattern observed. Large income gains from migration are partially offset by direct and indirect migration costs, as well as by higher investment in education (for rural migrants). Migration prospects to urban centres drive education choices of rural individuals. Hence, migration policies can be used to stimulate educational attainment in rural regions.
R58|Sorting Around the Discontinuity Threshold: The Case of a Neighbourhood Investment Programme|Abstract This paper investigates the empirical validity of the setup of a large-scale government neighbourhood investment programme in the Netherlands. Selection of neighbourhoods into the programme was determined by a measure of neighbourhood quality. At first sight this is a textbook example for the application of a regression discontinuity design to estimate the causal effect of the programme on neighbourhood outcomes. Neighbourhoods close to the threshold should be similar before the programme starts. However, at the discontinuity threshold we observe a surprisingly large gap in the share of non-Western immigrants between neighbourhoods that were selected into the programme and neighbourhoods that were not. In addition, there is non-compliance with the assignment rule based on the quality index. The pattern of non-compliance is consistent with investing in neighbourhoods with a high share of non-Western immigrants. Finally, the way in which neighbourhoods were defined could be a likely explanation for the imbalance in the share of non-Western immigrants at the discontinuity threshold.
R58|Vocational Schools as an Instrument of Interregional Competition – Empirical Evidence from German Counties|The German apprenticeship system is widely known throughout the world. We analyze expenditures on vocational schools on county level using data from 213 West-German counties between 2001 and 2006. We use spatial econometrics to test for spatial correlation in counties’ expenditure on vocational schools but find no evidence that vocational schools serve as instrument in inter-county competition. While the theoretical literature suggests that spending should be higher for apprentices from small firms, we find a negative relationship between the share of apprentices from small firms and the expenditures per pupil. Expenditures are found to increase in the share of Christian Democrats in the county council.
R58|A hybrid space to support the regeneration of competences for re-industrialization. Lessons from a research-action|"Since the 1970s, in many European industrialized areas, cities have undergone radical transformations to cope with de-industrialization but also with the new needs of the post Fordistic organization of the factories and their ecosystems: logistics and transport requirements were demanding new functional areas, business services - from individual units up to big service companies - needed different configurations of working spaces, urban sprawling increased to satisfy residential needs. A huge amount of manufacturing buildings has become no longer appropriate for many production processes and the future of the old industrial premises has punctuated the public debate of the past forty years: from their restoring (to keep traces of local socio-technical identity), to their demolition (to provide new appropriate production or living spaces), to their re-use (for hosting new activities). In the somewhat drastic passage from the past industrial era to the future digital economy, medium size cities in industrialized areas present some specific challenges when they have to support the new manufacturing age: not only with new spaces, but also with new skills. In recent years, many public (and also private) initiatives have proposed and implemented the transformation of old manufacturing building in new settings to foster creativity-andinnovation, a condition considered essential, among others, to create new opportunities for growth. Are the re-uses of buildings effective for that goal? Is contamination in hybrid spaces the crucial ingredient for their success in supporting creativity? These questions appear even more critical when we are confronted with the creation of new skills for re-industrialization in areas that are still pillars of manufacturing activities but that are progressively lost the social fabric that reproduced skills. Although their general character is to enable information and communication flows, cities in industrialized areas have lost some important pieces of knowledge on material processes. In this contribution we address some of those issues by nvestigating the action-research called ""Officina Emilia"" that was initiated in Italy exactly with the goal of regenerating competence networks in a manufacturing area. Officina Emilia developed some distinctive features: the creation of an original space, Museolaboratorio, designed as a hybrid space; the action-research program to introduce changes through the context-based technology education; the intent to build on a large and qualified network, supporting the innovation in the education system at regional level. These features will be discussed below. The rationale for this analysis is to single out which are the agents, the processes and some conditions that may hamper similar initiatives. In this chapter we first introduce, in section 2, the interdependencies between economic system and education system. We discuss a new approach to technology education in context, and the specific characters of what is needed to improve such context-based education. In section 3 we present the education activities produced by Officina Emilia. In section 4 we comment on the lessons learned from the action-research that created a hybrid space. Our focus is on the relevant agents, artefacts and interaction processes that can support social innovation in education to enhance significant learning, to meet the changes of the world of production and to address the complexity of concrete situations. Section 5 concludes with some remarks on the lost and missing links hampering the actionresearch to become a driver of change."
R58|Earthquake hazard in Italy Cluster analysis of socio-economic data to inform place-based policy measures|The Italian Government launched the Piano Casa Italia immediately after the series of massive earthquakes that struck Central Italy in 2016, following the 2009 earthquake in L'Aquila and the one in 2012 in Emilia-Romagna. The cumulative impact of human loss-es and economic and social uncertainty produced by the last disaster in 2016 has spurred political decision-makers to advocate an ambitious long-term intervention, aimed at re-structuring Italian public buildings and houses over the next decades. Italy has experi-enced only one other era of similar schemes with the controversial interventions lasting for more than thirty years of the Cassa del Mezzogiorno, which started in the 1950s to cope with the country's dual economic condition. Since then, no other long-term ambi-tious plan has been attempted in Italy and a similar planning perspective is nowadays far from the experience of most public managers, policy makers and even scholars of eco-nomics and development. The ongoing challenges that the Piano Casa Italia has to face are multifaceted: political, economic and social. Challenges pertaining to the agents asked to design the scheme, to implement it and to accept it. The overall perspective of structur-al change will mark its implementation. This paper is a first contribution within a broader framework to outline the conditions characterizing those challenges and the paths of change that will be initiated by realizing the Plan. The paper suggests taking an analytical perspective to support informed policy measures, in four complementary domains: emergency (National Civil Protection), recov-ery (Struttura Commissariale), risk reduction (Piano Casa Italia), socio-economic devel-opment (National Strategy for Inner Areas). The present contribution starts with a prelim-inary step, in line with the Sendai Framework for disaster risk reduction (UNISDR 2015): a detailed analysis of the socio-economic, demographic and geographic conditions across Italian territorial areas, at a municipality level. This work explicitly aims to single out these features, by focusing both on seismic zones and on regions. The paper also returns the results of a cluster analysis performed at municipality level across Italy and concludes discussing some implications for place-based policy interventions.

R58|Destination attributes and tourist’s satisfaction in a cultural destination|Cultural tourism is one of the leading growing segments of the tourism industry. Many tourists who visit heritage sites seek a value-added and authentic experience, when compared with the traditional products or mass destinations. Considering the importance of tourist`s satisfaction in what regards the revisit intentions and word-ofmouth referrals, which in turn influence the economic development of the tourist destination, this study attempts to investigate the relationship between cultural/heritage destination attributes and tourist`s satisfaction. The study area for this paper is the city of Guimarães, in the northwest of Portugal. This city is a place of strong symbolic and cultural significance and was deemed a world heritage site (UNESCO) in the year 2001. In 2012, Guimarães was one of the cities that hosted the European Capital of Culture (ECOC). All this enhanced its tourism potential and increased the amounts of visitors. The methodology consists of quantitative research based on a self-administered survey applied to tourists who visited Guimarães in the first half of 2015. Based upon the empirical results of this study, several recommendations can be made to increase 2 tourists’ satisfaction vis-à-vis to Guimarães, regarding tourists’ needs, attributes valorization and cultural/heritage sustainability.
R58|Assessing the impact of banking intermediation on the economy of Russian regions: The post-crisis trends|"The paper explores the changes in relative levels of banking services availability in Russia’s regions in 2007—2015 and the relationship between the regional financial development characteristics and the indicators of GRP and investments on the regional level in 2002—2014. For 2013—2015, the paper demonstrates the divergence of regions by the composite indicator — the composite banking services density index by region and its separate components. A significant positive relationship of indicators characterizing the regions’ financial mediator services density with the indicators of GRP has been revealed. This relationship is non-linear which is demonstrated in different sensitivity of GRP per capita by groups of regions to the indicators of financial mediation, so that regions with relatively lower or, on the contrary, higher GRP per capita show weaker or no relationship between finance and growth, whereas regions of ""central"" groups with medium values of GRP demonstrate stronger connection."

During the same period, the number of towns and cities with more than 10 000 inhabitants grew from 159 to close to 2 000. A large majority of these agglomerations are secondary cities and small towns that act as hubs and catalysts for local and regional production and supply chains, as well as for the transfer of goods, people and information, linking the local and regional economies to the global economy. The intensity of the spatial interactions of cities has strongly increased with population growth, urbanisation and higher urban density. This paper, part of ongoing work within the Sahel and West Africa Club Secretariat to integrate urbanisation and city growth into analyses of major trends in the region, lays the foundation for the development of a systematic method to capture and describe these spatial interactions. It does so by examining four variables: city size, market potential, urbanisation level and local dominance. These variables, in turn, help to define seven different city groups that can be used to classify West African agglomerations. The initial results of this work reveal the diversity and distinctive behaviours of cities in the region, providing a new perspective on urbanisation dynamics and the influence of spatial variables on urban growth rates, the emergence of new agglomerations and the clustering of cities.
R58|Cross-border Co-operation Networks in West Africa|Long seen as artificial barriers inherited from decolonisation, West African borders now lie at the heart of policies designed to encourage regional trade and combat political instability. This rediscovery of the peripheries of the nation state has fostered a proliferation of institutional initiatives that aim to cultivate co-operation between countries, regions and municipalities while ensuring the protection and promoting the interests and rights of the people living in border regions. Despite these regional initiatives, the effective functioning of cross-border co-operation still remains largely unknown across West Africa. The purpose of this paper is to fill that gap, with an analysis of both the social structure and the geography of West African governance networks. On the basis of this structural and geographic analysis, policy recommendations are formulated aimed at implementing policies that are more place-based, more attentive to relations between the actors at play in co-operation, and more specifically adapted to the constraints and opportunities of the West African region.
R58|Les réseaux de la coopération transfrontalière en Afrique de l’Ouest|Longtemps considérées comme des obstacles artificiels hérités de la décolonisation, les frontières ouest-africaines sont aujourd’hui au cœur des politiques visant à favoriser les échanges inter-régionaux et à lutter contre l’instabilité politique. Cette redécouverte des marges de l’État a favorisé la multiplication d’initiatives institutionnelles destinées à favoriser la coopération entre États, régions et communes tout en assurant la protection et la promotion des intérêts et droits des populations frontalières. En dépit de ces initiatives régionales, le fonctionnement effectif de la coopération transfrontalière demeure encore largement inconnu en Afrique de l’Ouest. L’objectif de cette note est de combler cette lacune en analysant la structure sociale et la géographie des réseaux de gouvernance ouest-africains. Sur la base de cette analyse structurelle et géographique sont formulées des recommandations politiques visant à mettre en œuvre des politiques plus territorialisées, plus attentives aux relations entre acteurs impliqués dans la coopération, et plus spécifiquement ajustées aux contraintes et opportunités ouest-africaines.
R58|Regional growth differences in China for 1995–2013: an empirical integrative analysis of their sources|Abstract An integrative empirical analysis of several regional economic outcome variables in China for the period of 1995–2013 reveal the major sources of regional growth differences in China. Patterns of growth in population, per capita income, gross regional product, housing prices and changes in unemployment rates are identified using principal components analysis. Regression analysis of principal component scores is applied to identify geographic and administrative status patterns in the sources of the growth. The analysis suggests that shifts in labor supply largely were responsible for the regional growth differences over the period, though shifts in labor demand were nearly equally as important. The results have implications for evaluating the success of regional development policies such as the Western Development Strategy.
R58|Technological effectiveness of urban transport in selected Polish cities|Research background: An efficient and effectively functioning transport in the city is of great importance both for the people residing in its territory, as well as companies doing business there. However, apart from a positive impact, transport also carries many social costs including congestion, traffic accidentsand a negative influence on the natural environment. Consequently, urban transport is an increasingly important area of city management. Purpose of the article:The aim of this study is to analyze and to assess the transport technological effectivenessin selected Polish cities.The author received a ranking of cities and identified ways to improve the efficiency. Methodology:The test procedure used non-parametric method of Data Envelopment Analysis. Data for analysis were draw from the Local Data Bank of the Central Statistical Office defining expenses in the transport section as well as data on the condition and use of transport infrastructure. The calculations have been made using Frontier Analyst Application software. The performance results were determined using the BCC model. Findings& Value added:The main result is the author’s rankingof transport effectivenessin Polish cities. The analysis showed that urban transport characterized by a rather low technological effectiveness.
R58|Regional development in the context of economic reform: The case of Limassol|Regional development occurs in the larger context of national economies. Thus, the elaboration of regional economic development strategies cannot be separated from higher-level economic policy which frames and conditions opportunities and risks for regional development. As a Southern European country undergoing a process of profound structural economic reform, Cyprus provides a case for a policy context aiming towards the emergence of a new model of economic growth. Within this context, the Limassol region as one of the country’s major economic centers with a number of comparatively strong industries can serve as an example of how to promote regional development in the framework of national reform priorities such as moving the national economy closer towards a knowledge- and innovation-driven model. The present study analyses current reform priorities on the national and supra-national level, takes stock of the regional economic structure of Limassol district, and presents some preliminary ideas that could be further explored if and when a comprehensive regional economic development strategy for Limassol were to be elaborated.
R58|Territoire Appropriant Et Economie De La Connaissance Basee Sur Les Tic : Une Approche Eclectique<BR>[Appropriating Territory and ICT-Based Knowledge economy: An Eclectic Approach]|This paper defends the idea that the transition of countries, particularly developing countries, to the knowledge economy depends on the ability of their territories (sub-national levels) to diffuse and appropriate the new ICT paradigm. This paper proposes a framework for modeling the process of diffusion and appropriation of ICTs and suggests an ideal-type model of territory that supports the diffusion and appropriation of ICTs. This model of '' Appropriating Territory '' questioned the resources and the possible actions that will develop any territory to enter the knowledge economy based on ICT. While ICT offer potentials for all spaces, the ways and effectiveness with which territory exploit these potentials vary from one territory to another. We distinguish between ‘‘Appropriating Territories’’ and connected to the archipelago economy (architecture of the knowledge economy) and other non Appropriating and thus disconnected and marginalized.
R58|Culture in local and regional development: A Mediterranean perspective on the culture/economy nexus|This policy paper discusses the direct and indirect role of culture as a driver of local and regional development. It identifies the interactions between local framework conditions, culture, creative industries, culturally relevant products and local development, and discusses the systemic role of culture in translating local framework conditions such as diversity, creativity and experimentation into local or regional development impacts such as economic growth and employment. Case studies from two Mediterranean countries, Cyprus and Israel, illustrate the link between culture and local development. In the final part of the paper, conclusions for local and regional policy are drawn and key recommendations are presented with a particular focus on Mediterranean countries.
R58|Rebranding Syngrou: Changing the image of Syngrou Avenue, in Greece|The evolution of cities during the 20th century decisively influenced by events that changed the way cities worked in the past. These rapid changes in the economy of cities, urban governance and mode of international urban network, intensified competition and highlighted the importance of image as a decisive factor for the development of cities and their inhabitants. In this context, place marketing emerged. Cities and regions use place marketing and place branding strategies in order to improve their image and attract investment, residents and visitors. Culture, in all of its manifestations, (cultural flagships projects, cultural clusters, cultural routes, special events and festivals) plays a significant role in place marketing and branding strategies. This paper examines the case of Syngrou Avenue, in Athens – Greece, by developing a pilot place branding plan. The new cultural foundations of the National Museum of Contemporary Art (EMST) and the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center (SNFCC), in conjunction with the existing cultural infrastructure around Syngrou and the plans for the redevelopment of the Faliron Bay, creating the need for a strategically planned image management in order to respond to these new conditions prevailing. The main purpose of the study was to investigate the image and identifying the characteristics that could compose the new competitive identity, the new «brand» of Syngrou. For the purpose of the study apart from the secondary literature review, a primary field research was also conducted. Survey findings were analyzed using the statistical SPSS software package.
R58|Dimensiunea economică a orașului confortabil<BR>[Economic dimension of liveable city]|Starting from the theoretical perspective presented in the first part of research, and ending up with the empirical ones, an attempt was made to provide an answer to the following issue: why are some cities more attractive than others and what criteria should be fulfilled in order for the life of a city’s inhabitants to be considered qualitative.
R58|Why do Portuguese Railways Languish? An Application of Internalisation of Transport Related Externalities|For the last ten years Portuguese railways has shown a gradual decrease in passengers’ annual figures; nearly 20 million. The major contributors are regional services and Lisbon’s commuting lines. Despite the number of passengers in the metropolitan area of Porto remains steady while the long-distance ridership market between the two major Portuguese cities, Lisbon and Porto presents a slightly growth starting in 2014, long-term perspectives for Portuguese railways are not optimistic. Lisbon and Porto, separated by a distance slightly greater than 300 km, are connected by the Northern Line, which was already competing with two parallel highways, is now facing a new threat in the form of an air-bridge launched one year ago with hourly airplane departures at very competitive ticket fares. There are clear indicators that this air-bridge will lure a large number of potential passengers away from long-distance rail therefore pressing up operator revenues over this important rail connection impacting its earning power: this line is responsible for more than 42% of the State-owned railways total earnings. Therefore, the aim of this article is to find why Portuguese rail languishes while air transport grows, increasing perverse results: climate change, health and non-health damages. Fuel exemption and the lack of excise duties produce enough market distortions to explain at some extent how aviation has seen such strong growth in demand at the expense of rail, but this market distortion do not tells the entire story. What is at stake is how to obtain a level playing field between the two modes. In that sense, it is necessary to internalise the social cost of carbon in a way to weight the real costs the society has actually to bear from each option because those costs are not borne by transport operators or users, but by society as a whole. After attach a money value to negative externalities, we identify as the root of the problem for the sustainability of Portuguese long-distance railways the lack of political will towards the internalisation of negative externalities.
R58|Macroeconomic Trends and Factors of Production Affecting Potato Producer Price in Developing Countries|Principal component analysis is performed on 33 mainly agriculture related social variables of 40 developing countries. Important components are also put to explain potato producer price. The analysis reveals that the data set contains macroeconomic trends; economic growth, growing importance of the potato and improving infrastructures for the market economy. Although the coefficients for these trends in affecting potato producer price are not statistically significant, it is noteworthy that their signs are in line with observations from earlier research. Economic growth and increasing potato importance are often accompanied with potato price rising in developing countries, whereas improving infrastructures increase availability of food with lower average prices. Potato producer price is statistically significantly affected by four factors of production: land, labour, capital and technology. Relating potato supply constraints of earlier survey literature to principal component interpretation also revealed primary paths how these macroeconomic inputs are being formed in developing countries. Potato suitability allows more cultivated land and greater production with lower price. Agricultural poverty brings limited alternatives and poor terms of trade for farmers, with abundant labour at low wage rate leading to low potato producer price. Better alternative business lowers capital inflow to agricultural land development, entailing low production and high price. Knowledge increases productivity lowering price.
R58|Local Authorities’ contribution on Gastronomy Tourism Development: the case of Ontario, Canada|The role of Local Government (LG) in achieving tourism development is extremely important. A characteristic example is the province of Ontario in Canada, which managed with the assistance of the Ministries of Tourism and Culture and with the cooperation of the private sector, to create an effective tourism development tool promote the region through its gastronomy - Ontario Culinary Tourism Alliance (OCTA), a non-profit, industry driven organization which leads the implementation of the provincial Culinary Tourism Strategy. Specifically, the municipalities, the ministry and the enterprises assigned to OCTA to develop a comprehensive, Strategic Action Plan 2005-2015 for the Development of Gastronomy Tourism in order to make Ontario, firstly, the primary culinary tourism destination across Canada, and then worldwide. OCTA connects and coordinates successfully all food tourism stakeholders of Ontario
R58|Waste collection in rural communities: challenges under EU regulations. A Case study of Neamt County, Romania|The paper aims to examine the changes in the rural waste management sector at regional scale since the Romania adhesion to the EU in 2007. Traditional waste management based on the mixed waste collection and waste disposal often on improper sites prevailed in municipal waste management options of transitional economies across the globe. The lack of formal waste collection services in rural areas has encouraged the open dumping or backyard burning. The paper analyses the improvements and challenges of local authorities in order to fulfill the new EU requirements in this sector supported by data analysis at local administrative unit levels and field observations. Geographical analysis is compulsory in order to reveal the local disparities. The paper performs an assessment of waste collection issues across 78 rural municipalities within Neamt County. This sector is emerging in rural areas of Eastern Europe, but is far from an efficient municipal waste management system based on the waste hierarchy concept.
R58|Non-parametric methods applied in the efficiency analysis of European structural funding in Romania|One of the most widely used methods in assessing the efficiency of public policies and programs for a set of units is Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). DEA is a non-parametric method which identifies an efficiency frontier on which only the efficient Decision Making Units (DMUs) are placed, by using linear programming techniques. By applying non-parametric techniques of frontier estimation, the efficiency of a DMU can be measured by comparing it with an identified efficiency frontier. In this paper we have used DEA for evaluating the efficiency of the European structural funds allocated to finance the educational infrastructure through the Regional Operational Program 2007-2013, implemented in Romania. The output variables measure the educational performance as well as the school drop-out rate, while the focal input variable is the value of European funds. Romanian counties are considered to be the decision making units (DMUs) and our results confirm the deep disparities existing between Romanian counties concerning the efficient use of European structural funds.
R58|Strategic planning and city/regional development: Review, analysis, critique and applications for Greece|The aim of this paper was to analyze the impact of Strategic Planning (SP) in city/regional development, as well as to identify which strategies, in the context of planning, can be used for achieving local economic development. For that purpose, a review of the relevant literature was conducted. In the analyzed papers, different regions were used as case studies. Additionally, eight areas were identified in which SP was successfully implemented, namely: City/urban development, Tourism, Transportation, Health Care, Education, Energy, Land use and Housing, and Local Governance, revealing the wide applicability of strategic planning in regional development. Several key policies in the context of planning which lead to regional development were identified for each domain. The results indicated that there is a positive association between strategic planning and regional development. More specifically, it was found that strategic planning contributed to the economic development of the examined regions, indicating that it is an efficient tool which can be used by local authorities for enhancing the performance of their regions. The findings are expected to help local actors and urban planners to obtain a more comprehensive view of the advantages, effectiveness and limitations of strategic planning, as well as to identify which strategies mentioned in the academic literature, and were applied in other countries, can be used for achieving local economic development outcomes in Greek regions.
R58|Upgrading a tourism cluster: The case of Eilat|Tourism clusters have attracted a good deal of attention in literature, probably due to the fact that (mass) tourism exhibits a strong tendency to agglomerate. A major challenge for many tourism clusters is how to upgrade their competitiveness in the wake of market change. While the 1950s and 1960s saw the rise of standardized mass tourism particularly in Mediterranean countries, driven by the Keynesian welfare state and Fordist paradigm as well as rising wealth in European markets, since the late 1970s a more differentiated and individualized pattern of tourism demand has emerged. Since then, tourists’ preferences have become much more diverse and led to a roll-back of the previously dominant form of standardized, deterritorialized mass (package) tourism. This diversity is somewhat reminiscent of the notion of flexible specialization known from the literature on industrial change. In the wake of these changes, tourism clusters that came into being during the age of Fordist mass tourism have to devise strategies to differentiate their offer and to adapt their product to new market demands. Eilat in Israel is one of those tourism clusters that exhibit salient features of Fordist mass tourism struggling to find their place in a more differentiated international tourism market. This study takes a look at the structure of the Eilat tourism cluster and suggests a trajectory towards differentiation and upgrading to enhance Eilat’s long-term competitiveness as an international tourist destination.
R58|Cross-border regional development in Gibraltar|Political borders are a reality regional development has to cope with, even if they do not necessarily correspond to the functional boundaries of regional economies. EU membership has afforded regions located close to national borders a high degree of permeability, supported by EU cohesion policy through Interreg projects. But how can these cross-border regions manage to develop under political tides towards re-erecting hard borders? The present study examines the regional economy of British Gibraltar in relation to its Spanish neighbor region, and proposes ideas on how to develop Gibraltar’s economy in a post-“Brexit” reality. Despite continuing uncertainties about the nature and scope of future EU-UK relations, this study presents possibilities for future cross-border regional cooperation, and for developing Gibraltar’s local economy within a region that may be crossed by a hard border but even so remains functionally strongly integrated.
R58|Inclusive local development: A strategy for Heraklion, Greece|Identifying opportunities to facilitate economic growth is a major challenge in local and regional development. Particularly for local or regional economies confronted with deep structural economic problems, unlocking growth differentials by targeting untapped potentials for employment and entrepreneurship can provide an opportunity to renew themselves. Therefore, it is logical that the “missing entrepreneurs” from among economically underrepresented or disadvantaged groups such as women, senior citizens, people with special needs, or youth as well as immigrants have recently gained attention by scholars and policymakers in local and regional development. Still, there is not yet a clear and comprehensive understanding on how to consider the needs of economically underrepresented or disadvantaged groups, both as entrepreneurs or as employees, in local and regional development strategy design. While women and youth entrepreneurship have been subject to an academic and policy debate for some time, the discourse on how to include other economically underrepresented or disadvantaged groups in local or regional economies is far less advanced. The present study reviews the state of literature on inclusive local development and, based on a preliminary analysis of the local economy, proposes a strategy for inclusive local development in Heraklion, Greece. As a locality suffering under the structural economic crisis that has afflicted Greece for almost a decade, a strategy for how to include economically underrepresented or disadvantaged groups in the local economy is both a social necessity and a way to unlock untapped potentials for economic growth.
R58|Regional Disparity and Decentralization in Pakistan: A Decomposition Analysis|The main objective of the study is to analyze the changing trends of social (education and health) inequalities before and after decentralization at the inter-regional and intra-regional level in Pakistan from 2005 to 2015. Coefficient of variation and decomposition of Theil inequality index are used to evaluate the spatial dimensions of inequality at the provincial and rural-urban level. Results of CV indicate high disparity in the education and health sectors at both inter-provincial and intra-regional level. Decomposition of education inequality indicates improvement at provincial level. Rural population has high education inequality than urban. Results of Theil index predict that health inequality has narrowed in the women health in the period of decentralization. Disparity level of child health shows the existence of inequality at both the provincial and rural-urban levels. This situation even persists in the decentralization period. Although the situation of Diarrhoea treatment has improved at the provincial level but there are stark differences in the inequality level of rural and urban population. Within and between group inequality at the provincial and rural-urban level indicates a stable and decline in education and health inequality. Decentralization has slightly improved the situation in both areas, however, such economic and social policies should be adapted which helps to eliminate the issue of regional inequality and develop the lagging areas.

This report is a diagnosis of the situation in foreign trade in Małopolska and Poland in 2015. It is a continuation of foreign trade research, which were carried out by the Małopolska Obserwatorium Gospodarki, operating within the Marshal's Office of the Małopolska Voivodship. The study presents selected areas of foreign trade of Małopolska in comparison to other Polish voivodships, as well as an in-depth analysis of trade exchange.
R58|Multidimensional Child Poverty Measurement and its Mapping: Case of Balochistan, Pakistan|The progress of Pakistan remained poor in human development indicators, especially health, education, stunting, living standard, food security, malnutrition and unemployment. It is a very alarming condition for the Pakistan future that 44 percent of children under five years old are facing stunting. It is notable that poverty levels in Balochistan province of Pakistan are comparatively high. This study uses Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (2010) data of Balochistan for estimation of multidimensional child poverty and deprivation in multiple dimensions using Multiple Overlapping Deprivation Analysis (MODA). The results show that 71% children under five years of age are deprived in nutrition, health, child development, housing and sanitation. A significant difference exists between rural (75%) and urban (57%) multidimensional children deprivation. The study results call for more investment in child poverty reduction programs by provencial and central governments. The focus should be on provision of economic opportunities, improvement in health facilities, strict action for compulsory education and actions for better nourishment to reduce child poverty.
R58|Sustainable rural development through tourism activities in Dobrugdea's rural area|The sustainable rural development of the Dobrudgean rural area requires reaching a balance between the need to preserve the rural economic, ecological and cultural space and the tendency to modernize the rural economic activity and life. The pleading for the promotion of tourism activities in the Dobrudgean rural area starts from the need for rural economical diversification. In general, no rural development program can be conceived in the absence of an essential role played by agriculture. The rural economy is more developed and more dynamic if it has a more diverse structure, and if the share of non-agricultural economy is higher. In this context, the paper presents the tourism potential of the rural localities from Dobrudgea and the development of a viable network of private small and medium-sized enterprises in the tourism sector. The volume of information in this paper resulted from the investigation of relationships that exist between the environmental and social factors at local level, making it possible to define the necessary mechanisms for the sustainable development of tourism activities.
R58|The influence of european funds in visible development of rural areas - case study, place. Ciugud, Alba county|The situation in which the Romanian rural village presents itself is not at all happy, identifying a whole series of problems that may contribute to the worst phenomenon, namely the depopulation of the rural area, characterized by the migration of young people to the big urban centers and the birth rate To an extremely low level. This country-wide phenomenon, but with a more marked manifestation in rural areas, seems to be driven by poor living conditions, lack of jobs, including life perspectives, which make young people leave regions. Those who are involved in the development of these localities are almost non-existent, most often determined by the lack of funds necessary for the investments that could develop the locality or the region, which would then attract investors, thus creating jobs, which could facilitate Leaving young people in rural areas. With the involvement of local authorities by attracting European non-reimbursable funds, the conditions for a harmonious development of these settlements could be created, in which their youth would be the engine of their development.
R58|Exploring Spatial Trends in Wealth Inequalities in Punjab, Pakistan|This study examines the disparities in wealth inequality across districts in Punjab, Pakistan. The paper documents Gini coefficients of wealth inequality using disaggregate household data to assess disparities at the district level as well as disaggregated by urban and rural areas for each district. Furthermore, the paper deploys spatial statistical tools to explore the spatial disparities in wealth inequality in Punjab. This study finds the existence of spatial clustering in wealth inequality in districts at aggregate, urban, and rural area levels. The study emphasizes the need to allocate resources for eradication of disparities among regions and districts. Furthermore, policies and decision-making aimed at reducing regional disparities and in enhancing equity are needed. Given the spatial clustering in economic depravity, the remedial policies must be spatially aware and sensitive to spatial interdependencies discovered in this paper
R58|Urban Development, Excessive Entry of Firms and Wage Inequality in Developing Countries|We examine the short- and long-term effects of urbanization, via favorable urban development policies, on income distribution and social welfare for a developing country. The urban manufacturing sector is characterized by imperfect competition and free entry. Urbanization shifts rural workers to the highly productive urban sector, while causing production in urban firms to expand because of scale economies. However, urbanization may worsen wage inequality between skilled and unskilled labor in the short term. In the long term, urbanization can attract new firms to the urban sector, and favorable urban development policies may result in excessive entry of firms, which can amplify wage inequality in the economy. This entry-amplifying effect is confirmed empirically, especially for low- and lower-middle-income countries. If the entry effect is not considered, the impact of urbanization on wage inequality could be understated by 18% for low- and lower-middle-income countries.
R58|Woody Biomass Processing and Rural Regional Development|This paper reports on economic and environmental impacts of introducing woody biomass processing in an economically distressed area in central Appalachia, one of the more heavily forested areas in the U.S. Woody biomass is a readily available unconventional energy source that has the potential to boost the rural region’s economy. We use a static regional computable general equilibrium model to assess regional economic impacts of two different WBP production pathways, biomass to ethanol and biomass to biofuel via fast pyrolysis. In an economy with a workforce approaching 160,000, we find that introducing woody biomass ethanol or fast pyrolysis processing would increase regional output by 0.45% and 0.78%, boost jobs by 0.13% and 0.20%, and increase income by 0.16% to 0.26%, respectively. The results from the environmental assessment show that the ethanol pathway is substantially more environmentally friendly than the fast pyrolysis pathway.
R58|Creative economy policy in developing countries: The case of Indonesia|This paper investigates how the creative economy discourse is interpreted and implemented in the context of Indonesia as a developing country. Our main conclusion is that the discourse is interpreted differently across localities. Bandung appears to be the only locality whose interpretation aligns with the general understanding of a creative economy that emphasises knowledge creation and innovation. This was made possible by the strong support from academia and communities who wanted to experiment with this policy idea. Our study also provides an insight into a creative economy developing not only as a discourse, but also as a workable framework for development policies, in this city. Conversely, other cities seem to pragmatically use the policy idea without considering the local context in a rebranding exercise in order to drive economic development, whereby traditional cultural industries are relabelled as creative despite performing hardly any innovation activities. Despite this, Bandung illustrates that there are possibilities for a developing country such as Indonesia to adopt the vision of a creative economy by reshaping local institutions to support successful experimentation with this new idea.
R58|Waterfront Urbani: Approcci Rigenerativi e Visioni di Città|L’articolo discute strategie e pratiche di intervento utilizzate per la rigenerazione dei waterfront, una tipologia di spazi urbani, esposta più di altre a processi di profit-driven urbanization. L’intento è quello di mettere in luce le vision o modelli di citta a cui si ispirano le politiche di rinnovo urbano messe in atto in tali ambiti. All’interno di questa prospettiva è proposto uno schema interpretativo, una sorta di griglia concettuale-metodologica che, individuando una selezione di criteri utili per una valutazione multidimensionale dei processi rigenerativi, possa essere utilizzata per sistematizzare i diversi approcci alla rigenerazione e filtrare le esperienze di waterfront renaissance condotte a scala nazionale ed internazionale.
R58|Public R&D subsidies: collaborative versus individual place-based programs for SMEs|Abstract This paper provides novel empirical evidence on the effectiveness of regional research and innovation policies for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). It investigated two subsidy programs implemented at the regional level in central Italy. One program targeted SMEs’ investments in individual research projects, and the other focused on collaborative research projects between SMEs and universities. Using a matched difference-in-differences approach, the empirical analysis showed that the two programs had different effects. The first was successful in stimulating additional private research and development (R&D) investment and improving firms’ performance. The second had weaker effects, mostly restricted to R&D expenditure and employment. These effects were not always uniformly distributed among project participants.
R58|The role of culture in urban contexts|This short paper aims to analyse from an interdisciplinary perspective the role of culture, cultural institutions and cultural actors in the urban scenarios. The main goal is to underline that this type of analysis have to take in consideration several academic disciplines: in particular, the analysis will be done from the point of view of public art, urban sociology, urban geography and economics of culture in order to provide a comprehensive tretment of the subject.
R58|Global changes in residential energy consumption|The residential energy sector is crucial to achieving CO2 emission reductions as it has an important energy-saving potential, and its environmental controls are difficult to displace to other countries. Using the latest available data, this short paper provides a concise analysis of residential energy consumption trends for the period 1993–2013 in a double perspective, by main world regions and by per capita gross national income levels in 2013. Residential energy has been divided into three types: non-renewable, direct renewable and indirect renewable. Annual rates of change, energy intensity, energy in per capita terms and some ratios have been analyzed. Notable regional differences and trends were observed in the studied variables. Therefore, different energy policies are recommended for the regions. Eastern and Southern Asian countries, the EU15 and other developed countries, are the regions which should make the greatest effort to reduce residential energy consumption. The promotion of direct and indirect renewable energies is recommended.
