B52|Escalation and Well-being|Escalation is a key characteristic of many consumption behaviors that has not received the theoretical attention it deserves. The aim of this paper is to propose both a definition and a theoretical treatment of escalation in consumption. We shall define escalation as the attempt to engage in consumption acts that are “more intense” on a measurable quantitative or qualitative, objective or subjective, scale (more difficult ski slopes, stronger drugs, harder sex, better restaurants, riskier games, etc.), even if, previously, the subject preferred less intense consumption behaviors. Further, this evolution in preferences also occurs if the budget constraint does not change. We will find endogenous and exogenous theoretical microfoundations for escalation in models of hedonic adaptation, desire for novelty, acquisition of consumption skills, rising aspirations, positional effects, and envy. However, we will also discuss the possibility that the tendency to escalate is a specific innate behavior inherent to human nature. Finally, we will propose a preliminary theoretical formalization of such behavior and indicate the possible implications of taking escalation into adequate consideration.
B52|Mapping the potential of EU regions to contribute to Industry 4.0|This paper aims to identify the future Industry 4.0 centers of knowledge production in Europe. We expect Industry 4.0 Technologies (I4Ts) to thrive in regions where they can draw on local resources from related technologies. We use OECD-REGPAT data to identify I4T-related technologies, and find that I4Ts are located at the periphery of the knowledge space. Regions with a high potential in terms of I4T-related technologies were more likely to diversify successfully in new I4Ts in the period 2002-2016. We find big differences across EU regions: some show high but most regions show weak I4T potential.
B52|Institutions, Frames, and Social Contract Reasoning|This work aims at filling a gap in the cognitive representation of institutions, starting from Aokiâ€™s account of institutions as equilibria in a game- theoretical framework. We propose a formal model to explain what happens when different players hold different representations of the game they are playing. In particular, we assume that agents do not know all the feasible strategies they can play, because they have bounded rationality; grounding on the works by Johnson-Laird and his coauthors, we suggest that individuals use parsimonious mental models that make as little as possible explicit to represent the game they are playing, because of their limited capacity of working memory and attention. Second, we rely on Bacharachâ€™s variable frame theory: agents transform the objective game into a framed game, where strategies are â€œlabeledâ€ in some sense. In such a context, we argue that a social contract â€“ given its prescriptive and universalizable meaning â€“ may provide a shared mental model, accepted by all players, that allows agents to select a joint plan of action corresponding to an efficient and fair distribution.
B52|Agency in regional path development: Towards a bio-economy in Värmland, Sweden|Despite significant interest in regional industrial restructuring in economic geography, surprisingly scarce attention has been paid to the changing role of agency over time. The current paper develops a framework for understanding the role of multiple types of agents and the agency they exercise for new path development. The framework is employed in a longitudinal study of industry development in Värmland, Sweden, from forestry towards a bio-economy. The analysis highlights how actors exercise very different types of agency in different periods of path development.
B52|Eductive stability may not imply evolutionary stability in the presence of information costs|Starting from a Muthian cobweb model, we extend the profit-based evolutionary setting in Hommes and Wagener (2010) populated by pessimistic, optimistic and unbiased fundamentalists, by assuming that agents face heterogeneous information costs, inversely proportional to the entity of their bias. Hommes and Wagener (2010) proved that, when the unique steady state of their model is globally eductively stable in the sense of Guesnerie (2002), the equilibrium under evolutionary learning may be just locally, but not globally, stable, due to the presence of a period-two cycle. Thanks to the introduction of information costs, we find that the equilibrium, when globally eductively stable, may be not even locally stable under evolutionary learning. More precisely, we analyze our setting by measuring the influence of agents’ heterogeneity through the parameter describing the degree of optimism and pessimism. According to the considered parameter configuration, the unique steady state, which coincides with the fundamental, may be (locally or globally) stable for every value of the bias, like in Hommes and Wagener (2010), or it may be stable just for suitably small and for suitably large values of the bias. Hence, increasing beliefs’ heterogeneity can be stabilizing when information costs are taken into account. We give an interpretation of such counterintuitive result in terms of profits, on which the share updating rule is based.
B52|Housing cooperatives are a growing presence in Australiaâ€™s housing system, providing a diversity of housing forms to a variety of household types across the income spectrum, typically serving low- and moderate-income households. International evidence shows that housing cooperatives can provide a range of housing from very low price points through to market rate in both non-urban and urban contexts. The research presented in this report reviewed a selection of international cooperative housing sectors in addition to the Australian context, with the aims of compiling current evidence for the social and financial benefits of housing cooperatives, to develop a framework to assess this in Australia; and to identify preliminary issues regarding the growth and diversification of housing cooperatives in Australia. Australian and international evidence for the benefits of housing cooperatives focuses on seven primary areas; greater levels of social capital, greater housing security and quality, health and wellbeing, skills acquisition, reduced costs, broader economic and development outcomes. Based on the international review, five factors can be seen to help the growth of cooperative housing in addition to supportive policy and/or public funding. Core amongst these are a stable asset base if the State itself is not the developer, access to appropriate finance, and familiarity and acceptance in the market. The growth and diversification of Australiaâ€™s cooperative housing sector requires assessment of its legislative and funding environment. Factors for consideration are: 1. Individual project viability; 2. Access to property title; 3. Appropriate development finance and resident mortgage mechanisms; 4. Policy support; 5. Appropriate regulation|No abstract is available for this item.

We justify the expediency of forming a system of interrelated projects that ensure the improvement of technology and expansion of output in a set of productions, and analyze promising areas of development of such projects. The connection of the proposed approach with the concept of value chains is considered. The options of institutional organization of the processes of formation and implementation of a system of projects are discussed.
B52|Постинституционализм: Программа Исследований За Пределами Институционального Мейнстрима<BR>[Post-institutionalism: research program beyond the institutional mainstream]|The paper examines the internal dualism of modern institutional economics manifested in division of orthodox or mainstream institutionalism (its axiomatics and dogmatics is represented by the Standard Model) and its opposition – post-institutionalism. It discusses the post-institutional agenda, covering a wide range of discussion issues beyond Standard Model – from the analysis of institutional complexity to introduction of the Evo-Devo paradigm into evolutionary research of institutions. It demonstrates that in the focus of post-institutionalism there are super-complicated institutional systems (assemblages) and related phenomena and processes (bricolage, kludges, anomalies, configurations), which can only be comprehended by overcoming unilateral and dichotomous approaches of the institutional mainstream.
B52|An attitude of complexity: thirteen essays on the nature and construction of reality under the challenge of Zeno's Paradox|This book is about the construction of reality. The central aim of this study is to understand how gravity works and how it may be focused and manipulated. While I do not have an answer to this question, the discoveries along the way have been worth collecting into a single volume for future reference.
B52|From transaction costs to transaction value: Overcoming the Coase-Williamson paradigm|The transaction cost economics has accumulated a mass of dogmatic concepts and assertions that have received high stability under the influence of path dependence. These include the dogma about transaction costs as frictions, the dogma about the unproductiveness of transactions as a generator of losses, Stigler-Coase theorem and the logic of transaction cost minimization, the dogma about the priority of institutions providing low-cost transactions. The listed dogmas underlie the prevailing tradition of transactional analysis – the Coase-Williamson paradigm – which, in turn, is the foundation of neo-institutional theory. Therefore, the community of new institutionalists implicitly block attempts of a serious revision of this dogmatics. The purpose of the article is to substantiate a post-institutional (alternative to the dominant institutional discourse) perspective for the development of transactional studies based on rethinking and combining forgotten theoretical alternatives. We are talking about Commons’s theory of transactions, Wallis-North’s theory of transaction sector and Zajac-Olsen’s theory of transaction value. The article provides arguments and examples in favor of the broader explanatory possibilities of post-institutional transactional analysis.
B52|From institutions to extitutions to the post-institutional theory of institutional anomalies|The paper proposes to abandon the one-sidedly negative interpretation of institutional anomalies (non-optimal, inefficient, dysfunctional institutions) and rethink them as the main products and manifestations of institutional complexity. The concept of extitutions is introduced, which are understood as models of social order that go beyond the bounds of institutions and are based on variations of norms. The extitutional interpretation of the nature of institutional anomalies allows a critical review of the traditionally associated dichotomies (e.g. opposition of ideal and dysfunctional, inclusive and extractive institutions), analytical approaches (functionalist, mechanistic, isolationist, static, etc.) and stereotypes (e.g. assessment of institutions from the standpoint of public interests, “presumption of guilt” of interest groups, stigmatization of hybrid institutional trajectories, etc.). The article proposed a set of conceptual shifts towards increasing the objectivity and realism of the analysis of institutional anomalies in line with the research program of post-institutionalism.
B52|Постинституциональная Теория Блокчейна: Трансакционная Ценность И Ассамбляжи<BR>[Post-Institutional Theory of Blockchain: Transaction Value and Assemblages]|The paper on the example of blockchain demonstrates the possibilities of post-institutionalism – a new generation of institutional methodologies and theories, alternative to the new institutional economics. Based on the theory of transaction value, it has been proved that radical reduction of transaction costs by blockchain technologies will not lead to the elimination of intermediaries, but will redirect them to improving the quality of transactions and expanding the offer of additional (including hyperrelevant) transaction services. Using the theory of institutional assemblages, it is argued that it is impossible to form a homogeneous system of blockchain institutions based solely on the principles of decentralization, transparency and openness. The institutional system of blockchain will be organically hybrid, combining elements of opposing institutional logics – regulatory and algorithmic law, Ricardian and smart contracts, private and public systems, uncontrollability and arbitration. Thus, the conclusions of the neoinstitutional theory of blockchain (Davidson, De Filippi, Potts, 2018) are refuted from post-institutional positions.
B52|Блокчейн и институциональная сложность: постинституционализм vs. неоинституционализм|From the point of view of modern neo-institutional economics, blockchain is an institutional technology that minimizes transaction costs and leads to the elimination of intermediation. Using the example of the blockchain, I demonstrate the possibilities of post-institutionalism – a new generation of methodologies and theories of institutional analysis, alternative to neo-institutional economics. Based on the theory of transaction value, I argue that the blockchain technologies will not radically reduce transaction costs, but will reorient intermediaries to improving the quality of transactions and expanding the offer of additional transaction services. Using the theory of institutional assemblages, I argue that it is impossible to form a homogeneous system of blockchain-based institutions associated exclusively with the principles of decentralization, transparency and openness. Blockchain-based institutions will be of a hybrid nature, combining elements of opposing institutional logics – regulatory and algorithmic law, Ricardian and smart contracts, private and public systems, uncontrollability and arbitration
B52|The limits of laws: traffic law enforcement in South Africa|The aim of many public policies is to change behaviour. Governments tend to rely on regulations, taxes and subsidies to effect such change. These measures, which affect agents' economic incentives, have a mixed record. A key insight of the New Institutional Economics is that the efficacy of such formal institutions depends on the strength of their enforcement and the extent to which they are compatible with prevailing informal institutions. This paper uses the road safety situation in South Africa as a case study to explore aspects of the relationships among formal institutions, law enforcement and informal institutions. South Africa has a strong suite of road safety laws but poor road safety outcomes. The paper argues that improved law enforcement cannot fully solve the problem; complementary changes to the informal institutions shaping the behaviour of road-users are essential. It points out that institutional economists have to take a greater interest in the insights of research in behavioural economics, behavioural and cognitive science and other disciplines in order to provide useful advice in settings where such change is an important policy objective.
B52|Come sorridere anche noi: Sviluppo economico, accesso alle conoscenze, e riduzione delle diseguaglianze|Negli anni recenti si è molto modificata la “curva del sorriso” che descrive la catena del valore. Si è svalorizzata l’incidenza delle parti attribuite ai processi produttivi materiali rispetto alle parti che si riferiscono ai diritti di proprietà intellettuali. Questa trasformazione del capitalismo moderno ha portato a una monopolizzazione della conoscenza, a un forte aumento della diseguaglianza e a una lunga stagnazione economica. Questo lavoro analizza l’interdipendenza fra questi fenomeni e avanza delle proposte che hanno lo scopo di diffondere il benessere consentito dalle nuove tecnologie. Finora il rapido progresso tecnologico di questi anni ha prevalentemente permesso di sorridere solo a coloro che hanno avuto accesso ai nuovi monopoli che caratterizzano il capitalismo moderno
B52|Heterodox economics and Economic Anthropology: reflections prompted by two books|This paper has been long ago inspired by Jared Diamond (1997) and, in particular, by his extensive use of the concept of economic surplus as the key to the development of civilization. Unfortunately, Diamond does not even mention the origin of the concept in classical and pre-classical economics. Moreover, Diamond does not pay any consideration to the long debates in economic anthropology on the role of economic analysis in studying primitive and ancient economic formations. These debates are instead the object of a more recent book by Cedrini & Marchionatti (2017), who context the neoclassical “imperialist” attempt to occupy the territory of economic anthropology. They rely, however, upon the frail institutionalist background provided by Karl Polanyi and his school and by other anthropologists of similar inspiration. In so doing, they fail to provide a robust economic basis to institutional change, by firmly anchoring it around the changing modes of generation and distribution of the economic surplus. These notes are explorative, as also shown by a post-scriptum. Comments welcome.
B52|CasP's 'Differential Accumulation' versus Veblen's 'Differential Advantage' (Revised and Expanded)|This paper clarifies a common misrepresentation of our theory of capital as power, or CasP. Many observers tend to box CasP as an ‘institutionalist’ theory, tracing its central process of ‘differential accumulation’ to Thorstein Veblen’s notion of ‘differential advantage’. This view, we argue, betrays a misunderstanding of CasP, Veblen or both. First, we are not Veblenians and certainly not institutionalists: Veblen’s theory was evolutionary, while CasP is deeply dialectical, and institutionalism, particularly its ‘new’ varieties, emphasizes and often promotes what holds capitalism together, whereas CasP critically examines both the underpinnings of capitalized power as well as the forces that threaten and undermine it. Second, CasP’s notion of differential accumulation is not only different from, but also diametrically opposed to Veblen’s differential advantage. Veblen, who wrote at the turn of the twentieth century, before the appearance of business indices and financial benchmarks, emphasized the absolute drive for ‘maximum profit’ and saw strategic sabotage merely as a power means to an economic end. By contrast, CasP, which was developed at the end of the twentieth century, sees power not only as a means of accumulation, but also – and perhaps more importantly – as its ultimate purpose. Accumulators, it argues, are conditioned and driven to augment not their profits and assets as such, but their relative power, and this means that, as symbolic bearers of power, these profits and assets should be measured not absolutely, but relatively to those of others – hence the imperative of differential accumulation.
B52|Ex-post Analyse der Ministererlaubnis-Fälle - Gemeinwohl durch Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen?|Die sogenannte Ministererlaubnis als Teil der deutschen Fusionskontrolle repräsentiert wahrscheinlich das umstrittenste Instrument sowohl in der juristischen als auch in der ökonomischen Fachdiskussion. Vereinfachend ausgedrückt ermöglicht die Ministererlaubnis dem Bundeswirtschaftsminister, ein Zusammenschlussverbot des Bundeskartellamtes aufgrund von erwarteten positiven Gemeinwohleffekten aufzuheben. Zu den Kritikpunkten zählt dabei, dass die tatsächlichen Erlaubnisentscheidungen weniger durch Gemeinwohlerwägungen zu begründen seien als vielmehr durch politökonomische Interessen bzw. erfolgreiche Lobbyaktivitäten. Zwar können wir im vorliegenden Beitrag nicht die tatsächlichen Motivationen der Erlaubnisentscheidungen nachweisen, aber wir können mit Hilfe von Ex-Post-Analysen zeigen, dass sich nur in einem geringen Teil der Erlaubnisfälle die Gründe, welche zur Erlaubnis führten, ex-post empirisch bestätigt haben und auch auf die Fusion zurückzuführen sind. Damit kann die Ministererlaubnis in ihrer gegenwärtigen Form nicht als effektives Instrument einer gemeinwohlorientierten Korrektur von Fusionskontrollentscheidungen eingestuft werden.
B52|The Financial Innovation Hypothesis: Schumpeter, Minsky and the sub-prime mortgage crisis|Neo-Schumpeterian economics inspired by the work of Schumpeter and the financial Keynesianism of Minsky are often regarded as unrelated theoretical strands. In this paper, we try to combine these two literatures building on a parallelism between non-financial and financial firms. We focus on recent financial innovations, highlighting how the evolution experienced by US financial institutions led them to transcend their traditional role of credit providers, shaping as 'producers' of financial products, through securitization. This allows on the one hand to broaden the application of Neo-Schumpeterian insights to the financial sector and, on the other, to provide an original explanation of the so-called sub-prime crisis by applying the Financial Instability Hypothesis of Minsky to the alternative context of financial production. We maintain that the 2007-8 crisis was not the result of an innovation in the real sector, but came from an innovation (or a series of innovations) intrinsic to the financial system itself, which fostered credit creation. We argue that this 'cluster of innovations' can be placed under the label 'securitization', defined as the business of packaging and reselling loans, with repo agreements as the main source of funds.
B52|Evolution of preferences in group-structured populations: genes, guns, and culture|Humans have evolved in populations structured in groups that extended beyond the nuclear family. Individuals interacted with each other within these groups and there was limited migration and sometimes conáicts between these groups. Suppose that during this evolution, individuals transmitted their behaviors or preferences to their (genetic or cultural) o§spring, and that material outcomes resulting from the interaction determined which parents were more successful than others in producing (genetic or cultural) o§spring. Should one then expect pure material self-interest to prevail? Some degree of altruism, spite, inequity aversion or morality? By building on established models in population biology we analyze the role that di§erent aspects of population structureó such as group size, migration rates, probability of group conáicts, cultural loyalty towards parentsó play in shaping behaviors and preferences which, once established, cannot be displaced by any other preference. In particular, we establish that uninvadable preferences under limited migration between groups will consist of a materially self-interested, a moral, and an other-regarding component, and we show how the strength of each component depends on population structure.

B52|Alta Desigualdad en América Latina: desde cuándo y por qué<BR>[High inequality in Latin America: since when and why?]|In recent years, a dense and fruitful debate on the history of inequality in Latin America has developed. The central points of the debate are: 1) the origin of Latin American inequality; 2) the role of the region’s colonial legacy; 3) whether the continent went through a period of “levelling” between 1930 and 1980; and 4) the sustainability of the recent trend towards inequality reduction. In this context, this paper has two main objectives. First, to evaluate the merits and empirical base of different positions under debate. Second, and most important, to offer a brief history of income inequality in Latin America based on the best evidence available. Thus, the paper presents an analytical narrative centered on the linkages between peripheral capitalism -to which Latin American economies moved in nineteenth century- and the institutional heritage, much of it of colonial origin. The main argument is that both changes and persistent features of inequality can be explained by the way in which the price cycles of exports interact with a political-institutional framework.
B52|Dématérialiser la nature pour la faire entrer dans la sphère du marché|Cela fait longtemps que la nature est entrée dans le processus capitaliste dans ses dimensions matérielles, terre, ressources agricoles et minières, sous la forme de biens tangibles donc. Depuis quelques décennies, un phénomène nouveau apparaît. Des dimensions de la nature sont requalifiées en information, en services et en actifs financiers pour pouvoir à leur tour faire l’objet d’échanges marchands. Autrement dit une nouvelle classe de marchandises fictives apparaît (Karl Polanyi (1944)). Plutôt que de les nommer « immatérielles », je préfère parler de dématérialisation, car il s’agit d’un processus institutionnel, juridique et politique construit et voulu, et non d’une immanence. Analysant le cas des services écosystémiques, cet article propose une catégorisation permettant de comprendre comment l’institution marchande remodèle ainsi de grands pans de la nature, en trois grands moments. Le premier est celui de la qualification de la marchandise, qui vise à en définir les contours précis, la doter d’une mesure et de droits de propriété. Le deuxième processus est celui de l’évaluation, où l’objet considéré acquiert une valeur monétaire de référence. On parle quelquefois de monétisation. Le troisième et dernier moment de la création d’une marchandise fictive est celui de la valorisation. Il s’agit de dispositifs contractuels et/ou marchands qui transforment les valeurs en prix. Ce n’est qu’à cette ultime étape que de la valeur est effectivement créée, c’est-à-dire du capital. Malgré le caractère apparemment immatériel de ces nouvelles marchandises, les conséquences de leur création sur la nature et les relations que nous entretenons avec elle sont tout à fait matérielles.
B52|MobilePay versus Swipp - Main insights from a Nordic country for mobile payment apps|We describe the development of the market for mobile payments in Denmark. In the first step, we explain the two main competing products as well as their underlying technologies. In the second step, we also analyze the competition within the Danish market from debit card companies and the competition which stems from outside of the banking industry (Apple Pay). Based on our analysis, we derive some managerial as well as policy implications.
B52|Die Ministererlaubnis als Element der deutschen Wettbewerbsordnung: eine theoretische und empirische Analyse|Das Instrument der Ministererlaubnis ist ein viel diskutierter Sonderfall in der deutschen Wettbewerbspolitik, bei welchem der Bundeswirtschaftsminister einen vom Bundeskartellamt (BKartA) untersagten Zusammenschluss bei Vorliegen besonderer Gründe im Nachhinein doch noch erlauben kann. Im vorliegenden Beitrag werden sowohl die Ausgestaltung, als auch die Sinnhaftigkeit des Instrumentes an sich aus ökonomischer Sicht beleuchtet, indem zunächst die im Gesetz verankerten Gründe für eine Erlaubnis auf einen Konflikt mit dem Schutz des Wettbewerbs, als übergeordnete Aufgabe des BKartA, untersucht werden. Nach einer Analyse der bisherigen 22 FälleZum Zeitpunkt der Beitragsannahme im Jahr 2018 war die hier angegebene Zahl aktuell und damit auch die weitere Analyse der Fälle und Gründe vollständig. Seit Mai 2019 gibt es nun mit Miba/Zollern einen weiteren Ministererlaubnis-Fall, welcher hier jedoch logischerweise nicht berücksichtigt werden konnte., bezogen auf die jeweiligen Begründungen und Erfolge, werden abschließend fünf Möglichkeiten zur Novellierung des Instrumentes diskutiert. Dabei kommen die Autoren zu dem Schluss, dass eine Anpassung des Gesetzes, sowohl hinsichtlich des entscheidenden Gremiums, als auch bezüglich der zulässigen Begründungen für eine Ministererlaubnis, notwendig wäre, um das Bestehen des Instrumentes wohlfahrtsökonomisch rechtfertigen zu können.
B52|Exploitation, Human Nature, and Social Institutions|Exploitation exists where some gain advantage at others' expense. Its root force is found in human biology, the fact that as a socially-reproducing species, humans compete for mates and the exploitation of others can generate a competitive advantage. Social institutions direct and channel this competitiveness. Thus, during 97-98 percent of our species existence, competitiveness was not expressed by accumulating material wealth and political power, but by being good warriors and foragers, being cooperative, and being generous. However, with the rise of civilization and the state, elites gained ownership and control over the means of production, thereby subjugating all others and appropriating their surplus. Although violence stood behind this exploitation, ideology served as the principal political tool for its maintenance. It is the force of ideology that clarifies why, even with free speech, free press, free assembly, and the franchise, exploitation continues to exist.
B52|Systems Innovation, Inertia and Pliability: A mathematical exploration with implications for climate change abatement|This paper develops a stylised mathematical interpretation of innovation and inertia in economic systems, characteristics which feature in economics literature traceable back at least to Schumpeter and other economic theorists of innovation, as well as economic historians. Such characteristics are particularly important in energy systems and their potential response to climate change, where it is important to distinguish operational/fuel substitution from investment because the latter necessarily embodies both inertia and innovation, in systems as well as technologies. We argue that integrated assessments of climate abatement need to focus on investment, including the associated characteristics of both learning and inertia, and derive in detail the mathematical basis for incorporating these factors through marginal investment cost curves. From this we also introduce the concept of ‘pliability’ as an expression of the ratio between costs which are significant but transitional (including learning investments, infrastructure and overcoming inertia), as compared to the enduring costs implied by purely exogenous technology assumptions. We then incorporate these features in a global model of optimal climate mitigation and show that they can generate a very different profile and pattern of results from traditional ‘integrated assessment’ models, pinpointing the key sensitivities. We conclude that alongside all the attention devoted to evaluating climate change impacts and technology scenarios, far more effort should be devoted to understanding the structural characteristics of how the global energy system may respond to climate change mitigation.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
B52|Reaganomics: A Historical Watershed|The socio-economic impact of Reaganomics and its long-run deleterious legacy is documented. The preponderance of data indicate that economic growth was not particularly impressive in the wake of the tax cuts of 1981 or 1986. GDP did snap back to potential but failed to accelerate beyond the rates achieved in prior or subsequent decades. The supposed incentives of supply-side economics failed to materialize. People did not work more, they did not save or invest more than they did before, and the benefits trickled down like molasses and got stuck at the very top of the income distribution. Instead, Reagan’s presidency was a watershed in U.S. economic development in the sense that it reversed many of the accomplishments of the New Deal and inaugurated an era in which low-skilled men’s wages began a long period of decline, and labor’s share of GDP continued to fall. Reagan’s true legacy is a dual economy that accompanied the hollowing out of the middle class, a more business-friendly regulatory and oversight framework for Wall Street that ultimately led to the financial crisis, a stupendous increase in the national debt from 30% to 50% of GDP that put it on a path such that by 2012 it exceeded 100%, anti-statism that contributed to the rise of Trumpism, a remarkable rise in inequality that gave rise to an oligarchy, and the benign neglect of blue-collar workers who eventually became Hillary Clinton’s “deplorables.” Reagan put the economy on a trajectory to ultimately, even if not inevitably, led to the triumph of Trumpism and an economy of malaise.
B52|The subsidiarity principle: Turning challenge-oriented innovation policy on its head|While innovation policy started as national policy, we witness a proliferation both at the sub-national and the supra-national level. This begs the question about subsidiarity: what policies should be organized at sub-national, national and supra-national levels? We argue that innovation policies aimed to solve societal challenges such as climate change or ageing - currently central in EU policies - are better organized at sub-national levels given the contested nature of problem identification and the contextual nature of problem-solving. Regional innovation policy, then, should formulate concrete societal goals relevant to the local community and tailored to the local context.
B52|Industrial relatedness and regional resilience in the European Union|The 2008 Great Recession prompted interest in the concept of regional resilience. This paper discusses and empirically investigates the relationship between industrial relatedness and economic resilience across European Union regions over the 2008–2012 crisis period. The analysis focuses on two types of industrial relatedness: technological and vertical (i.e., market‐based). The empirical analysis is performed on a sample of 209 NUTS 2 regions in 16 countries. Our results highlight a positive effect of technological relatedness on the probability of resilience in the very short run (i.e., the 2008–2009 period), while the negative effect of vertical relatedness seems to persist for longer. La Gran Recesión de 2008 despertó el interés por el concepto de resiliencia regional. Este artículo analiza e investiga empíricamente la relación entre la relación industrial y la resiliencia económica en las regiones de la Unión Europea durante el período de crisis 2008‐2012. El análisis se centra en dos tipos de relación industrial: tecnológica y vertical (es decir, basada en el mercado). El análisis empírico se realizó sobre una muestra de 209 regiones NUTS 2 en 16 países. Nuestros resultados destacan un efecto positivo de la relación tecnológica sobre la probabilidad de resiliencia a muy corto plazo (es decir, en el período 2008‐2009), mientras que el efecto negativo de la relación vertical parece persistir por más tiempo. 2008年のグレート・リセッションによって、地域のレジリエンスという概念に対する関心が急激に高まった。本稿では、2008年~2012年の経済危機の期間を通しての欧州連合の地域全体における産業間の連関性と経済レジリエンスの関連性を考察し、実証的に検討する。技術的と垂直的 (すなわち、市場ベース)という2つの産業間の連関性のタイプを中心に分析を行う。実証分析は、16カ国における209のNUT2の地域のサンプルを対象に実施する。結果から、技術的な連関性は、垂直的連関性の負の効果はより長く持続するようであるが、非常に短期的 (すなわち、2008年~2009年)なレジリエンスの可能性に対して正の効果を与えていることが明確に示された。
B52|Does related variety affect regional resilience? New evidence from Italy|Abstract Although several contributions have studied the effect of related variety on the economic performance of firms and regions, its influence on regional resilience—that is, regions’ capacity to adapt to external shocks—has received little attention. This paper contributes to this debate by analysing empirically the relationship between related variety and regional resilience at the local labour market (LLM) level in Italy. The analysis uses a standard definition of regional resilience and employs spatial econometric techniques to analyse the role played by related variety as a short-run shock absorber with respect to the 2008 Great Recession. The results obtained from the estimation of Spatial Durbin Error Models suggest that LLMs characterised by a higher level of related variety have shown a higher capacity to adapt to the Great Recession with respect to the 3-year period 2010–2013. On the contrary, there is evidence of a negligible role played by related variety as a shock absorber with respect to the 1-year resilience period 2012–2013.
B52|Spinoffs, parents, and institutions: Evidence from the Italian motorcycle industry|In this paper we study the impact of spinoff generation events on the performance of parent organizations. Using data from the Italian motorcycle industry (1893-1993), we find that parents have higher survival chances after a spinoff generation event, confirming results from previous studies about other manufacturing industries. We also show that these enhanced survival patterns differ across time and space, and we link these effects to institutional differences: spinoff generation did not determine any survival advantage for parent firms in the Fascist era and in the Turin cluster, while it had an additional positive effect in the Motorvalley cluster. The paper contributes to the literature on spinoff generation and employee mobility and adds to the debate on the role of institutions in evolutionary economic geography, by showing the importance of contextual factors for the performance of parent firms.

From this we also introduce the concept of ‘pliability’ as an expression of the ratio between costs which are significant but transitional (including learning investments, infrastructure and overcoming inertia), as compared to the enduring costs implied by purely exogenous technology assumptions. We then incorporate these features in a global model of optimal climate mitigation and show that they can generate a very different profile and pattern of results from traditional ‘integrated assessment’ models, pinpointing the key sensitivities. We conclude that alongside all the attention devoted to evaluating climate change impacts and technology scenarios, far more effort should be devoted to understanding the structural characteristics of how the global energy system may respond to climate change mitigation.
B52|Calmfors and Driffill revisités : analyse de l'hétérogénéité institutionnelle et macroéconomique en Europe|Aux divergences institutionnelles des marchés du travail européens s’ajoutent d’importants écarts de performance macroéconomique. Une hypothèse intéressante est celle d’une courbe en cloche reliant la centralisation des négociations salariales aux salaires réels et au chômage, proposée par Calmfors et Driffill (1988). À partir des bases de données ICTWSS et OCDE, nous identifions trois profils de marché du travail selon leur degré de centralisation et leurs performances (centralisé, intermédiaire et décentralisé). Nous agrégeons les principales composantes institutionnelles de la dispersion des pays sous forme d’un indicateur de centralisation sur lequel nous régressons le salaire réel et le taux de chômage. La courbe en cloche qui apparaît s’avère non seulement robuste, mais également pertinente pour analyser les trajectoires des pays, notamment la décentralisation allemande. Les mauvaises performances de certains pays européens, comme l’Italie, semblent liées à l’absence de choix entre deux modes de négociation opposés.
B52|Calmfors and Driffill revisited : Analysis of European ,Institutional and Macroeconomic Heterogeneity|The European labor market incorporates a great variety of institutional frameworks and divergent macroeconomic performances. The hump-shaped curve hypothesis of Calmfors and Driffill is interesting in its linkage of centralization of wage bargaining processes to real wages and unemployment. From the ICTWSS and OECD databases, we identify three labor market profiles according to their degrees of centralization (decentralized, centralized and intermediate). We aggregate the main institutional components of the dispersion of countries into a centralization indicator on which we regress real wages and unemployment rate. The hump-shaped relationship that results from our analyses is robust and pertinent to country trajectories over the years, especially to German decentralization. The poor macroeconomic performance of some European countries after the 2008 financial shock appears to be linked to the countries’ consistent intermediate levels of centralization that result in a manifestation of the negative effects of both centralized and decentralized models.
B52|Norm making and institutions dynamics: how the research program of the French Régulation Theory can be fertilized by the methodological concepts from the “Max-Planck-Institute for European Legal History”|The aim of this paper is to show the possible connections between some legal history research methodologies and the research agenda of the Régulation Theory. As the last is a heterodox theory of institutions, cross-fertilizations with other fields of research open new research perspectives. In this respect, the methodology of the legal history research from the Max-Planck-Institute for European Legal History developed several methodological concepts like multinormativity, governance, science of regulation or law as communication. Such constructivist framework allows analyzing in vivo the norm-making and their incorporation into actors and social structures. In a context of trans-national regulation and growing autonomy of sectoral regulations, such in vivo analysis of the norm making can explain the genesis, transformation and destabilization of macro-economic institutions, which is the core interest of the Régulation Theory.
B52|Regional Growth Paths: From Structure to Agency and Back|The study of regional growth paths is a key theme in economic geography and of elemental interest for policy makers concerned with regional development. Evolutionary theory explains the path-dependent nature of regional development, and points to its open-ended nature. This paper addresses the interplay between path-dependent, structural forces and the construction and utilization of opportunities through agentic processes. Extending to the evolutionary framework, it is argued that not only history but also perceived future opportunities influence agentic processes in the present and thus shape regional growth paths. Building on recent work about foresightful, strategic and distributed agency, this paper identifies three forms of agency, Schumpeterian innovative entrepreneurship, institutional entrepreneurship and place leadership, that call for and necessitate each other in the process of shaping regional growth paths. It is argued that such a holistic view is essential to understand regional development processes and in particular structural change as manifested in economic diversification and new industrial path development.
B52|Employment and the minimum wage: A pluralist approach|When discussing the employment effects of minimum wages, mainstream economic discussion as well as mainstream economics textbooks mainly center around two variations of the neoclassical model: the model of the competitive and the monopsonistic labor market. The current paper offers a different perspective: it provides an assessment of the broader variety of existing theories and develops a new theoretical account which integrates these different views. For the comparison as well as for the later integration of these theories, it draws on an evolutionary economic concept: a micro-meso-macro framework. Here it shows that due to its simple structure and conceptual flexibility, the micro-meso-macro framework is very well suited to the task of integrating these different theoretical visions as well as assessing their evolutionary features. It follows from the analysis that from a theoretical viewpoint, the effect of the minimum wage on employment is indeed ambiguous, which is perfectly in line with the existing empirical evidence.
B52|Reflections on the New Deal: The Vested Interests, Limits to Reform, and the Meaning of Liberal Democracy|"I subject some aspects of Roosevelt's ""New Deal"" to critical analysis, with particular attention to what is termed ""liberal democracy."" This analysis demonstrates the limits to reform, given the power of ""vested interests"" as articulated by Thorstein Veblen. While progressive economists and others are generally favorably disposed toward the New Deal, a critical perspective casts doubt on the progressive nature of the various programs instituted during the Roosevelt administrations. The main constraint that limited the framing and operation of these programs was that of maintaining liberal democracy. The New Deal was shaped by the institutional forces then dominant in the United States, including the segregationist system of the South. In the end, vested interests dictated what transpired, but what did transpire required a modification of the understanding of liberal democracy. The following paper provides a compressed account of this tradition of endogenous financial market instability."
B52|Managing the Discontent of the Losers|In the early-mid 1990s, Social Structure of Accumulation (SSA) theorists identified the solidification of a neoliberal SSA that included a capital-citizen accord based on “managing the discontent of the losers”. This created social stability by reconciling working households to material hardships emanating form the neoliberal labour market by means of either coercion or non-economic distraction. This paper argues that there was, in fact, a fundamentally material basis to the neoliberal capital-citizen accord, including the ability of households to accumulate debt in order to limit the growth of consumption inequality in the face of burgeoning income inequality. The material basis of the capital-citizen accord broke down during the financial crisis of 2007-09, destabilizing the accord itself. The result is that an SSA that has resisted top-down reform is now threatened by bottom-up “reform” in the shape of rising populism. The outcomes of this process are highly uncertain – a key characteristic of the periods of inter regnum that separate successful SSAs.
B52|Inter-Industry Wage Inequality: Persistent differences and turbulent equalization|Persistent inter-industry wage differentials are an enduring puzzle for neoclassical economics. This paper applies the classical theory of ‘real competition’ to inter-industry wage differentials. Theoretically, we argue that competitive wage determination can be decomposed into equalizing, dispersing and turbulently equalizing factors. Empirically, we show graphically and econometrically for 31 U.S. industries in 1987-2016 that wage differentials, like regulating profit rates, are governed by turbulent equalization. Furthermore, we apply a fixed effects OLS as well as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model and find that the link between regulating profit rates and wage differentials is positive, significant and robust.
B52|Development of Education and Health Services in Asia and the Role of the State|This paper analyses the dramatic spread of education and healthcare in Asia and also the large variations in that spread across and within countries over fifty years. Apart from differences in initial conditions and income levels, the nature of the State has also been an important determinant of these variations. This is because social development has typically been led by the State. But in most countries, public resource constraints and the growing dependence on private provision and private spending have generated a pattern of nested disparities in the access to education and healthcare between rich and poor regions, between rural and urban areas within regions, and between rich and poor households within these areas. However, as the better-off regions, areas, and households approach the upper limits of achievable education and health standards, a process of convergence is also underway as those left behind begin to catch up.

B52|Are “happy” firms all alike? A comparative analysis of Italian and German manufacturing systems|Recent works in the socio-economic and comparative political economy literature suggest the emergence of a predominant neoliberal model of capitalism, which is gradually being adopted by most advanced countries. A similar trend is present in the management literature where competitive advantages are increasingly being associated with a predominant strategic paradigm (integrated global engagement) leaning on the complementarities among R&D, human capital and entry into foreign markets, regardless of the country and industry a firm belongs to. While both views imply a growing tendency towards institutional and strategic homologation, other studies show only a partial convergence in institutional settings and highlight the presence of considerable heterogeneity in managerial conducts. In this paper we explore these contrasting interpretations by comparing the characteristics of manufacturing firms in Italy and Germany. The analysis suggests that (a) independently of the country of origin, globally engaged firms are relatively similar in characteristics that are usually positively correlated with economic performance such as size, age and innovation, but remain highly differentiated in terms of institutions-related variables; b) firms that have not adopted a strategy of global engagement are markedly heterogeneous in terms of both structural characteristics and institutions-related variables. In other words, global engagement is associated with a lower degree of the differentiation between Italian and German firms, but the variety of institutional settings continues to affect the evolution of businesses. Policy implications are discussed.
B52|The Financial Innovation Hypothesis: Schumpeter, Minsky and the sub-prime mortgage crisis|Neo-Schumpeterian economics inspired by the work of Schumpeter and the financial Keynesianism of Minsky are often regarded as unrelated theoretical strands. In this paper, we try to combine these two literatures building on a parallelism between non-financial and financial firms. We focus on recent financial innovations, highlighting how the evolution experienced by US financial institutions led them to transcend their traditional role of credit providers, shaping as 'producers' of financial products, through securitization. This allows on the one hand to broaden the application of Neo-Schumpeterian insights to the financial sector and, on the other, to provide an original explanation of the so-called sub-prime crisis by applying the Financial Instability Hypothesis of Minsky to the alternative context of financial production. We maintain that the 2007-8 crisis was not the result of an innovation in the real sector, but came from an innovation (or a series of innovations) intrinsic to the financial system itself, which fostered credit creation. We argue that this 'cluster of innovations' can be placed under the label 'securitization', defined as the business of packaging and reselling loans, with repo agreements as the main source of funds.
B52|The Institutionalist Theory of the Business Enterprise: Past, Present, and Future|This paper examines the historical developments of the institutionalist theory of the business enterprise since early 1900s. We will examine the major contributions in order to find the theoretical characteristics of the institutionalist theory of the business enterprise vis-à-vis evolving capitalism. The paper begins with a discussion of the present state of the institutional theory, looks back on the original ideas of Veblen and Commons, and goes on to later contributions, such as Gardiner Means, John Kenneth Galbraith, William Dugger, and Alfred Eichner. The paper concludes with a discussion as to what should be done for the further development of the institutionalist theory of the business enterprise.
B52|Ricardo’s Theory of Value is Still Alive and Well in Contemporary Capitalism|The purpose of this article is, on the one hand, to shed light on some significant aspects of Ricardo's theory of value and on the other hand to show that Ricardo's insights about the explanatory power of the relative labour times on the movement of relative prices were in the right direction. For this purpose, Ricardo's theory of value is cast rigorously and in modern terms such that by using detailed intertemporal data from input-output tables of two major economies to show that Ricardo's insights are absolutely consistent with the facts.
B52|Economics of Information Biasing: A Unified Economic Theory That Leads to New Sustainability Concepts|The author believes that his concept “Biased Equilibrium” based on information sharing strategies of individual economic agents brings two scientific paradigms of economics, neoclassical economics and institutional economics together from the origin of general equilibrium to provide holistic view of real world economic and social structures. In this article he goes deep into the concept of dynamics of rational behaviors with respect to diverse self-interests of individual economic agents. Our social or economic institutions can be subjectively modeled as an information biasing chain where individuals are positioned in different abstract coalitions according to interdependence of their payoff functions. The upper layer coalitions virtually control the institutions and they have greater influences on our economy that provokes growth by exhausting energy and other natural resources and causes climate change. His model also provides guidelines for transiting from a growth based economy to a sustainable economy, while solving macro and micro-economic challenges in real time.

B52|Alta desigualdad en América Latina: desde cuándo y por qué|In recent years, a dense and fruitful debate on the history of inequality in Latin America has developed. The central points of the debate are: 1) the origin of Latin American inequality; 2) the role of the region’s colonial legacy; 3) whether the continent went through a period of “levelling” between 1930 and 1980; and 4) the sustainability of the recent trend towards inequality reduction. In this context, this paper has two main objectives. First, to evaluate the merits and empirical base of different positions under debate. Second, and most important, to offer a brief history of income inequality in Latin America based on the best evidence available. Thus, the paper presents an analytical narrative centered on the linkages between peripheral capitalism -to which Latin American economies moved in nineteenth century- and the institutional heritage, much of it of colonial origin. The main argument is that both changes and persistent features of inequality can be explained by the way in which the price cycles of exports interact with a political-institutional framework.

B52|К Общей Теории Социально-Экономического Развития<BR>[Towards a general theory of social and economic development: evolution of coordination mechanisms]|"A new approach to understanding social and economic development is proposed, based on consideration of the evolution of coordination mechanisms. The work consists of two parts. In the first part, a critical analysis of four recently proposed theories of social development, focusing on geographical, institutional or cultural factors, is given. These theories have greatly enriched our understanding of the evolution of society, however, as analysis shows, none of them provides a satisfactory description of the driving forces and mechanisms of this evolution; the main reason is rooted in their common shortcoming - monocausality. It is proposed to distinguish between two types of development, catching up and leading. The basic ideas of the theory of catching-up development are presented. This approach makes it possible to explain the phenomenon of the ""economic miracle"" as a result of mutually conditioned changes in culture, institutions, technological progress and well-being in the context of interaction of competition, power and collaboration mechanisms. The second part is devoted to the theory of leading socioeconomic development. . It is shown how in Western Europe, as a result of the interaction of the above four factors, specific forms and combinations of the three main mechanisms of coordination - competition, power and cooperation - emerged at each stage of evolution. I emphasize the importance of ideology and the phenomenon of technical progress in the formation of institutions of economic and political competition that contributed to the creation of the welfare state. These changes and economic growth created the conditions for further transformation of civil culture: increasing levels of trust, tolerance, altruism and cosmopolitanism, expanding the planned horizon. The decrease in the level of coercion built into the mechanisms of power and competition are demonstrated as well as the expansion of the role of collaboration. A hypothesis is advanced that the speed of this process depends on geographical factors. The idea of welfare world is discussed."
B52|A Testable Theory of Institutional Change in Authoritarian Regimes|With the guidance of a new institutional framework, the theoretical modelling establishes the necessary and sufficient conditions for institutional change to occur in authoritarian regimes: first, external chocks must be strong, much stronger than in a democratic regime; second, the chocks must be of such a kind that gives rise to factional competition within the ruling group. It predicts that involvement by the ruled group brings about more extensive institutional change than that merely driven by the ruling group. The theory is then applied to explain rural China’s market transition. As institutional change defines pay-off structure, the extent of this change is approximated by the income advantage of cadre households relative to non-cadre households. Econometric tests based on a Chinese rural household panel data of 21 years confirm the theoretical prediction.
B52|Monopoly Capital and Innovation: An Exploratory Assessment of R&D Effectiveness|This research note performs some limited empirical assessments of the Baran and Sweezy (1966) contention that most research and development (R&D) efforts in the US are “wasted” at the macroeconomic level in that as R&D succeeds by absorbing a little of the excess economic surplus generated by a capitalist system, it still fails to generate a lot of innovation of a transformative nature. At an aggregate level, greater R&D efforts are correlated with higher worker productivity and standards of living, which is to be expected according to mainstream economic theory and literature. Yet, R&D efforts regarding job creation, new firm creation, and net business investment show either mixed results or even negative connections. There is some preliminary empirical support in this paper for many aspects of the Baran and Sweezy point of view on R&D, and these findings also hint that R&D is used in a monopoly capital system to further monopolization. The findings of this note also may help to explain how productivity gains and innovation over the last few decades may not be benefitting the typical worker or the creation of small businesses as well.
B52|Эво-Дево: Парадигмальный Вызов Для Институционально-Эволюционного Анализа<BR>[Evo-Devo: Paradigmal Challenge for Institutional-Evolutionary Analysis]|In modern biological science there is a change in the paradigm of evolutionary research associated with the rejection of neo-Darwinism principles. The article discusses the prospect of using the conceptual ideas of evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) as the new dominant metaphors of institutional-evolutionary analysis. For example, metaphors of niche construction and developmental system stimulate the rejection of externalism (securing the key role in selection for the environment) and dichotomous thinking (opposition of actors and the environment, micro- and macro-analysis). The concept of institutional configurations developed in this vein makes it possible to analytically combine institutional, agential and environmental factors in their interaction into a single framework. The metaphor of bricolage actualizes the importance of abandoning the optimization concepts of evolution and one-sidedly negative interpretation of institutional anomalies (dysfunctions, failures, traps, etc.) in favor of studying institutional kludges as quasi-optimal persistent institutions created by non-professional actors, and positively rethinking anomalous institutions as a main output of institutional complexity. The metaphor of modularity is associated with the abandonment of thinking in the spirit of traditional totally integrated systems and the transition to the research of assemblages – super-complex institutional systems based on multiple logics and orders for which heterogeneity, fragmentation and hybridity are organic properties and evolutionary advantages.

The term ‘extitutions’ is introduced as transcending institutions of (beyond-institutional) models of social order, based on variations of norms. The extitutional interpretation of the nature of institutional anomalies allows us to critically reconsider associated dichotomies (such as ‘bad / good institutions’ like North-Wallis-Weingast or Acemoglu-Robinson), approaches (eg, functionalism and evaluative ‘something wrong’-approach) and stereotypes (including one-sided negative interpretation of ‘bad’ institutions, ""presumption of guilt"" of interest groups, etc.). The author's position is to understand institutional anomalies as the main product of institutional complexity. The article also substantiates the expediency of taking into account the role of institutional configurations and small institutional entrepreneurship in the formation of ‘anomalous’ institutions. An agenda is proposed for future research in the field of the theory of institutional anomalies"
B52|Постинституционализм: За Пределами Институционального Мейнстрима<BR>[Post-institutionalism: Beyond the Institutional Mainstream]|The paper examines the internal dualism of modern institutional economics manifested in division of orthodox or mainstream institutionalism (its axiomatics and dogmatics is represented by the Standard Model) and its opposition – post-institutionalism. It discusses the post-institutional agenda, covering a wide range of discussion issues beyond Standard Model – from the analysis of institutional complexity to introduction of the Evo-Devo paradigm into evolutionary research of institutions. It demonstrates that in the focus of post-institutionalism there are super-complicated institutional systems (assemblages) and related phenomena and processes (bricolage, kludges, anomalies, configurations), which can only be comprehended by overcoming unilateral and dichotomous approaches of the institutional mainstream
B52|Market sentiment and heterogeneous fundamentalists in an evolutive financial market mode|We study a financial market populated by heterogeneous fundamentalists, whose decisions are driven by ``animal spirits''. Each agent may have optimistic or pessimistic beliefs about the fundamental value, which are selected from time to time on the basis of an evolutionary mechanism. The evolutionary selection depends on a weighted evaluation of the general market sentiment perceived by the agents and on a profitability measure of the existent strategies. As the relevance given to the sentiment index increases, a herding phenomenon in agents behavior may take place and the animal spirits can drive the market toward polarized economic regimes, which coexist and are characterized by persistent high or low levels of optimism and pessimism. This conduct is detectable from agents polarized shares and beliefs, which in turn influence the price level. Such polarized economic regimes can consist in stable steady states or can be characterized by endogenous complex dynamics, generating persistent alternating waves of optimism and pessimism, as well as return distributions displaying fat tails and excess volatility.
B52|A Pull-Push Theory of Industrial Revolutions|Drawing from the only two known industrial revolutions, this paper present a theory of technological/structural/industrial revolutions based on pull and push factors. Specifically, generalizing from the first industrial revolution (FIR) in Great Britain and the U.S. post-bellum economic growth (1880-1900) and second industrial revolution (SIR), we show that two fundamental conditions appear to be necessary, namely the existence of a set of new market opportunities (pull) as well as the existence of a new set of process innovations/new technologies (push). In other words, the overriding, underlying shock (i.e. the ultimate cause) must induce push and pull factors, without which the revolution in question will not occur. In the case of the first industrial revolution, we argue that the migration of 100,000-140,000 French Huguenot refugees to the shores of England, Ireland and Scotland was among the causes, while in the case of the second industrial revolution, it was the steam engine which ultimately contributed to the opening up of the West, the creation of a national market and the resulting mass production.

B52|Understanding Financialization: Standing on the Shoulders of Minsky|Since the death of Hyman Minsky in 1996, much has been written about financialization. This paper explores the issues that Minsky examined in the last decade of his life and considers their relationship to that financialization literature. Part I addresses Minsky's penetrating observations regarding what he called money manager capitalism. Part II outlines the powerful analytical framework that Minsky used to organize his thinking and that we can use to extend his work. Part III shows how Minsky's observations and framework represent a major contribution to the study of financialization. Part IV highlights two keys to Minsky's success: his treatment of economics as a grand adventure and his willingness to step beyond the world of theory. Part V concludes by providing a short recap, acknowledging formidable challenges facing scholars with a Minsky perspective, and calling attention to the glimmer of hope that offers a way forward.
B52|The Great Deception: The 'Science' of Monetary Policy and the Great Moderation Revisited|Conventional wisdom suggests that the Great Moderation was caused by either good policy, good luck (favourable shocks), more efficient private sector behaviour (such as better inventory management), or more effective financial innovations. We show that it may, instead, have originated from the complementarity of an erroneous reading of the economy by central bankers and evolutionarily time-varying heterogeneity in inflation expectations formation within the private sector. One general finding of our analysis is that seemingly inadequate stabilization policies may, in fact, work. We comment on the broader ramifications for stabilization policy of this finding.
B52|Beyond Catch Up: Some Speculations About the Next Twenty Five|In his book Catch Up, Deepak Nayyar has identified a total of twenty five developing countries (excluding Taiwan) as having the most potential for catching up with the developed countries. This paper speculates about the likely status of these countries, Nayyar's `Next Twenty Five', around the middle of the 21st century. Drawing on his own earlier work on the subject as well as the recent contributions of Acemoglu and Robinson, among others, the author first presents the elements of a theory of economic history as the dynamics of interactions between resource endowments, technology and institutions, mediated by the cumulative impact of incremental change as well as transformative shocks at critical junctures. The prospects of the `Next Twenty Five' are then assessed through the lens of this theoretical framework, recognising that outcomes are probabilistic in a Bayesian sense and not deterministic. Size matters because very large and very small countries have their own specific dynamic. Hence, two very large countries, China and India, and two very small countries, Tunisia and Honduras, are separately analysed. In assessing the prospects of the other twenty one countries in the group, the paper addresses the question of why there is a distinct geographic pattern of the catch up process working more powerfully in Asia as compared to Latin America or Africa.
B52|Alternative Financial Regimes and Development Banks in Greece 1963-2002: What Have We Learned?|The recent global financial crisis spurred a renewed interest in development banking because of the countercyclical role many of these banks assumed during the crisis. However, there is no agreement in the literature concerning the nature and efficiency of development banks. This paper focuses on their role as agents of institutional change and the concomitant need for their internal transformation as institutional development goes on. The question posed is how development banksï¿½ internal transformation from the traditional development banking model to a modern investment banking model is affected by the political decision on the prevailing financial regime. The paper addresses this question by examining the relationship between development banks and alternative financial regimes in Greece during the period 1963-2002. Useful insights concerning the role of government policy in development banking are drawn.
B52|Pension Funds in Chile: Bringing the State Back In|The privatized and capitalized old-age insurance in Chile has recently witnessed reforms under President Bachelet which extended the social safety net as well as re-introduced publicly-administered programs on behalf of retirees. The article reviews the performance of the system up to the most recent reform and presents results of pension engineering in a systematic way in attempt to estimate the scope of change. The method relies on orderly analysis which is founded on review of the literature relevant to the subject. Bringing the state back into Chile's pension system can be viewed as a plan to subsidize total retirement benefits in order to improve the distressing rates of replacement and, in such indirect way, to support the longevity of privately-managed pension funds.
B52|Mainstreams of Research on Institutional Change in the Multidimensional Viewpoint|The role of institutions in the social and economic development is widely recognized in recent literature on economics of institutions. Economic history provides many examples of bad and good institutional structures, environments, and ways of organizing the social life and relationships between individuals, which is the main reason for institutions to arise. Simultaneously diversity of institutional solutions can be perceived as cultural wealth from which societies can choose in order to find proper instruments to solve various problems in different situations. The present paper is an attempt to review main areas of research into institutional changes and synthesize them into mainstreams, which are also described in the multi-faceted viewpoint to prove the complexity and broad scope that need to be tackled by institutional economists to investigate institutional changes. The article analyses literature on institutional change and several dozen dimensions of the research areas that have a significant impact on the discussion on the mechanisms and environments of evolution of institutions. The review of the mainstreams is divided into five identified basic groups. In the last section the multidimensional perspective of the research area of institutional changes is proposed as it helps to grasp many aspects that play the fundamental role in understanding the process of institutional change, which is an indispensable step towards a development of the general theory of institutional change.
B52|The firm as a common. The case of the accumulation and use of capital resources in co-operative enterprises|Contemporary literature dealing with the governance of the exploitation of common-pool natural resources was initiated by Elinor Ostrom in 1990, and has been growing fast ever since. On the contrary, within the same research stream, the study of the presence and economic role of common resources in entrepreneurial-organizational is, to date, under-researched. This work endeavours some attempt to fill this gap by: first, spelling out a new-institutionalist framework for the analysis of the accumulation and governance of common capital resources within organizational boundaries; second, by considering co-operative enterprises as the organizational form that, on the basis of historical record, and of behavioural and institutional characteristics, demonstrated to be the most compatible with a substantial role for common and non-divided asset-ownership and with its governance thereof. The economic forces influencing the optimal level of self-financed common capital resources in co-operatives are enquired. Also their governance is brought under the spotlight, evidencing: (i) the constraints that need to be fulfilled, and the potential benefits arising out of their presence; (ii) the compatibility and mutual adaptability between democratic governance in co-operatives and the governance of non-divided assets.
B52|Between Trust and Performance: Exploring Socio-Economic Mechanisms on Directed Weighted Regular Ring with Agent-Based Modeling|This paper explores the evolution of interaction and cooperation supported by individuals’ changing trust and trustworthiness on directed weighted regular ring though agent-based modeling. This agent-based model integrates fragility of trust, interaction decision, strategy decision, payoff matrix decision, interaction density and information diffusion. Marginal rate of exploitation of original payoff matrix and relative exploitation degree between the original and mutated payoff matrices are stressed in trust updating; influence of observing is introduced via imagined strategy; relation is maintained through relation maintenance strength. The impact of degree of embeddedness in social network, mutation probability of payoff matrix, mutated payoff matrix, proportion of high trust agents and probabilities of information diffusion within neighborhood and among non-neighbors on the sum of number of actual interaction and cooperation of all agents are probed on the base of a baseline simulation, respectively. Under the experimental design and parameter values selection in this paper, it is found that basically as degree of embeddedness in social network, proportion of high trust agents and probability of information diffusion in neighbors increase, as mutation probability of payoff matrix, conflict in mutated payoff matrix and probability of information diffusion in non-neighbors decrease, interaction and cooperation perform better.
B52|What Affects General Trust? A Perspective from Institutional Economics and Empirical Evidence from China|Given the importance of trust, exploring what may affect trust then becomes attractive. The main purpose of this paper is to explain general trust quantitatively. This paper from, but not limited to, a perspective of original institutional economics elaborates what may affect general trust and proposes three reasonable hypotheses first, and then uses CGSS 2013 dataset to execute ordered logit regression of general trust on some selected variables. It is found that taken advantage has a strongly significant negative impact on general trust; fairness, moral satisfaction, opinion similarity, leisure time for rest and leisure time for learning have strongly significant positive impacts on general trust; public security problem, however, has a negative but not significant impact on general trust. These core explanatory variables improve predictive capability by 4 percent. This paper also compares general trust and trust in strangers, and regress trust in strangers on the same independent variables of general trust. There are two main differences: the first is that the negative impact of public security problem gets significant for trust in strangers; the second is that the significant impact of leisure time for resting gets negative for trust in strangers.
B52|Consumption & Class in Evolutionary Macroeconomics|This article contributes to the field of evolutionary macroeconomics by highlighting the dynamic interlinkages between micro-meso-macro with a Veblenian meso foundation in an agent-based macroeconomic model. Consumption is dependent on endogenously changing social class and signaling, such as bandwagon, Veblen and snob effects. In particular we test the macroeconomic effects of this meso foundation in a generic agent-based model of a closed artificial economy. The model is stock-flow consistent and builds upon local decision heuristics of heterogeneous agents characterized by bounded rationality and satisficing behavior. These agents include a multitude of households (workers and capitalists), firms, banks as well as a capital goods firm, a government and a central bank. Simulation experiments indicate co-evolutionary dynamics between signaling-by-consuming and firm specialization that eventually effect employment, consumer prices as well as other macroeconomic aggregates substantially.

Throughout regarding calibrations, one might see that, despite the existence of some deviations from trend and some Gini 1 and Gini 2 coefficients’ differences, (a) there exists an improvement in the distribution of income until 2011, except for the year 2009 when the global crisis was experienced, but an average deterioration in the distribution for 2011-2015 period is experienced, (b) the geographical regions of the Turkish economy reveal different outcomes. For the period 2006-2015, it is observed that in the regions of Istanbul, West Marmara, Central Anatolia and North East Anatolia, the Lorenz curve has moved away from full equilibrium line, but in the regions of Aegean, Eastern Marmara and Eastern Black Sea, on the average, a convergence towards the equilibrium from the Lorenz curve has appeared. In other three regions, the Gini coefficients improve on average in Western Anatolia, Mediterranean and Western Black Sea regions. The Gini coefficients are increasing in the period 2006-2011 in the Middle East Anatolia and falling in 2015. In the South East Anatolia Region, there is no progress in the period 2006-2011, but, there happens to be a recovery in income distribution in 2015.
B52|Разработка стратегий социально-экономического развития: наука vs идеология<BR>[Designing the Strategies for Socio-Economic Development: Science vs. Ideology]|"Strategies for socio-economic development in ""catching-up"" countries are designed on the basis of ideologies dominated in the society and, as a rule, fail. Until recently, economic science could not offer an alternative basis for designing strategies, but over the past twenty years the situation has changed. Nevertheless, scientific results are still weakly demanded by society. In this paper, the conflict between economics and dominant ideology is explored. On the one hand, ideology restrains the development of scientific research, and on the other hand it is changing under their influence. However, these changes are very slow for a number of reasons, analyzed in the paper. Ideology is inevitably connected with the interests of economic agents. The old elite prevents the emergence of a new ideology, since new concepts reveal the mistakes of past projects. In addition, the implementation of new ideas may require institutional changes that weaken the power of existing high-ranking officials. Meanwhile, in modern societies there are no regular mechanisms providing such transformations, and the probability of rational volitional decisions, which confront the dominant ideology, is small."
B52|Толерантность, Сотрудничество И Экономический Рост<BR>[Tolerance, collaboration and economic growth]|"Institutional (in particular, political) pluralism is a fundamental feature of modern developed societies. Its cultural basis is the tolerance of citizens. The paper proposes to distinguish between legal, evaluative and interactive tolerance. This distinction makes it possible to explain the contradictory results obtained with econometric studies of tolerance and its links with the economic growth. Legal tolerance is the basis of competitive pluralism, and interactive one is the prerequisite for the formation of consensus pluralism, based on the collaboration of various social forces. Struggle for resources, intra- and intercountry inequality, ""history wars"" and prejudices prevent the strengthening of tolerance. Attention is drawn to the ""paradox of political correctness"": dogmatic tolerance generates intolerant behavior. It is noted that interactive tolerance in developing countries is significantly correlated with technological progress and the level of well-being. The existence of this relationship, which is realized through the collaboration mechanisms, gives the ground for supposition that, despite the contradictory dynamics of the tolerance level in the past 25 years, tolerance will be strengthening in the long run."
B52|Institutional Quality and Economic Performance in West Africa|This study empirically accessed the impact of institutional quality on economic performance in West Africa. The study employed the control of corruption, government effectiveness, regulatory quality and rule of law as institutional quality indicators as provided by the World Governance Indicators, WGI (2017). A panel data set of 12 West African countries from 1996 to 2015 was estimated using the fixed effect model, the random effect model and the panel two-stage least square technique. The result showed that all the indicators of institutional quality employed in the study have positive and significant impact on economic performance in West Africa when the fixed and random effect model estimation technique was employed but only government effectiveness was significant after taking account of endogeneity using the panel two-stage least square technique. The study concludes that economic performance in West Africa would be enhanced in the presence of improved institutions with more consideration to government effectiveness.
B52|Blockchain Technology - An Instrument of Economic Evolution?|Man has not only evolved biologically and culturally but also economically. Human economy has grown over many centuries through continuous addition of value. This value addition has been an evolutionary factor as it has influenced the formation of the main economic sectors-namely Primary, Secondary and Tertiary. Recently after the advent of Blockchain technology, Bitcoin achieved Gold parity. This paper analyses whether such an event will have any impact on the evolution of our economies. First, I discuss the various sectors of the economy. Then I evaluate how Bitcoin (BTC) achieving Gold Parity (GP) may influence the outcome of future economic scenarios. The paper concludes by summarizing the importance of technology in our economic systems and how technology affects its evolution.
B52|The Great Deception: the ‘science’ of monetary policy and the Great Moderation revisited|Conventional wisdom suggests that the Great Moderation was caused by either good policy, good luck (favourable shocks), more efficient private sector behaviour (such as better inventory management), or more effective financial innovations. We show that it may, instead, have originated from the complementarity of an erroneous reading of the economy by central bankers and evolutionarily time-varying heterogeneity in inflation expectations formation within the private sector. One general finding of our analysis is that seemingly inadequate stabilization policies may, in fact, work. We comment on the broader ramifications for stabilization policy of this finding.
B52|Heterogeneity of habits as a foundation for Schumpeterian economic policy|Abstract In this paper, we highlight the heterogeneity of agents in Schumpeter’s theory. Because of its centrality in Schumpeter’s theory, we argue that agent heterogeneity should also be a key element for economic policy informed by Schumpeter’s theory. Schumpeter considered agents’ habits as a particularly important source of heterogeneity. We show how Schumpeter’s notion of habits is closely related to modern work on habits, and draw on recent research to elaborate theory that can provide the foundation for Schumpeterian economic policy. We argue that heterogeneity of habits can be a crucial building block and foundation of Schumpeterian economic policy: it offers a target for policy interventions that is different from incentives or information. This target is potentially as powerful as incentives or information, which only influence intentions rather than influencing behavior directly.
B52|The Origins of Private Property|This paper focuses on the legitimacy of private property and analyses the process of first appropriation. In particular, we examine and comment the different views on the origin of private property rights that have emerged through the history of economic and legal thinking, from Democritus to de Jasay. These views have been grouped in two broad categories: consequentialism and fundamental principles. Although consequentialism is now dominant among economists and inchoate in the legal profession, we observe that it is in fact an alibi for discretionary policymaking by the authority. By definition, fundamentalist approaches generate rules that limit discretion. However, we show that some fundamental views rest on questionable a-priori statements. De Jasay’s argument based on the presumption of liberty is perhaps the only perspective that escapes this criticism.
B52|Un récit historique alternatif sur l’indépendance des banques centrales: la doctrine et les pratiques avant la théorie ou l’art avant la science|La fin des années 80 et les années 90 ont été marquées par une grande vague d'adoption de l'indépendance des banques centrales (IBC). Les manuels et les revues de la littérature adoptent souvent un récit historique standard la présentant comme une sucess story, comme l'application d'un consensus théorique. L'art aurait suivi le pas de la science. Cet article a comme finalité ultime de proposer un récit alternatif concernant l'IBC. Adoptant une perspective historique centrée sur la première partie des années 20, nous entendons démontrer que la doctrine des banquiers centraux et les pratiques, comprises en tant qu'adoption de l'IBC, précédent la théorie, l'art venant alors avant la science. Vue de façon normative par la littérature économique à partir des années 80, l'indépendance est pensée, dès les années 20, par les praticiens qui posent eux-mêmes les principes du central banking. Dans la nouvelle donne de l'après-guerre, marquée par l'absence de l'ancrage nominal autrefois fourni par l'étalon-or, l'IBC s'avère un arrangement institutionnel alternatif face à l'inflation. Elle est recommandée au niveau international et constitue un principe central de la doctrine du central banking avancé par le gouverneur anglais Montagu Norman. Comme pour le principe d'indépendance, les pratiques précèdent la théorie. On considère qu'il y a eu une première vague d'adoption de l'IBC dans la première moitié des années 20, bien avant la vague d'adoption de l'IBC de la fin des années 80 et des années 90. Suite à des expériences hyper-inflationnistes et dans le cadre de plans de stabilisation monétaire sous tutelle internationale, les banques centrales de l'Autriche (1923), de la Hongrie (1924) et de l'Allemagne (1922-24) deviennent légalement indépendantes.
B52|SMEs access to formal finance in post-communist economies: Do institutional structure and political connectedness matter?|In post-communist economies, a disproportionately greater share of formal finance is channelled to larger enterprises and SMEs lack appropriately-priced formal finance. This article examines whether institutional structure and interpersonal connectedness with bureaucrats exacerbate this formal finance misallocation. We show that access to and use of interpersonal bureaucratic networks improve chances of receiving formal bank credit by between 4–10%. The benefits of interpersonal links are stronger for larger SMEs, and being connected to bureaucratic networks is not associated with enterprise growth. These findings imply that traditional policies that increase bank finance to SMEs should also aim to improve impartiality of bureaucratic institutions and enforceability of private contracts.
B52|Global and domestic inequalities and the political economy of the midde-income trap|Some middle-income economies, many of which Latin American, have not achieved to make the transition into high-income status for long years and are allegedly trapped in middle-income status. While there is considerable consensus on the proximate causes of this phenomenon, we present a global political economy perspective to the discussion, arguing that global and domestic inequalities, both political and economic, are key to understand the issue. We subject our argument to empirical scrutiny, using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) on data spanning the years 1976-2009. Both domestic economic equality and political independence from the influence of an external power turn out to be robust characteristics supporting growth convergence of middle-income countries.
B52|"From the ""planning euphoria"" to the ""bitter economic truth"": The transmission of economic ideas into German labour market policies in the 1960s and 2000s"|This paper compares the interconnections between dominant economic thought and processes of policy-making in the area of labour market reforms in Germany in the late 1960s and the early 2000s. The transition in labour market policies in this period could be described as a change from an active to an activating approach. At the level of economic discourse these policy changes correspond to a paradigm shift from Keynesian to neoclassical/neoliberal economic thought. We investigated these changes by focussing on two distinct reforms of labour market policies and carried out a critical discourse analysis of the relevant public and academic discourse of economists. We find that the paradigm shift in economic thought was accompanied by a shift in economists' discourses on labour market policy issues.

B52|Tony Lawson's Theory of the Corporation: Towards a Social Ontology of Law|In his account of the corporation as a 'community', Tony Lawson advances a materialist theory of social reality to argue for the existence of emergent social structures based on collective practices and behaviours, distinguishing his position from John Searle's theory of social reality as consisting of declarative speech acts. Lawson's and Searle's accounts are examined for what they imply about the relationship between social structures and legal concepts. It is argued that legal concepts are themselves a feature of social reality and that a consequence of the law's recognition of the 'reality' of the corporation is to open up the activities of business firm to a distinct form of normative ordering.
B52|Um fordismo “atrofiado”?: considerações a respeito do modo de desenvolvimento do capitalismo no Brasil : retrospecto histórico e situação atual|This paper discusses the Brazilian industrialization process (1930-1980). Could we call the Brazilian experience as a Fordism model of development ? In a what sense? Further on highlights the institutional diversity and the national trajectories of development (the varieties of capitalism) and we discuss the Brazilian case: the crisis of the Brazilian development model and the new possibilities. We must examine these ideas in the context of contemporary global crisis and in the background of contradictory and historic sides of the institutional change. Then this paper examines the consequences of social struggles and democratization of the country over social rights and the political economy. We also examine the consequences of the globalization and social development over the Brazilian ways.
B52|Assessing the Fiscal Sustainability of the Czech Republic|We present a model of public finance for the Czech Republic that addresses the main sources of risks to long-term fiscal sustainability: ageing-related expenditures and revenues, and the corresponding evolution of government debt. The baseline model is based on recent demographic projections issued by the Czech Statistical Office that forecast a shrinking share of the working-age population. Along with regulations and microeconomic incentives embedded in the tax and expenditure systems, demographic developments will affect economic growth and government expenditure and revenues in the long run. Population ageing is found to have a significant impact on future government expenditure via spending on old-age pensions and health care, where the cost profiles are modelled to reflect technological progress in the treatment of ageing-related illnesses. The analysis shows that under the current policy settings, a compound demographic effect will cause the primary government balance to turn negative at the beginning of the 2030s. The growing primary deficits, along with interest payments, which react to debt dynamics, will lead to a rapid escalation of government debt. While the outcome of the model is dependent on the specific settings of macroeconomic trends and policy variables, our wide range of sensitivity analyses show that without a policy response, even the most optimistic population scenario delivers an unsustainable path for public finances.
B52|Migrants and the Making of America: The Short- and Long-Run Effects of Immigration during the Age of Mass Migration|We study the effects of European immigration to the United States during the Age of Mass Migration (1850-1920) on economic prosperity today. We exploit variation in the extent of immigration across counties arising from the interaction of fluctuations in aggregate immigrant flows and the gradual expansion of the railway network across the United States. We find that locations with more historical immigration today have higher incomes, less poverty, less unemployment, higher rates of urbanization, and greater educational attainment. The long-run effects appear to arise from the persistence of sizeable short-run benefits, including greater industrialization, increased agricultural productivity, and more innovation.
B52|Strategies and public propositions in games of institutional change: Comparative historical cases|This paper argues that the game-theoretic approach is incomplete for institutional studies, because comparative institutions as well as institutional changes involve the possibility of multiple equilibria. In order to solve the common knowledge problem, this paper proposes to unify game theoretic thought with an analysis of public representations/propositions to summarize salient features of the recursive/emergent states of play. From this perspective the paper tries to reconcile differences in three accounts of institutions: endogenous outcome, exogenous rules and constitutive rules accounts. Then, the unified approach is applied to comparative and historical cases of Tokugawa Japan and Qing China. Specifically it sheds new light into the coalitional nature of the Tokugawa Baku-Han regime nesting the fundamental Samurai-village pact as well as the tendency toward decentralization of political violence and fiscal competence to the provincial level toward the end of Qing China. From these new historical interpretations, endogenous strategic forces and associated public propositions leading to institutional changes through the Meiji Restoration and the Xinhai Revolution are identified and compared.
B52|Social and solidarity finance: A conceptual approach|An analysis of the social- and solidarity-finance system of relationships, which has characteristics that differ from those of other financial intermediaries, underpins the conceptual approach of this article. Social and solidarity finance constitutes a set of interdependent financial and social relationships, and partnerships between individuals and organisations, that mesh into an organised whole.
B52|The spatial evolution of the Italian motorcycle industry (1893–1993): Klepper’s heritage theory revisited|This article investigates the spatial evolution of the Italian motorcycle industry during the period 1893–1993. We find strong support for the heritage theory of Klepper, even after controlling for agglomeration economies. However, we find also a positive effect of being located in the Motor Valley cluster in Emilia Romagna on the survival rate of motorcycle firms. Interestingly, this beneficial effect is stronger in the Emilia Romagna cluster than elsewhere. This might indicate the importance of a favorable local institutional environment, as propagated by the Emilian district literature.

B52|Is the market really a good teacher?|Abstract This paper proposes to model market mechanisms as a collective learning process for firms in a complex adaptive system, namely Jamel, an agent-based, stock-flow consistent macroeconomic model. Inspired by Alchian’s (J Polit Econ: 5(3):211–221, 1950) “blanketing shotgun process” idea, our learning model is an ever-adapting process that puts a significant weight on exploration vis-à-vis exploitation. We show that decentralized market selection allows firms collectively to adapt their overall debt strategies to the changes in the macroeconomic environment so that the system sustains itself, but at the cost of recurrent deep downturns. We conclude that, in complex evolving economies, market processes do not lead to the selection of optimal behaviors, as the characterization of successful behaviors itself constantly evolves as a result of the market conditions that these behaviors contribute to shaping. Heterogeneity in behavior remains essential to adaptation. We come to an evolutionary characterization of a crisis, as the point where the evolution of the macroeconomic system becomes faster than the adaptation capabilities of the agents that populate it.
B52|Les droits et libertés fondamentaux à l'épreuve de l'efficacité économique : une application à la politique de la concurrence|La place croissante que revêt l'analyse économique dans le contentieux juridique, y compris dans le contentieux constitutionnel, pose la question de son impact sur les droits et libertés fondamentaux. Ces derniers peuvent être mis en balance avec la logique de l'efficacité. Dans le droit de la concurrence de l’Union Européenne, la mise en oeuvre d'une approche plus économique (ou approche par les effets) et la montée en puissance des procédures négociées (souvent justifiée par des gains d'efficience en termes procéduraux) constituent un exemple d'évolution de la pratique décisionnelle pouvant mettre en jeu non seulement les droits de propriété et la liberté contractuelle des firmes mais aussi le contrôle juridictionnel lui-même. Cet exemple nous conduit à nous interroger sur l'analyse économique de ces deux droits fondamentaux. Nous insistons sur la diversité des approches économiques en la matière en confrontant les approches de l'analyse économique du droit à celles du vieil institutionnalisme et de l'approche autrichienne.
B52|Unrelated knowledge combinations: Unexplored potential for regional industrial path development|The paper engages in a critical discussion of the related variety – regional branching argument and foregrounds a more differentiated perspective on regional industrial path development. It contributes by i) sharpening the definition of key concepts, namely specialisation and diversity, related and unrelated variety, ii) discussing their relevance in local and non-local spaces, iii) scrutinizing related variety as source for regional branching, and iv) developing a conceptual framework capturing the opportunity space for regional structural change that unveils the relevance of path upgrading, path importation, path branching, path diversification, and new path creation as different forms of new path development.
B52|The Role of Agents’ Propensity toward Conformity and Independence in the Process of Institutional Change|This paper analyses institutional change and Veblen’s work (1907, 1914, 1919) under the perspective of cognitive economics. Particularly it focuses on two interesting issues of Veblen’s theory of economic change: 1. in Veblen’s view habits are both mental habits and behavioral habits and they play a twofold role in economic change because they are particularly relevant both as elements of propensity, and as forces resisting to change. 2 Veblen gives an exhaustive definition of instincts and habits but he does not completely explain the cognitive processes that bring changes and evolution in social habits. He develops an economic theory at the base of which there is an evolutionary view of reality and a deep awareness of the role of the human mind within the decision-making processes of choice. This paper is aimed at analyzing both issues using the interpretive tools offered by psychology and discussing the role of agents psychological propensity toward conformity and independence in explaining institutional change. The central idea is that if we better encompass the theory of conformity and independence developed in psychology (starting from Asch, 1952) in the analysis of economic institutions, we can better explain institutional change. Conformity is the effect of the pressure of social group on agents’ behavior. That concept contributes to explain resistance to change. On the other hand, psychology shows that agents are also subject to mechanisms of independence. These are key elements in explaining behavioral change. The analysis of Veblen’s instinct-habit concept under conformity-independence perspective shows interesting connections between Veblen and Hayek’s ideas of economic change. Hayek’s concept of evolution based on psychological and neurobiological aspect, in fact, is a contribution of great significance both in explaining the dual role of habits in institutional change and in understanding individual mechanisms that bring changes in social habits.
B52|Social-scienciation of Economics and its Consequences: On a Relative Convergence between Economics and Sociology|We are currently in times in which an increased discussion on interdisciplinarity is on the agenda. Economics tends to go into directions of sociology, history, and psychology, taking on topics of their domains. Questions of convergencies and divergencies between the academic subjects are a result. This observation goes parallel with sociological debate on the status of sociology. Major questions remaining are: (1.) Has the field of sociology changed since Emilé Durkheim or Max Weber? (2.) Which domain can sociology claim as being its exclusive ground? Answers to these questions have to identify a broader landscape of academic division: Economics is moving increasingly in the direction of social topics and sociological ground. The “imperialism of economics” (Granovetter) is increasingly approaching traditional academic fields of history, psychology, and sociology. However, at least two psychologists (H. Simon, D. Kahneman) and an economic historian (R. Fogel) have received Nobel prizes in economics. How can sociology map with this trend, how can this challenge be converted into an academic opportunity? The paper will explore observed trends in detail in order to conclude that the public image of sociology may have declined during recent decades, but the strategic use and importance of (economic) sociology has never been greater. Economic sociology seems to have become an upgraded discipline since social networks, communication processes, institutions and culture are increasingly considered as core dimensions. Of course, the conclusion follows exactly the script of earlier instructions provided by Max Weber or Joseph Schumpeter.
B52|Impact Of Institutional Economy On The Way Of Scientific Cognition In Marketing| Subject and purpose of work : The article discusses the problem of the relationship between marketing science and institutional economy. Its goal is to examine the impact of institutional economy on the way of scientific cognition in marketing. Materials and methods: The article was prepared on the basis of the study of the relevant Polish and foreign research literature, particularly concerning marketing theory. The methodology of the present study is based on the considerations taken up in deduction with the support of descriptive and comparative analysis. Results : The impact of institutional economy on the method of scientific cognition in marketing results in the interest of marketing science not only in an enterprise but also in an effort to describe the external factors (externalities) and social costs related to marketing activities of enterprises. Of importance is also the understanding of the functioning of the structure of the marketing system as well as the reactions of the institutions responsible for the implementation of the country’s marketing policy. Conclusions : The analysis conducted for the purpose of this study leads to a general conclusion that marketing and science devoted to it are not homogeneous in epistemological terms and a significant dualism between the two can be pointed out. It encompasses traditional marketing which stems from management and marketing referring to the institutional economy of higher level.---------Przedmiot i cel pracy: W artykule podjęto problem związku nauki o marketingu z ekonomią instytucjonalną, a jego celem jest ukazanie wpływu ekonomii instytucjonalnej na sposób poznania naukowego w marketingu.

B52|Conspicuous Consumption and Darwin's Critical Sexual Selection Dynamic That Thorstein Veblen Missed|" Thorstein Veblen's theory of conspicuous consumption is one of his most powerful contributions to social science. Conspicuous consumption is undertaken in an attempt to maintain or increase social standing. But why do humans seek to acquire status through their consumption practices? Or more fundamentally, why do they seek status? Veblen does not present it as grounded in an instinct such as his instincts of parental bent, workmanship or idle curiosity, although he claims that ""the propensity for emulation is probably the strongest and most alert and persistent of the economic motives properâ€¦ a pervading trait of human nature."" But why? Had he read Darwin, or read him more carefully, he would have picked up on Darwin's concept of sexual selection and recognized it as the driving force behind conspicuous consumption as well as much other behavior intended to favorably impress others, if not the driving force behind all of his instincts. Sexual selection is a form of natural selection that works through mate selection as opposed to physical survival. How much an individual can consume signals an ability to command resources essential for successfully raising children. This article adds the Darwinian depth that Veblen missed to his important concept of conspicuous consumption, and in doing so adds clarity to humanity's prospects."

Theoretical base for research was the new institutionalism under the methodological principles and criteria prepared by Douglass North. The analysis consist of two steps. The first describes institutional matrix of monetary policy in EMU. The second compares formal and informal institutions of monetary policy in the Eurozone before and after 2008. The analysis revealed, that changes have been made in monetary policy principles and tools. Nevertheless, institutional matrix was not changed.
B52|Informal Institutions in the Corporate Governance System in Russia|The corporate governance system in Russia, having evolved through years, can be characterized by the following features: the dominant role of the concentrated ownership structure, corporate supervision relying on a combination of ownership function and company management, the significant role of the state as the owner, and the fairly marginal relevance of external market mechanisms. Those features result partly from particular legal solutions and partly from the unwritten, informal customs or patterns of behaviour of the so-called informal institutions. The article’s main thrust is to analyse selected informal institutions which were considered the most significant from the Russian corporate governance system point of view. These are, among others: the tendency not to obey the rights of minority shareholders, informal relationships of enterprises with authorities of various levels, and corruption. The author assumes that informal institutions decide upon the specificity of the corporate governance system in Russia and its particular elements, and upon the efficient functioning of supervisory mechanisms.
B52|Informal Institutions in the Corporate Governance System in Russia|Various scholars of ethics and economics conduct research on the best modes of decision making which guarantee good outcome and moral behaviour of the individuals involved. Either of the modes considered, rules with regulations or discretion and judgment, find applicability in diversified professional circumstances. The paper investigates how discretion can be used in professional activity by using the Aristotelic-Thomistic framework. Results indicate that such a framework can be used by engineers in their working environments and by other working professionals with the main proposition that only in discretionary decision making is the person able to take full responsibility for the outcomes and to premeditate their moral worth in conscience before resolving to commit the act itself.
B52|Institutions Without Culture. A Critique of Acemoglu and Robinson's Theory of Economic Development|Acemoglu and Robinson’s theory presented in their famous Why Nations Fail, and other papers, should be placed among the institutional theories of economic development. Yet the problem is they strongly differentiate their concept from the so-called culture hypothesis, which they reject. This stance is difficult to accept, not only because of the significance of culture-related factors of economic development, but it is also difficult to reconcile with their own model. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that such a strong rejection of the culture hypothesis is inconsistent with their own analysis, triggers some principal problems with understanding the basic notion of institution, and suggests Acemoglu and Robinson are only focused on considering formal institutions. The article concludes with the statement that, paradoxically, Acemoglu and Robinson’s unconvincing rejection of the culture hypothesis may be regarded as a justification of the importance of culture-related factors.
B52|Meeting the Challenges of the EU-2020 Agenda - A Future-Oriented Indicator Analysis for the EU-Countries|"Future-orientation or innovativeness is a leading credo in the EUâ€™s economic policy agenda of the 21 st century. It started in the year 2000 with the Lisbon Agenda, the first 10 years plan in which Europe should have become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economic region in the world. And, it continued in 2010 with the second 10 years framework program ""EU 2020"" which again is concentrating on research and innovations in the technological, but also in the social (political) and ecological field. The evolving quantitative and qualitative effects summarize under the strategy of ""smart, inclusive and sustainable growth"" (European Union, 2010). The aim of our study is to deal with these grand European visions and to focus on the ""emerging future"" of the EU countries. How do the EU member states handle their economic future? Does there exist a certain pattern of future-orientation? Can specific similarities or dissimilarities between the single countries be observed and satisfactorily explained? To give an answer to these questions we use an empirical indicator approach combined with cluster analysis. This approach, however, has to be based on a specific model of future-orientation or economic development. Such a model determines the theoretical scaffold of the study and provides the necessary ingredients for an empirical application. In our study we will use ""Comprehensive Neo-Schumpeterian Economics"" (CNSE) as an analytical framework (Hanusch and Pyka, 2007a). This approach is based (a) on the principle of innovation as the main driving force and the engine of development coupled (b) with the notion of future-orientation penetrating all spheres of socio-economic life in developed as well as in developing countries."
B52|On the Patterns of Behaviour in Digitalized Societies|"The study intends (1) to look at the importance of individual rationality as the main principle of economic behaviour, incorporated best in the concept of ""homo oeconomicus"". (2) to show how the third technological revolution, the ""digitalization of society"", may transform individual behaviour in the three pillars of an economic system (real, financial, public). One major achievement of main stream economics of Western style is the ""homo oeconomicus"". Behind this concept stands the idea of rational man relevant for all parts in economic systems. It allows a consequent application of profit and efficiency maximizing in the real and financial sector and of vote and utility maximization in the public sector as agents' behaviour. Psychology, sociology, behaviourism, anthropology are strictly against the idea of the ""homo oeconomicus"". Evolutionary and Neo-Schumpeterian Economics also claim that it is wrong because it doesnâ€™t allow to include uncertainty considerations which are a condition sine-qua-non for innovation, change and prosperity. But, is this concept completely wrong? Or is it perhaps relevant for specific parts of an economic system, if they develop within the process of digital revolution? These are the questions which will be tackled in the paper. The analysis will follow a comprehensive approach, looking at the three institutional pillars of an economy, the financial, the real and the public sector trying to work out the effects of digitalization on the patterns of behaviour. All in all, the effects of digitalization can be summarized as follows: In the financial pillar it modifies the culture of doing business from ""symbiotic capitalism"" to ""financial capitalism"" with prevailing olympic rationality. In the industrial pillar it induces changes from short term maximizing ""managerial capitalism"" to a long term oriented ""entrepreneurial capitalism"". In the public pillar it may open ways to institutional change, at least partially, from a ""bureaucratic tax state"" to a system of ""social capitalism"" with high potentials for enabling individual creativity and resilience capabilities."
B52|Revolutionary Developments in the World Economy|"In the last decades the world changed dramatically. From a global point of view three disruptive processes are on their way which can be called revolutionary: a political, a technological and an economic revolution. This paper aims to give an overview when and how these movements started what the essence of these processes is and with which consequences we will have to deal with in the future. Concerning the political revolution the year 1990 can be characterized as a historical landmark because of two reasons: At first, it finished with orthodox communism as it was practiced primarily in the former Soviet Union. Secondly, this year created a new illusion which is described at its best by Francis Fukuyama in his book ""The End of History"" (1990). The Western form of a liberal representative democracy had overruled communism as its most important counterpart and it promised to stay forever as a political system when combined with a capitalistic market economy. That means in last consequence ""the end of history"". The paper shows how this illusive thinking has been demolished in the last twenty years and in which way a new regime of political thinking, the ""autocratic system"" of political decision making, is gaining relevance worldwide in developed as well as in developing countries. Starting in China and spreading over to other countries in the second half of the last century it now even reached countries in Europe which after 1990 tried to install a liberal representative democracy with great empathy, for instance Russia, Hungary, the Czech Republic and recently also Poland. The paper tries to grasp this process, to find answers why the attractiveness of the democratic ideal is fading away in these days and to show which consequences this political transformation process might have for the global economy. The last two decades of the 20 th century set off a third great wave of technological invention and disruptive innovation, the ""digital revolution"". Radical advances in computing-, information- and communication-technology may deliver a similar mixture of transformation as societies had experienced in the centuries before, getting acquainted to the steam engine, electricity, the telegraph and telephone for instance. The larger part of economists and scientists today sticks to the opinion that this new technological revolution will change fundamentally essential characteristics of the three pillars which constitute a socio-economic system: the financial, the public and the real sector. The paper intends to show how each of these pillars are already affected by the eruptive development of digitalization and how this process may go on in the future with all its social, economic and institutional consequences. If the 1990â€™s are taken as a historical landmark for fundamental changes in the world, one miraculous development has to be stressed as most important: The economic ""catching up"" process of the developing world, especially in those emerging countries called the BRICS group consisting of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. In the last 20 years these nationsâ€™ growth has far outpaced that of the US and the EU, with China already having become the second largest economy in the world. The paper will show how this growth phenomenon already changed fundamentally the structure of the world economy and which consequences can be expected in the future, if a country like China will be successful in combining elements of the political and the technological revolution in its development strategy. This scenario and the economic system standing behind may be called ""state capitalism"" and it is thoroughly in conflict with what is named as ""entrepreneurial capitalism"", concretized at its best in the US and its Silicon Valley. If we go back to Schumpeter, the Silicon Valley example can be pictured as a realistic portrait of what he had in mind in his 1912 book (The Theory of Economic Development). Whereas the Chinese kind of forming the countryâ€™s development process and its innovation culture seems to be more in accordance with the Schumpeter book of 1942 (Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy). The paper will at the end shortly focus on this interesting issue, which might be called a ""Schumpeterian Battle of Systems"", namely ""Entrepreneurial Capitalism"" against ""State Capitalism"". Perhaps, this antagonism might shape the development of the world economy in the coming decades of the 21 st century more than any other event."
B52|Variety of Future-Orientation: The Case of G-19 Countries|"In modern growth or development theory innovation is a crucial factor which pushes the dynamics of an economy and determines its success in the future. Out of innovations, created in the presence, the potentials for the future of a country are prepared, deciding how its economic fitness and competitiveness will emerge. So, future-orientation is in a natural way connected with innovativeness of a firm, a region or a country and shapes the strength and the specifics of the process of development. Our study is focusing on the group of G-19 countries with respect to their future-orientation shaped and characterized by innovation and the underlying processes of creating and distributing novelties. This group is an economic, financial and political forum which consists of 19 major economies, advanced and developing ones, allocated in Asia, Europe, Euro-Asia, North and South America, The Middle East and Oceania. If you add the European Union you get the G-20 group which is the main economic council of wealthy nations nowadays. The concept of future-orientation, defined by innovativeness, gets its analytical and empirical relevance when it is placed and investigated within a specific development model. Such a model determines the theoretical basis of the study and provides the necessary ingredients for an empirical application. In our study we will use ""Comprehensive Neo-Schumpeterian Economics"" (CNSE) as an analytical framework (Hanusch and Pyka, 2007a). This approach is based (a) on the principle of innovation as the main driving force and the engine of development coupled b) with the notion of future-orientation penetrating all spheres of socio-economic life in developed as well as in developing countries. Based on the concept of CNSE the central aim of our study is to gain new insights and findings concerning the variety of future-orientation of the G-19 countries. For that purpose we use an empirical indicator approach which (a) tries to bring the notion of future-orientation on a concrete basis by using indicators embedded in the framework of CNSE; (b) investigates patterns of similarities in the set of indicators; (c) shows how these patterns look like by applying cluster analysis; (d) draws some conclusions from the patterns concerning the status and variety of future-orientation in the group of G-19 countries."
B52|Social capital, institutions and policymaking|Economic processes, consisting of interactions between human beings, exploit the social capital of persons endowed with specific cultures, identities and education. By taking into account this complexity, the authors focus on the role of institutions and policymaking in the building of social capital and its relevance to the fulfilment of their objectives. Social capital, however, is elusive and has several dimensions with which to interpret its multifaceted functions in economics and society. The authors cannot forget that social capital is sometimes even undesirable for society, for instance when unethically used. Even so, it is widely accepted that social capital has stable and positive effects.
B52|Has Creative Destruction become more Destructive?|Schumpeter’s concept of creative destruction as the engine of capitalist development is well-known. However, that the destructive part of creative destruction is a social and economic cost and therefore biases our estimate of the impact of the innovation on GDP is hardly acknowledged, with the notable exception of Witt (1996. “Innovations, Externalities and the Problem of Economic Progress.” Public Choice 89:113–30). Admittedly, during the First and Second Industrial Revolutions the magnitude of the destructive component of innovation was no doubt small compared to the net value added to GDP. However, we conjecture that recently the destructive component of innovations has increased relative to the size of the creative component as the new technologies are often creating products which are close substitutes for the ones they replace whose value depreciates substantially in the process of destruction. Consequently, the contribution of recent innovations to GDP is likely upwardly biased. This note calls for further research in innovation economics in order to measure and decompose the effects of innovations into their creative and destructive components in order to provide improved estimates of their contribution to GDP and to employment.
B52|Une approche transactionnelle des démarches d’élaboration participative d’indicateurs sociétaux. La méthode du Conseil de l’Europe|This article is dedicated to innovative approaches regarding association of citizens in the production of alternative indicators. It is based on an experimentation of the methodology proposed by the Council of Europe which is aimed at developing well-being indicators in a participatory way to qualify well-being and societal progress. The article proposes an analytical shaping of this approach, and more generally of the efforts to involve citizens in indicators production processes. Our framework, which can be described as transactional, is based on American pragmatism, especially on J. Dewey?s works. Such an approach invites to pay attention on the communicative processes which underlie the formation of values. This implies to reconsider the nature of the data used to understand well-being and to develop indicators. The article also focuses on structuring phenomena that can affect the participatory processes. JEL Codes?: A13, B41, B52, I31, Z13
B52|Firm growth and knowledge flows: comparative analysis between defence and civil areas|In this paper, we seek to understand how technological duality influences the growth of companies. Since the end of the Cold War, defense budgets are strongly discussed. In this context, the dual policy (convergence between civil and military areas) is presented as an optimization strategy of the defense budgets. Nevertheless, the 1990s are also characterized by a wave of defense restructuring in the United States around large private companies. Therefore, we choose to study the results of duality for these groups as they are more at stake. In order to do so, we use structural analysis tools as a way of understanding duality as the relocation of defense activities in the?innovation system center. As a result, we show that the duality of defense activities is specific because it has an opposite effect on centrality of civil activities on firms? growth. JEL Codes: B52, C55, L64, O33, O51
B52|Historia e institucionalidad en la minería colombiana|El presente documento comprende una revisión de la historia y consolidación de la actividad minera en Colombia y su institucionalidad desde los primeros años de la colonia hasta la primera década del siglo XXI. Así, se desarrolla una revisión crítica del cambio de las formas sociales de producción y el rol del Estado colombiano en la regulación de esta actividad económica, incluidos los cambios en los derechos de propiedad del subsuelo desde los primeros esfuerzos de consolidación de un proyecto político independentista. Se incorporan elementos historiográficos para facilitar la lectura de un periodo tan amplio entre los cuales se destacan: el periodo colonial, periodo de las primeras repúblicas, industrialización clásica, la mineralización dirigida por el Estado (1973-1991), una transición y la apertura minera (2001-2013). El artículo cuestiona la veracidad histórica de la existencia de un paradigma de desarrollo a partir de una vocación minera y pone en evidencia la permanencia de los lazos y formas institucionales coloniales en la consolidación del sector así como también la incapacidad de gestionar algunos aspectos centrales de la actividad económica en mención.
B52|La crisis del euro en perspectiva|Este artículo analiza la integración monetaria europea, los determinantes estructurales y los elementos disfuncionales de las instituciones de la Unión. Además, revisa dos lecturas que fallan al interpretar los acontecimientos: una interpretación ideológica que ve en la integración un proceso de convergencia que no se debe interferir, y una visión idealista que sostiene que la integración debe prevalecer sobre toda contradicción generada a nivel institucional. Su combinación sirvió para justificar las intervenciones poscrisis (la austeridad) y la construcción institucional posterior, que agravaron la inestabilidad macroeconómica en Europa.
B52|Economia Pluralista para Enfrentar Crisis Contemporanea<BR>[Pluralist Economics to Confront Recent Crisis]|Despite the deep impact of the 2008s Great Recession, Department of Economics around the world keep teaching the neoclassical paradigm as it nothing happened. Economics´ teaching, especially at the undergraduate level, does not leave room for a pluralist background, although somewhat similar process happens at the graduate level. Global dominance of approaches market oriented, based on an individualistic ontology, a methodological deductivism and the massive use of mathematical models since the last three decades, have been closing the possibilities of different approaches. In this essay, possible causes behind this phenomenon are explored, and several proposals are presented about how a more integral and plural Microeconomics could be taught, and a more grounded Macroeconomics involved with today´s problems, and a development theory that does not give up with the theoretical richness of the Latin American traditions, could be also presented to students. The main criteria would be to endow our graduates with a more versatile vision about economic thought and economic theory, aiming toward the opening of new and creative approaches about public policies that would be able to solve our structural problems. Several concrete suggestions are offered regarding curriculums and books, and mechanism to overcome the Procrustean bed that incorporates the teaching of the dominant approach only. At the end, we would have creative professionals and conscious about the myriad of possibilities that a pluralist approach of economics science brings about, and new avenues of creative ideas will be opened to implement such policies. This proposal implies a more audacious curriculum and less timid toward the critique of the dominant cathedral of the main current of thought in Economics.
B52|Evolutionary efficiency in economic systems: A proposal|The paper proposes an efficiency criterion for evolving economic systems. Drawing on the idea that these systems develop from the interconnected actions of intentional creative agents (which invent and try to carry out action plans), the suggested criterion at a micro level could be state as follows: a system is efficient (from a micro evolutionary perspective) if agents’ intentional and hierarchical (open) goals are actualized through action. Thus, intentionality leads to facts and goals are reached. The evolutionary efficiency criterion proposed in the paper links the intended goals of heterogeneous agents and the performance of the system they are involved.
B52|Agent-based computational models– a formal heuristic for institutionalist pattern modelling?|"Institutionalist economists have always been criticizing the neoclassical way of studying the economy, especially because of its obsession to a very strict and flawed formalism. This formalism receives critique also from advocates of agent-based computational economic (ACE) models. The criticism seems to be similar to that of institutional economists. Although some authors consider ACE models to belong to a completely new way of thinking about economics, many concepts of ACE have been anticipated by institutionalists: Although using a different vocabulary, ACE proponents speak about cumulative causation, realistic agents, explanatory models, dynamic relations among individuals and the necessity to see the economy as an systemic whole rather than from an atomistic perspective. Consequently, the emergence of the ACE framework may not be left unconsidered by institutionalist economists. This paper investigates the consistency of ACE models with the institutionalist research program as defined by Myrdal, Wilber and Harrison and other original institutionalists and discusses whether ACE models can be a useful heuristic for institutionalist ""pattern modelling"". I study the ability of ACE models to provide a holistic, systemic and evolutionary picture of the economy, the conception of agents in ACE models, and ask whether they can help to understand the social stratification of a society with its power relations. I also compare ACE models with earlier attempts to formalize institutionalist analysis, e.g. by Bush and Elsner (Theory of Institutional Change), Hayden (Social-­Fabric-Matrix) or Radzicki (System Dynamics).<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>"
B52|Teilen, Sharing 1 und Sharing 2: die Sharing Economy im Licht theoretischer Zugänge|This article elaborates on theoretical approaches to the concept of sharing. It explicates both the contribution and limitations of services approaches and property rights theory for the understanding of the sharing economy. The article provides reasons for the differentiation between a commercial and noncommercial sharing economy and discusses the effects of possible impulses of the sharing economy on the understanding of economic action and its organizational structures. Der Artikel geht theoretischen Zugängen zum Sharing-Begriff nach. Er erläutert den Beitrag, aber auch die Grenzen von Dienstleistungstheorie und Property-Rights-Theorie für das Verständnis der Sharing Economy. Gründe für die Unterscheidung zwischen kommerzieller und nichtkommerzieller Sharing Economy werden dargelegt sowie mögliche Impulse der Sharing Economy für Änderungen im Verständnis wirtschaftlichen Handels und seiner Organisationsformen erörtert.
B52|Endogenous evolution of heterogeneous consumers preferences: Multistability and coexistence between groups|We propose an exchange economy evolutionary model with agents heterogeneous in the structure of preferences. Assuming that the share updating mechanism is non-monotone in the calorie intake, we find multistability phenomena involving equilibria characterized by the coexistence of heterogeneous agents.
B52|A Darwinian theory of institutional evolution two centuries before Darwin?|How effective institutions come about and how they change are fundamental questions for economics and social science more generally. We show that these questions were central in the deliberations of lawyers in 17th century England, a critical historical juncture that has motivated important institutional theories. We argue that the lawyers held a conceptualization of institutional development that foreshadowed many elements of Darwinism, more than two centuries before Darwin’s great contributions. To this end, we first identify a set of features characteristic of Darwinian evolutionary social-science theories. We then match the lawyers’ own words to these features, revealing the many congruities between a Darwinian approach and the lawyers’ evolutionary model of institutional construction and change. Finally, we analyze the normative conclusions on institutional development that the lawyers drew from their evolutionary analysis.
B52|Regional co-evolution of firm population, innovation and public research? Evidence from the West German laser industry|We trace the co-evolution of regional firm population sizes, private-sector patenting and public research in German laser research and manufacturing for over 40 years from the emergence of the industry to the mid-2000s. Qualitative as well as quantitative evidence suggests a co-evolutionary process of mutual interdependence rather than a unidirectional effect of public research on private-sector activities.
B52|Diversity of firm sizes, complexity, and industry structure in the Chinese economy|Among the phenomena in economics that are not yet well-understood is the fat-tailed (power-law) distribution of firm sizes in the world's economies. In the present paper we discuss different mechanisms suggested in the literature to explain this distribution of firm sizes. The paper uses the China Industrial Enterprises Database to study the distribution (firm size in terms of the number of employees, capital, and gross profit) for the provinces of China for the years 1998–2008. We estimate the power-law distribution and confirm its plausibility using the KS test and the log-likelihood ratio vs. lognormal and exponential distributions. The analysis on regional levels allows an assessment of regional effects on differences in the distribution; we discuss possible explanations for the observed patterns in the light of the recent regional economic development and the economic reforms in the PRC.
B52|Complexity paths in neo-Schumpeterian evolutionary economics, structural change and development policies|Recently, several authors of evolutionary and neo-Schumpeterian economics have identified in complex systems a common framework for accounting for a range of attributes they have been claiming are present in economic systems: path-dependence, positive feedbacks, micro-heterogeneity, emergent properties, and self-organization. Complexity seems to be broad enough to accommodate very different positions and it has been seen as a unifying approach for evolutionary and neo-Schumpeterian streams. This pluralism is reflected in the fact that many authors that draw upon complexity ideas from neo-Schumpeterian evolutionary theory, make contrasting policy recommendations in terms of if it should be vertical or horizontal or if it should promote bottom-up process or direct interventions. This is possible because the complexity approach has not yet been fully developed and its limits are still somewhat blurred. In this paper, we propose to explore this idea by identifying the theoretical backgrounds and the policy recommendations of different groups of neo-Schumpeterian evolutionary authors. We propose that backgrounds focused on different attributes of complexity lead to different development policies recommendations.
B52|Formal definitions of information and knowledge and their role in growth through structural change|The article provides a way to quantify the role of information and knowledge in growth through structural adjustments. The more is known about environmental patterns, the more growth can be obtained by redistributing resources accordingly among the evolving sectors (e.g. bet-hedging). Formal equations show that the amount of information about the environmental pattern is directly linked to the growth potential. This can be quantified by treating both information and knowledge formally through metrics like Shannon's mutual information and algorithmic Kolmogorov complexity from information theory and computer science. These mathematical metrics emerge naturally from our evolutionary equations. As such, information becomes a quantifiable ingredient of growth. The policy mechanism to convert information and knowledge into growth is structural adjustment. The presented approach is applied to the empirical case of U.S. export to showcase how information converts into growth potential.
B52|Resilience in the European Union: the effect of the 2008 crisis on the ability of regions in Europe to develop new industrial specializations|This article adopts an evolutionary framework to the study of industrial resilience. We present a study on European regions and assess the extent to which the capacity of their economies to develop new industrial specializations is affected by the global economic crisis of 2008. We compare levels of industry entry in European regions in the period 2004–2008 and 2008–2012, i.e. before and after a major economic disturbance. Resilient regions are defined as regions that show high entry levels or even increase their entry levels after the shock. Related and unrelated variety exhibit a positive effect on regional resilience, especially on the entry of knowledge-intensive industries after the shock.
B52|Towards a theory of regional diversification|This paper aims to develop a theoretical framework on regional diversification. Combining insights from the evolutionary economic geography literature and the transition literature, we argue that a theory of regional diversification should build on the current understanding of conditions for related diversification but additionally start to tackle processes of unrelated diversification by accounting for (1) the role of agency (institutional entrepreneurship) and the dynamic interplay between agency and context; (2) enabling and constraining factors at various spatial scales. We propose a typology of four regional diversification processes by cross-tabulating related versus unrelated diversification with niche creation versus regime adoption.
B52|Industrial Diversification in Europe: The Differentiated Role of Relatedness| There is increasing interest in the drivers of industrial diversification, and how these depend on economic and industry structures. This article contributes to this line of inquiry by analyzing the role of industry relatedness in explaining variations in industry diversification, measured as the entry of new industry specializations, across 173 European regions during the period 2004–2012. First, we show that there are significant differences across regions in Europe in terms of industrial diversification. Second, we provide robust evidence showing that the probability that a new industry specialization develops in a region is positively associated with the new industry’s relatedness to the region’s current industries. Third, a novel finding is that the influence of relatedness on the probability of new industrial specializations depends on innovation capacity of a region. We find that relatedness is a more important driver of diversification in regions with a weaker innovation capacity. The effect of relatedness appears to decrease monotonically as the innovation capacity of a regional economy increases. This is consistent with the argument that high innovation capacity allows an economy to break from its past and to develop, for the economy, truly new industry specializations. We infer from this that innovation capacity is a critical factor for economic resilience and diversification capacity.
B52|Dinámicas epigenéticas y su impacto sobre el territorio: el caso del cooperativismo vasco|This article deals with the study of organizational dynamics derived from adaptation to turbulent environments, which in the context of this article are labelled epigenetic economic dynamics. Our goal is to study how firms and territories adapt to very rapid and significant changes in their respective environments. The article places emphasis on the decisionmaking routine as a vehicle to achieve this adaptation. The article focuses on the study of decision-making processes in three major industrial cooperative groups located in the Basque Country. The paper offers a discussion about the consequences of such dynamics not only for the companies themselves but also for the territory in which they are located, as well as about the importance of timing in decision-making.
B52|Rethinking Economic Evolution|Modern economies never come to rest. From institutions to activities of production, trade, and consumption, everything is locked in processes of perpetual transformation – and so are our daily lives. Why and how do such transformations occur? What can economic theory tell us about these changes and where they might lead? Ulrich Witt’s book discusses why evolutionary concepts are necessary to answer such questions. While economic evolution is in many respects unique, it nonetheless needs to be seen within the broader context of natural evolution. By exploring this complex relationship, Rethinking Economic Evolution demonstrates the significance of an evolutionary economic theory.
B52|Les droits et libertés fondamentaux à l'épreuve de L'efficacité économique: une application à La politique de la concurrence|The increasing influence of economic analysis on case law, even in matters of constitutional litigation, raises the issue of its impacts on fundamental rights and liberties. Within the European Union competition law field, the implementation of the “more-economic approach” (named the effects-based approach) and the growing use of negotiated practices (often grounded on procedural efficiency concerns) provide us with a striking example of how the decisional practice may not only challenge property rights and economic freedoms but also impair the judicial control. This example leads us to interrogate the economic treatment of these two fundamental rights. We insist on the diversity of the theoretical approaches, confronting the economic analysis of law with old institutionalism and Austrian economics.
B52|Institutions as Emergent Phenomena: Redefining Downward Causation|The concept of emergence is frequently used in the social sciences in order to characterize social institutions. Nevertheless, philosophy of mind argues that the idea of emergence is problematic because it encompasses the dubious notion of downward causation, i.e. the fact that an entity at a given ontological level might have a causal influence on lower level entities. This work shows that although it is problematic in some fields, emergence is an ontological feature of the social world. In order to justify this point of view and to show how institutions relate to individuals' actions, we define an institution as an exogenous device, which enables us to show that the relationship between institution and individual actions is not only a causal one but also an intersubjective and a constitutive one.
B52|Quality of employment regimes and diversity of emerging countries|Emerging countries and their leaders, the BRICS, can be revisited with an institutionalist approach enabling a better recognition of their diversity. Focusing on the composition of their labour nexus, this paper offers to question the category formed by these countries by studying their variety of quality of employment regimes. Two interesting results came out from this study using a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and a Mixed Clustering (MC) break two institutional dimensions into fourteen indicators. (1) Four specific quality of employment regimes appear, illustrating their heterogeneity and the weakness of this category. (2) The BRICS appear notably scattered over some socio-economic aspects of each leader. Far from composing a coherent and independent regime, BRICS countries dispersion can be explained by a specific combination of socio-economic and institutional factors to each one of them.
B52|Positive collaboration: Factors and mechanisms of evolution|It is proposed in the article to distinguish between two types of collaboration: a positive (not directed against third parties) and a negative one. I consider the hypothesis that in the process of social development, transaction costs ratio of the three main types of coordination?— competition, power, and collaboration?— is changing in favor of the latter. The mechanisms responsible for the implementation of this tendency are studied, and an attempt to explain its nonmonotonicity is made. It is shown that the strengthening role of positive collaboration is largely explained by cultural changes: the enhance of tolerance culture, the spread of cosmopolitanism and altruism, increasing planning horizon as well as trust radius. I demonstrate the importance of the institutions of positive collaboration in the process of catching-up development; it is shown that shock reforms could lead to the formation of negative collaboration mechanisms. For the further development of these ideas, a program of interdisciplinary researches is outlined.
B52|Understanding long run economic development as an evolutionary process|A broad sketch of an evolutionary theory of long run economic development is presented in this article, considering the basic processes and structures involved. The problematic orientation of Neoclassical growth theory is discussed, pointing out its limited macroeconomic perspective, the weak consideration of technological change and of demand, the lack of attention to institutional settings. An explanation of economic development has to consider the key role of innovation and the process of creative destruction, in the context of Schumpeterian insights and evolutionary perspectives. I argue that economists need to consider three somewhat separate bodies of research on economic development. One is the evolutionary analysis that follows Schumpeter. A second is the research on technological advance as an evolutionary process. The third is focused on institutions and how they mold the development process, and how they themselves evolve. Moreover, the role of demand in shaping growth dynamics and business cycles—stressed by Keynes and post-Keynesian approaches—has to be integrated in such evolutionary perspectives in ways that are only now starting to emerge.

B52|Monitoring, endogenous comparative advantage, and immigration|We propose a theory of free movement of goods and labor between two economies in the presence of moral hazard. Each country produces two final goods where the productive efforts of workers cannot be perfectly observed, or verified only in the complex industry. We show that national institutional quality and the system of the early childhood care and education determine the pattern of international trade. However, individuals’ decisions to emigrate depend only on the national institutional quality, where the country with more developed institutions serves as the host country of immigrants. We conclude that international labor movement promotes international trade. JEL classification: B52, I21, F10, F16, F22, J24. Copyright Qirjo. 2015
B52|The Schumpeter–Hilferding Nexus|The paper interprets certain parts of Joseph Schumpeter’s oeuvre in association with the writings of Rudolf Hilferding. For instance, we show that Hilferding’s conception of economic development has striking similarities with Schumpeter’s respective thesis. Also, Hilferding expressed the thesis that ‘the size and technical equipment of the monopolistic combination ensure its superiority’ which has striking similarities with the so-called Schumpeterian Hypothesis. Furthermore, Hilferding made a distinction between the entrepreneur who is in charge of the use of capital in production and the capitalist who advances his capital and bears the risk. There, Hilferding identified another personality who has similar tasks to those of an innovative manager. It is exactly this separation of roles which is at the core of Schumpeter’s famous analysis. Moreover, regarding credit, for both theoreticians, it is determined by its demand side i.e. creation of credit money resulting from the demand for investment funds and is indispensable for the functioning of capitalism. In this context, their views on economic instability have further similarities, since for both theorists, development presupposes an innovation, which enables the firm to earn an extra profit and stimulates the demand for credit in order to finance new investments through credit creation. As for socialism, Hilferding regarded it as the organization of production not by and for the benefit of capitalist magnates but by and for society as a whole, whereas for Schumpeter socialism is an institutional arrangement that vests the management of the productive forces with some public authority. Finally, regarding imperialism, Schumpeter differentiated himself from Hilferding and considered it to be an ‘old’ inheritance from pre-modern capitalist eras, which was bound to disappear contrarily to Hilferding, who regarded imperialism as a ‘new’, characteristic of capitalism in its ‘latest’ stage. In brief, some of Schumpeter’s ideas are probably not quite as unique as they appeared to be, since many of them could be described as a reworking of Hilferding’s views. Apparently, Schumpeter’s originality is, at least partly, based on the approaches on which he built his oeuvre. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015
B52|Joseph Schumpeter and Simon Kuznets: comparing their evolutionary economic approaches to business cycles and economic growth|The connections between the work of Simon Kuznets and Joseph Schumpeter are discussed from a history of economic thought perspective. First, their broad perspectives on economic evolution are compared and contrasted. It is argued that Kuznets assigned a greater role for institutional change in economic evolution and he had a greater interest in the distribution of income and how it changes with economic development. Second, Kuznets’ controversial review of Schumpeter’s two volume book, Business Cycles, is reassessed. This leads directly to discussion of their differing methodological approaches. Third, their respective views on the determination of economic growth are compared and it is argued that Kuznets’ laid a stronger foundation for future neo-Schumpeterian research on economic growth. The paper concludes with some discussion of how evolutionary economists using modern perspectives, such as ’micro-meso-macro’, can draw upon the works of these great economists to provide an empirical methodology that can be used to explain economic growth and its fluctuation.

B52|Joseph Schumpeter and John Kenneth Galbraith: two sides of the same coin?|Joseph Schumpeter and John Kenneth Galbraith were two of the most influential scholars of the previous century addressing the most fundamental questions confronting society—what is the nature of economy and how is it shaping society? At the heart of their work was a concern about the gap between what they perceived to be the standard models in economics and the evolution of the actual economy. In particular, this meant abandoning the standard models of neoclassical economics and instead focusing on what both perceived to be an evolution towards a more managed economy. The purpose of this paper is to explain the relationship between the works of Schumpeter and Galbraith. Perhaps one of the enduring lessons that bonded Schumpeter and Galbraith is their keen focus on how the economy was evolving over time, and with it, the institutional landscape, that carried with it huge implications for public policy.

B52|Sunk costs and the speed of market selection|This paper studies the influence of sunk costs on industry evolution using the stylized pure selection model developed by Metcalfe. It is shown that sunk costs influence industry dynamics by reducing the speed of the replicator dynamics of competitive selection. Based on the theoretical model, we argue that sunk costs should lead to a reduction of market share reallocation dynamics and a larger share of stable firms. We validate these predictions empirically, finding that higher-sunk-cost industries have a larger share of stable firms and display lower market share dynamics. The result has practical implications for the interpretation of productivity decompositions. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015
B52|Is the psychology of high profits detrimental to industrial renewal? Experimental evidence for the theory of transformation pressure|The theory of transformation pressure maintains, by reference to cognitive and emotional factors, that productivity and innovation are stimulated by a decline in actual profits. In periods of increasing profits, firms governed by historical relativism, the peak-end rule and overconfidence will opt for the status quo. In the following profit recession, actors become more alert, calculating and creative, favoring a transformation, especially if they fear that the survival of the firm is at stake. The theory of transformation pressure was tested by a within-subjects experiment where undergraduate students in macroeconomics acted as managers for an established company. The role play sheds light on the students’ investment strategy choices and underlying psychological perceptions under varying profit conditions. The theory was only partly confirmed by the experiment. There are arguments in industrial economics, psychology and neuroscience for a qualified theory of transformation pressure. Productivity is enhanced by moderate pressure or by periodic shifts between hard pressure and good opportunity. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015
B52|Financing the Capital Development of the Economy: A Keynes-Schumpeter-Minsky Synthesis|"This paper discusses the role that finance plays in promoting the capital development of the economy, with particular emphasis on the current situation of the United States and the United Kingdom. We define both ""finance"" and ""capital development"" very broadly. We begin with the observation that the financial system evolved over the postwar period, from one in which closely regulated and chartered commercial banks were dominant to one in which financial markets dominate the system. Over this period, the financial system grew rapidly relative to the nonfinancial sector, rising from about 10 percent of value added and a 10 percent share of corporate profits to 20 percent of value added and 40 percent of corporate profits in the United States. To a large degree, this was because finance, instead of financing the capital development of the economy, was financing itself. At the same time, the capital development of the economy suffered perceptibly. If we apply a broad definition--to include technological advances, rising labor productivity, public and private infrastructure, innovations, and the advance of human knowledge--the rate of growth of capacity has slowed. The past quarter century witnessed the greatest explosion of financial innovation the world had ever seen. Financial fragility grew until the economy collapsed into the global financial crisis. At the same time, we saw that much (or even most) of the financial innovation was directed outside the sphere of production--to complex financial instruments related to securitized mortgages, to commodities futures, and to a range of other financial derivatives. Unlike J. A. Schumpeter, Hyman Minsky did not see the banker merely as the ephor of capitalism, but as its key source of instability. Furthermore, due to ""financialisation of the real economy,"" the picture is not simply one of runaway finance and an investment-starved real economy, but one where the real economy itself has retreated from funding investment opportunities and is instead either hoarding cash or using corporate profits for speculative investments such as share buybacks. As we will argue, financialization is rooted in predation; in Matt Taibbi's famous phrase, Wall Street behaves like a giant, blood-sucking ""vampire squid."" In this paper we will investigate financial reforms as well as other government policy that is necessary to promote the capital development of the economy, paying particular attention to increasing funding of the innovation process. For that reason, we will look not only to Minsky's ideas on the financial system, but also to Schumpeter's views on financing innovation."
B52|Towards an Evolutionary Perspective on Regional Resilience| Boschma R. Towards an evolutionary perspective on regional resilience, Regional Studies. This paper proposes an evolutionary perspective on regional resilience. It conceptualizes resilience not just as the ability of a region to accommodate shocks, but extends it to the long-term ability of regions to develop new growth paths. A comprehensive view on regional resilience is proposed in which history is key to understand how regions develop new growth paths, and in which industrial, network and institutional dimensions of resilience come together. Resilient regions are capable of overcoming a trade-off between adaptation and adaptability, as embodied in related and unrelated variety, loosely coupled networks and loosely coherent institutional structures.
B52|Proximity and Innovation: From Statics to Dynamics| B alland P.-A., B oschma R. and F renken K. Proximity and innovation: from statics to dynamics, Regional Studies . Despite theoretical and empirical advances, the proximity framework has remained essentially static. A dynamic extension of the proximity framework is proposed that accounts for co-evolutionary dynamics between knowledge networking and proximity. For each proximity dimension, how proximities might increase over time as a result of past knowledge ties is described. These dynamics are captured through the processes of learning (cognitive proximity), integration (organizational proximity), decoupling (social proximity), institutionalization (institutional proximity), and agglomeration (geographical proximity). The paper ends with a discussion of several avenues for future research on the dynamics of knowledge networking and proximity.

B52|Some Reflections on Popper's approach to Rationality and its implications for the Social Sciences<BR>[Algunas reflexiones acerca del enfoque popperiano sobre la racionalidad y sus implicaciones para las ciencias sociales]|There are two different notions of human rationality in Popper´s work: the notion that stems from his evolutionary theory of knowledge and learning (PTKL), and the notion embodied in his methodological proposal for the social sciences known as `Situational Analysis´ (SA). This essay provides an in-depth critical analysis of the relation between these two approaches and its implications for the social sciences. In particular, we focus on (i) the difference between PTKL and both the `objectivist´ and `subjectivist´ version of SA, (ii) Schumpeter´s distinction between the `rationality of the observer´ and the `rationality in the observed´, and (iii) Hayek´s arguments about the nature of the `facts´ of the social sciences.

B52|Research joint ventures in an R&D driven market with evolving consumer preferences: An evolutionary multi-agent based modelling approach|RD collaborations have increasingly attracted the attention of both academic and business circles in the last couple of decades. Several empirical studies have concentrated on the firms incentives to participate in these collaborations. This paper presents an alternative approach to RD collaborations using an evolutionary, multi-agent based and sector-level RD model. The model will firstly be used to simulate the evolution of an RD driven market composed of profit-driven firms and boundedly rational consumers. Next, frequently discussed research questions in the relevant empirical literature will be explored. This modelling exercise will extend beyond a basic confirmation/rejection of these research questions by showing that the way a firm is defined as an RD collaborator has a significant effect on research results.
B52|How much does economic crisis affect sustainability transitions? a social network analysis of the Italian biofuel sector|The present paper investigates the impact of he current economic crisis on the process of sustainability transitions by exploring the case of a green niche, namely the biofuel sector. From a methodological point of view, we employ a social network analysis aimed at comparing the Italian biofuel niche in two different time periods, specifically before and during the crisis. Our findings provide evidence that biofuel actors are responding to the economic crisis by raising the degree of their knowledge exchange. At the same time, they are exhibiting a general scepticism about the future development of the niche, showing a lower level of expectations compared to that of 2007 (i.e. before the crisis). These results suggest that the economic crisis is concretely hindering the transition towards a biofuel-based regime by affecting the degree of maturity of the niche.

B52|Market vs. system failure as a rationale for EU regional policy? A critique from an evolutionary economic perspective|This paper reconsiders the economic explanation of EU regional policy from an evolutionary perspective. It contrasts the neoclassical equilibrium notions of market and government failure with the prevalent evolutionary neo-Schumpeterian and Austrian-Hayekian perceptions. Based on this comparison the paper criticises that neoclassical failure reasoning still prevails in non-equilibrium evolutionary economics when regional policy issues are examined. This is more than surprising since proponents of evolutionary economics usually view their approach as incompatible with its neoclassical counterpart. In addition, it is shown that this ?fallacy of failure thinking? even finds its continuation in the alternative concept of ?system failure? with which some evolutionary economists try to explain and legitimate regional policy interventions in local, regional or national innovation systems. The paper argues that in order to prevent the fruitful and more realistic evolutionary approach from undermining its own criticism of neoclassical economics and to create a consistent as well as objective evolutionary policy framework it is necessary to eliminate the equilibrium spirit from it. Finally, the paper delivers an alternative evolutionary explanation of EU regional policy which is able to overcome the theory-immanent contradiction of the hitherto evolutionary view on this subject. Building on the preceding remarks, policy implications for EU regional policy from a ?proper? evolutionary perspective are deduced.
B52|Goethe und das Papiergeld|"Goethes Faust II, genauer das erste Kapitel wurde vielfach als eine Geld- und Inflationstheorie gelesen. Obgleich darin viele Motive anklingen, die in der Erklärung des Geldes eine Rolle spielen, so ist es doch ein Missgriff, Goethe als ökonomische Autorität zu lesen. Allerdings stand er allerdings in regem Austausch mit zeitgenössischen Ökonomen, deren Erkenntnisse weitgehend vergessen wurden. Gerade darin finden sich viele Elemente für eine Theorie und Philosophie des Geldes. Im Text werden zahlreiche dieser Einsichten vorgestellt und im Kontext der Faust-Dichtung vertieft. Die Figur des Mephistopheles als des ""neuen"" Narren erweist sich dabei als wichtige Leitfigur für das Verständnis monetärer Prozesse jenseits der Vorurteile einer traditionellen Quantitätstheorie."
B52|The institutional underpinnings of the prospective euro adoption in Poland|This paper aims to assess both the explicit and implicit convergence criteria for Poland's possible membership in the Economic and Monetary Union, with special emphasis on institutional underpinnings of the country's prospects of adopting the euro. While the former set of criteria (embedded in the Maastricht Treaty) comprises fiscal and monetary indicators of nominal convergence, the latter highlight the resilience of a country to adverse asymmetric shocks and its ability to compete internationally, and point to the importance of labor mobility in particular and institutional quality in general as key shock-absorbing mechanisms and main drivers of a sustainable comparative advantage of a country. The paper focuses therefore on the evaluation of existing institutions and their evolution in Poland vis-à-vis the standards prevailing in the euro zone, as key determinants of the country's readiness to become an EMU member. The theoretical background of the assessment involved comprises two chief pillars: the optimum currency area theory (OCA) and the 'diversity of capitalism' (DoC) approach.
B52|Creative forces for entrepreneurship: The role of institutional change agents|The paper reviews the current discussion on institutional change and institutional entrepreneurship. Specifically, it focuses on institutional change agents, by which we mean individuals whose actions can be shown to have contributed to formal or informal institutional change, to the benefit of the wider economy or society as well as to themselves. It aims to explore their antecedents and behaviours, and the contingent factors contributing to institutional change, both intentionally and unintentionally. We find that the concept of institutional entrepreneurship does not provide an adequate conceptual underpinning for incorporating human agency into institutionalised theory. We therefore argue that a focus on institutional change agents may be more productive. Whilst institutional theory recognises the impact of institutions on entrepreneurs and individuals, this paper draws attention to the role of human agency for institutional change. Institutional change can happen intentionally and as an unintended by-product of entrepreneurial or organisational 'path-dependent' behaviour. The implication of this is that it is not only intentional behaviour which contributes to institutional change, but rather any entrepreneurial behaviour which implicitly or explicitly questions existing institutions. Thus, the paper adds to the current debate on institutional entrepreneurship.
B52|Agent-based modeling for decision making in economics under uncertainty|Ever since the emergence of economics as a distinct scientific discipline, policy makers have turned to economic models to guide policy interventions. If policy makers seek to enhance growth of an open capitalist economy, they have to take into account, firstly, the uncertainties, inefficiencies, and market failures faced by the agents in the economy, and, secondly, the activities, network structure, and interactions in the innovation and production system. The authors discuss ins-and-outs of developing and using (encompassing and empirically calibrated) agent-based models for (i) abductive theorizing about causes for empirical realities, and (ii) evaluating effects of policy interventions. To ensure that derived policies are suitable to intervene in the real world and not just the stylization of it, they discuss validity and operationalization of agent-based models as well as interpretation of simulation results.
B52|The macroeconomics of radical uncertainty|Macroeconomics must take radical uncertainty into account, if it aims at contributing to the solution of serious real-world problems such as climate change. Allowing for radical uncertainty must happen at two levels: the level of modeling and the level of the scientifi c discipline. I argue that the complexity approach which sees the economy as a complex adaptive system is better suited to deal with radical uncertainty than the mainstream DSGE approach. I review a number of agent-based models that are promising starting points to incorporate radical uncertainty into macroeconomics. Discussing the examples of the fi nancial crisis and climate change, I establish why methodological monism is dangerous and why macroeconomics needs more pluralism and openness towards other scientifi c approaches. Radical uncertainty and the complexity approach have important implications for macroeconomic policy and the advice that economists can give to policy makers. Under radical uncertainty it does not make sense to look for optimal policies.
B52|Is Amazon The Next Google?|Dominant or apparently dominant internet platform increasingly become subject to both antitrust investigations and further-reaching political calls for regulation. While Google is currently in the focus of the discussion, the next candidate is already on the horizon - the ubiquitous online trading platform Amazon. Competitors and suppliers but also famous economists like Paul Krugman unite in criticizing Amazon′s market power and alleged abuse of it. In this paper, we collect the multitude of allegations against Amazon and categorize them according to types of potential anticompetitive conduct or types of market failure. We provide an economic analysis of these allegations based upon economic theory as well as publicly available information and data. As one of our main results, we find that the most severe allegations against Amazon do not hold from an economic perspective and, consequently, do not warrant regulation or other drastic interventions (like breaking the company up). However, several areas of conduct, in particular, the use of best price clauses and the (anti-) competitive interplay of Amazon and the major publishers in the e-book market require competition policy action. The standard antitrust instruments, enriched with modern economic theory, should suffice to disincentivize the identified anticompetitive conduct for now.
B52|Declining trust in growing China: A dilemma between growth and socio-economic damage|"Declining general trust has become a serious social issue in China in recent years. This paper attempts to understand and analyze this social phenomenon from a social interaction perspective. Based on a repeated prisoners´ dilemma game on networks, it finds that the evolution of general trust is dependent on changes of the social interaction structure, and the increases of both social and spatial distance may explain a decrease of the levels of cooperation and general trust. In addition, we find that the traditional Chinese family and clan networks culture has an ambiguous effect on general trust, and simple reactive social ""homing behavior"" might be critical for China´s future economic development. In order to recover the general trust level, a major strategic option for China, and for fast growing countries in economic transition in general, is to (re-)develop appropriate network structures and properties, as our model indicates."

In this process the theory helps reconcile growth with industrial organization and development economics.

B52|Will the institution of coexistence be re-defined by TTIP?| The coexistence between genetically modified (GM) and non-GM based agricultural supply chains is an economic institution that defines rules of the games, the objectives of which are set more broadly than economic rationality and efficiency. Institution of coexistence covers the formal rules as well as informal constraints devoted principally to identity preservation and segregation, and the ways how they are imposed and enforced in the GM and non-GM based supply chains from agri-food sector. They applies to the dynamic process of formulation, selection and adaptation of behaviors and rules, which form the institutional orders in local, regional and international dimensions, under the circumstances of constant changes in the socio-economic systems. The paper is an attempt to describe the coexistence as an economic institution in the light of New Institutional Economics. Using the results of foresight technique it also examine how the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership under negotiation between the European Union and the United States could re-define both legal regulations and market-based standards of coexistence. In the Delphi method panels participated stakeholders from both GM and non-GM based agri-food supply chains, who forecasted that the institution of coexistence will be re-defined by the rules that TTIP would set up.
B52|Why Farm Support Persists: An Explanation Grounded in Congressional Political Economy| n the paper we provide an explanation of the persistence of the commodity titles in US farm bills that is grounded in core theories of the policy process from the political science literature. The political science literature explains policy continuity and policy change from a number of different perspectives and we use these to explain why the commodity titles of farm bills have persisted in the face of considerable opposition and how in response the Agriculture Committees have introduced incremental change to the content of farm bills to facilitate each bill’s passage. Unlike the standard approach of agricultural economists which focuses on the broader national economic efficiency impacts of farm programs, we concentrate on, narrower local political forces that affect individual Members of the Congress, and on the legislative process that created each farm bill.
B52|Learning that milk comes from a cow: supply management and the character of neoliberalism in Spain’s dairy chain|This article takes Spain’s dairy chain as a study case of the transformations in the political economy of the food system in the West since the Second World War. I find that there is much to support the prevailing narrative in food regime analysis: the organised capitalism of 1952-1986 was gradually weakened by a policy agenda of deregulation stemming from both internal and external pressures. I also find, however, a thread of continuity between the period 1952-1986and the post-1986 period – in both periods there were strategies of supply chain management by means of which the power of political or business elites joined the market as a mechanism for the coordination of decisions. I argue that there is a case for reassessing the degree up to which the term “neoliberalism” does a good job at describing the new historical era that started in the food system in the latter decades of the twentieth century.
B52|Spontaneous order and social norms. Hayek’s theory of socio-cultural evolution|Hayek’s theory of socio-cultural evolution is a generalization of his theory on spontaneous market order. Hayek explains both the emergence of market and social institutions serving as a social basis for that order within the framework of a unified evolutionary logic. This logic interprets the emergence and survival of spontaneous order and group-level rules of conduct as an unintended consequence of human action. In order to explain the emergence of social norms exclusively on the basis of methodological individualism, one would have to give up an exclusively evolutionary explanation of these norms. Since Hayek applies the invisible-hand explanation to the investigation of social norms, he combines the position of methodological individualism with functionalist-evolutionary arguments in his analysis. Hayek’s theory of socio-cultural evolution represents a theory in the framework of which methodological individualism and functionalism do not crowd out but complement each other.
B52|The Changing Face of Economics? Ethical Issues in Contemporary Economic Schools as a Consequence of Changes in the Concept of Human Nature|The last financial crisis combined with some recent social trends (like growing inequality or environmental problems) inspired many contemporary economists to the re-evaluation of actual economic knowledge in the search for solutions to these problems. Modern economic schools (especially heterodox ones) stress the meaning of ethical issues in economics more often. The thesis of the paper is that this revival of the ethical face of present economics depends very strongly on the changing assumptions of human nature within economics and other disciplines which work alongside economics, such as social psychology or business ethics, for instance. In order to prove the thesis, the paper provides an evaluation of current economic schools, especially within the heterodoxy, in search of their ethical aspects, and presents them as a result of the changing assumptions about human beings within those schools. This ethical dimension of human beings manifests itself in different ways, which can be perceived as a result of it being based on different ethical schools and different psychological and philosophical assumptions about human nature. Therefore, the paper also considers the current developments of the view on human beings in contemporary schools of economic ethics.
B52|Economics as a Discipline of Instrumental Reason. Looking at Economics as a Science from the Perspective of the Frankfurt School of Philosophy|The article is built around the analysis of The critique of instrumental reason by Horkheimer, applied to issues connected with the philosophy of economics. Positive economics is under-stood as an example of a discipline where the pragmatic paradigm has been implemented. Therefore, economics functions within the boundaries of what Horkheimer called instrumental rationality. The starting point is the intellectual source shared by economics and the Frankfurt School, namely Kant’s philosophy of rationality. In the first part of the article, three of Kant’s ideas that are fundamental to economics are presented, and then the development of their application in philosophy of science, as seen by Horkheimer in 1947, is laid out. The second part of the article consists of enumerating various distinctive features of economics that set it apart from other social sciences and which constitute factors for which it can be considered a realm of the reign of ‘instrumental rationality’, with all the threats such an approach provokes. The above-mentioned features concentrate on treating humans in economics as a means, not as a goal. This aspect of the philosophy of science of the Frankfurt School (unlike its critique of capitalism as an economic system) has not been widely received.
B52|The psychology of early institutional economics: The instinctive approach of Thorstein Veblen's conspicuous consumer theory|Thorstein Veblen, a founder of original or old institutional economics, combined social and evolutionary thought in his institutionalist approach to dealing with psychological, social, and economic issues. The psychological content of Veblen's writings takes instinct and habits into consideration. The economic literature on the psychological content of Veblen's writings has focused on habits, despite the importance of instincts in Veblen's works. This paper attempts to discuss Veblen's notion of instincts in order to make its role clearer in his approach to conspicuous consumer decision making. It discusses the role of instincts, the instinct of workmanship, the relationship between habits and instincts, and their influence on the conspicuous consumer. Consequently, this paper contributes to a better understanding of how inner forces and socialization culminate in behavior in Veblen's conspicuous consumer approach
B52|Autonomy-Enhancing Paternalism|" type=""main""> We present a form of soft paternalism called “autonomy-enhancing paternalism” that seeks to increase individual well-being by facilitating the individual ability to make critically reflected, autonomous decisions. The focus of autonomy-enhancing paternalism is on helping individuals to become better decision-makers, rather than on helping them by making better decisions for them. Autonomy-enhancing paternalism acknowledges that behavioral interventions can change the strength of decision-making anomalies over time, and favors those interventions that improve, rather than reduce, individuals' ability to make good and unbiased decisions. By this it prevents manipulation of the individual by the soft paternalist, accounts for the heterogeneity of individuals, and counteracts slippery slope arguments by decreasing the probability of future paternalistic interventions. Moreover, autonomy-enhancing paternalism can be defended based on both liberal values and welfare considerations."
B52|Conspicuous Consumption, Inequality and Debt: The Nature of Consumption-driven Profit-led Regimes| This paper extends the theoretical concept of wage-led and profit-led demand regimes by incorporating relative consumption concerns. Specifically, it integrates the Veblenian concept of conspicuous consumption into the Bhaduri–Marglin model by assuming that relative consumption concerns matter primarily within the working class. If in such a framework the profit share increases and the corresponding decrease in workers' income is distributed unevenly, efforts to ‘keep up with the Joneses’ may increase consumption and, hence, lead to a consumption-driven profit-led regime.
B52|Trajectoire d’innovation dans les systèmes laitiers français : une analyse socio-technique de la démarche « Bleu-Blanc-Cœur »|The multi-level perspective for analyzing transitions presents the niche-innovation as the seed of new productive paths?: its diffusion through the current regime could cause its change. We apply this analytical framework to study the trajectory of innovation of the ?Bleu-Blanc-Coeur? (BBC) case based on a change in practices of animal feeding to improve the health value of products. By analyzing the interactions between the actors of the dairy sociotechnical systems in France, we examine how the current systems and the BBC niche-innovation coevolve, and how new standards are built in the sector. This case study shows how technological, organizational, and institutional innovations are combined. We propose to consider these changes as the seeds of a transition in the dairy sector, according to the future strategy of actors as regards the diffusion of this innovation. This analysis reveals the complexity of coevolution processes. JEL Codes?: B52, D2, L1, O3, Q1, Q5

Our aim is to show that, in spite of this growing skepticism, new opportunities for cluster policy and collective management exist. They require moving their focus from the ?connecting people? one best way that gets through the whole of cluster policy guidelines to more surgical and targeted incentives for R&D collaborations, as well as renewed coordination mechanisms, which favor a set of particular network properties along the life cycle of clusters.

Inicia enfatizando la necesidad de afirmar la dimensión humana e institucional de la economía, a partir de reconocer el tiempo de la economía como tiempo histórico. La perspectiva que plantea, identifica la urgencia de renovar las bases institucionales de la sociedad mediante el fortalecimiento y desarrollo efectivo de la sociedad civil, junto con la configuración de arreglos institucionales que fortalezcan la confianza y la cohesión social mediante políticas activas del Estado. Estas políticas dirigidas a buscar la estabilización económica y social de las zonas rurales y a mejorar las dotaciones de recursos modernos de la población que, tanto en el campo como en la ciudad, ha estado al margen de los procesos de modernización y transformación del crecimiento moderno. ****** The document presents an overview of the post-conflict issue in Colombia. It starts by emphasizing the need to affirm human and institutional dimensions of the economy, from acknowledging time economics as a historical time. It raises the prospect that identifies the urgency to renew the institutional foundations of society through effective development and strengthening of civil society, together with the configuration of institutional arrangements that strengthen confidence and social cohesion through active state policies. These policies address economic and social stability in rural areas and improve the population’s modern resource endowments, both in the countryside and in the city; have been on the sidelines of the modernization and transformation of modern growth.
B52|Aprendizaje, instituciones y desempeño económico|En este artículo ofrecemos una visión amplia de la interacción entre cognición, sistemas de creencias e instituciones, y de la manera cómo estos afectan el desempeño económico. Argumentamos que una comprensión más profunda del surgimiento, las propiedades operativas y los efectos de las instituciones en los resultados económicos y políticos debería comenzar por el análisis de procesos cognitivos. Exploramos la naturaleza del aprendizaje individual y colectivo, haciendo énfasis en que el asunto no es si los agentes son perfecta o limitadamente racionales, sino cómo los seres humanos en realidad razonan y eligen de forma individual o colectiva. Luego atamos el proceso de aprendizaje con el análisis institucional, ofreciendo argumentos a favor de lo que se puede caracterizar como “institucionalismo cognitivo”. Además, mostramos que un tratamiento completo del fenómeno de sendero-dependencia debe comenzar en el nivel cognitivo, pasar por el nivel institucional, y culminar en el nivel económico.
B52|Institutional inertia in crisis management and interest representation: the case of the European Union|The recent crisis is banking crisis at its roots. An opening observation says that as far as policy response in the EU in the shape of the banking union concerned the multi- governmental negotiations seem to have failed to change common law in relevant respects. The question is posed what reasons for such institutional inertia might be. The premise of the research is looking at lobbying activities of pan-European economic agents at European level, transnational banks included. Thus the paper draws from theoretical perspective offered by political economy. The review of empirical findings adds an observation that at time of introducing the banking union circumstances existed under which lobbying activities might have been intensified. The paper concludes that institutional inertia in the EU-response to the banking crisis can be explained by intensity and power of interest representation as confronted with a rather soft stance of major European institutions involved in decision-making process.
B52|Institutional determinants — decorations or yoke — a crisis test|Institutional determinants of economic crises as a subject of scientific study is a compromise between quality notions and quantity calculation. Under pressure of practical governing and disrupted by crises, economic thought developed some concepts and doctrines, addressed to the state authorities. As attractive component theory of economic cycles come out institutionalism. The concepts of two scholars: Svetlana Kirdina (Russia) and Thráinn Eggertson (Iceland) are worth noting. S. Kirdina promote the theory of an institutional matrix, where the area of conflicts is located. Eggertson is recognized as an author of the theory of imperfect institutions and limit of reform. Interesting issues, both theoretic and practical ones, against the background of Ukrainian drama, may be found in publications of Vladimir Lipov. He developed methodology of institutional economics and focused attention on the theory of goods, especially on dual notions complementary and substitution. As a starting point to an analysis, Lipov proposes the structure of institutional blocs. Progressing gradually and employing the dynamics of blocs cooperation, he justifies the importance of complementary. It provides an opportunity to analyze an institution from a structural and functional angle. In the further section of the paper, Hyman P. Minsky‘s “financial instability hypothesis” is extensively covered and discussed. Among the reasons, the rebirth of Keynesianism and the pressure exerted by the last American crises are listed. Financial instability is blamed very intensively. Given the above, various determinants are obviously necessary but always distant from a perfect resolution.
B52|Spontaneous order and social norms. Hayek’s theory of socio-cultural evolution|Hayek's theory of socio-cultural evolution is a generalization of his theory on spontaneous market order. Hayek explains both the emergence of market and social institutions serving as a social basis for that order within the framework of a unified evolutionary logic. This logic interprets the emergence and survival of spontaneous order and group-level rules of conduct as an unintended consequence of human action. In order to explain the emergence of social norms exclusively on the basis of methodological individualism, one would have to give up an exclusively evolutionary explanation of these norms. Since Hayek applies the invisiblehand explanation to the investigation of social norms, he combines the position of methodological individualism with functionalist-evolutionary arguments in his analysis. Hayek's theory of socio-cultural evolution represents a theory in the framework of which methodological individualism and functionalism do not crowd out but complement each other.
B52|Una interpretación institucionalista de la política macroprudencial|Una de las consecuencias de la reciente crisis económica internacional fue la demanda de nuevos instrumentos de política económica, además de los ya consagrados mecanismos de política monetaria, cambiaria y fiscal. En particular, se procura buscar medios más eficaces para regular el sistema financiero e impedir el surgimiento de desequilibrios que afecten a la economía real. En ese sentido, la política macroprudencial se ha destacado como otra política pública de matriz económica cuya utilización puede contribuir al mantenimiento de la estabilidad financiera. No obstante, los debates y el desarrollo de la literatura sobre este tema se basan en fundamentos pragmáticos no relacionados directamente con las escuelas ortodoxas o heterodoxas de la ciencia económica. En ese contexto, el objetivo de este trabajo es realizar una lectura institucionalista de la política macroprudencial, sobre la base de que esta puede comprenderse con arreglo al contenido teórico de los enfoques institucionalistas.
B52|Macroprudential policy: an institutionalist interpretation|One of the consequences of the recent international economic crisis has been the demand for new economic policy tools, to add to the well-established monetary, exchange-rate, and fiscal policy mechanisms. In particular, more effective ways are needed to regulate the financial system and prevent the emergence of imbalances that affect the real economy. In that context, macroprudential policy has been singled out as another economic-type public policy which could help maintain financial stability. Nonetheless, the discussions and development of the literature on this topic are founded on pragmatic considerations that are not directly related to the orthodox or heterodox schools of economic thought. So the aim of this article is to provide an institutionalist reading of macroprudential policy, to understand it in terms of the theoretical content of institutional approaches.
B52|The effect of cultural distance on contracting decisions: The case of executive compensation|This paper focuses on how differences in national culture may relate to cross-country differences in the structure of executive compensation contracts. We know that firms design executive compensation contracts to reduce conflicts of interest between owners and managers. We contend that cultural context affects these conflicts of interest and hypothesize that firms from cultures that are similar (different) should design compensation contracts that are similar (different). To specify cultural context, we calculate cultural distance using value dimensions from Hofstede (1980) and test for a relation between culture and contracting using compensation data for 39 countries from 1996–2009. Our findings indicate that culture is a significant determinant of cross-sectional differences in compensation structures. These results are robust to our use of instrumental variables methodologies (to mitigate concerns of potential omitted variables and reverse causation). By exploring the relatively unexplored impact of national culture on compensation structure, we hope to contribute to a better overall understanding of contracting decisions.
B52|Small-scale cooperative banking and the production of capital: Reflecting on the role of institutional agreements in supporting rural livelihood in Kampot, Cambodia|This paper explores the ecological economics of small-scale cooperative banking (SSCB) through reference to the empirical case of a rice-farming village in Kampot, Cambodia. It combines Georgescu-Roegen's discussion of an economy's capacity to produce economic processes with Ostrom's concept of institutional performance, in order to address the implications and functioning of SSCB within a small-farmer economy. The local collective action situation of maintaining and making use of a SSCB system – a specific finance model – provides the studied community with access to a pooled capital fund that may play an important role in ensuring its capacity to produce and reproduce economic processes, according to its own specifications. The coordinated action among the villagers, which matches up well with Ostrom's criteria for effective institutional performance of common pool resource use governance, is found to include social and environmental dimensions, which we understand to be necessary for achieving transformations toward more sustainable economic activity. While we do not wish to suggest that the adoption of SSCB guarantees either improved ecological or social impacts, our results suggest that this finance model could play a supporting role in enhancing the potential of small-farming communities to improve both, should they wish to do so.
B52|From equilibrium to autopoiesis: A Luhmannian reading of Veblenian evolutionary economics|The paper reconstructs the Veblenian critique of the pecuniary economy from the perspective of Niklas Luhmann's theory of autopoietic social systems. Luhmann argued that social systems relieve people from the overwhelming civilizational complexity, but develop autopoietic properties hindering rational solutions to human problems. This argument allows seeing the pecuniary economy as an important complexity-reducing device, which, however, develops excessive autonomy from the embedding societal and ecological environment. For this reason, like other autopoietic systems, the economy has a high chance of becoming societally and ecologically unsustainable. While Veblen criticized the obsession of classical economics with equilibrium and the natural order, Luhmann urged to replace the notion of equilibrium with that of autopoiesis, which focuses attention on the sustainability problem. Accentuating this problem is shown to be the main evolutionary economics implication of Luhmann's work.
B52|Institutions and diversification: Related versus unrelated diversification in a varieties of capitalism framework|The varieties of capitalism literature has drawn little attention to industrial renewal and diversification, while the related diversification literature has neglected the institutional dimension of industrial change. Bringing together both literatures, the paper proposes that institutions have an impact on the direction of the diversification process, in particular on whether countries gain a comparative advantage in new sectors that are close or far from what is already part of their existing industrial structure. We investigate the diversification process in 23 developed countries by means of detailed product trade data in the period 1995–2010. Our results show that relatedness is a stronger driver of diversification into new products in coordinated market economies, while liberal market economies show a higher probability to move in more unrelated industries: their overarching institutional framework gives countries more freedom to make a jump in their industrial evolution. In particular, we found that the role of relatedness as driver of diversification into new sectors is stronger in the presence of institutions that focus more on ‘non-market’ coordination in the domains of labor relations, corporate governance relations, product market relations, and inter-firm relations.
B52|Economics as energy framework: Complexity, turbulence, financial crises, and protectionism|This paper presents a framework for thinking about economic growth, trade, and capital flows viewed as transformations of current and vintage solar energy, stored in the form of natural resources, human capital, physical capital and technology described by the laws of thermodynamics. Recent developments in nonequilibrium thermodynamics (NET) show how efficient global capital markets and high-speed communications networks accelerate energy flow and growth but also create turbulence, financial crisis, protectionism and conflict. The paper discusses the role that NET can play in helping us understand stock market bubbles and financial crises.
B52|Revisiting profit persistence and the stock market in Japan|This paper tests the classical hypothesis of inter-industry profit rate's proclivity to gravitate towards the economy's average profit rate. In so doing, individual as well as panel unit root tests have been applied on a dataset consisting of 52 Japanese manufacturing industries spanning the period 1974–2008. The evidence generated is rather mixed in a sense that the inter-industry profit rates tendency to gravitate towards the economy's average rate of profit depends on the idiosyncratic characteristics of each industry. However, the rate of profit of regulating capitals, as this is reflected in the incremental rate of profit, displays gravitational behaviour around the economy-wide incremental rate of profit, the movement of which is found to be linked to the rate of return in the stock market. These results lend support to those who contend that the classical theory of competition is an area where further research is warranted.
B52|Simulating micro behaviours and structural properties of knowledge networks: toward a “one size fits one” cluster policy|The economic return of cluster policies has been recently called into question. Essentially based on a “one size fits all” approach consisting in boosting R&D collaborations and reinforcing network density in regions, cluster policies are suspected to have failed in reaching their objectives. The paper proposes to go back to the micro foundations of clusters in order to disentangle the links between the long run performance of clusters and their structural properties. We use a simple agent-based model to shed light on how individual motives to shape knowledge relationships can give rise to emerging structures with different properties, which imply different innovation and renewal capabilities. The simulation results are discussed in a micro-macro perspective, and the findings suggest reorienting cluster policy guidelines towards more targeted public-funded incentives for R&D collaboration.
B52|Methodology of institutional analysis and its implication for contemporary framework of Islamic banks|Purpose - – This paper aims to investigate the possibility of a methodological error made by the concerned scholars and academics of Islamic finance & economics to understand and study the modern framework of financial institutions, where they intend to practice Islamic law of contract. This error has led them to expect something which the institutional modern framework of banks, adopted by Islamic banks (for e.g.), wasn’t designed to accomplish, hence the disappointment. Design/methodology/approach - – This study reviews the literature on history of evolution of banking industry and the corresponding ideological and cultural changes in the European society which drove this evolution; this is followed by a conceptual analysis to identify the institutional components inconsistent with ethos of Islamic norms and ethos. Findings - – After review of history and evolution of modern banking framework, in the light of Hollingsworth frame of institutional analysis, it is inferred that the said framework was designed for a secular, liberal and capitalist society to efficiently and effectively enhance freedom and accumulate capital and wealth, without much regard for equitable distribution of wealth and economic justice. These goals are very much in contrast with the normative premise of Islamic Economics, which cannot be efficiently used to achieve the related objective. This indicates that framework of banking was narrowly understood by the concerned scholars and academics, without considering its history of evolution and intended objectives, before adopting for IBs. Practical implications - – The disconnect between the Western institutional framework and ethos of Islam implies that the concerned need to look deeper and holistically while adapting Western institutions, so that necessary alteration is done in advance, if such an adoption is inevitable. Originality/value - – This study introduces a new dimension for the concerned scholars, academics and practitioners to reanalyze the institutional framework adopted from the West, so that necessary adjustments can be worked out to make the said framework compatible with the ethos of Islamic economics.
B52|Anatomy of the â€œEconomic Miracleâ€|The authors analyze evolutionary-institutional patterns and factors of economic growth and development on the example of a number of countries which have demonstrated the â€œeconomic miracleâ€ . Their research method is a structure of socio-economic genotype which aims at maximizing the economic system outcomes. It is concluded that the â€œeconomic miracleâ€ appears when the economic policy and development strategy of a country coincide with the succession (logic) of a cyclic structure of genotype as a driving force of economic evolution.
B52|Régimes de qualité de l’emploi et diversité des pays émergents|Les pays émergents et leurs leaders, les BRICS, peuvent aujourd’hui être revisités à la lumière d’une approche institutionnaliste plus propice à la prise en compte de leur diversité. En se concentrant sur la configuration de leur rapport salarial, ce papier propose de questionner la catégorie formée par ces pays en étudiant la variété des régimes de qualité de l’emploi qu’ils présentent. Deux résultats intéressants ressortent de cette étude proposant une Analyse en Composantes Principales (ACP) suivie d’une Classification Mixte (CM) à partir de deux grandes dimensions institutionnelles décomposées en quatorze indicateurs. (1) Les pays émergents se dispersent pour établir quatre régimes de qualité de l’emploi spécifiques, illustrant ainsi leur hétérogénéité et la fragilité de leur catégorie. (2) L’éclatement des BRICS, loin de composer un régime cohérent et indépendant, peut être expliqué par une combinaison de facteurs socio-économiques et institutionnels propre à chacun de ces leaders de l’émergence.
B52|Revisiting New Institutional Economics: Basic Concepts And Research Directions|In the last four decades there is a renewed interest within the economic theory for the institutional structures. Numerous, multiple and often unpredictable effects of institutions on economic process are differently reflected among the leading schools of economic analysis. Certainly, in this sense, the greatest attention should be given to the stream of economic thought known as institutional economics. This heterogeneous research orientation today is already clearly differentiated on Veblenian and the new institutional economics. The paper will make, in the light of its recorded achievements and the subjects of interest of its main protagonists, a general insight into the new institutional economics.
B52|Market failure vs. system failure as a rationale for economic policy? A critique from an evolutionary perspective|Abstract This paper reconsiders the explanation of economic policy from an evolutionary economics perspective. It contrasts the neoclassical equilibrium notions of market and government failure with the dominant evolutionary neo-Schumpeterian and Austrian-Hayekian perceptions. Based on this comparison, the paper criticizes the fact that neoclassical reasoning still prevails in non-equilibrium evolutionary economics when economic policy issues are examined. This is more than surprising, since proponents of evolutionary economics usually view their approach as incompatible with its neoclassical counterpart. In addition, it is shown that this “fallacy of failure thinking” even finds its continuation in the alternative concept of “system failure” with which some evolutionary economists try to explain and legitimate policy interventions in local, regional or national innovation systems. The paper argues that in order to prevent the otherwise fruitful and more realistic evolutionary approach from undermining its own criticism of neoclassical economics and to create a consistent as well as objective evolutionary policy framework, it is necessary to eliminate the equilibrium spirit. Finally, the paper delivers an alternative evolutionary explanation of economic policy which is able to overcome the theory-immanent contradiction of the hitherto evolutionary view on this subject.
B52|How false beliefs about exchange rate systems threaten global growth and the existence of the Eurozone|The current belief system that says “all will be well” if domestic price stability can be maintained is fundamentally flawed. If this can be achieved only through monetary, credit and debt expansion, the end result will be an increased risk of systemic crisis. Moreover, false beliefs about how exchange rate systems function, at both the global level and within the Eurozone, imply international “spillover” effects that increase both the likelihood and the seriousness of such crises. Gross international capital flows pose as many (perhaps more) dangers than do net flows (ie current account imbalances). And false beliefs about exchange rate regimes not only compromise crisis prevention, but they also hinder crisis management and resolution. At the global level, we still lack the instruments to do either effectively should current problems worsen. In the Eurozone, the crisis which began in 2010 has not been well managed and remains fundamentally unresolved.
B52|"The Ontology of Schelling's ""Theory of Interdependent Decisions"""|"The present paper offers a methodological contribution on Schelling's insight into game theory drawing both on his proposition for a ""reorientation of game theory"" and his dynamic models of residential segregation. It aims to show how these respective works exhibit coherence in Schelling's thinking. It is often claimed that Schelling criticizes standard game theory without proposing any conceptual solution. To the contrary, I assert that the methodological constraints Schelling identifies in standard game theory support the proposition of a new type of modeling in the dynamic models of residential segregation: the first agent based modeling. I argue that the agent-based models provide a theoretic ground to formalize the methodological innovations proposed in his “reorientation of game theory.” To understand such a claim I stress the social ontology underlined in Schelling's conception of a ""theory of interdependent decisions."""
B52|Eco-innovations: which new paths for the Aquitaine wood industry?|This article focuses on the question of how eco-innovation projects can lead to the break-out of an industrial trajectory. Using the example of the Aquitaine wood industry, we question how eco-innovation projects promoted by the ‘competitiveness cluster’ might help to modify that trajectory. Based on the existing literature, which refers to the diversity of objectives of eco-innovation, our research analyzes this diversity and then questions the compatibility of these objectives. By doing so, the article aims to identify the main possible paths of evolution of the Aquitaine wood industry.
B52|Vers un cadre d’analyse institutionnaliste de la politique de filière : Quelle cohérence pour la politique de filière française ?|This paper aims to investigate new theoretical approaches for explaining the concept of French filiere. By using the institutional meso-economics policy point of view (Jullien, 2011), we highlight a gap between the latest French policies for structuring industries into filieres and the objective pursued by such policies. Our demonstration is organized as follow. First, using the institutional meso-economics view, we’ll provide a theoretical definition of the filiere as a particular set of industries technologically closes, sought by the politics. Second, we introduce the instruments used by public authorities within the definition of filiere policies (like the CNI and the “34 plans de la Nouvelle France”). Finally, we show some shortcomings of such policies, both at practical and conceptual order.
B52|Routines and Networks: Strengthening a Missed Link|This paper aims at understanding how and why managers can mobilize networks for creating and modifying organizational routines. We mobilize both routines and social capital corpus associated to structuration theory to deepened understanding on how networks are deployed and further used for elaborating and modifying organizational routines. Our research is based on a 3-year in-depth engaged study in a small firm pertaining to European biopesticide industry confronted to developing a registration capability. This process led to routine creation and modification through managerial agency. This study brings insights on how social capital plays a role in the elaboration and modification of routines related to social structures imposed to the firm. We provide a model that articulates social structure, social system and social capital. It provides a recursive and dialogical perspective of structures and social capital as a carrier for creating and modifying routines conceptualized as a social system. Results show that the modification or creation of routines is oriented by how the manager perceives it as legitimate by specific ties. It also shows that the elaboration of a bundle of routine can be supported by external networks that are not initially part of the firm resources. These networks provide diverse kind of resources such as information, human resources, and procedures. But more important, they are also a medium for legitimating both routines and associated actions.
B52|Another “French paradox”: explaining why interest rates to microenterprises did not increase with the change in French usury legislation|Conventional wisdom indicates that the growth of credit may not materialize if credit rates remain capped by usury laws, as had long been the case in France. France therefore abolished usury ceilings on loans to microenterprise in an effort to increase financing for microentrepreneurs. This should have led to an increase in interest rates and increase in microcredit. However, we do not find any increase in interest rates and this is therefore a paradox. The paper provides a brief literature review and the salient features of the legislative changes in France. It follows this up with a presentation of interest rate movements. The discussion of possible explanations of the paradox includes classical market analysis (global interest rates, money supply, and competition), behavioral and institutional analysis (guarantees, Basel II and risk taking, legal concept of abusive support, protection for over-indebtedness, information asymmetry and limited liability) and softer institutional reasons (religion, risk-taking culture).

B52|La construction des catégories diagnostiques de maladie mentale|Dans le cadre d’une approche d’économie politique, l’article propose une analyse de la construction sociale des maladies et des marchés dans le champ de la santé mentale, en lien avec les débats récents sur la classification des maladies mentales relancés autour de la publication du DSM-5. En prenant l’exemple du trouble du déficit de l’attention et de l’hyperactivité (TDAH), l’analyse du travail politique des différents acteurs (firmes pharmaceutiques, associations de familles de patients, assurances sociales, école, État, système de santé, etc.) permet de préciser leurs rôles à travers l’analyse comparative de la France et des États-Unis. L’étude de la production du discours scientifique sur la maladie précise qu’au-delà des questions éthiques, c’est une économie du financement de la recherche et de la publication scientifique qui participe au jeu des acteurs.
