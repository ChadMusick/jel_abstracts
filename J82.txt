J82|Can unconditional in-kind transfers keep children out of work and in school? Evidence from Indonesia|The International Labour Organisation estimates that 152 million children are engaging in child labour globally which creates a need for evidence based policies and interventions to eliminate it. Particularly, there is limited evidence about the effect of in-kind transfers on child labour, impeding policy development. We address this evidence gap by examining the impacts of an unconditional in-kind transfer, a subsidised rice program, on child labour as well as schooling, using household survey data from Indonesia. To identify the causal effect we employ coarsened exact matching with difference-in-differences estimator. The results indicate that the program is effective in increasing the probability of schooling for girls though it does not have a significant impact on the probability of working as a child. However, as an unconditional in-kind transfer, its ability to increase schooling for girls, especially of those who are not currently attending school, provides an important policy implication on how a food subsidy program can indirectly influence child wellbeing.
J82|Does Rice for Poor Subsidy Reduce Child Marriage?|Reducing child marriage is seen as one of the essentials to women’s empowerment and wellbeing, ending the intergenerational cycle of poverty and rights violation. In this paper, we use a longitudinal household survey from Indonesia to study whether a food subsidy (Raskin) reduces child marriage. Modelling treatment assignment with Coarsened Exact Matching and Differences-in-Differences, we show that the unconditional rice subsidy significantly reduces the likelihood of marrying as a child.
J82|Minimum wage workers in the private sector in Poland: regional perspective|The aim of the paper is to analyse regional diversification of minimum wage workers in the private sector in Poland and identify regions more vulnerable to minimum wage increases. Firstly, we examine the regional differences in the share of minimum wage workers. Secondly, we look at the structure of minimum wage earners. Finally, we use empirical approach analogous to Nestiæ et al. (2018) to identify low-wage sections and low-wage regions. We use individual data from the Structure of Earnings Survey in Poland. The research period covers 2008-2016. Six Polish regions are identified as the low-wage ones: five economically underdeveloped provinces of Eastern Poland and one region located centrally. These regions are characterised not only by high percentage of young people working for the minimum wage, but also high share of prime age and elderly minimum wage workers. High share of minimum wage earners is not only among low-qualified workers, but also among those with secondary education. These are employed in labour intensive, low-wage sections of the economy. What is particularly interesting is the fact that the results are fairly stable over time. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study of such kind not only for Poland but also for other countries.
J82|More insecure and less paid? The effect of perceived job insecurity on wage distribution|This article employs a Counterfactual Decomposition Analysis (CDA) using both a semi-parametric and a non-parametric method to examine the pay gap, over the entire wage distribution, between secure and insecure workers on the basis of perceived job insecurity. Using the 2015 INAPP Survey on Quality of Work, our results exhibit a mirror J-shaped pattern in the pay gap, with a significant sticky floor effect, i.e. the job insecurity more relevant at the lowest quantiles. This pattern is mainly due to the characteristics effect, while the relative incidence of the coefficient component accounts roughly for 22 up to 36% of the total difference, being more relevant at the bottom of the wage distribution.
J82|Mission of the company, prosocial attitudes and job preferences: A discrete choice experiment|We conduct a discrete choice experiment to investigate how the mission of high-tech companies affects job attractiveness and induces self-selection of science and engineering graduates with respect to their prosocial attitudes. We characterize mission by whether or not the company combines its profit motive with a mission on innovation or corporate social responsibility (CSR). Furthermore, we vary job design (e.g. autonomy) and contractible job attributes (e.g. job security). We find that companies with a mission on innovation or CSR are considered more attractive. Women and individuals who are more altruistic and less competitive feel particularly attracted to such companies.
J82|The Added Worker Effect, Employment Contracts, and the Reasons for the Wife’s Inactivity|The recent literature provide compelling evidence of the existence of a significant added worker effect (AWE) - wives increase their labour supply in response to the job displacement of their husbands. However, little is known about the heterogeneity of the effect. I study the variation in the AWE depending on the reasons for the wife’s inactivity, and on the husband’s employment contract type. I find that the responses of discouraged women to the job displacement of their husbands were three times as strong as the responses of those women, who were inactive for reasons of health and family. This finding suggests that discouraged people are highly responsive to the income shocks that occur within a household. In addition, I find that the size of the AWE also depends on the type of employment contract the husband had. The results suggest that high employment protection reduces the wife’s incentives to join the labour force after her husband’s job displacement.
J82|Retirement Choices by State and Local Public Sector Employees: The Role of Eligibility and Financial Incentives|I analyze the effects of state public pension parameters on the retirement of public employees. Using a panel data set of public sector workers from 12 waves of the Health and Retirement Study, I model the probability of retirement as a function of pension wealth at early and normal retirement eligibility and Social Security coverage in the public sector job. I find that becoming eligible for early retirement, or receiving an early-out offer, significantly increases the probability of retiring. I do not find any effect of retirement wealth levels; instead the findings are consistent with the literature on default options in defined contribution plans. These findings suggest that state legislative action to affect retirement decisions and reduce future pension costs may be most effective operating through plan eligibility rules and early-out incentives.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J82|Changing Business Cycles: The Role of Women's Employment|This paper builds a real DSGE model with gender differences in labor supply and productivity. The model is used to assess the impact of changing trends in female labor supply on productivity and TFP growth and aggregate business cycles. We find that the growth in women's labor supply and relative productivity contributed substantially to TFP growth starting from the early 1980s, even if it depressed average labor productivity growth, contributing to the 1970s productivity slowdown. We also show that the lower cyclicality of female hours and their growing share in aggregate hours is able to account for a large fraction of the decline in the cyclicality of aggregate hours during the great moderation, as well as the decline in the correlation between average labor productivity and hours. Finally, we show that the discontinued growth in female labor supply after the 1990s played a substantial role in the jobless recoveries following the 2001 and 2007-2009 recession. Moreover, it also depressed aggregate hours and output growth during the late 1990s and mid 2000s expansions and it reduced male wages. These results suggest that continued growth in female hours since the early 1990s would have significantly improved economic performance in the United States.

J82|Consumption dispersion between white-collar and blue-collar workers and rising market concentration in the USA: 1984-2011|The relationship between consumption inequality (between two groups) and market concentration has hitherto been absent from the literature. This paper argues that consumption dispersion between white-collar and blue-collar workers has caused increased market concentration in the USA in a direct and long-term structural manner. Using data from the Consumption Expenditure Survey (CES) and the St. Louis Fed's FRED datasets, the argument is empirically analyzed based on yearly data for the period 1984-2011 in the USA. The results confirm the existence of a long-term relationship of causality. Applying a vector auto regressive (VAR) model to the data, we find that the variance in market concentration markup due to consumption dispersion starts to rise after the fourth period and reaches 41% in the tenth period.
J82|Labor Heterogeneity and the Pattern of Trade|This article combines data on trade flows with a novel construction of the distribution of skill in the population, based on the results from the International Adult Literacy Survey of the OECD, to evaluate the empirical importance of the distribution of talent as a determinant of the sectoral pattern of trade. It is found that both the mean and standard deviation of the distribution of skills are significant determinants of the pattern of trade. According to the results, cross-country differences in the distribution of skills explain more of the sectoral pattern of trade than differences in capital stocks and differences in indicators of a country's institutional framework.
J82|Human Capital Formation during the First Industrial Revolution: Evidence from the Use of Steam Engines|This paper explores the effect of technological change on human capital formation during the early phases of England’s Industrial Revolution. Following the methodology used in Franck and Galor (2016), we consider the adoption of steam engines as an indicator of technical change, examining the correlation between industrialisation and human capital by performing cross-sectional regression analyses using county-level variation in the number of steam engines installed in England by 1800. Using exogenous variation in carboniferous rock strata as an instrument for the regional distribution of steam engines, we find that technological change as captured by steam technology significantly improved the average working skills of the labour force. In particular, places with more steam engines had lower shares of unskilled workers and higher shares of highly-skilled mechanical workmen deemed important by Mokyr (2005) in the Industrial Revolution. Technological change was, however, not conducive to elementary education. Literacy rates and school enrollment rates were not systematically different in places with more steam engines. This diverse response to new technology highlights the ambiguous effects of early industrialisation on the formation of human capital.
J82|Income Distribution in Latin America. The Evolution in the Last 20 Years: A Global Approach|While Latin America has historically been considered a region of very high inequality, the performance of most Latin American countries in terms of reduction of income inequality has been remarkable good in the first decade of this century. Given that those improvements took place in a context of rising inequality in most of the world, the evolution of income inequality in the region has caught the attention of researchers and policy makers around the world. Taking advantage of a large database of comparable microdata from household surveys, this article updates the evidence on the trends of income inequality in all Latin American countries for the period 1992-2015. It also provides an analysis of how the distinctive evolution of income inequality in this century in Latin America has changed the position of the different countries of the region in both, the global distribution of income in the world and the global distribution of income in Latin America. Finally, the paper decomposes the evolution of income inequality in several countries of the region, discussing the role played by several factors on that evolution.
J82|Creative and science-oriented employees and firm-level innovation|This paper examines the link between innovation and the endowments of creative and science-oriented STEM - Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics - workers at the level of the firm and at the city-/regional-level in Germany. It also looks into whether the presence of these two groups of workers has greater benefits for larger cities than smaller locations, thus justifying policies to attract these workers in order to make German cities 'smarter'. The empirical analysis is based on a probit estimation, covering 115,000 firm-level observations between 1998 and 2015. The results highlight that firms that employ creative and STEM workers are more innovative than those that do not. However, the positive connection of creative workers to innovation is limited to the boundaries of the firm, whereas that of STEM workers is as associated to the generation of considerable innovation spillovers. Hence, attracting STEM workers is more likely to end up making German cities smarter than focusing exclusively on creative workers.
J82|Do Equal Employment Opportunity Statements Backfire? Evidence From A Natural Field Experiment On Job-Entry Decisions|Labor force composition and the allocation of talent remain of vital import to modern economies. For their part, governments and companies around the globe have implemented equal employment opportunity (EEO) regulations to influence labor market flows. Even though such regulations are pervasive, surprisingly little is known about their impacts. We use a natural field experiment conducted across 10 U.S. cities to investigate if EEO statements in job advertisements affect the first step in the employment process, application rates. Making use of data from nearly 2,500 job seekers, we find considerable policy effects, but in an unexpected direction: the presence of an EEO statement dampens rather than encourages racial minorities’ willingness to apply for jobs. Importantly, the effects are particularly pronounced for educated job seekers and in cities with white majority populations. Complementary survey evidence suggests the underlying mechanism at work is “tokenism”, revealing that EEO statements backfire because racial minorities avoid environments in which they are perceived as regulatory, or symbolic, hires rather than being hired on their own merits. Beyond their practical and theoretical importance, our results highlight how field experiments can significantly improve policymaking. In this case, if one goal of EEO regulations is to enhance the pool of minority applicants, then it is not working.
J82|Temporary Employment Contracts and Household Income|It is widely accepted that temporary jobs tend to be associated with low pay which, in turn, will have negative consequences for household income. Evidence in support of such claims, however, is surprisingly thin. This study seeks to fill this void. In articular, it is both the first study to examine the consequences of temporary employment for workers’ household income within a multivariate framework, and the first to quantify the relative importance of the different channels through which temporary employment affects income. Fixed-effects regression and decomposition analyses are applied to longitudinal survey data from Australia, a country where the incidence of temporary forms of employment, and especially casual work, are very high by Western standards. As expected, workers in casual and temporary agency employment are found to live in households with lower average incomes. In contrast, employment on a fixed-term contract is not associated with living in a household with a significantly lower income. The estimated size of the income penalty, relative to households of comparable permanent employees, is about 5% for temporary agency workers and 12% for casual employees. These differentials, however, are not primarily the result of lower wages, but instead are due to the fewer hours worked by these groups. In the case of casual workers, lower annual individual earnings are partly offset by higher incomes of other household members. This compensatory effect, however, is relatively modest in size – the income gap with permanent workers remains substantial.
J82|An Integrated Analysis of the Impact of Gender Diversity on Innovation and Productivity in Manufacturing Firms|This paper presents evidence of the effects of gender diversity on firm innovation outcomes and their productivity in Colombian manufacturing firms, by extending a CDM model to include women’s participation in science, technology and innovation (STI) activities and production processes. The paper makes a methodological contribution by taking into account potential endogeneity issues of women’s participation in STI and innovation behavior. An upward bias of the impact of gender diversity on innovation might arise because more dynamic and innovative managers, knowing the value of gender diversity, may also hire more women in STI. The paper addresses the endogeneity concerns with a Tobit specification of the firm’s decision to employ women in STI by instrumenting it with the share of total women in the workforce in the industry or the region where the firm is located. The main results indicate that firms with a larger share of women in the knowledge creation and innovation process might increase their innovative behavior. It also presents evidence of a differentiated effect of gender diversity by type of innovation. Women’s participation has a larger effect on technological innovation than on organizational innovation. Finally, gender diversity drives firm productivity, even after controlling for the effect of innovation on the production process. These results are important for developing countries where women’s participation in STI activities is extremely low. In Colombia, for example, only 6 percent of STI employees are women, a very low figure compared with the 21 percent participation of women in industry and even lower compared with the 52 percent of women in Colombia’s total work force. These figures and this paper’s results should open up discussion on policies to promote women’s participation in the labor force in manufacturing firms, specifically in the knowledge creation processes.
J82|Explaining the MENA Paradox: Rising Educational Attainment, Yet Stagnant Female Labor Force Participation|"Despite rapidly rising female educational attainment and the closing if not reversal of the gender gap in education, female labor force participation rates in the MENA region remain low and stagnant, a phenomenon that has come to be known as the ""MENA paradox."" Even if increases in participation are observed, they are typically in the form of rising unemployment. We argue in this paper that female labor force participation among educated women in four MENA countries - Algeria, Egypt, Jordan and Tunisia - is constrained by adverse developments in the structure of employment opportunities on the demand side. Specifically, we argue that the contraction in public sector employment opportunities has not been made up by a commensurate increase in opportunities in the formal private sector, leading to increases in female unemployment or declines in participation. We use multinomial logit models estimated on annual labor force survey data by country to simulate trends in female participation in different labor market states (public sector, private wage work, non-wage work, unemployment and non-participation) for married and unmarried women of a given educational and age profile. Our results confirm that the decline in the probability of public sector employment for women with higher education is associated with either an increase in unemployment or a decline in participation."
J82|Firm-level labor demand for and macroeconomic increases in non-regular workers in Japan|The purpose of this study is to account for the increase in non-regular workers, namely, part-time and dispatched workers, in the Japanese economy from the early 2000s. We use a firm-level panel dataset extracted from an administrative survey and distinguish between the short-run and long-run determinants of non-regular labor demand. Using the estimated parameters of the labor demand function, we decompose the rate of increase in the macroeconomic non-regular worker ratio into determinant factor contributions. Our major results can be summarized as follows. First, the firm-level determinants of the demand for part-time and dispatched workers significantly differ. Second, our results suggest that the creation of part-time jobs stimulated by the increased female labor supply plays an essential role in non-regular worker growth relative to direct demand-side factors. On the contrary, increases in both the elderly and the female labor supply have reduced demand for dispatched workers. Third, the microeconomic demand conditions for non-regular labor are widely dispersed among firms. Neither the micro demand factors examined in this study nor industrial differences can explain this heterogeneity.

J82|Endogenous Altruism, Learning by Doing Effect and Impact of Domestic Policies on Child Labour|This paper builds an overlapping generations household economy model where child labour is present. We argue that the degree of parental altruism is determined by the level of schooling of the parent. A more educated parent has more willingness to invest in human capital formation of child. These differences in preferences of parent towards offspring’s schooling bear significant effects on the long run dynamics of schooling. In this context, we study the efficacy of child labour ban vis-a-vis education subsidy in enhancing schooling and reducing child labour. In an extension of the basic model, we also study the dynamics of schooling in the presence of learning by doing effect in unskilled work.
J82|Recent Research on the Minimum Wage: Implications for Missouri|I discuss the sources of the policy disputes surrounding the mini-mum wage, both theoretical and empirical. I focus on recent research, particularly on margins other than the level of employment, and ex-amine the distributional implications of minimum wage increases. I consider the impacts of recent proposals to increase the minimum wage in the state of Missouri.
J82|Returns to Education and Female Work Force Participation Nexus: Evidence from India|In this paper, we make an attempt to understand whether low labour market returns to education in India are responsible for low female work participation. The National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) Employment Unemployment Survey (EUS) unit level data of India for the year 2011-12 is used to examine the relationship between educational attainment and labour market participation through gender lens. Results show that women’s education has a U-shaped relationship with paid work participation. The probability to participate in the paid labour market shows an increasing trend with education levels higher than compulsory secondary schooling. The labour market returns to education are insignificant and low for lower levels of education. The returns increase significantly along with the increase in educational levels. However, females have a significant lower rate of return for each year of education as compared to men in rural and urban labour markets as well. Though it has been said that increase in female enrolment in schooling is one of the reasons of the recent declining phenomenon of female participation, but our study shows that the low returns to education is another reason for their less participation. The findings therefore suggest that, women need to be educated above secondary level to become visible in the labour market.
J82|Matching efficiency and labour market heterogeneity in the United Kingdom|This paper investigates how compositional changes in the UK labour market affect the matching process between vacancies and job seekers. We augment a state space representation of the aggregate matching function with a measure of job seekers’ ‘search intensity’ that is recovered from micro-data on individual unemployment-to-employment transitions, in line with recent developments in the literature. The baseline results show that matching efficiency declined by around 15% between 1995 and 2010 but subsequently recovered by about 5 percentage points in the last six years. Compositional changes in the labour force that improved aggregate search intensity prior to the 2008 recession will tend to obscure the decline in aggregate matching efficiency unless controlled for properly. Considering broader definitions of job seekers that include marginally-attached workers and on-the-job searchers exacerbates the registered decline in matching efficiency. Changes in ‘recruiting intensity’ and the share of vacancies posted by different industries provide a potential explanation for some, but not all, of the initial fall in matching efficiency that preceded the 2007–08 recession. Finally, we quantitatively analyse how labour force heterogeneity and changes in matching efficiency have affected the shape and location of the UK Beveridge Curve.
J82|Are Immigrants in Favour of Immigration? Evidence from England and Wales|Using the UK Citizenship Survey for the years 2007–2010, this paper investigates how immigrants view immigration and how these views compare to the views of natives. Immigrants who have been in the UK longer are similar to natives in being opposed to further immigration, while recent immigrants are more in favour of further immigration. Labour market concerns do not play a large role for either immigrants or natives. However, there is some evidence that financial and economic shocks can increase anti-immigration sentiments.
J82|La diaspora malagasy en France et dans le monde : une communauté invisible ?|"(english) Based on existing databases at the international and national levels, this study aims to better understand the migrant community from Madagascar: how many are there? What kind of migration is at stake and how do flows evolve over time? Where do migrants live? Who are they? What are their living conditions? How do they fit into their host country? These are the questions we intend to answer. Although exclusively focused on migrants at their point of arrival, the answer to the previous questions shed light on Madagascar's original and ambiguous relationship abroad and in the world. Their profile and their way of integration in the host societies give indirectly to see what they come to look for, possibly highlight characteristic features specific to ""Madagascar"", and finally inform on the mobilization potential for the development of Madagascar, and eternal sea serpent that could perhaps one day come to fruition. More prosaically, our study should allow the Malagasy diaspora to count itself, to get to know oneself better and perhaps to strengthen its ties with Madagascar. The discovery that the Malagasy diaspora in France is the largest of the sub-Saharan communities is one of the striking and most unexpected results of this work. _________________________________ (français) Partant des bases de données existantes aux niveaux international et national, cette étude vise à mieux connaître la communauté des migrants originaires de Madagascar : combien sont-ils ? De quel type de migration s’agit-il et comment les flux évoluent-ils dans le temps ? Où résident-ils ? Qui sont-ils ? Quelles sont leurs conditions de vie ? Comment s’insèrent-ils dans leur pays d’accueil ? Autant de questions auxquelles nous tentons d’apporter des éléments de réponse. Bien qu’exclusivement centré sur les migrants à leur point d’arrivée, la réponse aux questions précédentes éclaire en creux le rapport original et ambigu de Madagascar à l’étranger et au monde. Ainsi, leur profil et leur mode d’insertion dans les sociétés d’accueil donnent indirectement à voir ce qu’ils viennent chercher, mettent éventuellement en lumière des traits caractéristiques propres à « Madagascar », et enfin informent sur le potentiel de mobilisation pour le développement de Madagascar, éternel serpent de mer qui pourrait peut-être un jour se concrétiser. Plus prosaïquement, notre étude doit permettre à la diaspora malgache de se compter, de mieux se connaitre et peut-être de resserrer les liens avec Madagascar. La découverte que la diaspora malgache est la plus nombreuse des communautés sub-saharienne en France est un des résultats marquant et le plus inattendu de ce travail."
J82|Women Workforce in the Korean Context|The social participation of women workforce in the labour market is now more prevalent than ever, however the promotion opportunities for women employees are limited compared to men in the Korean context. The article explores the impact of the Confucian tradition on women employees and as a result the traditional value causes difficulties for women employees to gain promotion than men in organisations. Also this article discusses why Korean women need to overcome the “glass ceiling” more compared to other countries. In addition, this article examines the factors which impact women employees to curtail work efficiency in service companies. Lastly, this article brings different actors of human resource managers, trade union representatives and employees together to fully understand the gender relations at workplaces.
J82|Mind the gap: A detailed picture of the immigrant-native earnings gap in the UK using longitudinal data between 1978 and 2006|Using the underexplored, sizeable and long Lifetime Labour Market Database (LLMDB), we estimated the immigrant-native earnings gap across the entire earnings distribution, across continents of nationality, across cohorts of arrival, across years and across regions in the UK between 1978 and 2006. We exploited the longitudinal nature of our data to separate the effect of observed and unobserved individual characteristics on earnings. In keeping with the limited existing UK literature, we found a clear and wide dividing line between whites and non-whites in simple comparable models. However, in our more complete models, when we accounted for unobservable individual characteristics – an important contribution of this paper – we found a much narrower and subtler dividing line. This suggests that the labour market primarily rewards individual characteristics other than immigration status. This, in turn, facilitates the assimilation of immigrants into the UK labour market. We also found that the lowest paid immigrants, whom are disproportionately non-white, suffer an earnings penalty in the labour market, whereas higher paid immigrants, whom are disproportionately white, do not. Finally, we found less favourable earning gaps for cohorts that witnessed proportionately larger non-white and lower paid white immigration.
J82|Does Assigning More Women to Managerial Positions Enhance Firm Productivity? Evidence from Sweden|We analyze whether gender composition at non-board managerial levels has any impact on firm productivity and other related outcomes in the service sector using a linked employer-employee dataset from Sweden. Exploiting within-firm variation, we apply a difference-in-differences propensity score matching method to address an endogeneity issue. Our results suggest no significant effects on productivity but significant positive effects on firms' growth in terms of value added and labor inputs when a firm “replaces” a male manager with a woman. We do not observe any impact when a firm “appoints” a woman instead of a man to a new managerial position.
J82|Do seniority rules protect older workers? Age composition effects of the last-in-first-out principle|Employment protection legislation is often motivated by the need to increase security for older workers. Sweden has even implemented a last-in-first-out principle (LIFO), stipulating that the last hired employee should be dismissed first in the case of lay-offs. A reform in 2001 made it possible for firms with fewer than 11 employees to exclude two workers from the LIFO principle. If the LIFO regulation is serving its purpose, the reform should lead to a weakened labor market position for older workers. This study analyzes the effect of the reform on labor market flows for different age groups – with a special focus on the effects for older workers – using a difference-in-difference regression model. The results show that firms with 7-9 employees increased their recruitment from unemployment and from outside the workforce due to the reform, while the reform had no effect on separations. The increased hires came mostly from workers younger than 25 who were previously not in the workforce or were unemployed, meaning that the reform lowered youth unemployment. There is some indication of workers aged 55-64 moving to another workplace but not leaving the workforce or becoming unemployed, suggesting that the reform did not weaken the labor market position of older workers.
J82|Employment Protection Legislation and the Labor Market Position of Immigrants - A Natural Experiment|How does employment protection legislation affect the labor market position of immigrants? We investigate this question, which has scarcely been studied in a robust way previously, even though it is highly relevant from a policy perspective. A natural experiment enables us to identify a causal relationship between the reform of an employment protection law and the employment status of immigrants in Sweden. The experiment took the form of a partial reform of the Swedish employment protection law in 2001, which made it possible for firms with ten employees or less to exclude two workers from the last-in-first-out rule when dismissing personnel. Our results show that the reform positively affected the decision to hire groups that were relatively close to insider status but that the reform had no effect on decisions to hire non-western immigrants. We also find that the reform mainly increased net-hires of natives that were unemployed or outside the workforce, showing the importance of considering the labor market status of individuals when evaluating the effects of changes in employment protection legislation.
J82|MacroeconomÃ­a Y ConciliaciÃ³n Familiar: El Impacto EconÃ³mico De Los Jardines Infantiles|En esta investigaciÃ³n estudiamos los efectos agregados de la conciliaciÃ³n familiar, medido a travÃ©s, del efecto de los jardines infantiles. Tomamos como caso el de Chile, que, a pesar de haber implementado importantes reformas modernizadoras en la economÃ­a, aÃºn registra tasas bajas de participaciÃ³n femenina. Usando un modelo macro estÃ¡ndar, estimado economÃ©tricamente, se muestra que hay importantes ganancias en aumentar los servicios de jardines infantiles a travÃ©s de la productividad mÃ©s que por un aumento de la oferta laboral, punto que remarca la literatura de conciliaciÃ©n trabajo y familiar mÃ¡s que la literatura macro tradicional. La segunda contribuciÃ³n es que los cambios en la composiciÃ³n del financiamiento entre trabajadores y empresas se diluyen en la economÃ­a a nivel agregado. AsÃ­, la principal consecuencia de polÃ­tica econÃ³mica para otras economÃ­as con bajas tasas de participaciÃ³n femenina es que aumentar los niveles de conciliaciÃ³n trabajo y familia, y por tanto la productividad, tienen importantes efectos positivos a nivel macroeconÃ³mico sin que los costos de su financiamiento compensen los beneficios.
J82|Segregation of women into low-paying occupations in the US|We present an approach to measure the stratification of occupations by sex. For that, we extend the conventional framework for measuring gender segregation to take into account the quality of jobs (e.g. average earnings) predominantly held by each sex. We complement segregation curves and measures derived from them, with their associated concentration curves and indices, to determine whether women are segregated into low-paying jobs. We investigate with this approach the long-term trends of gender segregation and stratification of occupations by sex in the US using census data. Our results show that de-stratification of occupations by sex was more intense than their desegregation, and lasted longer, even after segregation had stagnated. Neither segregation nor stratification levels can be explained by the different characteristics of male and female workforces, although the profound changes in the composition of workers over time (e.g. education, marital status) did help to substantially explain their trends. Changes in the earnings structure favoring occupations held by women since 1980 additionally contributed to reduce stratification over time. Finally, changes in the conditional occupational distribution by sex only reduced segregation and stratification before 1990.
J82|Husband's Unemployment and Wife's Labor Supply – The Added Worker Effect across Europe|This paper investigates the responsiveness of women's labor supply to their husband's loss of employment - the so-called added worker effect. While previous empirical literature on this topic mainly concentrates on a single country, we take an explicit internationally comparative perspective and analyze whether the added worker effect varies across the European countries. In doing so, we use longitudinal data from the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) covering the period 2004 to 2011. For our pooled sample of 28 European countries, we find evidence for the existence of an added worker effect, both at the extensive and at the intensive margin of labor supply. Women whose husbands become unemployed have a higher probability of entering the labor market and changing from part-time to full-time employment than women whose husbands remain employed. However, our results further reveal that the added worker effect varies over both the business cycle and the different welfare regimes within Europe.
J82|Returns to Education and Female Participation Nexus: Evidence from India|Abstract In this paper, we aim to understand whether low labour market returns to education in India are responsible for low female work participation. The National Sample Survey Office—Employment Unemployment Survey unit level data of India for the year 2011–2012 is used to examine the relationship between educational attainment and labour market participation through gender lens. Results show that women’s education has a U-shaped relationship with paid work participation. The probability to participate in the paid labour market increases with education levels higher than compulsory secondary schooling. The labour market returns to education are insignificant and low for lower levels of education, increasing significantly along the educational levels. Technical education equivalent to degree level or above has high returns for men and women. However, women with technical education have very low levels of participation. Vocational training also provides a positive return. Our results suggest that to increase participation, women need to be educated above secondary level and receive broader technical education and more vocational training.
J82|The Vanishing Middle Class: Prejudice and Power in a Dual Economy|"The United States is becoming a nation of rich and poor, with few families in the middle. In this book, MIT economist Peter Temin offers an illuminating way to look at the vanishing middle class. Temin argues that American history and politics, particularly slavery and its aftermath, play an important part in the widening gap between rich and poor. Temin employs a well-known, simple model of a dual economy to examine the dynamics of the rich/poor divide in America, and outlines ways to work toward greater equality so that America will no longer have one economy for the rich and one for the poor. Many poorer Americans live in conditions resembling those of a developing country—substandard education, dilapidated housing, and few stable employment opportunities. And although almost half of black Americans are poor, most poor people are not black. Conservative white politicians still appeal to the racism of poor white voters to get support for policies that harm low-income people as a whole, casting recipients of social programs as the Other—black, Latino, not like ""us."" Politicians also use mass incarceration as a tool to keep black and Latino Americans from participating fully in society. Money goes to a vast entrenched prison system rather than to education. In the dual justice system, the rich pay fines and the poor go to jail."
J82|Home Bias in Global Employment| We study the nature of home bias in online employment, wherein the employers prefer workers from their own home countries. Using a unique large-scale dataset from a major online labor platform, we identify employers’ home bias in their online employment decisions. Moreover, we find that employers from countries with high traditional values, lower diversity, and smaller (user) population size, tend to have a stronger home bias. Further, we investigate the nature of employers’ home bias using a quasi-natural experiment wherein the platform introduces a monitoring system to facilitate employers to keep track of workers’ progress in time-based projects. After matching comparable fixed-price projects as a control group using propensity score matching, our difference-in-difference estimations show that the home bias does exist in online employment, and at least 40.93% of home bias is driven by statistical discrimination.
J82|‘Private sector’ Emiratisation: job satisfaction and sociocultural influences|Purpose — To gauge the job satisfaction levels of UAE nationals employed in the (‘real’ and quasi-) private sector. Despite private sector Emiratisation (labour market nationalisation) having been in place since the late 1990s and considered a strategic government priority in 2007, the numbers of nationals employed in the private sector as a ratio to those employed in the public sector remains particularly low. Design/methodology/approach — This study is based on a survey of 653 nationals employed in the non-classic sector (i.e., working at commercially-run entities). The instrument used was based on the Job Satisfaction Survey construct and assessed, inter alia, the impact of sectoral pay and benefit discrepancies and prevailing societal sentiment towards the ‘appropriacy’ of pursuing a non-conventional career path. Findings — statistically significant relationships between the dependent variable of “continuance intentions” and various predictor variables were observed: β .399 for salary and benefits; whilst sociocultural influences was found to have a significant and negative relationship, β -.423. Originality/value — This research can help in a) identifying and prioritising the economic and social issues that are impacting the pace of Emiratisation and b) in understanding what incentives and measures can be useful and effective for the operational implementation of labour nationalisation policies throughout the Arab Gulf and therefore adds to the growing body of literature on an Arab Middle East HRM model.
J82|Child Labour: what do the survey results in Georgia show|The child labour is very important problem in the world. The statistical findings based on the survey results, providing details on child labour phenomenon in Georgia, its dimensions and scope, including characteristics and results. According to the survey 5.8% of children aged 5-17 are economically active. The boys account for 76.5% of employed children aged 5-17. Children engaged in economic activities constitute 1.6% in urban and 11.4% in rural areas. The educational level of parents of children in child labour is relatively low compared to the educational level of non-working children. Poverty and low income are among the main causes of child labour.
J82|The work treatment in the textile industry of mid-18th century Andalusia: Laujar de Andarax (Almería) and Úbeda (Jaén)|The objectives that emerge from this contribution are manifold. First, study the kinds of employment contracts for those who work in the textile industry of wool, silk and linen in the 18th century Andalusia was regulated. This is used the information from particular responses or memorials of the Cadastre of Ensenada (1751-52) on Laujar de Andarax (Almería) and Úbeda (Jaén). Such contracts which were established in agriculture, livestock and service sectors of these same locations are compared. Finally, discusses the differences that existed in the business dealings of women with respect to men. Following the introduction, the socio-economic context of the tested locations, the textile activity developed in them within the Andalusian mid eighteenth century environment, addresses for ending the study of treatment and working arrangements and annual incomes that were established in textile manufacturing in comparison with the remaining working activities of women and men and their corresponding conclusions.
J82|La tasa de actividad femenina en el siglo xviii en dos municipios andaluces: Laujar de Andarax (Almería) y Úbeda (Jaén)|This article analyses the female labour participation rates of Laujar de Andarax (Almería) and Úbeda (Jaén), both in Andalusia, in the mid-eighteenth century, representative locations of manufacturing activity linked to wool textile in the South of Spain. A database was composed including 12,195 inhabitants using the records of the Ensenada Cadastre of 1751-1752. The impact of the demand factors was established: A local economy with a relatively stronger presence of the secondary and tertiary sector, especially the textile sector; and the supply factors: life cycles, marital status, number of children, occupation and age of husbands. This study concludes that the female activity rates were 54.2% in Laujar, and 27.4% in Úbeda, and the 2 most important occupations were in the textile industry and domestic service. The local perspective shows that demand factors had a strong influence. KEY Classification-JEL: J16. J21. J82. R23
J82|The Impact of Race and Inequality on Human Capital Formation in Latin America During the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries|In this paper we analyze the reasons behind the delay of the spread of education in Latin America and its relationship with income inequality and race. While the racial composition of the population was behind the low literacy levels obtained during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries, racial inequality and its impact on education and educational inequality decreased during the last decades of the 20th century. Nonetheless educational levels lagged behind those of the OECD countries even during the late 20th century. We also find that the spread of primary and to a lesser extent secondary school during the 20th century can explain the sharp decrease of educational inequality during the same time period. Nonetheless this diminution of educational inequality did not have any impact on the diminution of income inequality at least during the 20th century. While this paper gives consistent results on race and inequality on human capital formation, the trends and causes of the long run evolution of income inequality till the beginnings of the 21st century are still a controversial research topic that we want to further discuss in other forthcoming contributions.
J82|Back to Basics: Basic Research Spillovers, Innovation Policy and Growth|This paper introduces endogenous technical change through basic and applied research in a growth model. Basic research differs from applied research in two significant ways. First, significant advances in technological knowledge come through basic research rather than applied research. Second, these significant advances could potentially be applicable to multiple industries. Since these applications are not immediate, the innovating firm cannot exploit all the benefits of the basic innovations for production. We analyze the impact of this appropriability problem on firmsÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Ã‚ basic research incentives in an endogenous growth framework with private firms and an academic sector. After characterizing the equilibrium, we estimate our model using micro level data on research expenditures and behavior by French firms. We then decompose the aggregate growth by the source and type of innovation. Moreover, we quantitatively document the size of the underinvestment in basic research and consider various research policies to alleviate this inefficiency. Our analysis highlights the need for devoting a larger fraction of GDP for basic academic research, as well as higher subsidy rates for private research.
J82|Chronicle of a Deceleration Foretold: Income inequality in Latin America in the 2010s|After a decade of strong progress toward the goal of reducing the high levels of income disparities, there are clear signs of a deceleration in the pace of inequality reduction in Latin America. This paper argues that the deceleration is the result of two set of reasons. First, several of the driving factors of the fall in inequality in the 2000s have lost strength, due to “natural” motives; and second, the external conditions faced by the Latin American economies have worsened in the early 2010s, making further reductions in inequality more difficult.
J82|Health Capacity to Work at Older Ages: Evidence from Spain|In a world with limited PAYGO financing possibilities this paper explores whether older Spanish individuals have the health capacity to work longer. For that purpose we use Milligan-Wise and Cutler-Meara Cutler-Meara-Richards-Shubik simulation methods. Our results suggest that Spanish workers have significant additional capacities to extend their working careers.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J82|The Wealth Paradox for Whom? Child Labor and the Identification of Households Excluded from the Land and the Labor Markets in Madagascar|"The paper aims at identifying households who have their children work more because their access is constrained on the land and the labor markets. Data from the 2005 ""Enquête auprès des Ménages"" (EPM) collected in Madagascar provide information on the amount of hours worked by each household member along with measures for market imperfections. A simple theoretical model highlights that land should not influence the number of hours of child work when the household can fully access the land or the labor markets. When the access is limited in both markets, land may impact the amount of child work whereas the external wage should not. Using a switching regression model with unknown sample separation to classify households in the two regimes (constrained or not), this paper shows that not belonging to the largest ethnic group at the local level significantly decreases access to the market. The same result holds for religion, thereby highlighting the importance of the informal market. Abstract The paper aims at identifying households who have their children work more because their"

J82|Perverse Consequences of Well Intentioned Regulation: Evidence from India's Child Labor Ban|While bans against child labor are a common policy tool, there is very little empirical evidence validating their effectiveness. In this paper, we examine the consequences of India's landmark legislation against child labor, the Child Labor (Prohibition and Regulation) Act of 1986. Using data from employment surveys conducted before and after the ban, and using age restrictions that determined who the ban applied to, we show that child wages decrease and child labor increases after the ban. These results are consistent with a theoretical model building on the seminal work of Basu and Van (1998) and Basu (2005), where families use child labor to reach subsistence constraints and where child wages decrease in response to bans, leading poor families to utilize more child labor. The increase in child labor comes at the expense of reduced school enrollment. We also examine the effects of the ban at the household level. Using linked consumption and expenditure data, we find that along various margins of household expenditure, consumption, calorie intake and asset holdings, households are worse off after the ban.
J82|Workplace Disability: Whose Wellbeing Does It Affect?|The paper examines the link between workplace disability (WD) and job satisfaction (JS) in Britain using linked data from WESR2011. The results obtained indicate workplaces with respondents with disabilities report lower JS vis-à-vis workplaces without such respondents in the private sector. Within private sector workplaces with mixed respondents, the JS of respondents without disabilities declines with the percentage of respondents with disabilities. Also, workplace disability policies and practices are positively (negatively) associated with the JS of respondents with (without) disabilities in the sector. The sector may have to re-examine its dealings with issues of workplace disability.
J82|Men, Women and Unions|The paper re-examines the question of why unions might have declined despite the 'influx' of women, their risk-averse constituents, into British workplaces. It argues that given unions' role in minimising risk, membership should have been boosted. The paper reviews different strands of the literature and conducts empirical analyses using panel data from WERS. The results obtained suggest that men have been deserting unions and that there is an inverse link between membership and the share of women in workplaces. The paper ponders if better management of gender relations may improve unions' fate.
J82|Faces of Joblessness: Characterising Employment Barriers to Inform Policy|This paper proposes a novel method for identifying and visualising key employment obstacles that may prevent individuals from participating fully in the labour market. The approach is intended to complement existing sources of information that governments use when designing and implementing activation and employment-support policies. In particular, it aims to provide individual and household perspectives on employment problems, which may be missed when relying on common labour-force statistics or on administrative data, but which are relevant for targeting and tailoring support programmes and related policy interventions. A first step describes a series of employment-barrier indicators at the micro level, comprising three domains: work-related capabilities, financial incentives and employment opportunities. For each domain, a selected set of concrete employment barriers are quantified using the EU-SILC multi-purpose household survey. In a second step, a statistical clustering method (latent class analysis), is used to establish profiles and patterns of employment barriers among individuals with no or weak labour-market attachment. A detailed illustration for two countries (Estonia and Spain) shows that “short-hand” groupings that are often highlighted in the policy debate, such as “youth” or “older workers”, are in fact composed of multiple distinct sub-groups that face very different combinations of employment barriers and likely require different policy approaches. Results also indicate that individuals typically face two or more simultaneous employment obstacles suggesting that addressing one barrier at a time may not have the intended effect on employment levels. From a policy perspective, the results support calls for carefully sequencing activation and employment support measures, and for coordinating them across policy domains and institutions. Cet article propose une nouvelle méthode pour identifier et visualiser les obstacles qui empêchent les individus éloignés de l’emploi de s’intégrer pleinement au marché du travail. L’approche se positionne en complément des sources d’information actuellement utilisées par les administrations pour la conception et la mise en oeuvre des politiques d’activation et de retour à l’emploi. Elle fournit une nouvelle perspective, au niveau des individus et des familles, sur les barrières à l’emploi qui ne sont pas capturées par les approches s’appuyant uniquement sur des données administratives et sur des statistiques sur le marché du travail, qui peut s’avérer très utile pour cibler et adapter des programmes sociaux. La première partie décrit, au niveau microéconomique, un ensemble de barrières à l’emploi couvrant trois domaines : les capacités individuelles (liées au travail), les incitations financières (à travailler) et les opportunités (de trouver un emploi). Pour chaque domaine, des barrières concrètes sont mesurées à l’aide de l’enquête EU-SILC. Ensuite, une méthode de classification, le modèle à Classes Latentes, est utilisée pour regrouper les individus dont l’attachement au marché du travail est inexistant ou très faible sur la base des barrières à l’emploi auxquelles ils font face. La méthode est illustrée par des résultats détaillés sur deux pays (Estonie et Espagne). Les résultats montrent que des groupes souvent identifiés dans le débat politique par des caractéristiques simples telles que « les jeunes » ou « les travailleurs âgés » sont en réalité composés de sous-groupes confrontés à des combinaisons de problèmes très différentes et nécessitant donc des programmes et interventions différents. Très fréquemment, les individus font face à plus d’une barrière à la fois. Ceci suggère que les politiques ciblant les problèmes de manière isolée pourraient avoir un effet sur l’emploi moindre qu’escompté. Placés dans une perspective de politique sociale, ces résultats invitent à soigneusement séquencer les programmes d’activation et de retour à l’emploi et à les coordonner entre les différentes institutions.
J82|Child labour and inequality|This paper focuses on the role that inequality plays in shaping political support for child labour regulation policies. We provide a model of the evolution of child labour, fertility and human capital where the heterogeneity between low- and high-skilled workers allows for an endogenous analysis of inequality generated by child labour. Depending on the initial level of inequality, child labour regulation policies can affect the welfare of low- and high-skilled workers in different ways and therefore can have an impact on political support for their introduction. The possible conflicts of interest that may arise between the two groups can help explain the difficulties that many governments have when dealing with the issue of child labour.

J82|A Study of the Process and Types of Deindustrialization in the Visegrád Countries|My goal in this article is to analyze the process of deindustrialization from the aspect of the labor market. Accepting the definition of the relevant literature, I define deindustrialization as a decline in the number of workers employed in industry and a drop in their ratio on the labor market. My experimental question is whether deindustrialization was present in the Visegrád countries between 1993 and 2015, and if so, what kinds can be identified. In this work I merge the observations of developed countries regarding deindustrialization and also expand upon the methodology for defining the types of deindustrialization.
J82|Socio-economic transitions on the labour market : a European benchmarking exercise|The dynamics of the unemployment rate can be seen as the outcome of movements in the inflow into unemployment (i.e. the job separation rate) and movements of the outflow from unemployment (i.e. the job-finding rate). The article describes those rates during the period 1998-2014 for seven countries (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Spain, Sweden and United Kingdom), estimated on the basis of the harmonised labour force surveys. In all those countries, the job separation rate largely explains the variability of the unemployment rate. The job-finding rate also contributes to that variability, but is not the driving force except in France and Spain. The multivariate analysis reveals that education and age are important determinants, apart from the business cycle. The job-finding rate appears to be very low in Belgium compared to the other examined countries, although that is due in part to a statistical phenomenon
J82|A structural analysis of the effects of the Great Recession on retirement and working longer by members of two-earner households|This paper uses data from the Health and Retirement Study to estimate a structural model of household retirement and saving. It applies that model to analyze the effects of the Great Recession on the work and retirement of older couples who were both employed full-time at the beginning of the recession. We analyze the effects of job loss, changes in wealth and changes in expectations. The largest overall effects of the Great Recession are observed for 2009 and 2010. In 2009, an additional 2.5 percent of all 55 to 59 year old husbands were not working full-time as result of the Great Recession, amounting to a reduction of 3.2 percent in full-time work. In 2010, 2.8 percent of 55 to 59 year old husbands were not working full-time as a result of the Great Recession, amounting to a 3.8 percent reduction in full-time work. For wives the reductions in full-time work due to the Great Recession were 1.7 percent and 2.2 percent of those who initially held a job, or reductions of full-time work of 2.3 and 3.0 percent respectively. For those 60 to 64, the reductions were 1.2 percent of men and 0.9 percent of women. Having been laid off in the last three years reduces full-time work by 30 percent. There also are lingering effects of layoff on the probability of working longer. Having been laid off three or more years in the past reduces full-time employment in the current year by about 12 percent. This reflects the reduced work incentives for full-time work arising from lower earnings due to the loss of job tenure with a layoff as well as the additional earnings penalty from a layoff. The effect on own work of a spouse having been laid off is much smaller. The reason is that, as found in the estimation of our structural model, having one spouse not working increases the value of leisure for the other. In contrast, when one member of the household loses their job, the value of consumption increases relative to leisure. For recent layoffs, these effects are roughly offsetting.

J82|The Ins and Outs of Employment in 25 OECD Countries|This paper presents quantitative information on labour market flows for 25 OECD countries. It uses household surveys that offer the advantage of reporting monthly transitions between employment, unemployment and economic inactivity for individuals. Between 2005 and 2012, the annual probability of leaving employment averaged 10% across OECD countries. Jobless people have a 30% average probability of finding a job. The analysis uncovers significant cross-country differences and highlights key facts about how labour market flows differ depending on socio-demographic, worker characteristics and the institutional framework. Female, young, low educated and low income workers are at highest risk of becoming jobless. Young jobless individuals have higher chances of finding a job than their older counterparts. Female, low educated and low income jobless individuals face a lower probability of finding a job than others. Les transitions professionnelles dans 25 pays de l’OCDE Cet article présente des données quantitatives concernant les flux de main-d’oeuvre sur le marché du travail dans 25 pays de l’OCDE. Les enquêtes sur lesquelles il repose présentent l’avantage de fournir des informations mensuelles sur les transitions entre emploi, chômage et inactivité au niveau individuel. Entre 2005 et 2012, la probabilité annuelle de quitter son emploi était en moyenne de 10 % dans l’ensemble de la zone OCDE, tandis que la probabilité moyenne de trouver un emploi s’établissait à 30 %. L’analyse met en évidence des différences importantes entre les pays et décrit les grandes évolutions des flux de main-d’oeuvre sur le marché du travail en fonction des caractéristiques sociodémographiques et professionnelles des travailleurs ainsi que du cadre institutionnel. Elle révèle ainsi que les femmes, les jeunes, les moins qualifiés et les travailleurs à faible revenu sont les catégories les plus exposées au risque de perdre son emploi, que les jeunes sans emploi ont davantage de chances de trouver du travail que leurs homologues plus âgés, et que, parmi les personnes sans emploi, les femmes, les travailleurs peu qualifiés et les travailleurs à bas revenu présentent une moindre probabilité de retour à l’emploi.

J82|Profit sharing and its effect on income distribution and output: a Kaleckian approach|This study investigates how profit sharing influences the economy by using a Kaleckian model. Unlike existing research, I endogenise the profit share. The analysis shows that profit sharing decreases or increases the equilibrium capacity utilisation rate depending on whether the productivity-enhancing effect of profit sharing is weak or strong. Moreover, the presented numerical simulations show that the profit-sharing effects on income distributions differ according to the relative strength of the productivity-enhancing effect of profit sharing.
J82|The Labor Market in Azerbaijan|This paper analyzes the development of the labor market in Azerbaijan from the early 1990s until the early 2010s. The analysis shows that the labor market has a range of positive characteristics such as high labor force participation and employment, low youth and female unemployment, flexibility, and a low share of the “working poor”, all of which can beneficially influence future economic prospects. However, the Azerbaijani labor market also experiences certain undesirable developments, such as an increase in the share of labor with primary education, a shift towards elementary occupations, a high share of self-employment, and an excess of labor cost growth over productivity growth, all of which can threaten further economic development.
J82|Learning by doing, low level equilibrium trap, and effect of domestic policies on child labour|This paper builds an overlapping generations household economy model with learning by doing effect in unskilled work. We study the short run equilibrium of schooling, relationship between child schooling and parental schooling, long run dynamics of schooling and human capital and relative effectiveness of two domestic policies- child labour ban and education subsidy on schooling. We find some interesting results. If parents working in unskilled sector do not experience any schooling at their childhood, they will never send their children for schooling. But the relationship between parental schooling and child schooling may not be monotonic. This relationship depends on other factors like subsistence consumption expenditure, learning by doing effect, responsiveness of wage to human capital in skilled sector, efficiency of education technology. Existence of low level equilibrium trap for unskilled parent depends on the specific form of human capital accumulation function. For a certain range of parental schooling time path of child schooling will be oscillating in nature. Decrease in child wage increases steady state schooling only if the maximum possible adult unskilled wage exceeds the sum of the schooling cost and subsistence expenditure of the household. If unskilled adult wage is sufficiently small, education subsidy is more effective in enhancing schooling than banning child labour.
J82|Industrieangestellte – Neue Initiativen der Interessenvertretung in der internen Tertiarisierung (White collar workers: New initiatives of interest representation)|Industrieangestellte nehmen an Zahl und Bedeutung zu. Nicht nur stellen sie inzwischen die Haelfte der Beschaeftigten in den Kernbranchen der Industrie, sie besetzen auch wichtige Positionen in den betrieblichen Hierarchien mit hohem Primaermachtpotenzial. Die Mobilisierung und Organisierung von Industrieangestellten als Waehler, Kompetenztraeger und Mitglieder entscheidet deshalb ueber die Zukunftsfaehigkeit der Interessenvertretungen in den Industriebranchen. Waehrend frueheren angestelltenpolitischen Ansaetzen der Gewerkschaften wenig Erfolg beschieden war, sind in juengerer Zeit von Gewerkschaften und Betriebsraeten neue Initiativen der Angestelltenpolitik entwickelt worden. Diese werden im vorliegenden Beitrag anhand betrieblicher Fallbeispiele untersucht. Die Initiativen haben unterschiedliche thematische Schwerpunkte; gemeinsam ist ihnen jedoch, dass darin die Betriebsraete neue Formen der Rekrutierung und der Arbeitsteilung in den Gremien entwickeln und dass sie Laboratorien neuer Formen der Beteiligung von Beschaeftigten einrichten. Interessenvertretungen gewinnen an Bedeutung als Berater und Helfer zur Selbsthilfe. Gewerkschaftliche Organisationswirkungen stehen und fallen mit der Rolle der Gewerkschaft in lokalen Konflikten und ihrer Organisierungsstrategie. (White collar workers in the German manufacturing sector have outpaced blue collar workers in number and they usually have positions with higher power resources in occupational hierarchies. Therefore it is of crucial importance for the future organisational power of unions and works councils to attract, mobilise and organise them as voters, as a resource with competencies and experience and as members. While former attempts to develop white collar policies have had little success, unions and works councils today have created new initiatives which will be analysed in this paper by focusing on the plant level. The initiatives are characterised by different topics like safeguarding of jobs, wages, health or working time flexibility. However, common denominators of the initiatives are new forms of recruitment, new divisions of work in works council committees and new forms of employee participation created in the course of the initiatives. Works councils are gaining importance by playing roles as consultants of employees and as supporters of the individual capability of the workers to defend their interests. Union organising can be successful if the union plays a central role in local conflicts and if it focuses on a strategy of organising.)
J82|HRM responses to ageing societies in Germany and Japan: Contexts for comparison|This brief introductory discussion develops contexts within which to compare human resource management (HRM) responses to ageing societies in Japan and Germany. Here we define key concepts that occur throughout this Special Issue. While giving due attention to the historical and current contexts for emerging challenges to HRM policy-makers, practitioners and researchers posed by ageing societies in Germany and Japan, we propose that the relevant contexts for interpreting these challenges are essentially global, national, and regional in nature. In conclusion we present a brief overview of the contributions to this Management Review Special Issue.
J82|Diversity management in ageing societies: A comparative study of Germany and Japan|In response to demographic change organizations in Germany and Japan have recently begun to adapt their human resource management practices to embrace employees with diverse backgrounds: e.g. females, foreigners, or older workers (aged fifty and older). Based on a survey of 209 organizations we compare the current situation of diversity management practices in the two countries. Our findings indicate that, due to institutional differences, the scope and focus of diversity management varies significantly. Japanese diversity management focuses primarily on gender, whereas German organizations adopt a broader approach. While Japanese organizations consider communication and HR initiatives more important, German organizations assign a higher importance to practices integrating diversity in everyday work.
J82|Wage Effects of Unionization and Occupational Licensing Coverage in the United States|Recent estimates in standard models of wage determination for both unionization and occupational licensing have shown wage effects that are similar across the two institutions. These cross-sectional estimates use specialized data sets, with small sample sizes, for the period 2006 to 2008. The authorsâ€™ analysis examines the impact of unions and licensing coverage on wage determination using new data collected on licensing statutes that are then linked to longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79) from 1979 to 2010. They develop several approaches, using both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, to measure the impact of these two labor market institutions on wage determination. The estimates of the economic returns to union coverage are greater than those for licensing statutes.
J82|Zmiany struktury zatrudnienia kobiet w Polsce w latach 2000–2013|Celem artykułu jest analiza zawodowej i sektorowej segregacji kobiet na polskim rynku pracy w latach 2000–2013. Przeprowadzono analizę stopnia segregacji kobiet w przekroju wielkich i dużych grup zawodowych oraz w przekroju sekcji PKD. Podjęto też próbę odpowiedzi na pytanie, czy istotny wzrost liczby kobiet z wyższym wykształceniem na polskim rynku pracy przełożył się na zmiany ich struktury zatrudnienia. Przeprowadzone badania wskazują na występowanie zjawiska segregacji zawodowej i sektorowej w Polsce. Struktura zatrudnienia w Polsce wskazuje na dominację kobiet w zawodach i sekcjach uważanych za bardziej kobiece (opieka zdrowotna, edukacja) a dominację mężczyzn w zawodach i sektorach wymagających większego wysiłku fizycznego (budownictwo). Wydaje się zatem, że w dużym stopniu istniejący podział nie jest wynikiem dyskryminacji, a odzwierciedleniem zarówno psychofizycznych, jak i kulturowych uwarunkowań związanych z zatrudnianiem kobiet i mężczyzn. Wejście na rynek pracy dużej liczby kobiet z wyższym poziomem wykształcenia spowodowało wzrost odsetka kobiet pracujących w grupach wymagających wyższych kwalifikacji zawodowych oraz na stanowiskach kierowniczych. Jednocześnie można wskazać na dalszy wzrost koncentracji zatrudnienia kobiet w zawodach i sekcjach sfeminizowanych, a zatrudnienia mężczyzn w zawodach i sekcjach zmaskulinizowanych.
J82|How to Measure Employment Status and Occupation in Analyses of Survey Data? (Jak mierzyc status zatrudnienia i pozycjê zawodowa w analizach danych sondazowych?)|This article presents issues relevant for including employment status and occupational position in analyses of survey data. It describes the employment statuses distinguished by International Labour Organization (ILO) and discusses their internal heterogeneity and possible overlaps. Further, it presents the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) and discusses its usefulness for social research. It finishes with the presentation of scales (prestige and socio-economic status) and classifications (EGP and ESeC). The discussion is illustrated by examples of questions and data from large international surveys, such as the European Social Survey, the European Values Study, and the International Social Survey Program.
J82|Further developments in the dynamics of female labour force participation|Abstract Papers attempting to explain female labour force participation either do not include women-specific variables or lack a proper dynamic specification. In this paper, we estimate a dynamic equation for female labour force participation in OECD countries from 1980 to 2007, taking into account several sets of variables. Moreover, we use our model to predict the results for 2007–2011, and we find that our model adjusts quite well to the actual data even with regard to the out-sample observations during the ongoing recession. In order to gain further insight concerning the interpretation and robustness of the equation, it is then compared to a similar equation for males. Our results show that real wage is one of the most relevant variables for female participation. Thus our specification could also be useful to endogenise labour force participation for a macro-labour market framework such as that of Layard et al. (1991, rev. 2005). However, women’s preferences, the overall level of education, and other structural factors are also important.
J82|El ajuste educativo y ocupacional en España en el contexto de la crisis económica|In this paper is established than, beyond asymmetric job loss during crisis, at least in its initial period, the occupational transformation can also be explained by changes in the educational requirements. From 2011 to 2014, the polarization that had been produced in our country has slowed due to higher job losses inside skilled manual occupations. But most importantly is that the education requirements have increased for whole occupations, this increase has been higher inside technical manual occupations. In sum, the transformation of the labor market during crisis leading to professionalization and educational dualization, stablishing a poor relative presence of intermediate occupation of classes
J82|Methodological problems and directions in the youth unemployment analysis|This article tackles two methodological problems. The first one concerns the definition and age boundaries of the youth population. It is still actively discussed in the literature and ambiguously solved in research and policy actions. The second problem is related to the measures of youth unemployment, which allow for manipulations through skewed usage of only one deliberately chosen measure or through comparisons of multiple measures with no account of their different content. Directions for a detailed empirical analysis of youth unemployment in Bulgaria are inferred. In the concluding part an alternative ranking of EU-28 countries is suggested based on an aggregate handling of three youth unemployment measures in the age interval 15-29 years. It differs decisively from the popular Eurostat ranking, based only on the youth unemployment rate.
J82|The Frisch Elasticity in the Mercosur Countries: A Pseudo-Panel Approach|" type=""main""> In estimating the Frisch elasticity – i.e., the elasticity of substitution between worked hours and real wages, holding constant the marginal utility of wealth – for the Mercosur countries, this article finds a strong heterogeneity. It argues that severe liquidity constraints are the main reason for the negative estimates and that the heterogeneity is the outcome of differences in many relevant economic dimensions – ranging from sectorial specialisation to welfare-state provisions and labour-market specificities. The diversity of Frisch elasticities calls for the development of a cross-country (rather than a within-country) policy approach, since they crucially affect the dynamics of the business cycle, the synchronisation of which is a step prior to the design of macro-convergence policies in the Mercosur context."
J82|The impact of child labor on children's educational performance: Evidence from rural Vietnam|In 1998, nearly one-third of Vietnamese children engaged in non-housework labor supply, 95% of these working children residing in rural areas. This paper investigates the impact of child labor on children's educational outcomes in rural Vietnam using the 1998-Vietnam Living Standard Survey. The paper finds that child labor lowers children's academic performance and the negative impact is bigger for girls.
J82|Can health-insurance help prevent child labor? An impact evaluation from Pakistan|Child labor is a common consequence of economic shocks in developing countries. We show that reducing vulnerability can affect child labor outcomes. We exploit the extension of a health and accident insurance scheme by a Pakistani microfinance institution that was set up as a randomized controlled trial and accompanied by household panel surveys. Together with increased coverage the microfinance institution offered assistance with claim procedures in treatment branches. We find lower incidence of child labor, hazardous occupations and child labor earnings caused by the innovation. Boys are more often engaged in child labor in our sample, but also seem to profit more from the insurance innovation.
J82|Spillover effects of unionisation on non-members' wellbeing|We investigate whether unionisation has a spillover wellbeing effect on non-members. To this end, we adapt the Social Custom Model of trade unions and conduct empirical analyses using linked employer–employee data on private establishments in Britain. We find that unionisation lowers non-members' job satisfaction, but the effect is confined to workplaces where pay is set through collective bargaining.
J82|Desigualdad salarial y empleo de bajos salarios en los países desarrollados|This article studies the inequality in the labour market that occurs among employed people and has to do with the fact that the wage earnings differ across employees. In particular, we review the factors that theoretically may explain the degree of wage inequality and the incidence of low wage employment and examine the data concerning these issues for the developed countries. Accordingly, a comparative international and temporal perspective is adopted, since not only the existence of differences across countries is examined but also its evolution over time.
J82|La evolución reciente del empleo: retos y perspectivas de futuro|The impact of the crisis on the Spanish labor market has been very intense compared with other European countries but also with respect to previous recession episodes. Overall, employment destruction account by around 18% of employment prior to the crisis and unemployment more than tripled its level in 2008. The impact of the crisis has been, though widespread, relatively heterogeneous, showing a steeper decline in employment for groups of workers such as the young and those with lower levels of qualification. Throughout this period, employment has shown a high cyclicality that would relate to the institutional characteristics of the labor market in Spain. In the future, the absorption of high unemployment will face the major challenge of adjusting the skills of the unemployed, with a very high proportion of workers with a reduced level of qualification and a very high incidence of long-term unemployed, to the requirements of labour demand.
J82|Female employment in MENA’s manufacturing sector: the implications of firm-related and national factors|The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region has realized significant advances toward improving women’s well-being and social status over the last few decades. However, women’s employment rate in the MENA region remains one of the lowest in the world. This paper examines the implications of firm-related and national factors for female employment in manufacturing firms located in the MENA region. The empirical analysis is implemented for firm-level data derived from the World Bank’s Enterprise Surveys database. It uses fractional logit and other econometric models to perform the estimations for female overall employment, female non-production employment, and female employment in managerial positions. The results reveal significant implications of firm-related factors, such as private foreign ownership, exporting activities, firm size, and labour composition, for female employment. They also show that national factors, such as economic development and gender equality, promote female employment. There are considerable differences in the estimated marginal effects across female employment categories. This paper provides policy-makers with directions to design strategies aiming at enhancing women’s economic opportunities and employment rates.

J82|The Gothenburg Population Panel 1915-1943: GOPP Version 6.0|This paper presents the Gothenburg Population Panel (GOPP), a random sample of individuals who were living in Gothenburg at some point in time during the period 1915-1943. The individuals in the GOPP were searched for every fourth year in the registers of local tax authorities. The hit rate was high; 95 percent of the individuals and 87 percent of the possible observations in the initial master sample were found. The database contains 12,500 observations of 3,767 unique individuals 16 years old or more, who are broadly representative of Gothenburg’s adult population in the period of investigation. The sample is augmented with spouses and information on children (birth year and incomes). The paper documents how the database was constructed, describes its historical context, compares it with official statistics, presents some basic sample characteristics and discusses the issue of panel attrition.
J82|Sexual orientation and labor market outcomes|Studies from countries with laws against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation suggest that gay and lesbian employees report more incidents of harassment and are more likely to report experiencing unfair treatment in the labor market than are heterosexual employees. Gay men are found to earn less than comparably skilled and experienced heterosexual men. For lesbians, the patterns are ambiguous: in some countries they have been found to earn less than their heterosexual counterparts, while in others they earn the same or more. Both gay men and lesbians tend to be less satisfied with their jobs than their heterosexual counterparts.
J82|Immigrant Performance and Selective Immigration Policy: A European Perspective|The European Union aims at a stronger participation by its population in work to foster growth and welfare. There are concerns about the attachment of immigrants to the labour force, and discussions about the necessary policy responses. Integrated labour and migration policies are needed. The employment chances of the low-skilled are limited. Whereas Europe could benefit from a substantive immigration policy that imposes selection criteria that are more in line with economic needs, the substantial immigration into the European Union follows largely non-economic motives. This paper discusses the economic rationale of a selective immigration policy and provides empirical evidence about the adverse effects of current selection mechanisms.
