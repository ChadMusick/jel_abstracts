O10|Business Dynamics, Knowledge Economy, and the Economic Performance of African Countries|This paper develops a framework (a) to examine whether or not the African business environment hinders or promotes the knowledge economy (KE), (b) to determine how the KE affects economic performance, and (c) how economic performance relates to the inequality-adjusted human socioeconomic development (IHDI) of 53 African countries during the 1996-2010 time period. We estimate the linkages with three related equations. The results support a strong correlation between the dynamics of starting and doing business and variations in KE. The results also show that there exists a weak link between KE and economic performance. Nonetheless, KE-influenced performance plays a more important role in socioeconomic development than some of the conventional control variables like foreign direct investment (FDI), foreign aid, and even private investment.
O10|Trajectories of Knowledge Economy in SSA and MENA countries|In the first critical assessment of knowledge economy dynamic paths in Africa and the Middle East, but for a few exceptions, we find overwhelming support for diminishing cross-country disparities in knowledge-based economy dimensions. The paper employs all the four components of the World Bank’s Knowledge Economy Index (KEI): economic incentives, innovation, education, and information infrastructure. The main finding suggests that sub-Saharan African (SSA) and the Middle East and North African (MENA) countries with low levels of KE dynamics and catching-up their counterparts of higher KE levels. We provide the speeds of integration and time necessary to achieve full (100%) integration. Policy implications are also discussed.
O10|Taxation,foreign aid and political governance in Africa|This study examines the hypothesis that foreign aid dilutes the positive role of taxation on political governance. The empirical evidence is based on the Generalised Method of Moments and 53 African countries for the period 1996-2010. For more policy options, the dataset is disaggregated into fundamental characteristics of African development based on income levels, legal origins, natural resources and landlockedness. While the hypothesis is invalid in baseline Africa, low income and English common law countries of the continent, the research cannot conclude on its validity for other fundamental characteristics of development. Policy implications, caveats and directions for future research are discussed.

O10|Foreign Aid Complementarities and Inclusive Human Development in Africa|This study complements existing literature by assessing how various types of foreign aid complement each other in boosting inclusive human development in Africa. (a) When â€˜aid to social infrastructureâ€™ is moderated with other aid types, â€˜action on debtsâ€™ is substitutive whereas â€˜aid to the production sectorâ€™, â€˜aid for program assistanceâ€™ and humanitarian assistance are complementary. (b) â€˜Aid to the production sectorâ€™ (â€˜action on debtâ€™) is complementary (substitutive) to â€˜aid for economic infrastructureâ€™. (c) Whereas â€˜action on debtâ€™ is a substitute to â€˜aid to the production sectorâ€™, â€˜aid for social infrastructureâ€™ and â€˜aid for economic infrastructureâ€™ are complementary. (d) â€˜Action on debtâ€™ is a substitute for â€˜aid to the multi-sectorâ€™. (e) While â€˜aid for social infrastructureâ€™ and â€˜action on debtâ€™ are substitutive to â€˜aid for program assistanceâ€™; humanitarian assistance is complementary. (f) The following are substitutes to â€˜action on debtâ€™: â€˜aid for economic infrastructureâ€™, â€˜aid to the production sectorâ€™, â€˜aid to the multi-sectorâ€™ and â€˜programme assistanceâ€™. (g) â€˜Aid for social infrastructureâ€™ and â€˜programme assistanceâ€™ are complementary to humanitarian assistance. The findings reveal various patterns that inform policy makers on the relevance of sequencing aid types to enhance inclusive development. Future research should focus on country-specific studies.
O10|Human capital at the beginnings of the 18th century Catalonia: age-heaping and numeracy in a changing economy|This article examines numeracy levels in Catalonia in the first years of the 18th century. The age-heaping methodology is applied to a source, the municipal registers of inhabitants (padrons), which is less biased than other sources commonly used in the literature. Moreover, this source allows considering a large number of observations (over 6,700) and offers a substantial geographical coverage. The study of the Catalan case is particularly appealing due to the scarce information available for human capital in the 18th-century, a crucial period in the transition from a preindustrial to an industrial society. The results show high levels of arithmetic capacity at the beginning of the century, mainly in urban areas and among the middle classes, with values close to those of other parts of Western Europe. In addition, they point to changes in occupational groups as a potential key factor in the positive evolution of this capacity, possibly making it a good indicator of learning in the workplace. Partial indicators of wealth also appear to link numeracy levels with access to equal opportunities.
O10|Variety, Complexity and Economic Development|We propose a combinatorial model of economic development. An economy develops by acquiring new capabilities allowing for the production of an ever greater variety of products of increasingly complex products. Taking into account that economies abandon the least complex products as they develop over time, we show that variety first increases and then decreases in the course of economic development. This is consistent with the empirical pattern known as 'the hump'. Our results question the common association of variety with complexity. We further discuss the implications of our model for future research.
O10|Local Development, Urban Economies and Aggregate Growth|Abstract The aim of this paper is to present an overview of the results of a recent research project by the Bank of Italy. The paper analyses the interplay between historical origins, congestion costs, and agglomeration benefits in shaping the Italian urban system. It shows that urban agglomeration externalities (on wages, productivity, or innovation) tend to be smaller in Italy than in other developed countries; it also shows that the costs of congestion are relatively high and that high housing cost—explained by both physical constraints and public administration inefficiencies—discourage mobility. These features have a relevant impact on the development of an advanced urban system with possible negative consequences on the country’s ability to grow.
O10|Financial Deepening, Terms of Trade Shocks and Growth in Low-Income Countries|This paper contributes to the literature by looking at the possible relevance of the structure of the financial system—whether financial intermediation is performed through banks or markets—for macroeconomic volatility, against the backdrop of increased policy attention on strengthening growth resilience. With low-income countries (LICs) being the most vulnerable to large and frequent terms of trade shocks, the paper focuses on a sample of 38 LICs over the period 1978-2012 and finds that banking sector development acts as a shock-absorber in poor countries, dampening the transmission of terms of trade shocks to growth volatility. Expanding the sample to 121 developing countries confirms this result, although this role of shock-absorber fades away as economies grow richer. Stock market development, by contrast, appears neither to be a shock-absorber nor a shock-amplifier for most economies. These findings are consistent across a range of econometric estimators, including fixed effect, system GMM and local projection estimates.
O10|Does Female Empowerment Promote Economic Development?|Empirical evidence suggests that money in the hands of mothers (as opposed to their husbands) benefits children. Does this observation imply that targeting transfers on women is good development policy? In this paper they develop a series of non-cooperative family bargaining models to understand what kind of frictions can give rise to the observed empirical relationships, and we assess the policy implications of these models. It had been found that targeting transfers to women can have unintended consequences. Moreover, alternative forms of empowering women may lead to opposite results. More empirical research is needed to distinguish between alternative theoretical models. [BREAD Working Paper No. 281]
O10|Another Look at “Bank Competition and Financial Stability: Much Ado about Nothing?”|This study replicates Zigraiova and Havranek’s (2016) meta-analysis of banking competition and financial stability. It performs multiple types of replications: a “Reproduction” replication where Z&H’s data and code are verified to reproduce the results of their study; a “Repetition” replication where the studies used by Z&H are independently recoded and then re-analyzed; an “Extension” replication where additional studies on banking competition and stability are analyzed; and a “Robustness Analysis” where we check Z&H’s results using an alternative empirical procedure. Our analysis strongly confirms Z&H’s main finding that competition in the banking sector has an economically negligible effect on financial stability. This result is consistently confirmed across a variety of replication analyses. Most impressively, we confirm their finding even when we analyze a completely independent set of 35 studies not included in Z&H’s meta-analysis. Our results for Z&H’s other findings are less supportive. As the first comprehensive replication of a meta-analysis, this study also provides insights into the robustness of meta-analysis. We find that meta-regression analysis, where estimated effects are related to data, estimation, and study characteristics, is sensitive to how data are coded and to the choice of estimation procedure; and that this sensitivity extends to “best practice” estimates.
O10|Should We Care (More) About Data Aggregation? Evidence from the Democracy-Growth-Nexus|We compile data for 186 countries (1919 - 2016) and apply different aggregation methods to create new democracy indices. We observe that most of the available aggregation techniques produce indices that are often too favorable for autocratic regimes and too unfavorable for democratic regimes. The sole exception is a machine learning technique. Using a stylized model, we show that applying an index with implausibly low (high) scores for democracies (autocracies) in a regression analysis produces upward-biased OLS and 2SLS estimates. The results of an analysis of the effect of democracy on economic growth show that the distortions in the OLS and 2SLS estimates are substantial. Our findings imply that commonly used indices are not well suited for empirical purposes.
O10|Folklore|Folklore is the collection of traditional beliefs, customs, and stories of a community, passed through the generations by word of mouth. This vast expressive body, studied by the corresponding discipline of folklore, has evaded the attention of economists. In this study we do four things that reveal the tremendous potential of this corpus for understanding comparative development and culture. First, we introduce and describe a unique catalogue of folklore that codes the presence of thousands of motifs for roughly 1,000 pre-industrial societies. Second, we use a dictionary-based approach to elicit group-specific measures of various traits related to the natural environment, institutional framework, and mode of subsistence. We establish that these proxies are in accordance with the ethnographic record, and illustrate how to use a group’s oral tradition to quantify non-extant characteristics of preindustrial societies. Third, we use folklore to uncover the historical cultural values of a group. Doing so allows us to test various influential conjectures among social scientists including the original affluent society, the culture of honor among pastoralists, the role of family in extended kinship systems and the intensity of trade and rule-following norms in politically centralized group. Finally, we explore how cultural norms inferred via text analysis of oral traditions predict contemporary attitudes and beliefs.
O10|Bite and Divide: Malaria and Ethnolinguistic Diversity|We investigate the epidemiological origins of ethnic diversity and its persistence. First, we conceptualize the role of malaria for the incentives to voluntary isolation in a Malthusian environment. The theory predicts that interactions in multiple geographically clustered groups with high sexual endogamy allowed limiting disease prevalence and increasing group fitness in pre-modern populations exposed to malaria. Second, using disaggregate level data, we document the hitherto unexplored and robust role of malaria for pre-colonial, historical and contemporaneous ethnic diversity in Africa. Third, falsification tests based on malaria epidemiology and history further allow us to validate the specific predictions of the model. No effect can be detected for other placebo vector-borne diseases. Malaria is a main driver of pre-colonial ethnic diversity in Africa but not in the Americas, where the pathogen was absent before European colonization. Fourth, the effect of ancestral malaria on endogamic cultures is the main predicted channel for the persistence of African ethnicities. Exploiting within village variation across 18 African countries, we find that ancestral malaria, but not malaria today, still affects the differential persistence of ethnicities through its legacy of active endogamic cultures.
O10|Social Proximity and Bureaucrat Performance: Evidence from India|Using exogenous variation in social proximity generated by an allocation rule, we find that bureaucrats assigned to their home states are perceived to be more corrupt and less able to withstand illegitimate political pressure. Despite this, we observe that home officers are more likely to be promoted in the later stages of their careers. To understand this dissonance between performance and promotion we show that incoming Chief Ministers preferentially promote home officers that come from the same home district. Taken together, our results suggest that social proximity hampers bureaucrat performance by facilitating political capture and corruption.
O10|Historical Analysis of National Subjective Wellbeing Using Millions of Digitized Books|We present the first attempt to construct a long-run historical measure of subjective wellbeing using language corpora derived from millions of digitized books. While existing measures of subjective wellbeing go back to at most the 1970s, we can go back at least 200 years further using our methods. We analyse data for six countries (the USA, UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain). To highlight some results, we find a positive short-run effect for GDP and life expectancy on subjective wellbeing. An increase of 1% life expectancy is equivalent to more than 5% increase in yearly GDP. One year of internal conflict costs the equivalent of a 50% drop in GDP per year in terms of subjective wellbeing. Public debt, on the other hand, has a short-run positive effect. Our estimated index of subjective wellbeing generally does not feature any positive trend, which is consistent with the Easterlin paradox, although we caution against long term analysis given the historical variation of written texts (which parallel similar issues with historical GDP statistics).
O10|Democracy Does Cause Growth: Comment|I revisit the causal relationship between democracy and growth as recently studied in Acemoglu, Naidu, Restrepo, and Robinson (2019, ANRR). I demonstrate the sensitivity of their results to sample selection by dropping a small number of observations in a non-random fashion and use these findings to motivate a generalisation of their empirical approach. My own analysis relaxes the assumption of (i) a common democracy-growth relationship, and of (ii) the absence of strong cross-section correlation. Adopting novel methods for policy evaluation I find a robust positive long-run effect of democracy albeit with only around half the magnitude of that found in ANRR.
O10|Patronage and Selection in Public Sector Organizations|In all modern bureaucracies, politicians retain some discretion in public employment decisions, which may lead to frictions in the selection process if political connections substitute for individual competence. Relying on detailed matched employer-employee data on the universe of public employees in Brazil over 1997–2014, and on a regression discontinuity design in close electoral races, we establish three main findings. First, political connections are a key and quantitatively large determinant of employment in public organizations, for both bureaucrats and frontline providers. Second, patronage is an important mechanism behind this result. Third, political considerations lead to the selection of less competent individuals.
O10|Creativity over Time and Space|Creativity is often highly concentrated in time and space, and across different domains. What explains the formation and decay of clusters of creativity? In this paper we match data on thousands of notable individuals born in Europe between the XIth and the XIXth century with historical data on city institutions and population. After documenting several stylized facts, we show that the formation of creative clusters is not preceded by increases in city size. Instead, the emergence of city institutions protecting economic and political freedoms facilitates the attraction and production of creative talent. Keywords: innovation, agglomeration, political institutions, immigration, gravity. JEL: R10, O10, J61, N13
O10|‘Fear of the State’ in governance surveys? Empirical evidence from African countries|The need to collect data on governance-related issues has been growing since the 1990s. Demand gained momentum in 2015 with the adoption of SDG16 worldwide and Agenda 2063 in Africa. African countries played a key role in the adoption of SDG16 and are now leading the process of collecting harmonised household data on Governance, Peace and Security (GPS). Yet the possibility has recently been raised that sensitive survey data collected by government institutions are potentially biased due to self-censorship by respondents. This paper studies the potential bias in responses to what are seen as sensitive questions, here governance issues, in surveys conducted by public organisations. We compare Afrobarometer (AB) survey data, collected in eight African countries by self-professed independent institutions, with first-hand harmonised GPS survey data collected by National Statistics Offices (NSOs). We identify over 20 similarly worded questions on democracy, trust in institutions and perceived corruption. We first compare responses from AB survey respondents based on who they believe the survey sponsor to be. No systematic response bias is found between respondents who believe the government to be behind the AB survey and those who consider it to be conducted by an independent institution. The absence of a systematic self-censorship or attenuation bias is further evidenced by means of an experimental design, whereby responses from GPS surveys conducted by NSOs (the treatment) are compared with AB surveys sponsored by reportedly independent bodies. Our results provide evidence of the capacity and legitimacy of government-related organisations to collect data on governance as a matter of national interest and sovereignty.
O10|Theories of Governance and Development: How Does India’s Experience Fit?|This paper takes on the apparent paradox of India’s combination of durable democracy, capable bureaucracy, but a deficient development trajectory. It begins by outlining the nature of the problem. Then it summarizes and compares some significant approaches to drawing connections from governance institutions to development outcomes. Next, it reviews some of the contributions to understanding India’s political economy in the last few decades. Finally, it attempts to draw some lessons from India’s experience for the application of different theories of governance and development. The central lesson is that the paradox recedes when attention is paid to the subnational level, where India’s states encompass considerable variation in initial societal and economic conditions and in development outcomes.
O10|Диверсификсация Российской Экономики За Счет Углубления Переработки Углеводородов: Проблема Индикативного Планирования<BR>[Diversification of Russian Economy by Deepening Hydrocarbon Processing: a Problem of Indicative Planning]|Basing on the ideas of indicative planning, we propose an approach to the diversification of the Russian economy by deepening the hydrocarbon processing. We justify the expediency of forming a system of interrelated projects that ensure the improvement of technology and expansion of output in a set of productions, and analyze promising areas of development of such projects. The connection of the proposed approach with the concept of value chains is considered. The options of institutional organization of the processes of formation and implementation of a system of projects are discussed.
O10|Good governance for sustainable development|Since many decades there has been a growing concern about reducing poverty, reduce inequality, protect environment, promote well-being, etc. These changes have shifted focus from the model of economic growth to the new model of sustainable development. Despite this new direction, the issue of how to achieve sustainable development goals still remains. One of the most recognized tools to cope with the development agenda is the good governance. The aim of this paper is to give an overview on the issues of the sustainable development and to outline the link between good governance dimensions and selected indicators of development. Also, the paper investigates the requirement for good governance.
O10|Trajectories of Knowledge Economy in SSA and MENA countries|In the first critical assessment of knowledge economy dynamic paths in Africa and the Middle East, but for a few exceptions, we find overwhelming support for diminishing cross-country disparities in knowledge-based economy dimensions. The paper employs all the four components of the World Bankâ€™s Knowledge Economy Index (KEI): economic incentives, innovation, education, and information infrastructure. The main finding suggests that sub-Saharan African (SSA) and the Middle East and North African (MENA) countries with low levels of KE dynamics and catching-up their counterparts of higher KE levels. We provide the speeds of integration and time necessary to achieve full (100%) integration. Policy implications are also discussed.
O10|Optimal Operation of Islanded Microgrid Operation Based on the JAYA Optimization Algorithm|Islanded microgrid (MG) is one of the most important challenges in the power system operation as the network can be safe and disconnected from the conjected area. Also, in the case that the market price is high, the islanded MG can have a lower operational cost by islanding from the main grid. However, optimal operation of the islanded MG is very challenging as the MG is a nonlinear problem. Hence, this paper proposed a new heuristic method known as the JAYA optimization algorithm to solve the problem. Finally, the proposed model is examined on a modified IEEE 30 bus test network to show the merit of the model.
O10|Productive Performance and Technology Gaps using a Bayesian Metafrontier Production Function: A cross-country comparison|Growth theory argues on the role of heterogeneity that can lead to multiple regimes examining countries’ performance. A meta-production stochastic function under a Bayesian perspective has been developed to estimate technical efficiencies across countries over a time period. The metafrontier model is used to highlight heterogeneity among cluster of countries revealing catch up phenomena. The estimation procedure relies on the solution of an optimization problem and on the concept of the upper orthant order of two multinormal random variables. The proposed models are applied in a real dataset consisting of 109 countries for a 20-year period from 1995-2014. The productive performance differential and the associated technology gaps were investigated using two distinct frontiers (OECD vs non-OECD countries). Empirical results reveal that heterogeneity indeed plays a significant and distinctive role in determining technological gaps.
O10|Economic development through halal tourism|Tourism is a potential sector in the world. The increasing number of tourist destinations and investments has encouraged this sector to become a major factor in foreign exchange earnings, employment, and business and infrastructure development. At present, halal tourism (halal tourism) is becoming a world trend. This is in line with the increase in the number of Muslim tourists from year to year. This article will review the concept of halal tourism, potential, and halal tourism as an alternative to economic development.
O10|Official development aid effectiveness and economic growth in African countries: The role of the governance|This work revolves around support policies of developing countries which, in most cases, need financing and more particularly development aid. In this setting, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of development aid for a sample of African countries of which 25 are considered to have intermediate incomes and 23 achieve low incomes. To do this, we relied on a cross-sectional regression over the period 1996-2014. Our results imply that good governance is a deterministic condition of the positive effect of aid on economic growth. Indeed, international aid unaccompanied by good governance practices (control of corruption, political stability, a sound regulatory quality, a rigid state of rights, government effectiveness, voice and accountability) has adverse effects on economic activity and creates more inequalities of opportunity, especially in low-income countries. Thus, we note that the better quality of institutions allow a better allocation of international aid towards productive projects which stimulates economic growth in the two sub regions. So, in order to achieve the desired goals of international aid, countries must first ensure political stability and develop a regulatory and institutional framework to organize economic activities, second need to protect individual properties and resolve disputes between players in different markets.
O10|Computerization and Development: Formalizing Property Rights and its Impact on Land and Labor Allocation|I test the land and labor market effects of a property rights reform that computerized rural land records, and provided access to digitized records and automated transactions to agricultural landowners and cultivators in Pakistan. Using the staggered roll-out of the program, I find that while the reforms do not shift land ownership, landowning households are more likely to rent out land and lower their agricultural participation. At the same time, cultivating households have access to more land, as rented in land and overall farm size per cultivating household increases. Improved tenure security also shifts the type of rental contracts, and the input choices of cultivators. Aggregate district level data suggests an improvement in overall crop yield. These results have implications for both the allocation of land across farmers and the selection of labor into farming.
O10|The Role of Credit Guarantee Schemes in the Development of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises with an Emphasis on Knowledge-Based Enterprises|Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in their growth stage reach the point where, on the one hand, personal resources do not meet their needs, and, on the other, they do not have enough collateral to attract external finance. Access to finance can be facilitated by obtaining loans from financial institutions backed by governmental credit guarantees. Therefore, the development of a sound credit guarantee scheme will be an important step in filling the financing gap of SMEs. We investigate the situation of the credit guarantee scheme for SMEs in Iran by using the available data and interviews with activists from this field with the grounded theory method. We show the weaknesses of the Iranian credit guarantee scheme, and based on the analysis, present solutions and policy recommendations in accordance with the social and economic environment of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The most important problem is the lack of a credit database for comprehensive assessment of SMEs, especially knowledge-based enterprises. The lack of a robust database makes it impossible to carry out a comprehensive evaluation because these models require a large amount of data. The lack of accurate models makes it difficult to rate credit status and thus to issue credit guarantees. In addition, the current level of the capital of the credit guarantee funds in Iran is not sufficient given the large number of SMEs in the country.
O10|Productivity Panics – Polemics and Realities|Widespread uneasiness has emerged concerning a perceived slowdown in productivity growth. The question posed here is whether our destiny is indeed tied to inexorable movements in productivity and innovation, whatever these things may be, or can we build a future contingent upon collective choices and guided by human needs and desires?
O10|Explaining the Economic Growth of Thailand|"One of the principles of economic development is economic growth. To ensure the sustainability, factors promoting long-term economic growth need to be analyzed. Understanding these factors could provide insightful information and, then, allow the government to properly plan for the future economic stimulating scheme. This study, therefore, looks into the determinants of economic growth in Thailand. The ARMA and ARCH techniques are employed to elicit significant factors and their impact on the country's economic growth between the first quarter of 2005 to the fourth quarter of 2017. The rate of change of GDP is applied as an indicator for economic growth. The result presents the volatile behavior or a sign of time-varying variance. Moreover, the finding preliminarily hypothesizes autoregressive characteristic. Technically, time-varying variance could be captured by ARCH, while that of autoregressive could be taken into account by the ARMA. This study employs the inflation uncertainty to reflect the role of the internal instability on economic growth, and the exchange rate uncertainty to indicate the external instability. The AR(1)-GARCH(0,1) model is appropriately estimated the inflation and its residual is taken as its uncertainty. On the other hand, the naive OLS-GARCH(1,1) is the most suitable model to estimate the value of Thai baht and the unobserved portion is treated as its uncertainty. Finally, the economic growth is thus explored under the growth model framework with the Cobb-Douglas production form. The empirical results show that AR(|2|) equation appears to be the most suitable model compared to others. These findings suggest that the government should implement promotion measures to attract foreign direct investment. In addition, labor productivity issue should be taken care of by the adjustment in education curriculum and on-the-job training."
O10|Benefits of Community-driven Development program to improve livelihood: Case Study of Dana Desa (Village Funds) in Indonesia|Indonesia has been implementing Dana Desa (Village Funds) program since 2015. It is a form of the community-driven development approaches in rural areas which involves more than 74.000 villages. This research presents a case study from Ponggok village, Jetak Village, and Ngadas Village, which have successfully implemented Dana Desa. The central government appoints them as the national role models on implementing Dana Desa. They show that benefits from CDD (community-driven development) program can fulfil their needs, especially on developing clean water and sanitation access which leads to improving their livelihood. This research uses a qualitative approach using case study methodology. The research uses purposive sampling, by which, collecting data is done by interviewing, documenting, and observing the samples. It discusses several social factors which are claimed to have been contributing to the success of the implementation of Dana Desa programs, such as the role of central and local government, social capital and community participation. It aims to analyse the study case that is expected to be a lesson learned for government, practitioners and other village government, to make sure that Dana Desa is well-implemented in their areas. It is concluded that Dana Desa can be well-implemented if the villages have decent community participation, leadership, and suitable planning.
O10|Econometric Analysis Of Competitiveness, Innovation And Trade Openness Of Western Balkan Countries|The level of trade openness plays a crucial role on boosting countries? competitiveness, innovation and productivity. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to empirically analyze the linkage of trade openness and competitiveness for Western Balkan countries covering the time period 2005-2017. The research method consists of a panel regression analysis by examining the static models for both fixed and random effects and using the Hausman test for deciding for the most appropriate model for the proposed sample countries. First, the gross competitiveness index is modelled as dependent variable on trade openness and a set of control variables such as: GDP per capita, gross fix capital formation, FDI, inflation and several interaction variables with trade openness. Second, innovation is taken as dependent variable whereas trade openness and the aforementioned indicators as independent variables. The empirical results of the fixed effects model suggest that trade openness positively affect competitiveness, as well as trade openness enhance innovation as in both models the coefficients of trade openness seem to be statistically significant and with positive signs. Regarding interaction variables between trade and FDI as well as trade and gross capital formation, it is confirmed that countries with higher level of FDI and higher physical capital benefit more from international trade, and in turn increase competitiveness. The findings of this research reveal important policy implications for Western Balkan countries, in terms of strengthening the mutual trade cooperation and joining the efforts for increasing even more their participation into the global market. It will imply extension of competitiveness and a range of paybacks, such that job creation, poverty alleviation and better standards of living of their citizens.
O10|Whither the evolution of the contemporary social fabric? New technologies and old socio-economic trends|The reflections which follow build on two interrelated questions, namely, first, whether we are witnessing another “industrial revolution”, and second, what is the impact of technological transformations upon the current dynamics of the socio-economic fabric, especially with respect to employment, income distribution, working conditions and labour relations. We argue that the processes of innovation and diffusion of what we could call “intelligent automation” are likely to change, or more likely reinforce, the patterns of distribution of income and power, which have been there well before the arrival of the technologies we are concerned about: some are indeed intrinsic features of capitalism since its inception, while others are features of the last thirtyforty years. First, we shall offer a fresco of such tendencies which certainly preceded any potential “Fourth Industrial Revolution” but are going to be amplified by the latter. Second, we discuss the features of such possible new techno-economic paradigms. Third, we examine the relationships between technology, productivity and growth, and the ensuing impact on jobs, division of labour, distribution of knowledge, power, and control. Finally, we address some policy implications.
O10|Technical progress and structural change: a long-term view|Along the development path, countries experience large transformations in their economic structure as productive resources move towards different economic activities. “Modern economic growth” is also associated with a self-sustained process of technical change which leads to the emergence of new products and sectors characterized by different scopes for productivity gains and demand growth. In this paper we study the interactions between structural change and technological progress from a long-term perspective. We first analyze the secular patterns of structural change across agriculture, manufacturing and services using historical data in the attempt to test some broad conjectures concerning sectoral reallocations at different stages of development (i.e. the so-called Petty-Clark law) and discuss the specific role of manufacturing as an engine of growth. Second, we provide an overview of the literature on sectoral innovation patterns as well as of recent evidence linking structural transformations and sector-specific technological opportunities to aggregate productivity growth. In the final part we present productivity decompositions using a sectoral innovation taxonomy to study the contribution of different groups of activities characterized by heterogeneous innovation patterns. Our results suggest that structural change towards knowledge-intensive activities provides a source of productivity growth in both developing and advanced countries. In turn, this points at the need for a more disaggregated analysis of structural change to capture the diversity in the rate and direction of technical progress across sectors.
O10|Wasted windfalls: Inefficiencies in health care spending in oil rich countries|This paper examines the long-term impact of refugee camps on the health of local residents in Tanzania. Taking height-for-age z-score (HAZ) as a proxy for health, the paper exploits the fact that different birth cohorts were exposed to different stages of the camps’ lifecycle. Temporal variation through birth cohorts is combined with geographic variation in a difference-in-difference estimation approach. First, the paper examines the generation that were children at the opening of the camps and are now adults (as of 2012). It finds a negative and localised health effect that has persisted into adulthood. The result is comparable to a 2.9% to 5.9% reduction in adult hourly earnings. However, those that were exposed for a longer duration were less affected suggesting that subsequent economic development around camps mitigated the initial adverse effect. Second, this paper compares the subsequent generation that was born once the camps were already in operation, and those born after camps closed. It finds no observable difference in the HAZ score between those born during camps operation and in the post-camp period.
O10|Decolonizing with data: The cliometric turn in African economic history|Our understanding of Africa's economic past -- the causes and consequences of precolonial polities, the slave trade, state formation, the Scramble for Africa, European settlement, and independence -- has improved markedly over the last two decades. Much of this is the result of the cliometric turn in African economic history, what some have called a `renaissance'. Whilst acknowledging that cliometrics is not new to African history, this chapter examines the major recent contributions, noting their methodological advances and dividing them into four broad themes: persistence of deep traits, slavery, colonialism and independence. We conclude with a brief bibliometric exercise, noting the lack of Africans working at the frontier of African cliometrics.
O10|A Trade-Based Misallocation Index|This paper, based on a model of trade in the presence of sectoral distortions, develops a one dimensional sectoral misallocation index. It estimates the index using product-level bilateral trade data at the sector-country-year level since 1962. The geographical distribution of the misallocation index suggests substantial within-region differences across countries and across time. Notably, a large and historical allocative efficiency gap exists across the West and the East of Europe, while the latter shows a remarkable progress in catching up. On the other hand, the substantial gap between the North and South America is highly persistent. The paper then investigates the negative association of misallocation to economic performance through multivariate regression analysis. The index of misallocation inversely and robustly predicts cross-country productivity differences, contains valuable information on top of factors of production, and outperforms measures of diversification, product sophistication, and openness when time invariant country characteristics are accounted for.
O10|The Effects of Land Markets on Resource Allocation and Agricultural Productivity|We assess the effects of land markets on misallocation and productivity by exploiting policy-driven variation in land rentals across time and space arising from a large-scale land certification reform in Ethiopia, where land remains owned by the state. Our main finding from detailed micro panel data is that land rentals substantially reduce misallocation and increase agricultural productivity. Our evidence builds from an empirical difference-in-difference strategy, an instrumental variable approach, and a calibrated quantitative macroeconomic framework with heterogeneous household-farms that replicates, without targeting, the empirical effects. These effects are nonlinear, impacting more farms farther away from efficient operational scale, consistent with our theory. Using our model, we find that more active land markets reduce inequality, an important concern for the design of land policy. We also find that the positive effects of land markets are mainly driven by formal market rentals as opposed to informal rentals. Finally, our analysis also provides evidence that land markets increase the adoption of more advanced technologies such as the use of fertilizers.
O10|Public and Foreign Investment Spending in the Argentine Case.A Cointegration Analysis with Structural Breaks, 1960-2015|This paper examines whether public investment spending and inward foreign direct investment (FDI) enhance labor productivity growth in Argentina. It presents a simple modified production function that explicitly includes the positive or negative externality effects generated by increases in the stock of public or FDI capital. The paper estimates a dynamic labor productivity function for the 1960-2015 period that incorporates the impact of public and private investment spending, education expenditures (at all levels), the labor force, and export growth. It tests for both single and two-break unit root tests, as well as performs cointegration tests with an endogenously determined shift over the 1960-2015 period. Cointegration analysis suggests that a long-term relationship exists among the relevant variables. The error correction (EC) models suggest that (lagged) increases in public investment spending and education have a positive and significant effect on the rate of labor productivity growth. In addition, the model is estimated for a shorter period (1970-2015)to capture the impact of inward FDI flows. The estimates suggest that (lagged) FDI flows have a positive and significant impact on labor productivity growth, while increases in the labor force have a negative effect. From a policy standpoint, the findings call into question the politically expedient policy in many Latin American countries, including Argentina during the 1990s and 2000s, of disproportionately reducing public capital expenditures on education and infrastructure to meet reductions in the fiscal deficit as a proportion of GDP. The results give further support to pro-investment and pro-growth policies designed to promote public investment spending and attract inward FDI flows.
O10|Prenatal Exposure to Acute Diarrheal Diseases and Childhood Mortality|There is a large body of evidence that shows the effect of diarrheal diseases on childhood mortality. Nevertheless, most of this literature focuses on post-natal exposure to diarrheal diseases. This study ex-ploits the Cholera Epidemic in Peru, finding that a 1% point increase in cholera incidence in the third trimester in-utero increases average childhood mortality rate by 0.2% points or 14%. This study suggests that public programs that aim to reduce diarrheal diseases should tar-get not just children but also pregnant women and raises the question of whether pregnant women should take vaccines to prevent diarrheal diseases in poor countries.
O10|Born to be Obese and Self-Employed: Evidence of Long-Term Effects from Pre-Natal Exposure to an Acute Diarrheal Disease|This paper finds that women exposed to Cholera while in-utero are more likely to be obese, more likely to be self-employed and less likely to be employed in the service sector, providing evidence that these women may be suffering from discrimination in the labor market. This study suggests that, given the widespread incidencen of diarrheal diseases in the developing world, individ-uals in poor countries are born more vulnerable to becoming obese and self-employed, and, therefore, interventions that reduce these diseases will have important additional benefits as the obesity epidemic continue to expand in these countries.
O10|Inflation, Unemployment and Happiness: empirical evidences of the contribution of Economic Growth|This paper improves the understanding of the trade-off between inflation and unemployment and its impact on Subjective Well-Being (SWB), considering the role of the (Growth Domestic Product) GDP Growth and the issue of heterogeneity/nonlinearity. Effects on SWB depends on the spread between observed and potential GDP growth. The results point out country heterogeneity and nonlinearity of the marginal effects of macroeconomic variables on SWB. Economic growth moderates the relationship between unemployment as well as inflation and SWB. Both unemployment and GDP per capita growth rates have an important impact on Europeans’ SWB. Fostering economic growth must be one of the priorities of European policy.
O10|Economic Transition, Dualism, and Informality in India|In much of the literature on economic development, sustained economic growth is expected to be accompanied by several interrelated processes of structure change, which involve a shift in economic activities from ‘traditional’ / agricultural / informal to ‘modern’ / industrial / formal sectors. Such transitions are usually accompanied by a transition in the economic dependence of households towards relatively ‘modern’ and formal segments of the economy, along with a rise in their general economic well-being. In this paper, we examine the Indian economy using the only available household-level pan-India panel data over the high growth period between 2005 and 2011-12, to analyse the patterns and natures of household-level transitions across sectors and identify factors that affected the likelihood and nature of such transitions. We categorize households based on their primary income sources into seven sectors characterised by varying degrees of formality/informality and various production structures and labour processes. We find that while substantial proportion of households have transitioned across these sectors during the period, there has been a continued reproduction of the same economic structure, including a regeneration of dependence on ‘traditional’ informal sector and casual wage employment, which are often expected to dissolve over time with high economic growth. To ascertain the nature of these transitions (‘favorable’ or ‘unfavorable’), we employ a ‘counterfactual’ analysis. Contrary to some recent influential literature, we find that, on an average, the transitions towards informal and ‘traditional’ economic spaces are ‘unfavourable’ in nature in terms of well-being of households. Further, using a multinomial logit regression framework, we find that the likelihood and nature of these transitions are largely dependent on household characteristics like levels of education and social caste, some of which are structurally given and cannot be optimally chosen by households. The results show that despite significant churning in the economy, the structure continues to remain fractured, with substantial ‘unfavourable’ transitions towards economic spaces that are continuously reshuffled and reconstituted.
O10|Knowledge Economy and Economic Development in the Arab Region|This paper aims to discuss the relationship between knowledge, knowledge economy and economic development in the Arab region. It aims to contribute to improve understanding and provide valuable contribution to the increasing debate in the international literature concerning the relationship between knowledge economy and economic development in the Arab region. We use the descriptive and comparative approaches and methods of analysis and use the conceptual framework and indicators often used in the international literature to discuss the relationship between knowledge, knowledge economy and economic development in the Arab region. Different from previous studies in the Arab literature, we fill the gap in the Arab literature, we present an in-depth and a more comprehensive analysis of the relationship between knowledge economy and economic development in the Arab region defined by income level using recent secondary data related to knowledge economy obtained from the Global Innovation Index Report (2018) and the World Bank (2012). Our results support the first hypothesis concerning the considerable variation in the promotion of knowledge economy depending on the level of economic development across the Arab countries. Our findings verify the second hypothesis that the relationship between knowledge economy and economic development in the Arab region is determined by several factors including economic development, economic incentives and institutional regime, education and human resources, innovation system and Information and Communication Technology. Our results support the third hypothesis that sound and coherent policies for the promotion of knowledge economy through the promotion of economic incentives and institutional regime, education and human resources, the innovation system and Information and Communication Technology would contribute to accelerate achievement of inclusive growth and sustainable development in the Arab countries. Our results in the Arab region show positive relationship between income level and knowledge index, knowledge economy index and knowledge economy index and most of knowledge economy indicators including knowledge workers, knowledge-intensive employment, knowledge absorption, knowledge and technology outputs, knowledge impact and knowledge diffusion. Our findings in the Arab region show positive relationship between income level and all knowledge economy index pillars (economic incentive and institutional regime pillar, education and human resources pillar, the innovation system pillar, and information and communication technology (ICT) pillar) and all factors facilitating the promotion of knowledge economy including institutions, human capital and research, education, tertiary education, research & development (R&D), infrastructure, information and communication technologies, and innovation. The major policy implication and recommendation that the promotion of knowledge economy depends on promotion of institutions, economic incentive and institutional regime, education, human resources and research (human capital, education, tertiary education, research & development (R&D)), innovation system (innovation input, output and efficiency) infrastructure, and information and communication technologies.
O10|Technical progress and structural change: a long-term view|Along the development path, countries experience large transformations in their economic structure as productive resources move towards different economic activities. ''Modern economic growth'' is also associated with a self-sustained process of technical change which leads to the emergence of new products and sectors characterized by different scopes for productivity gains and demand growth. In this paper we study the interactions between structural change and technological progress from a long-term perspective. We first analyze the secular patterns of structural change across agriculture, manufacturing and services using historical data in the attempt to test some broad conjectures concerning sectoral reallocations at different stages of development (i.e. the so-called Petty-Clark law) and discuss the specific role of manufacturing as an engine of growth. Second, we provide an overview of the literature on sectoral innovation patterns as well as of recent evidence linking structural transformations and sector-specific technological opportunities to aggregate productivity growth. In the final part we present productivity decompositions using a sectoral innovation taxonomy to study the contribution of different groups of activities characterized by heterogeneous innovation patterns. Our results suggest that structural change towards knowledge-intensive activities provides a source of productivity growth in both developing and advanced countries. In turn, this points at the need for a more disaggregated analysis of structural change to capture the diversity in the rate and direction of technical progress across sectors.
O10|Variety, Complexity and Economic Development|We propose a combinatorial model of economic development. An economy develops by acquiring new capabilities allowing for the production of an ever greater variety of products of increasingly complex products. Taking into account that economies abandon the least complex products as they develop over time, we show that variety first increases and then decreases in the course of economic development. This is consistent with the empirical pattern known as 'the hump'. Our results question the common association of variety with complexity. We further discuss the implications of our model for future research.
O10|Accounting for Timing when Assessing Health-Related Policies|The primary focus of this paper is to offer guidance on the analysis of time streams of effects that a project may have so that they can be discounted appropriately. This requires a framework that identifies the common parameters that need to be assessed, whether conducting cost-effectiveness or benefit-cost analysis. The quantification and conversion of the time streams of different effects into their equivalent health, health care cost or consumption effects avoids embedding multiple arguments in discounting policies. This helps to identify where parameters are likely to differ in particular contexts, what type of evidence would be relevant, what is currently known and how this evidence might be strengthened. The current evidence available to support the assessment of the key parameters is discussed and possible estimates and default assumptions are suggested. Reporting the results in an extensive way is recommended. This makes the assessments required explicit so the impact of alternative assumptions can be explored and analysis updated as better estimates evolve. Some projects will have effects across different countries where some or all of these parameters will differ. Therefore, the net present value of a project will be the sum of the country specific net present values rather than the sum of effects across countries discounted at some common rate.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
O10|Trajectories of Knowledge Economy in SSA and MENA countries|In the first critical assessment of knowledge economy dynamic paths in Africa and the Middle East, but for a few exceptions, we find overwhelming support for diminishing cross-country disparities in knowledge-based economy dimensions. The paper employs all the four components of the World Bank’s Knowledge Economy Index (KEI): economic incentives, innovation, education, and information infrastructure. The main finding suggests that sub-Saharan African (SSA) and the Middle East and North African (MENA) countries with low levels of KE dynamics and catching-up their counterparts of higher KE levels. We provide the speeds of integration and time necessary to achieve full (100%) integration. Policy implications are also discussed.
O10|Foreign aid complementarities and inclusive human development in Africa|This study complements existing literature by assessing how various types of foreign aidcomplement each other in boosting inclusive human development in Africa. (a) When ?aid to socialinfrastructure? is moderated with other aid types, ?action on debts? is substitutive whereas ?aid tothe production sector?, ?aid for program assistance? and humanitarian assistance arecomplementary. (b) ?Aid to the production sector? (?action on debt?) is complementary(substitutive) to ?aid for economic infrastructure?. (c) Whereas ?action on debt? is a substitute to?aid to the production sector?, ?aid for social infrastructure? and ?aid for economic infrastructure?are complementary.

(f) The following are substitutes to ?action on debt?:?aid for economic infrastructure?, ?aid to the production sector?, ?aid to the multi-sector? and?programme assistance?. (g) ?Aid for social infrastructure? and ?programme assistance? arecomplementary to humanitarian assistance. The findings reveal various patterns that inform policymakers on the relevance of sequencing aid types to enhance inclusive development. Futureresearch should focus on country-specific studies.
O10|Firm Entry and Exit and Aggregate Growth|Using plant-level data from Chile and Korea, we find that, during episodes of rapid growth, most of the aggregate productivity growth is due to the entry and exit of firms while, during episodes of slower growth, it is mostly due to growth within and across existing firms. Studies for other countries suggest that this is an empirical regularity. We develop a dynamic general equilibrium model based on Hopenhayn (1992) which incorporates the theory of economic growth proposed by Parente and Prescott (1994) and Kehoe and Prescott (2002). In this model, new firms enter every period with productivities drawn from a distribution whose mean grows over time. After entering, a firmâ€™s productivity grows, but not as rapidly as new firmsâ€™ productivity distribution. In a version of the model calibrated to U.S. plant-level data, we simulate two sets of reforms: a decrease in new firmsâ€™ costs of entry and a reduction in the barriers to technology adoption for new firms. The model reproduces the regularity that we observe in the data, and confirm that entry and exit of firms is crucial for reforms to generate rapid growth.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
O10|The Role of Electricity Prices in Structural Transformation: Evidence from the Philippines|The Philippines provides an extreme example of Rodrikâ€™s observation that late developing countries experience deindustrialization at lower levels of per capita income than more advanced economies. Previous studies point to the role of protectionist policies, financial crises, and currency overvaluation as explanations for the shrinking share of the industry sector. We complement this literature by examining the role of electricity prices in the trajectory of industry share. We make use of data at the country level for 33 countries over the period 1980-2014 and at the Philippine regional level for 16 regions over the period 1990-2014. We find that higher electricity prices tend to amplify deindustrialization, causing industry share to turn downward at a lower peak and a lower per capita income, and to decline more steeply than otherwise. In a two-country comparison, we find that power intensive manufacturing subsectors have expanded more rapidly in Indonesia, where electricity prices have been low, whereas Philippine manufacturing has shifted toward less power-intensive and more labor-intensive subsectors in the face of high prices.
O10|Taxation, foreign aid and political governance in Africa|This study examines the hypothesis that foreign aid dilutes the positive role of taxation on political governance. The empirical evidence is based on the Generalised Method of Moments and 53 African countries for the period 1996-2010. For more policy options, the dataset is disaggregated into fundamental characteristics of African development based on income levels, legal origins, natural resources and landlockedness. While the hypothesis is invalid in baseline Africa, low income and English common law countries of the continent, the research cannot conclude on its validity for other fundamental characteristics of development. Policy implications, caveats and directions for future research are discussed.
O10|Foreign Aid Complementarities and Inclusive Human Development in Africa|This study complements existing literature by assessing how various types of foreign aid complement each other in boosting inclusive human development in Africa. (a) When ‘aid to social infrastructure’ is moderated with other aid types, ‘action on debts’ is substitutive whereas ‘aid to the production sector’, ‘aid for program assistance’ and humanitarian assistance are complementary. (b) ‘Aid to the production sector’ (‘action on debt’) is complementary (substitutive) to ‘aid for economic infrastructure’. (c) Whereas ‘action on debt’ is a substitute to ‘aid to the production sector’, ‘aid for social infrastructure’ and ‘aid for economic infrastructure’ are complementary. (d) ‘Action on debt’ is a substitute for ‘aid to the multi-sector’. (e) While ‘aid for social infrastructure’ and ‘action on debt’ are substitutive to ‘aid for program assistance’; humanitarian assistance is complementary. (f) The following are substitutes to ‘action on debt’: ‘aid for economic infrastructure’, ‘aid to the production sector’, ‘aid to the multi-sector’ and ‘programme assistance’. (g) ‘Aid for social infrastructure’ and ‘programme assistance’ are complementary to humanitarian assistance. The findings reveal various patterns that inform policy makers on the relevance of sequencing aid types to enhance inclusive development. Future research should focus on country-specific studies.
O10|An Analysis of the Importance of Both Destruction and Creation to Economic Growth|A growth model is studied in which the destruction (or exit) and creative (or research) decisions are decoupled. This approach emphasizes that different agents make these interrelated decisions. The growth rate equals the product of a measure of the destruction and creation rates. The determinants of income mobility, income inequality, the lifespan of a firm, and the growth rate are studied. The equilibrium can either yield too high or low a level of innovation, but the destruction rate may also be too high or low. A non-linear tax/subsidy scheme, which alters the innovation and exit decisions, can improve welfare.
O10|An Analysis of the Importance of Both Destruction and Creation to Economic Growth (Updated)|A growth model is studied in which the destruction (or exit) and creative (or research) decisions are decoupled. This approach emphasizes that different agents make these interrelated decisions. The growth rate equals the product of a measure of the destruction and creation rates. The determinants of income mobility, income inequality, the lifespan of a firm, and the growth rate are studied. The equilibrium can either yield too high or low a level of innovation, but the destruction rate may also be too high or low. A non-linear tax/subsidy scheme, which alters the innovation and exit decisions, can improve welfare.
O10|The Relationship Between Offshoring, Growth and Welfare|A dynamic model of offshoring is studied which permits the analysis of how offshoring can affect economic and welfare outcomes. Firm owners make location decisions based on the future returns from locating in either foreign or domestic markets, or ceasing operations altogether. It is shown that increased offshoring can raise growth and welfare in both the domestic and foreign economies. Imposing a tax on firms that relocate abroad can make firms delay this move, but at the cost of lowering both domestic and foreign welfare, as well as growth. A tax on domestic profits has an ambiguous impact on growth, while lowering domestic welfare. The effect that these policy or parameter changes have on domestic income inequality, and international wage inequality is also studied. In contrast to the view that the economic impact of outsourcing is equivalent to that of admitting more immigrants, the present model implies that these policies are nearly the opposite of each other. Immigration reduces growth, and lowers the welfare of both foreign and domestic agents.
O10|Relatedness, economic complexity and convergence across European regions|The aim of this paper is to analyze how the heterogeneous structure of the European regions has affected their patterns of convergence or divergence. We analyse data collected by Eurostat, from a balanced panel of 191 regions and 55 economic branches over the period 2003-2015. In this way, we are able to describe and capture technological proximity across the regions and analyse how it has evolved over space and time. Limiting the analysis to the manufacturing activities, we are also able to measure the degree of economic complexity of the regional production systems and assess how this affects their patterns of growth. Our findings suggest that there are pushing (enhancing convergence) and pulling (exacerbating economic gaps) forces to economic convergence. Spatial effects tend to push towards convergence, with the Eastern regions that started from relatively low levels of GDP per capita and experienced higher growth rates. Nevertheless, the different level of economic complexity tends to widen the gaps between territories: for example, the German regions, whose economic structures are more complex, have kept on widening the gap between themselves and the other European regions. The two different forces are also interconnected as the Eastern regions combine a relatively low level of GDP per capita with a significant level of economic complexity. During the period considered, the improvement in living standards has corresponded to the upgrade of their manufacturing production structures.
O10|Political Representation and the Provision of Public Goods: Theory and Evidence from Ethiopia|While the salience of ethnicity as a factor in ruling coalition formation in African politics has been documented in the literature, less is known about its impact on various ethnic groups' economic outcomes. We construct a simple political economy model to illustrate a way in which investments in public goods in ethnic-based polities may depend on the quality of the ethnic groups' political representation with the federal government. We then exploit a natural experiment that took place in Ethiopia, following the institution of an ethnic federalism in the country in 1995. Using a Difference-in-Difference estimation strategy on repeated cross-sectional data constructed from Censuses and Welfare Monitoring Surveys, we confirm that better political representation improves access to public goods. In Ethiopia's ethnic-based federation, the quality of political representation varies across ethnic regions depending on whether their populations belong or not to the ruling ethnic group at the federal level. Along this line, we found that access to public goods has improved faster in the politically dominant Tigray region than in the other regions. Similarly, the hierarchy of public goods access rates' in different ethnic regions is consistent with the proximity of the political elites from different regions to the center of political power in the country. We also found that the regional disparities in terms of access to public goods are more pronounced in rural areas than in urban areas.
O10|A Fresh Chance for Africa's Youth: Labour Market Effects of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA)|The African Continental Free Trade Area marks a historic decision on the road to regional economic integration on the continent. If implemented, the agreement has the potential to make a significant impact on improving the livelihoods of the African people, by increasing intra-African trade and generating new employment opportunities on an integrated African labour market.
O10|Inequality and Welfare Dynamics in the Russian Federation during 1994-2015|The Russian Federation offers the unique example of a leading centrally planned economy swiftly transforming itself into a market-oriented economy. This paper offers a comprehensive study of inequality and mobility patterns for Russia, using multiple rounds of the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Surveys over the past two decades spanning this transition. The findings show rising income levels and decreasing inequality, with the latter being mostly caused by pro-poor growth rather than redistribution. The poorest tercile experienced a growth rate that was more than 10 times that of the richest tercile, leading to less long-term inequality than short-term inequality. The analysis also finds that switching from a part-time job to a full-time job, from a lower-skill job to a higher-skill job, or staying in the formal sector is statistically significantly associated with reduced downward mobility and increased income growth. However, a similar transition from the private sector to the public sector is negatively associated with income growth.
O10|Whither the evolution of the contemporary social fabric? New technologies and old socio-economic trends|"The reflections which follow build on two interrelated questions, namely, first, whether we are witnessing another ""industrial revolution"", and second, what is the impact of technological transformations upon the current dynamics of the socio-economic fabric, especially with respect to employment, income distribution, working conditions and labour relations. We argue that the processes of innovation and diffusion of what we could call ""intelligent automation"" are likely to change, or more likely reinforce, the patterns of distribution of income and power, which have been there well before the arrival of the technologies we are concerned about: some are indeed intrinsic features of capitalism since its inception, while others are features of the last thirtyforty years. First, we shall offer a fresco of such tendencies which certainly preceded any potential ""Fourth Industrial Revolution"" but are going to be amplified by the latter. Second, we discuss the features of such possible new techno-economic paradigms. Third, we examine the relationships between technology, productivity and growth, and the ensuing impact on jobs, division of labour, distribution of knowledge, power, and control. Finally, we address some policy implications."
O10|Decomposing a decomposition: Within-country differences and the role of structural change in productivity growth|In this article, we investigate the relevance of structural change in country-wide productivity growth considering within-country differences. For this purpose, we propose a two-step decomposition approach that accounts for differences among subnational units. To highlight the relevance of our procedure compared to the prevalent approach in the existing development literature (which usually neglects subnational differences), we show an application with data for the Mexican economy. Specifically, we contrast findings obtained from country-sector data on the one hand with those obtained from (more disaggregated) state-sector data on the other hand. One main insight is that the qualitative and quantitative results differ substantially between the two approaches. Our procedure reveals that structural change appeared to be growth-reducing during the period from 2005 to 2016. We show that this negative effect is driven mainly by the reallocation of (low-skilled) labor within subnational units.
O10|Ethnic Geography: Measurement and Evidence|The effects of ethnic geography, i.e., the distribution of ethnic groups across space, on economic, political and social outcomes are not well understood. We develop a novel index of ethnic segregation that takes both ethnic and spatial distances between individuals into account. Importantly, we can decompose this index into indices of spatial dispersion, generalized ethnic fractionalization, and the alignment of spatial and ethnic distances. We use maps of traditional ethnic homelands, historical population density data, and language trees to compute these four indices for more than 150 countries. We apply these indices to study the relation between historical ethnic geography and current economic, political and social outcomes. Among other things, we document that countries with higher historical alignment, i.e., countries where ethnically diverse individuals lived far apart, have higher-quality government, higher incomes and higher levels of trust.

O10|The Impact of Public Health Insurance on Medical Utilization in a Vulnerable Population: Evidence from COFA Migrants|In March of 2015, the State of Hawaii stopped covering the vast majority of migrants from countries belonging to the Compact of Free Association (COFA) in the state Medicaid program. As a result COFA migrants were required to obtain private insurance in health insurance exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act. Using statewide administrative hospital discharge data, we show that Medicaid-funded hospitalizations and emergency room visits declined in this population by 69% and 42% after the expiration of Medicaid eligibility. Utilization funded by private insurance did increase but not enough to offset the declines in publicly-funded utilization. This resulted in a net decrease in utilization. In addition, we show that uninsured ER visits increased as a consequence of the expiration of Medicaid benefits. Paradoxically, we also find a substantial increase in Medicaid-funded ER visits by infants after the expiration of benefits which is consistent with a substitution of ER visits for ambulatory care for the very young.
O10|A step-by-step approach to social marketing in energy transition|By examining social marketing this articles has featured a step-by step approach for residential behavioural change towards sustainable energy transition. Specifically, this article considers the value-based approach instead of rational information campaigns for behavioural change of energy users. The proposed framework is based on environmental values and designed to transform the selected destructive behaviour into a sustainable one. The framework consist of five steps: (1) selecting the behaviour, (2) user orientation, (3) exchange, (4) marketing mix: elements of intervention, (5) measuring behaviour change. As behavioural change is the final goal of any energy efficiency campaign, it becomes also a starting point and an objective of the rest of the activities in the framework. Second, we suggest using the user orientation concept that divides the society into three groups based on their attitude towards environmental issues, i.e. environmentalist, the environmentally concerned and the disinterested. In the third step we apply the exchange theory; whereas in the step of â€˜marketing mixâ€™ a conceptual combination of six elements for energy transition is reasoned: proposition, cost, communication, communities and partnership. Finally, the fifth step stresses on the measurement of the behavioural change that enables energy transition. The proposed step-by step framework is based on theory and builded on current practice in a field that is analysed in the article.
O10|All that Glitters is not Gold. The Political Economy of Randomized Evaluations in Development|Randomized control trials (RCTs) have a narrow scope, restricted to basic intervention schemes. Experimental designs also display specific biases and political uses when implemented in the real world. Despite these limitations, the method has been advertised as the gold standard to evaluate development policies. This article adopts a political economy approach to explore this paradox. It argues that the success of RCTs is driven mainly by a new scientific business model based on a mix of simplicity and mathematical rigour, media and donor appeal, and academic and financial returns. This in turn meets current interests and preferences in the academic world and the donor community.
O10|The Effect of Antimalarial Campaigns on Child Mortality and Fertility in Sub-Saharan Africa|We examine to what extent recent declines in mortality and fertility in sub-Saharan Africa can be attributed to insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs). Exploiting the rapid increase in ITNs during the mid-2000s, we employ a difference-in-differences estimation strategy to identify the causal effect of ITNs on mortality and fertility. We show that ITNs reduced all-cause child mortality, but surprisingly increased total fertility rates in spite of reduced desire for children and increased contraceptive use. We explain this paradox by showing evidence for an unexpected increase in fecundity and sexual activity due to the better health environment after the ITN distribution.
O10|Crony Capitalism As An Electoral Outcome|When property rights are poorly secured, crony relations i.e. the tight connection between the owners of major firms and the government are the primary informal mechanism securing the property. However, this institutional framework creates high entry barriers on markets. We propose a theory that explains why in a democracy the majority of voters may prefer this type of institutions. This paper develops a simple voting model with heterogeneous agents, which differ in their skills and wealth endowment. We show that if the policy space is two-dimensional, the wealthy elite and low-skilled workers may form a majority coalition, supporting the regime with high-entry barriers. In this case, the wealthy elite agrees on a higher level of redistribution, preferred by the least skilled agents. We compare the possibility of this outcome for different voting rules, and prove that the electoral support of crony capitalism is more likely for countries with a low level of human capital and high income and skill inequality. The model is also able to explain different effects of democratization process on the institutional structure of the society.
O10|The Relation Between Synergy And Cycle Values In The Regional Innovation Systems In Norway|The innovation capacity of Norwegian innovation system, according Triple Helix model of innovations approach, is analyzed in terms of mutual information among geographical, sectorial, and size distributions of firms as dimensions of probabilistic entropy. Negative entropies can be considered as a consequence of synergy among these dimensions. Three different techniques for evaluation of temporal synergy evolution are used: R/S analysis, DFT, and geographical synergy decomposition. The calculations are based on data for all Norwegian firms registered between 2002 and 2014. The results suggest that the synergy at the level of both the country and its seven regions show non-chaotic oscillatory behavior and resonate in a set of natural frequencies.
O10|Baumol versus Engel: Accounting for 100 years (1885-1985) of Structural Transformation in Japan|This paper examines the drivers of the long-run structural transformation in Japan. We use a dynamic input-output framework that decomposes the reallocation of the total output across sectors into two components: the Engel effect (demand side) and the Baumol effect (supply side). To perform this task, we employ 13 seven-sector input-output tables spanning 100 years (1885 to 1985). The results show that the Engel effect was the key explanatory factor in more than 60% of the sector-period cases in the pre-WWII period, while the Baumol effect drove structural transformation in more than 75% of such cases in the post-WWII period. Detailed decomposition results suggest that in most of the sectors (agriculture, commerce and services, food, textiles and transport, communication and utilities), changes in private consumption were the dominant force behind the demand-side explanations. The Engel effect was found to be the strongest in the commerce and services sector, which contributed to the rapid growth of GDP in Japan throughout the 20th century

O10|Inequality of opportunity in education: Accounting for the contributions of Sibs, schools and sorting across East Africa|Inequalities in the opportunity to obtain a good education in low-income countries are widely understood to be related to household resources and schooling quality. Yet, to date, most researchers have investigated the contributions of these two factors separately. This paper considers them jointly, paying special attention to their covariation, which indicates whether schools exacerbate or compensate for existing household-based inequalities. The paper develops a new variance decomposition framework and applies it to data on more than one million children in three low-income East African countries. The empirical results show that although household factors account for a significant share of total test score variation, variation in school quality and positive sorting between households and schools are, together, no less important. The analysis also finds evidence of substantial geographical heterogeneity in schooling quality. The paper concludes that promoting equity in education in East Africa requires policies that go beyond raising average school quality and should attend to the distribution of school quality as well as assortative matching between households and schools.
O10|Bright Investments: Measuring the Impact of Transport Infrastructure Using Luminosity Data in Haiti|This paper quantifies the impacts of transport infrastructure investments on economic activity in Haiti, using satellite night-light luminosity as a proxy measure. Our identification strategy exploits the differential timing of rehabilitation projects across various road segments of the primary road network. We combine multiple sources of non-traditional data and carefully address concerns related to unobserved heterogeneity. The results obtained across multiple specifications consistently indicate that receiving a road rehabilitation project leads to an increase in luminosity values of between 6% and 26% at the communal section level. Taking into account the national level elasticity between luminosity values and GDP, we approximate that these interventions translate into communal section-GDP increases of between 0.5% and 2.1%, for communal sections benefited by a transport infrastructure project. We observe temporal and spatial variation in results, and crucially that the larger impacts appear once projects are completed and are concentrated within 2 km buffers around the intervened roads. Neither the richest or the poorest communities reap the benefits from road improvements, with gains accruing to those in the middle of the ranking of communal sections, based on unsatisfied basic needs. Our findings provide novel evidence on the role of transport investments in promoting economic activity in developing countries.
O10|Financial Deepening, Terms of Trade Shocks, and Growth Volatility in Low-Income Countries|This paper contributes to the literature by looking at the possible importance of the structure of the financial system—whether financial intermediation is performed through banks or markets—for macroeconomic volatility, against the backdrop of increased policy attention on strengthening growth resilience. With low income countries (LICs) being the most vulnerable to large and frequent terms of trade shocks, the paper focuses on a sample of 38 LICs over the period 1978-2012 and finds that banking sector development acts as a shock absorber, dampening the transmission of terms of trade shocks to growth volatility. Expanding the sample to 121 developing countries confirms this result, although this role of shock-absorber fades away as economies grow richer. Stock market development, by contrast, appears neither to be a shock absorber nor a shock amplifier for most economies. These findings are robust across fixed effect, System GMM and local projection estimates.
O10|What Drives Risk Perception? A Global Survey withFinancial Professionals and Lay People|Risk is an integral part of many economic decisions, and is vitally important in finance. Despite extensive research on decision-making under risk, little is known about how risks are actually perceived by financial professionals, the key players in global financial markets. In a large-scale survey experiment with 2,213 finance professionals and 4,559 lay people in nine countries representing ~50% of the world's population and more than 60% of the world's gross domestic product, we expose participants to return distributions with equal expected return and we systematically vary the distributions' next three higher moments. Of these, skewness is the only moment that systematically affects financial professionals'€™ perception of financial risk. Strikingly, variance does not influence risk perception, even though return volatility is the most common risk measure in finance in both academia and the industry. When testing other, compound risk measures, the probability to experience losses is the strongest predictor of what is perceived as being risky. Analyzing professionals' propensity to invest, skewness and loss probability have strong predictive power too. However, volatility and kurtosis also have some additional effect on participants' willingness to invest. Our results are very similar for lay people, and they are robust across and within countries with different cultural backgrounds as well as for different job fields of professionals.
O10|Do Pension Benefits Accelerate Cognitive Decline? Evidence from Rural China|Higher life expectancy and rapidly aging populations have led to the introduction of pension programs in developing countries in the last two decades. Using the introduction of a new public policy in China, we estimate the effects of pension benefits on individual cognition, measured by episodic memory and intact mental status, among individuals ages 60 and above. We find large and significant negative effects of the provision of pension benefits on cognitive functioning among the elderly. We find the largest effect of the program on delayed recall, a measure implicated in neurobiological research as an important predictor of the onset of dementia. We show that the program leads to more negative impacts among the female sample. Our findings support the mental retirement hypothesis that decreased mental activity results in atrophy of cognitive skills. We show that retirement plays a significant role in explaining cognitive decline at older ages.
O10|China's overseas lending|"Compared with China's dominance in world trade, its expanding role in global finance is poorly documented and understood. Over the past decades, China has exported record amounts of capital to the rest of the world. Many of these financial flows are not reported to the IMF, the BIS or the World Bank. ""Hidden debts"" to China are especially significant for about three dozen developing countries, and distort the risk assessment in both policy surveillance and the market pricing of sovereign debt. We establish the size, destination, and characteristics of China's overseas lending. We identify three key distinguishing features.First, almost all of China's lending and investment abroad is official. As a result, the standard ""push"" and ""pull"" drivers of private cross-border flows do not play the same role in this case. Second, the documentation of China's capital exports is (at best) opaque. China does not report on its official lending and there is no comprehensive standardized data on Chinese overseas debt stocks and flows. Third, the type of flows is tailored by recipient. Advanced and higher middle-income countries tend to receive portfolio debt flows, via sovereign bond purchases of the People's Bank of China. Lower income developing economies mostly receive direct loans from China's state-owned banks, often at market rates and backed by collateral such as oil. Our new dataset covers a total of 1,974 Chinese loans and 2,947 Chinese grants to 152 countries from 1949 to 2017. We find that about one half of China's overseas loans to the developing world are ""hidden""."
O10|Collective Reputation in Trade: Evidence from the Chinese Dairy Industry|Collective reputation implies an important externality. Among firms trading internationally, quality shocks about one firm’s products could affect the demand of other firms from the same origin country. We study this issue in the context of a large-scale scandal that affected the Chinese dairy industry in 2008. Leveraging rich firm-product level administrative data and official quality inspection reports, we find that the export revenue of contaminated firms dropped by 84% after the scandal, relative to the national industrial trend, and the spillover effect on non-contaminated firms is measured at 64% of the direct effect. Notably, firms deemed innocent by government inspections did not fare any better than noninspected firms. These findings highlight the importance of collective reputation in international trade and the challenges governments might face in signaling quality and restoring trust. Finally, we investigate potential mechanisms that could mediate the strength of the reputation spillover. We find that the spillover effects are smaller in destinations where people have better information about parties involved in the scandal. New firms are more vulnerable to the collective reputation damage than established firms. Supply chain structure matters especially in settings where firms are less vertically integrated and exhibit fragmented upstream-downstream relationships.
O10|Educational funds and economic growth:private versus public funds|This study constructs an overlapping generations model in order to examine the relationshipbetween education and R&D activities. Using this model, we analyze the effect of individuals'borrowing of educational funds on economic growth. We rst consider the benchmark case inwhich individuals borrow educational funds at a market interest rate. We next consider thatindividuals borrow educational funds from a government at a constant rate of interest. If thepolicy interest rate is too low, the number of skilled workers increases, but economic growth isnot achieved in the long run, because an increase in the demand for educational funds owing tothe low policy interest rate crowds out funds for R&D investment and hinders economic growth.In addition, this study examines welfare and intergenerational inequality. When the governmentlowers the policy interest rate, the current generation's welfare level increases. However, futuregenerations' welfare levels will decrease. This study shows that the government faces a trade-offbetween the current generation's welfare and future generations' welfare.
O10|Working for a Living? Women and Childrenâ€™s Labour Inputs in England, 1260-1850|We use new estimates of men, women, and childrenâ€™s wages in combination with cost-of-living indices to explore family living standards across six centuries of English history. A family perspective enables us to quantify the labour inputs required from women and children in circumstances when menâ€™s earnings alone were insufficient to secure a decent standard of living, and so to register the historical relevance of the male breadwinner model. We employ a life-cycle approach where pre-marital savings help married couples manage increasing numbers of dependent children as well as other periods of economic pressure. We find that the male breadwinner model was generally insufficient for a â€˜respectableâ€™ standard of living; women and sometimes children were required to contribute and, even then, couples still faced poverty during old age. However, with the exception of the pre-Black Death period and the first half of the 17th-century, child labour was not essential and in the early modern era and old-age poverty was in retreat. We reconcile our findings with evidence of a surge in child-labour in the late 1700s and early 1800s, with reference to early modern economic growth, and its association with industriousness and consumerism, twin developments which served to stimulate the Industrial Revolution.
O10|From Methodology to Practice (and Back): Georgescu-Roegen's Philosophy of Economics and the Flow-Fund Model|Despite his early contribution to the rise of mathematics in economics, Georgescu-Roegen's later methodological criticism of models has received little attention from historians and philosophers of economics. This paper attempts to fill this gap following two lines. First, I examine his explicitly methodological claims and connect them with related topics in economic methodology. Building on the distinction between dialectical and arithmomorphic concepts, I characterise his approach to theory-making as a three steps process of idealisation, isolation and arithmetisation. In this framework, models perform two functions, checking for logical consistency and facilitating understanding, which can be related to the idea of modelling as theorising. I then confront these general principles with Georgescu-Roegen's flow-fund model of production. I use the methodology as a reading grid of this theory, while examining its limits and complementary principles in practice. This shows a great deal of consistency, where idealisation provides conceptual foundations, isolation determines the relevant problems, and models are built according to structural consistency. The two functions of models are then illustrated by the logical derivation of older principles formulated by Babbage and Smith, and the understanding of the different organisational patterns of production. But some slightly different functions also appear when specific configurations of the model enable to check the conceptual consistency of other theories, or the understanding provided by the model contributes to the formation of new concepts. Hence, the consistency and the complementarity between Georgescu-Roegen's methodology and practice of theory-making provide interesting insights and a useful background for further investigations.
O10|Environmental externalities and free-riding in the household|Water use and electricity use, which generate negative environmental externalities, are susceptible to a second externality problem: with household-level billing, each person enjoys private benefits of consumption but shares the cost with other household members. If individual usage is imperfectly observed (as is typical for water and electricity) and family members are imperfectly altruistic toward one another, households overconsume even from their own perspective. We develop this argument and test its prediction that intrahousehold free-riding dampens price sensitivity. We do so in the context of water use in urban Zambia by combining billing records, randomized price variation, and a lab-experimental measure of intrahousehold altruism. We find that more altruistic households are considerably more price sensitive than are less altruistic households. Our results imply that the socially optimal price needs to be set to correct both the environmental externality and also the intrahousehold externality.
O10|The Dynamic Effects of Computerized VAT Invoices on Chinese Manufacturing Firms|This paper uses a balanced panel of large manufacturing firms to study the dynamic effects of computerizing VAT invoices on tax revenues and firm behavior in China, 1998-2007. We find that computerization explains 10.8% of cumulative VAT revenues and increases the effective average tax rate by approximately 9-12% in the seven subsequent years. The evidence suggests that the effects of computerization change over time: tax revenue gains are likely to be smaller in the long run. Meanwhile, firms reduce output and input, and increase productivity monotonically over time.
O10|Place-Based Policies for Development|"Many development policies, such as placement of infrastructure or local economic development schemes, are ""place-based."" Such policies are generally intended to stimulate private sector investment and economic growth in the treated place, and as such they are difficult to appraise and evaluate. This paper sets out a framework for analyzing the effects of such policies and assessing their social value. It then reviews the literature on place-based policies in the contexts of transport improvements, economic corridors, special economic zones, lagging regions, and urban policies."
O10|Cumulative Impacts of Conditional Cash Transfer Programs: Experimental Evidence from Indonesia|Conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs have spread worldwide, and are designed to promote comprehensive human capital investments in children, starting from encouraging pre-natal and maternal care and early childhood health interventions and continuing through incentivizing school attendance. Yet evaluating these claims over more than a few years is hard, as most CCT experiments extend the program to the control group after a short experimental period. This paper experimentally estimates the impacts of Indonesia’s cash transfer program (PKH) six years after the program launched, using data from about 14,000 households in 360 sub-districts across Indonesia, taking advantage of the fact that treatment and control locations remained largely intact throughout the period. We find that PKH continues to have large static incentive effects on many of the targeted indicators, increasing usage of trained health professionals for childbirth dramatically and halving the share of children age 7-15 who are not enrolled in school. Wage labor for 13-15 year olds was reduced by at least one-third. We also begin to observe impacts on outcomes that may require cumulative investments: for example, six years later, we observe large reductions in stunting and some evidence of increased high school completion rates. The results suggest that CCT investments can have substantial effects on the accumulation of human capital, and that these effects can persist even when programs are operating at large-scale without researcher intervention.
O10|Market Integration, Demand and the Growth of Firms: Evidence from a Natural Experiment in India|In many developing countries, the average firm is small, does not grow and has low productivity. Lack of market integration and limited information on non-local products often leave consumers unaware of the prices and quality of non-local firms. They therefore mostly buy locally, limiting firms’ potential market size (and competition). We explore this hypothesis using a natural experiment in the Kerala boat-building industry. As consumers learn more about non-local builders, high quality builders gain market share and grow, while low quality firms exit. Aggregate quality increases, as does labor specialization, and average production costs decrease. Finally, quality-adjusted consumer prices decline.
O10|Landmines and Spatial Development|"Landmine contamination affects the lives of millions in many conflict-ridden countries long after the cessation of hostilities. Yet, little research exists on its impact on post-conflict recovery. In this study, we explore the economic consequences of landmine clearance in Mozambique, the only country that has moved from ""heavily-contaminated"" in 1992 to ""mine-free"" status in 2015. First, we compile a dataset detailing the evolution of clearance, collecting thousands of reports from the numerous demining actors. Second, we exploit the timing of demining to assess its impact on local economic activity, as reflected in satellite images of light density at night. The analysis reveals a moderate positive association that masks sizeable heterogeneity. Economic activity responds strongly to clearance of the transportation network, trade hubs, and more populous areas, while the demining-development association is weak in rural areas of low population density. Third, recognizing that landmine removal reconË figured the accessibility to the transportation infrastructure, we apply a ""market-access"" approach to quantify both its direct and indirect effects. The market-access estimates reveal substantial improvements on aggregate economic activity. The market-access benefits of demining are also present in localities without any contamination. Fourth, counterfactual policy simulations project considerable gains had the fragmented process of clearance in Mozambique been centrally coordinated, prioritizing clearance of the colonial transportation routes."
O10|Per Capita Income, Consumption Patterns, and CO2 Emissions|This paper investigates the role of income-driven differences in consumption patterns in explaining and projecting energy demand and CO2 emissions. We develop and estimate a general-equilibrium model with non-homothetic preferences across a large set of countries and sectors, and trace embodied energy consumption through intermediate use and trade linkages. Consumption of energy goods is less than proportional to income in rich countries, and more income-elastic in low-income countries. While income effects are weaker for embodied energy, we find a significant negative relationship between income elasticity and CO2 intensity across all goods. These income-driven differences in consumption choices can partially explain the observed inverted-U relationship between income and emissions across countries, the so-called environmental Kuznet curve. Relative to standard models with homothetic preferences, simulations suggest that income growth leads to lower emissions in high-income countries and higher emissions in some low-income countries, with only modest reductions in world emissions on aggregate.
O10|Historical Legacies and African Development|"As Africa's role on the global stage is rising, so does the need to understand the shadow of history on the continent's economy and polity. We discuss recent works that shed light on Africa's colonial and precolonial legacies. The emerging corpus is remarkably interdisciplinary. Archives, ethnographic materials, georeferenced censuses, surveys, and satellite imagery are some of the sources often combined to test influential conjectures put forward in African historiography. Exploiting within-country variation and employing credible, albeit mostly local, identification techniques, this recent literature has uncovered strong evidence of historical continuity as well as instances of rupture in the evolution of the African economy. The exposition proceeds in reverse chronological order. Starting from the colonial period, which has been linked to almost all of Africa's post-independence maladies, we first review works that uncover the lasting legacies of colonial investments in infrastructure and human capital and quantify the role of various extractive institutions, such as indirect rule and oppression associated with concessionary agreements. Second, we discuss the long-lasting impact of the ""Scramble for Africa"" which led to ethnic partitioning and the creation of artificial modern states. Third, we cover studies on the multi-faceted legacy of the slave trades. Fourth, we analyze the contemporary role of various precolonial, ethnic-specific, institutional and social traits, such as political centralization. We conclude by offering some thoughts on what we view as open questions."
O10|Geographical Roots of the Coevolution of Cultural and Linguistic Traits|This research explores the geographical origins of the coevolution of cultural and linguistic traits in the course of human history, relating the geographical roots of long-term orientation to the structure of the future tense, the agricultural determinants of gender bias to the presence of sex-based grammatical gender, and the ecological origins of hierarchical orientation to the existence of politeness distinctions. The study advances the hypothesis and establishes empirically that: (i) geographical characteristics that were conducive to higher natural return to agricultural investment contributed to the existing cross-language variations in the structure of the future tense, (ii) the agricultural determinants of gender gap in agricultural productivity fostered the existence of sex-based grammatical gender, and (iii) the ecological origins of hierarchical societies triggered the emergence of politeness distinctions.
O10|Enhancing governance in Thailand|The Peace pillar of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development encompasses a diverse range of issues including stability and effective governance. Reforming the public sector is high on the government’s agenda, but involves a number of challenges: the gap between planning and implementation of policy objectives remains large; insufficient public participation in policy making is undermining the efficient allocation of resources toward public needs and development goals; under-development of evidence-based regulations is hampering the creation of a business-friendly environment essential to high value-added activities; and high levels of perceived corruption are weakening business confidence and public trust in the government. Thailand’s 12th Economic and Social Development Plan emphasises the importance of public sector reform. It sets out measures to strengthen co-ordination across ministries and agencies aimed at improving implementation of policy programmes, boosting public participation in policy making, improving online access to government services and combating corruption by strengthening integrity measures. The upcoming 20-year National Strategy and the accompanying National Reform Plan are expected to pave the way for future development. However, an inclusive and consultative process will be essential to ensure the success of reform efforts. This Working Paper relates to the Initial Assessment report of the Multi-dimensional Country Review of Thailand. (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/multi-dimensional-review-thailand.htm)
O10|On Poverty and the International Allocation of Development Aid|We analyze the role of poverty levels in the allocation of international development aid. We estimate “claims” for each recipient, based on the incidence and depth of poverty in its territory, and explore possible reallocations of the current (overall) official development assistance (ODA) based on those claims. We consider four allocation rules rooted in ancient sources: the Aristotelian proportional rule, two constrained egalitarian rules, inspired by Maimonides, and the Talmud rule. Each of them is grounded on different normative principles, which allows us to assess the recipients’ claims in different ways. Our results indicate that the current allocation of international development aid cannot be supported by any of those rules, which makes us conclude that the allocation of ODA is not truly driven by the goal of eradicating world’s poverty.
O10|Economic development in post-war Thailand|This paper discusses five aspects of Thailand’s economic performance since World War II: the changing rate of growth and its composition; the sources of that growth; the causes and consequences of the Asian Financial Crisis (AFC) of 1997-99, including the reason it originated in Thailand; the distribution among the Thai population of the fruits of long-term growth; and whether Thailand is caught in a middle-income trap. The evidence from Thailand demolishes the notion that economic growth fails to benefit the poor – provided ‘benefit’ is understood in absolute and not relative terms. It is argued that Thailand is now caught in a ‘middle-income trap’ caused by a backward and under-resourced educational system. Exit is possible, but requires a public commitment to overcoming the under-supply of human capital that a market-based economic system inherently produces and to raising the public revenue needed to finance higher levels of educational investment.
O10|Tolerance for inequality: Hirschman's tunnel effect revisited|Along the path of economic development, advancement of some groups naturally generates economic disparity in society. The concurrent presence of both winners and losers invariably give rise to the psychologically economic question of how the losers perceive and respond to the benefits of development. The ‘tunnel effect’ proposed by Hirschman provides valuable insights for understanding the changing tolerance of economic inequality in the process of economic development. This paper critically discusses this proposition, reviews the related literature, and provides possible extensions. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
O10|Endogenous growth and entropy|This paper offers novel insights regarding the role of complexity in both the transitional and the long-run dynamics of the economy. We devise an endogenous growth model that encompasses long-run economic change building on the concept of entropy as a time-varying state-dependent complexity effect. We show that the empirical evidence supports entropy as an ’operator’ of the complexity effect. It also suggests that part of the modern innovations have a stabilizing role in the complexity of the economies, as the ‘operator’ levels off despite the continuous increase in the measure of technological varieties. The model features endogenous growth, with null or small scale effects, or stagnation, in the long run. The model can replicate well the take-off after the industrial revolution and the productivity slowdown in the second half of the XXth century. Long-run scenarios based on in-sample calibration are discussed, and may help explain (part of) the growth crises affecting the current generation.
O10|Relatedness and growth: The impact of creative industries to the wider economy|The role of the cultural and creative industries (CCIs) in fostering both innovation and growth in the wider economy has been much debated, beginning with Bakhshi et al.'s (2008) seminal contribution. Such studies of creative environments tend to assign a strategic role to territories, but they provide little empirical evidence. In this paper, the issues of the creative economy are combined with evolutionary economic geography (EEG) topics in an attempt to understand whether the CCIs are able to foster innovation and growth in the wider economy. Using an indicator of the relatedness density between the creative and other sectors for the Italian provinces, we analyse employment growth and innovation over a period of ten years (2006?2015) by drawing from the AMADEUS database. A panel data analysis is then applied to investigate the role of relatedness and the clustering of the creative industries in wider economic growth, which shows that, at a local level, the creative industries require the presence of other sectors with a high degree of cognitive proximity/relatedness, while the capacity for development and innovation does not merely depend on their presence, but also on their relations and interdependencies with other economic sectors.
O10|The multifaceted relationship between environmental risks and poverty: new insights from Vietnam|Despite complex interlinkages, insights into the multifaceted relationship between environmental risks and poverty can be gained through an analysis of different risks across space, time and scale within a single context using consistent methods. Combining geo-spatial data on eight environmental risks and household survey data from 2010–2014 for the case study of Vietnam, this paper shows: (i) at the district level, the incidence of poverty is higher in high risk areas, (ii) at the household level, poorer households face higher environmental risks, (iii) for some risks the relationship with household-level consumption varies between rural and urban areas, and (iv) environmental risks explain consumption differences between households, but less so changes over time. While altogether these analyses cannot establish a causal relationship between environmental risks and poverty, they do indicate that Vietnam's poor are disproportionally exposed. Given growing pressures due to climate change, addressing such risks should be a focus of poverty reduction efforts.
O10|Ethnic Favoritism: Winner Takes All or Power Sharing? Evidence from school constructions in Benin| Ethnic favoritism often distorts public policies in fractionalized countries, especially in Subsaharan Africa. We estimate the impact of a change in the ethnic group of the education minister and of the president on school construction in Benin. We estimate difference in differences and regression discontinuities based on the dates of the changes, and we find that school constructions are more frequent when the district is coethnic with a new education minister, but less frequent when the district is coethnic with a new president. The effects are very large in magnitude: a coethnic education minister approximately doubles the number of school constructions, a coethnic president approximately divides this number by two. These results suggest that the president does not systematically favor his own ethnic group but has to share power in order to survive. By appointing politicians from other ethnic groups in the government, she redistributes power to these groups, as ministers have the discretionary power to favor their own group. This specific pattern of ethnic favoritism vanishes after the democratization of Benin, in 1991. The checks and balances created by democracy seemingly prevented ethnically targeted public policies.
O10|Stranded Assets: How Policy Uncertainty affects Capital, Growth, and the Environment|Standard environmental economics prescribes policies which are optimal and implemented immediately. The paper argues that, in reality, environmental policy often deviates from the optimum and implementation is not deterministic but subject to major uncertainty and frequent change. We present a model with a stochastic policy process that affects investors’ decisions and the composition of capital. We assume that pollution is reduced by private green services and public abatement. The government subsidizes green services and taxes dirty capital albeit at a rate which may become random, causing unexpected capital write-offs. Tax jumps depend on environmental degradation and the share of green services. We show how policy uncertainty affects capital valuation and how it alters individual portfolios, green services, and economic growth.
O10|Escaping Damocles' Sword: Endogenous Climate Shocks in a Growing Economy|Climate economics has been criticized for ignoring uncertainty, catastrophic changes, and tipping points (Stern 2016). The present paper addresses these issues. We consider multiple climate shocks which are recurring, random, uninsurable, and potentially large. The associated damages and the hazard rate are endogenously driven by the stock of greenhouse gases. We provide closed-form solutions for the optimal climate policy and the growth rate of the economy. The optimal path is characterized by a constant growth rate of consumption and of the capital stock until a shock arrives, triggering a downward jump in both variables. The mitigation policy consists of a simple and intuitive rule which requires spending a constant fraction of output on emissions abatement. In a quantitative assessment we show that under favorable conditions the abatement expenditure represents 0.5% of output, equivalent to $37 per ton carbon. Under less favorable conditions with respect to abatement technology and damages, coupled with a relative risk aversion which exceeds unity, the abatement propensity increases to 2.9%, equivalent to $212 per ton carbon, and it jumps to a striking 10% in the pessimistic scenario involving severe shocks and a possible crossing of a tipping point.
O10|About Ethics in Thinking of Great Philosophers|Ethics, an integral part of philosophy, has evolved closely with philosophical doctrines, with the obvious general-specific relationship between philosophy and ethics. At all stages of the evolution of philosophy, beginning with antiquity, many philosophers were animated by the desire to build and consolidate their thinking in the form of doctrines, currents, concepts and philosophical guidelines, materialized, usually in works, many of them of recognized value over the centuries. The use of several concepts for defining and analyzing different philosophical thoughts (doctrine, conception, current, theory, philosophical orientation), is imposed by several factors associated with a philosophical thinking, such as: theoretical importance and Practice, degree of substantiation, resistance to critical positions of analysts, scientific authority of the exponent of a doctrine, concepts, currents, philosophical guidelines etc.
O10|The determinants of economic growth in countries with high marine biodiversity|In this paper, we explore the economic growth determinants in 74 countries with high marine biodiversity for the period 1960-2009 through methodologies that take into account theory and specification uncertainty and the presence of multiple growth regimes. We find, firstly, that neoclassical (income), demography, macroeconomic policy, natural capital, fractionalisation and institutions theories are robust determinants of economic growth in these coastal countries. These results suggest that a country’s capacity to deal with marine biodiversity is associated with factors that impact economic growth. Secondly, in contrast with worldwide data sets, macroeconomic policies and natural capital are additional robust determinants of economic growth. There is strong historical evidence on the role of macroeconomic policies and non-renewable natural resources in trade flows and economic growth in coastal countries. Both factors, together with demography, highlight the pressures that coastal areas can be subject to such as construction and public works, population growth and urbanisation which, in turn, may degrade marine biodiversity. In fact, compared to other countries, coastal countries with high marine biodiversity have higher fertility rates, higher international trade exchanges, greater government consumption and lower institutional endowments. Thirdly, we find that education plays an important role in these countries. The rate of economic convergence increases with the level of education. Moreover, education and investment in physical capital have a significant and positive impact on economic growth in countries with very high levels of marine biodiversity. All together, our results suggest that diversifying away from natural capital wealth by investing in education and, more generally, in intangible capital can enhance economic growth, particularly in countries with very high levels of marine biodiversity. In turn, this structural change can contribute to remove pressure from marine biodiversity hotspots, mainly through lower fertility rates as education increases and lower dependence on natural capital exports via coastal areas.
O10|Economic growth determinants in countries with blue carbon: Natural capital as a limiting factor ?|In this paper, we explore the determinants of economic growth in countries with blue carbon, i.e. countries with open access to the sea and high mangrove mitigation potential, to explore the effects of potential antropogenic pressures on these coastal ecosystems. For this purpose, we use a sample of 23 countries across different regions in the world for the period 1960-2009. We find evidence that whereas neoclassical (initial income and investment in physical capital), demography, macroeconomic policy and natural capital are the robust growth theories in countries with blue carbon, investment in physical capital, macroeconomic policy and natural capital are not relevant anymore when using a worldwide sample of countries. The findings on the role of natural capital on economic growth are largely consistent with those of “less developed” countries that our sample represents. Indeed, there is a share over two times lower of national natural capital per capita compared to an average country, and such lower share can be a limiting factor for economic growth. In addition, a too large economic dependence on national natural capital, almost two times higher than in an average country, may also have a negative impact on economic growth. These features, together with the high fertility rates in these countries, highlight the potential antropogenic pressures that coastal areas with blue carbon can be subject to such as land conversion for agriculture or aquaculture, farming run-offs, over-exploitation of blue carbon resources, urbanisation, uncontrolled sewage and public works which, in turn, can degrade blue carbon ecosystems. Given these findings, we empathize the role of central governments to provide incentives for the protection of these nature-based solutions at the level of local policy makers and communities, and of international financial institutions to provide financial support for such initiatives in these “less developed” countries.
O10|Financial Deepening, Terms of Trade Shocks, and Growth Volatility in Low-Income Countries|This paper contributes to the literature by looking at the possible importance of the structure of the financial system—whether financial intermediation is performed through banks or markets—for macroeconomic volatility, against the backdrop of increased policy attention on strengthening growth resilience. With low income countries (LICs) being the most vulnerable to large and frequent terms of trade shocks, the paper focuses on a sample of 38 LICs over the period 1978-2012 and finds that banking sector development acts as a shock absorber, dampening the transmission of terms of trade shocks to growth volatility. Expanding the sample to 121 developing countries confirms this result, although this role of shock-absorber fades away as economies grow richer. Stock market development, by contrast, appears neither to be a shock absorber nor a shock amplifier for most economies. These findings are robust across fixed effect, System GMM and local projection estimates.
O10|Cash transfers, polygamy, and intimate partner violence: Experimental evidence from Mali| Cash transfer programs primarily targeting women in Latin America and East Africa have been shown to reduce intimate partner violence (IPV), but knowledge gaps remain on how impacts differ by program features and context. Using a randomized control trial, we investigate the IPV impacts of Maliâ€™s national cash transfer program (JigisÃ©mÃ¨jiri), which primarily targets men in a West African context where nearly 40 percent of households are polygamous. The program causes significant decreases in IPV in polygamous households â€“ where physical violence decreases by 7 percentage points, emotional violence decreases by 12 percentage points, and controlling behaviors decrease by 16 percentage points but has limited effects in nonpolygamous households. Evidence on mechanisms suggests that the program led to significant decreases in menâ€™s stress and anxiety among polygamous households, and larger reductions in disputes in polygamous households compared to non-polygamous households.
O10|Circle of Fortune: The Long Term Impact of Western Customs Institutions in China|This paper studies the persistent impact of good institutions on economic development in China. By exploiting a British-driven institutional switch in part of China's customs stations in 1902, I find that counties that were more affected by the British customs institutions are also better developed today. Moreover, I show that the institutional switch was exogenous to the pre-colonial development, and I provide different estima- tion models to reveal a robust and causal relationship between good institutions and economic development.
O10|Economic Analysis of Sea Shellfish as a Basic Material for Making Shellfish Souvenirs|Objective - Indonesia consists mainly of waters and is therefore rich in various marine products, either in the form of fish or other resources. One such property is shells. The selection of sea shells as a business material is based on the use of sea shells for daily needs. The price of sea shells is relatively cheap and the use of sea shells as a material for making souvenirs and handmade ornaments is a promising business prospect. Methodology/Technique - In planning this activity, the location of the marketing of the product is the central region of the city of Semarang. This area is home to a large source of sea shells and there is a lack of souvenir businesses using sea shells to make their products. Findings - The results of the study show that seashell businesses located in Situbondo Regency are experiencing good growth in recent years. Novelty - The research is one of few on seashell business in the context of Indonesia. This research opens the ways to bring more investment and growth awareness.
O10|Why Aid-to-GDP Ratios?|Virtually all aid-growth regression studies normalize aid by dividing it by GDP. This paper questions the usefulness of this practice: First, there are no clear theoretical reasons for this practice unless one assumes that donors allocate aid-to-GDP ratios. Second, using aid-to-GDP ratios introduces econometric problems that most likely introduce a downward bias for the aid-growth relationship. We illustrate this point by running simulations in which aid does not affect growth by construction but find strong negative and in some cases also positive correlations when using aid-to-GDP ratios. Finally, we replicate the Burnside-Dollar study and show that there is a significant positive relationship between aid and growth when using total aid instead of the aid-to-GDP ratio. We present a similar finding when estimating aid-growth regressions using data for the last 20 years (1995--2014).
O10|Environmental Externalities and Free-riding in the Household|Water use and electricity use, which generate negative environmental externalities, are susceptible to a second externality problem: with household-level billing, each person enjoys private benefits of consumption but shares the cost with other household members. If individual usage is imperfectly observed (as is typical for water and electricity) and family members are imperfectly altruistic toward one another, households overconsume even from their own perspective. We develop this argument and test its prediction that intrahousehold free-riding dampens price sensitivity. We do so in the context of water use in urban Zambia by combining billing records, randomized price variation, and a lab-experimental measure of intrahousehold altruism. We find that more altruistic households are considerably more price sensitive than are less altruistic households. Our results imply that the socially optimal price needs to be set to correct both the environmental externality and also the intrahousehold externality.
O10|Spatial Patterns of Development: A Meso Approach|Over the past two decades, the literature on comparative development has moved from country-level to within-country analyses. The questions asked have expanded in scope as economists have used satellite images of light density at night and other big spatial data to proxy for development at the desired level. The focus has also shifted from uncovering correlations to identifying causal relations, using elaborate econometric techniques including spatial regression discontinuity designs. In this review, we show how the combination of geographic information systems with insights from disciplines ranging from the earth sciences to linguistics and history has transformed the research landscape on the roots of the spatial patterns of development. We discuss the limitations of the luminosity data and associated econometric techniques and conclude by offering some thoughts on future research.
O10|Women's Empowerment, the Gender Gap in Desired Fertility, and Fertility Outcomes in Developing Countries|We document evidence on preferences for childbearing in developing countries. Across countries, men usually desire larger families than women do. Within countries, we find wide dispersion in spouses' desired fertility: there are many couples whose ideal family size differs by five children or more. This disagreement between spouses suggests that the extent to which women are empowered should matter for fertility choices. We point to evidence at both the macro and micro levels that this is indeed the case. We conclude that taking account of household bargaining and women's empowerment in analyses of fertility is an important challenge for research.
O10|Place-Based Policies for Development|Many development policies, such as placement of infrastructure or local economic development schemes, are “place-based.” Such policies are generally intended to stimulate private sector investment and economic growth in the treated place, and as such they are difficult to appraise and evaluate. This paper sets out a framework for analyzing the effects of such policies and assessing their social value. It then reviews the literature on place-based policies in the contexts of transport improvements, economic corridors, special economic zones, lagging regions, and urban policies.
O10|Accountability, Political Capture and Selection into Politics: Evidence from Peruvian Municipalities|We estimate the effects of political accountability on the selection of politicians when accountability mechanisms are prone to political capture. Using a comprehensive dataset that records characteristics of candidates for mayor in the last three local elections in Peru, and a close election sharp regression discontinuity design, we compare candidates running for mayor in districts where the incumbent was ousted from office through a recall referendum in the previous electoral term with those who run in districts where the recall referendum failed by a small margin. Candidates in municipalities where the incumbent was recalled are less educated, have less experience in elected offices and in the public sector, and are younger. These findings are consistent with a framework where potential candidates learn about an accountability mechanism which is prone to capture, distorting the main objectives of improving the quality of government, and instead discouraging high quality candidates to run. The negative selection of candidates is partially offset by voters, who elect the best politician out of a lower quality pool of candidates.
O10|Instrumental Variables in the Long Run|In the field of long-run economic growth, it is common to use historical or geographical variables as instruments for contemporary endogenous regressors. We study the interpretation of these conventional instrumental variable (IV) regressions in a simple, but general, framework. We are interested in estimating the long-run causal effect of changes in historical conditions. For this purpose, we develop an augmented IV estimator that accounts for the degree of persistence in the endogenous regressor. We apply our results to estimate the long-run effect of institutions on economic performance. Using panel data, we find that institutional characteristics are imperfectly persistent, implying that conventional IV regressions overestimate the long-run causal effect of institutions. When applying our augmented estimator, we find that increasing constraints on executive power from the lowest to the highest level on the standard index increases national income per capita three centuries later by 1.2 standard deviations.
O10|The Economics of Language|The paper brings together methodological, theoretical, and empirical analysis into the single framework of linguistic diversity. It reflects both historical and contemporary research by economists and other social scientists on the impact of language on economic outcomes and public policies. We examine whether and how language influences human thinking (including emotions) and behavior, analyze the effects of linguistic distances on trade, migrations, financial markets, language learning and its returns. The quantitative foundations of linguistic diversity, which rely on group identification, linguistic distances as well as fractionalization, polarization and disenfranchisement indices are discussed in terms of their empirical challenges and uses. We conclude with an analysis of linguistic policies and shifts of languages and examine their welfare effects and the trade-offs between the development of labor markets and the social costs that they generate in various countries.
O10|Landmines and Spatial Development|"Landmine contamination affects the lives of millions in many conflict-ridden countries long after the cessation of hostilities. Yet, little research exists on its impact on post-conflict recovery. In this study, we explore the economic consequences of landmine clearance in Mozambique, the only country that has moved from ""heavily-contaminated"" in 1992 to ""mine-free"" status in 2015. First, we compile a dataset detailing the evolution of clearance, collecting thousands of reports from the numerous demining actors. Second, we exploit the timing of demining to assess its impact on local economic activity, as reflected in satellite images of light density at night. The analysis reveals a moderate positive association that masks sizeable heterogeneity. Economic activity responds strongly to clearance of the transportation network, trade hubs, and more populous areas, while the demining-development association is weak in rural areas of low population density. Third, recognizing that landmine removal recon figured the accessibility to the transportation infrastructure, we apply a ""market-access"" approach to quantify both its direct and indirect effects. The market-access estimates reveal substantial improvements on aggregate economic activity. The market-access benefits of demining are also present in localities without any contamination. Fourth, counterfactual policy simulations project considerable gains had the fragmented process of clearance in Mozambique been centrally coordinated, prioritizing clearance of the colonial transportation routes."
O10|Per Capita Income, Consumption Patterns, and CO2 Emissions|This paper investigates the role of income-driven differences in consumption patterns in explaining and projecting energy demand and CO 2 emissions. We develop and estimate a general-equilibrium model with non-homothetic preferences across a large set of countries and sectors, and trace embodied energy consumption through intermediate use and trade linkages. Consumption of energy goods is less than proportional to income in rich countries, and more income-elastic in low-income countries. While income effects are weaker for embodied energy, we find a significant negative relationship between income elasticity and CO 2 intensity across all goods. These income-driven differences in consumption choices can partially explain the observed inverted-U relationship between income and emissions across countries, the so-called environmental Kuznet curve. Relative to standard models with homothetic preferences, simulations suggest that income growth leads to lower emissions in high-income countries and higher emissions in some low-income countries, with only modest reductions in world emissions on aggregate.
O10|Historical Legacies and African Development|"As Africa's role on the global stage is rising, so does the need to understand the shadow of history on the continent's economy and polity. We discuss recent works that shed light on Africa's colonial and precolonial legacies. The emerging corpus is remarkably interdisciplinary. Archives, ethnographic materials, georeferenced censuses, surveys, and satellite imagery are some of the sources often combined to test influential conjectures put forward in African historiography. Exploiting within-country variation and employing credible, albeit mostly local, identification techniques, this recent literature has uncovered strong evidence of historical continuity as well as instances of rupture in the evolution of the African economy. The exposition proceeds in reverse chronological order. Starting from the colonial period, which has been linked to almost all of Africa's post-independence maladies, we first review works that uncover the lasting legacies of colonial investments in infrastructure and human capital and quantify the role of various extractive institutions, such as indirect rule and oppression associated with concessionary agreements. Second, we discuss the long-lasting impact of the ""Scramble for Africa"" which led to ethnic partitioning and the creation of artificial modern states. Third, we cover studies on the multi-faceted legacy of the slave trades. Fourth, we analyze the contemporary role of various precolonial, ethnic-specific, institutional and social traits, such as political centralization. We conclude by offering some thoughts on what we view as open questions."
O10|Climatic Roots of Loss Aversion|This research explores the origins of loss aversion and the variation in its prevalence across regions, nations and ethnic group. It advances the hypothesis and establishes empirically that the evolution of loss aversion in the course of human history can be traced to the adaptation of individuals to the asymmetric effects of climatic shocks on reproductive success during the Malthusian epoch. Exploiting variations in the degree of loss aversion among second generation migrants in Europe and the US, as well as across precolonial ethnic groups, the research establishes that consistent with the predictions of the theory, individuals and ethnic groups that are originated in regions in which climatic conditions tended to be spatially correlated, and thus shocks were aggregate in nature, are characterized by greater intensity of loss aversion, while descendants of regions marked by climatic volatility have greater propensity towards loss-neutrality.
O10|Nepotism, Schooling Outcomes and Economic Development|Schooling outcomes matter for economic development. At the same time, educational policies around the globe often fail to effectively improve them. This paper suggests perceived nepotism as an important barrier to the development of cognitive skills as schooling outcomes. We argue that students in countries that perceive labor markets to be nepotistic experience a weaker economic motive to invest in human capital. To formally motivate this relationship, we develop a dynamic general equilibrium model in which nepotism is explained as an evolving cultural norm. We test the central prediction of the model by relating the PISA scores to an indicator for perceived nepotism at the country level. The findings show that, on average, an increase in one standard deviation of the perceived nepotism indicator decreases the PISA reading scores by 0.21 standard deviations, conditioning for overall corruption perception. Several robustness checks corroborate the stability of our estimate. The analysis implies that recruitment practices in labor markets strongly shape individual's efforts to accumulate human capital. Accordingly, the consideration thereof may enhance educational policy efforts.
O10|Economic Resilience and the Dynamics of Capital Stock|The role of capital stock in measuring resilience is investigated. Based on the current and potential growth paths we propose new indexes to better measure the characteristics associated with resilience: adaptability and resistance to shocks. The dynamics of capital instead of employment is used as a proxy for economic welfare, considered ideal to represent the evolution of economic systems. The two series of capital stock for the US and Spanish economies, associated with the short-run and the long-run trajectories, allows us to empirically compute the indexes and draw conclusions about their ability to resist shocks and absorb their effects.
O10|Modelo de Desarrollo Propio y su Potencial para la Construcción de Paz Territorial|The signing of peace agreements between the Colombian government and the FARC itself does not guarantee peace in terms of human lives, peace requires, but it is not enough, the end of war hostilities, the peacebuilding needs to stop the direct violence, but fundamentally build the social, economic and cultural conditions that progressively eliminate the structural and symbolic violence. This article aims to approach the Nasa aboriginal natives from the municipality of Toribío (Cauca) development model, to identify the main characteristics of this model of self-development that have allowed and constitute a potential to the construction of territorial peace. Highlighting the productive participation, the social participation and the community policy, which allows to expand its capacity of articulation between the different institutions and territorial agents, integrating the economic and political project in the “Proyecto Nasa”. The version here presented corresponds to the updated study.
O10|SDG 16 on Governance and its measurement: Africa in the Lead|(english) This article provides some elements for reflection on an apparent paradox. On the one hand, Africa appears to be the continent most riddled by problems related to governance and conflict; on the other hand, it is at the forefront in both promoting the issue of governance at the international level and in implementing its statistical measurement, an observation that has gone largely unnoticed until now. Will Africa manage to maintain its lead following the adoption by all countries of Sustainable Development Goal 16 on governance, peace and security, to which the continent contributed greatly?_________________________________ (français) Cet article se propose d’apporter des éléments de réflexion sur un apparent paradoxe : alors que l’Afrique apparaît comme le continent où les questions de gouvernance et de conflits sont les plus problématiques, c’est également celui qui se montre le plus en pointe, à la fois dans la promotion de cette thématique au niveau international et dans la mise en oeuvre de sa mesure statistique, un constat passé largement inaperçu jusqu’ici. Cette avance pourra-t-elle se maintenir avec l’adoption par tous les pays de l’Objectif de Développement Durable 16 sur la gouvernance, la paix et la sécurité, auquel le continent a largement contribué ?e la société malgache. La faible organisation, tant du côté d’élites fragmentées que d’une population atomisée géographiquement et socialement, n’est pas propice à l’émergence de violences politiques. Mais c’est surtout la prégnance d’une violence symbolique systémique qui permet le maintien de l’ordre établi et freine l’émergence de mobilisations susceptibles de remettre en cause l’équilibre de la société. Faiblesse organisationnelle, normes sociales et violence symbolique se conjuguent pour une apparente paix sociale. Celle-ci reflète moins une solidité institutionnelle que la domination symbolique de la classe élitaire.
O10|Responding to the SDG16 Measurement Challenge: The Governance, Peace and Security Survey Modules in Africa|This paper presents an ongoing initiative, built on a practical approach grounded in fieldwork, to produce harmonised statistics on governance, peace and security (GPS) at continental level in Africa. The methodology consists of adding standardised GPS modules to official socioeconomic household surveys. In keeping with the widely promoted principles of inclusiveness and participation, the use of statistical surveys of large, representative samples of the population is a good strategy for voicing citizens’ views and concerns. The adoption of the 2030 agenda, which positions institution‐building and governance issues as a cornerstone of sustainable development, provides a unique opportunity to consolidate this pioneering African experience. Institutionalisation of the production of GPS statistics by national statistics offices in the official statistics field offers a promising means to take up the Goal 16 measurement challenge. The paper describes the main methodological options for doing so and draws lessons and initial evidence from a dozen countries that have piloted the GPS survey module. Selected empirical results illustrate the analytical potential and policy relevance of this approach.
O10|Sous la crise anglophone au Cameroun: frustrations politiques et défiance à l’égard des autorités publiques|A l’aube d’un 7ème mandat présidentiel de Paul Biya, la situation politique s'est sévèrement dégradée au Cameroun depuis 2016, avec notamment la résurgence des velléités sécessionnistes des deux régions anglophones, le Nord-Ouest et le Sud-Ouest. Quelles sont les bases sociales et politiques des tensions qui parcourent ces deux régions ? Pour ce faire, nous mobilisons principalement une enquête statistique originale menée auprès de la population fin 2014 sur la Gouvernance, la Paix et la Sécurité (GPS-SHaSA), réalisée avec l’appui scientifique des auteurs. L’article montre que la situation n'est pas que le reflet de stratégies individuelles d’entrepreneurs politiques en mal d’assises électorales et sans ancrage populaire sérieux. La crise anglophone reflète bien des aspirations démocratiques d’une population qui se considère comme des citoyens de seconde zone. Certes, sur de nombreux aspects les Anglophones ne se distinguent pas substantiellement de leurs homologues francophones ; ils ne vivent pas des difficultés plus aigües au quotidien, ni ne se montrent forcément plus négatifs. En revanche, il est un domaine où la « question anglophone » prend corps : leur défiance massive à l’égard du pouvoir et des institutions publiques. _______english________ At the dawn of a 7th presidential term of Paul Biya, following the election of October 7, 2018, Cameroon’s political situation has deteriorated dramatically since 2016 largely due to the resurgence of separatist impulses in the two Anglophone Northwest and Southwest regions. What are the social and political causes of the unrest sweeping through these two regions? In answer to this question, we draw primarily on an original statistical survey of the population on Governance, Peace and Security (GPS-SHaSA) conducted with the authors’ scientific assistance in late 2014. The article shows that the situation is not merely the reflection of individual strategies by political entrepreneurs in need of an electoral base and with no serious popular support. The Anglophone crisis reflects many of the democratic aspirations of a population who see themselves as second-class citizens. In many ways, the English speakers are not so very different from their French-speaking counterparts; they neither experience more serious difficulties day to day nor are they necessarily more negative. However, there is one area in which the “Anglophone issue” really takes shape: their massive distrust of government and public institutions.
O10|The Economics of Language|The paper brings together methodological, theoretical, and empirical analysis into the single framework of linguistic diversity. It reflects both historical and contemporary research by economists and other social scientists on the impact of language on economic outcomes and public policies. We examine whether and how language influences human thinking (including emotions) and behavior, analyze the effects of linguistic distances on trade, migrations, financial markets, language learning and its returns. The quantitative foundations of linguistic diversity, which rely on group identification, linguistic distances as well as fractionalization, polarization and disenfranchisement indices are discussed in terms of their empirical challenges and uses.

O10|On Poverty and the International Allocation of Development Aid|"We analyze the role of poverty levels on the allocation of international development aid. We estimate “claims"" for each recipient, based on the incidence and depth of poverty in its territory, and explore possible reallocations of the current (overall) official development assistance (ODA) based on those claims. We consider four allocation rules rooted in ancient sources: the Aristotelian proportional rule, two constrained egalitarian rules, inspired by Maimonides, and the Talmud rule. Each of them is grounded on different normative principles, which allows assessing claims in different ways. Our results indicate that the current allocation of international development aid cannot be supported by any of those rules, which leads us to conclude that the allocation of ODA is not driven by eradicating world's poverty as a goal."
O10|Development in Africa|The purpose of the chapter is to analyze Africaâ€™s economic successes in the past half century, to understand not only what made it possible but also and more importantly what risk factors may eventually bring it to an end or compromise it. While it may not be possible for Africa to alter, for now, its position in the world system, it may nonetheless create the conditions for sustained economic growth and development by deepening democracy, enhancing the stability of political regimes and by reducing the incidence of tropical diseases.
O10|Democracy and Governance|The purpose of the paper is to show that the nature of the relationship between governance and democracy varies depending on how the two terms (of a political discourse) are defined, that when the definition of one term encompasses distinctive features of the other we find that governance and democracy are not just mutually reinforcing but even overlapping, that only when we distinguish on theoretical ground governance from democracy we create the basis for analyzing their relationship on empirical grounds exactly as Fukuyama had suggested.
O10|Human Capital, Knowledge Creation, Knowledge Diffusion, Institutions and Economic Incentives: South Korea versus Africa|This article compares African countries to South Korea in terms of knowledge economy (KE). Emphasis is laid on human capital, knowledge creation, knowledge diffusion, institutions and economic incentives. The analytical approach consists of providing knowledge economy catch-up strategies that can be understood within the context of country-specific gaps between the frontier country in KE and laggard African countries. The empirical evidence is based on sigma convergence with data for the period 1996-2010. Overall, a KE diagnosis is provided by assessing KE gaps (between South Korea and specific-African countries) and suggesting compelling catch-up strategies with which to reduce identified gaps. Contemporary and non-contemporary policies from South Korea and more contemporary policies based on challenges of globalisation are discussed. The policy relevance of this inquiry aligns with the scholarly perspective that catch-up between South Korea and more advanced economies was accelerated by the former adapting to and assimilating relatively obsolete technological know-how from more developed nations.
O10|Lessons from a Survey of Chinaâ€™s Economic Diplomacy|Today, the West faces a considerable dilemma in their support for the Washington Consensus as a dominant approach for development because the Beijing model has grown to become an unavoidable process which can only be neglected at the cost of standing on the wrong side of economic history. The Washington Consensus, the hitherto dominant scheme, is being encroached on by the Beijing model. Many African nations are increasingly embracing this later method because the prevailing Western model has failed to deliver on a number of objectives. This is increasingly evident because Chinaâ€™s economic diplomacy has been politely and strategically coined to achieve it. A case study is used herein to articulate the different strands of the survey. The paper puts some structure on Chinaâ€™s economic diplomatic strategies and discusses lessons for Africa, China and the West. It contributes to existing literature by critically assessing why it is necessary for the West to modify the conception and definition of the Washington Consensus as a counterpart to the Beijing model. In order to remain relevant in the 21st century and beyond, the Washington Consensus should incorporate those ideas which are in conformity with Moyoâ€™s (2013) conjecture. This postulates that, while the Beijing model is optimal in the short-run, the Washington Consensus remains the ideal long-term development model because it is more inclusive of the rights demanded by individuals at different income categories.
O10|The Effectiveness Of Development Aid For Agriculture In Sub-Saharan Africa|Agriculture is the major source of livelihood for the majority population in Sub- Saharan Africa, but its productivity is not only low it has started showing signs of decline since 2012. The paper seeks to find out whether official development assistance for agriculture is effective. The data for development assistance for agriculture are broken down into the major agricultural sectors in receiving countries.
O10|Introduction|Sustainable development within the investigated context includes the ability of African countries to meet the present economic, social and environmental needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. A challenging contemporary policy syndrome is the lack of funding for adequate capacities and structures essential for the realisation of the post-2015 development agenda. This introductory chapter provides highlights on all chapters covered by the book in the direction of addressing the underlying policy syndrome.
O10|An Integrative Framework for Entrepreneurship Research in Africa|Despite the good intentions in sub-Sahara Africa (SSA), previous policy initiatives on entrepreneurship have been disjointed, unambitious, and implemented without commitment and required resources. Furthermore, there has been limited research that can provide insight into the reasons why some of the policy initiatives appear to be successful while others fail. Some scholars have suggested that without a context-specific classificatory guide, policymakers are unlikely to be accurate in their assessment of the growth capabilities of prospective candidates for specific promotion initiatives and this can explain some of the policy failures. This observation has motivated the present paper. Our aim is to provide a framework that helps identify the different contextual dimensions influencing enterprise creation processes in SSA.
O10|Knowledge-Driven Economic Growth: The Case of Sub-Saharan Africa|The experience of South Korea, India, China and Singapore reveals that developing economies can fasttrack development, leapfrog the stages of development and catch up with advanced economies by putting knowledge capital as the driver of development. If the knowledge economy is therefore an accelerant of development for both advanced and developing economies, it is possible for Sub-Saharan African (SSA) economies to also catch up with advanced economies. It was on this basis that this study assessed the knowledge capacity of SSA and the effect it has on its economic advancement. Given the importance of the interrelatedness among the knowledge economy elements, this study, thus, examined how the interaction effect between the elements of the knowledge economy affects economic growth in 32 SSA countries, for which data were available, over the period of 17 years (1996-2012). Using the System Generalized Method of Moments (SGMM), the study found out that institutions and human capital in SSA mitigate the effect of innovation on economic growth in the region, thus, making it a lean knowledge economy.
O10|Doing Business and Inclusive Human Development in Sub-Saharan Africa|Purpose- This study examines how doing business affects inclusive human development in 48 sub-Saharan Africa for the period 2000-2012. Design/methodology/approach- The measurement of inclusive human development encompasses both absolute pro-poor and relative pro-poor concepts of inclusive development. Three doing business variables are used, namely: the number of start-up procedures required to register a business; time required to start a business; and time to prepare and pay taxes. The empirical evidence is based on Fixed Effects and Generalised Method of Moments regressions. Findings- The findings show that increasing constraints to the doing of business have a negative effect on inclusive human development. Originality/value- The study is timely and very relevant to the post-2015 Sustainable Development agenda for two fundamental reasons: (i) Exclusive development is a critical policy syndrome in Africa because about 50% of countries in the continent did not attain the MDG extreme poverty target despite enjoying more than two decades of growth resurgence. (ii) Growth in Africa is primarily driven by large extractive industries and with the population of the continent expected to double in about 30 years, scholarship on entrepreneurship for inclusive development is very welcome. This is essentially because studies have shown that the increase in unemployment (resulting from the underlying demographic change) would be accommodated by the private sector, not the public sector.
O10|Recent finance advances in information technology for inclusive development: a systematic review|Abstract The overarching question tackled in this paper is: to what degree has financial development contributed to providing opportunities of human development for those on low-incomes and by which information technology mechanisms? We systematically review about 180 recently published papers to provide recent information technology advances in finance for inclusive development. Retained financial innovations are structured along three themes. They are: (i) the rural-urban divide, (ii) women empowerment and (iii) human capital in terms of skills and training. The financial instruments are articulated with case studies, innovations and investment strategies with particular emphasis, inter alia on: informal finance, microfinance, mobile banking, crowdfunding, microinsurance, Islamic finance, remittances, Payment for Environmental Services (PES) and the Diaspora Investment in Agriculture (DIA) initiative.
O10|Foreign Aid And Sustainable Inclusive Human Development In Africa|Motivated by evidence that extreme poverty has been decreasing in all regions of the world with the exception of Africa, the study contributes to the literature on reinventing foreign aid by assessing if development assistance can sustain inclusive human development.
O10|Challenges of Doing Business in Africa: A Systematic Review| This paper provides a systematic review of challenges to doing business in Africa. It complements the extant literature by answering two critical questions: what are the linkages between the ease of doing business and economic development; and what are the challenges to doing business in Africa? In providing answers to these questions, the nexus between the ease of doing business and economic development is discussed in six main strands, namely: wealth creation and sharing; opportunities of employment; balanced regional and economic development; Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and GDP per capita; standards of living and exports. Moreover, challenges to doing business are articulated along the following lines: (i) issues related to the cost of starting a business and doing business; (ii) shortage of energy and electricity; (iii) lack of access to finance; and (v) high taxes and low cross-border trade.

The paper puts some structure on Chinaâ€™s economic diplomatic strategies and discusses lessons for Africa, China and the West. It contributes to existing literature by critically assessing why it is necessary for the West to modify the conception and definition of the Washington Consensus as a counterpart to the Beijing model. In order to remain relevant in the 21st century and beyond, the Washington Consensus should incorporate those ideas which are in conformity with Moyoâ€™s (2013) conjecture. This postulates that, while the Beijing model is optimal in the short-run, the Washington Consensus remains the ideal long-term development model because it is more inclusive of the rights demanded by individuals at different income categories.
O10|Introduction|Sustainable development within the investigated context includes the ability of African countries to meet the present economic, social and environmental needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. A challenging contemporary policy syndrome is the lack of funding for adequate capacities and structures essential for the realisation of the post-2015 development agenda. This introductory chapter provides highlights on all chapters covered by the book in the direction of addressing the underlying policy syndrome.
O10|Knowledge-Driven Economic Growth: The Case of Sub-Saharan Africa|The experience of South Korea, India, China and Singapore reveals that developing economies can fasttrack development, leapfrog the stages of development and catch up with advanced economies by putting knowledge capital as the driver of development. If the knowledge economy is therefore an accelerant of development for both advanced and developing economies, it is possible for Sub-Saharan African (SSA) economies to also catch up with advanced economies. It was on this basis that this study assessed the knowledge capacity of SSA and the effect it has on its economic advancement. Given the importance of the interrelatedness among the knowledge economy elements, this study, thus, examined how the interaction effect between the elements of the knowledge economy affects economic growth in 32 SSA countries, for which data were available, over the period of 17 years (1996-2012). Using the System Generalized Method of Moments (SGMM), the study found out that institutions and human capital in SSA mitigate the effect of innovation on economic growth in the region, thus, making it a lean knowledge economy.
O10|Doing Business and Inclusive Human Development in Sub-Saharan Africa|Purpose- This study examines how doing business affects inclusive human development in 48 sub-Saharan Africa for the period 2000-2012. Design/methodology/approach- The measurement of inclusive human development encompasses both absolute pro-poor and relative pro-poor concepts of inclusive development. Three doing business variables are used, namely: the number of start-up procedures required to register a business; time required to start a business; and time to prepare and pay taxes. The empirical evidence is based on Fixed Effects and Generalised Method of Moments regressions. Findings- The findings show that increasing constraints to the doing of business have a negative effect on inclusive human development. Originality/value- The study is timely and very relevant to the post-2015 Sustainable Development agenda for two fundamental reasons: (i) Exclusive development is a critical policy syndrome in Africa because about 50% of countries in the continent did not attain the MDG extreme poverty target despite enjoying more than two decades of growth resurgence. (ii) Growth in Africa is primarily driven by large extractive industries and with the population of the continent expected to double in about 30 years, scholarship on entrepreneurship for inclusive development is very welcome. This is essentially because studies have shown that the increase in unemployment (resulting from the underlying demographic change) would be accommodated by the private sector, not the public sector.
O10|Development in Africa|The purpose of the chapter is to analyze Africa’s economic successes in the past half century, to understand not only what made it possible but also and more importantly what risk factors may eventually bring it to an end or compromise it. While it may not be possible for Africa to alter, for now, its position in the world system, it may nonetheless create the conditions for sustained economic growth and development by deepening democracy, enhancing the stability of political regimes and by reducing the incidence of tropical diseases.
O10|Lessons from a Survey of China’s Economic Diplomacy|Today, the West faces a considerable dilemma in their support for the Washington Consensus as a dominant approach for development because the Beijing model has grown to become an unavoidable process which can only be neglected at the cost of standing on the wrong side of economic history. The Washington Consensus, the hitherto dominant scheme, is being encroached on by the Beijing model. Many African nations are increasingly embracing this later method because the prevailing Western model has failed to deliver on a number of objectives. This is increasingly evident because China’s economic diplomacy has been politely and strategically coined to achieve it. A case study is used herein to articulate the different strands of the survey. The paper puts some structure on China’s economic diplomatic strategies and discusses lessons for Africa, China and the West. It contributes to existing literature by critically assessing why it is necessary for the West to modify the conception and definition of the Washington Consensus as a counterpart to the Beijing model. In order to remain relevant in the 21st century and beyond, the Washington Consensus should incorporate those ideas which are in conformity with Moyo’s (2013) conjecture. This postulates that, while the Beijing model is optimal in the short-run, the Washington Consensus remains the ideal long-term development model because it is more inclusive of the rights demanded by individuals at different income categories.

O10|Más de cien años de avances en el nivel de vida: El caso de Colombia|Este trabajo examina las tendencias a largo plazo observadas en el nivel de vida de la población colombiana durante los últimos cien años, con especial atención a la salud. Construimos un índice histórico de desarrollo humano para Colombia (IHDHC) para los siglos XIX y XX por género. Encontramos que no hubo avances importantes en los niveles de vida durante el siglo XIX, debido principalmente al estancamiento del PIB per cápita. Por el contrario, se observaron avances significativos en el siglo XX, especialmente en las mujeres. Durante la primera mitad del siglo, las mejoras se debieron principalmente a un mayor ingreso per cápita, mientras que las posteriores a la década de 1950 fueron el resultado de una mayor inversión pública en educación y salud. Los datos en salud muestran que el porcentaje de muertes por tuberculosis, neumonía y enfermedades gastrointestinales disminuyó significativamente a lo largo del siglo. Por el contrario, las muertes causadas por cáncer y enfermedades del corazón aumentaron considerablemente en las últimas décadas. Los resultados indican que la disminución en la tasa de mortalidad estuvo relacionada en gran medida con la expansión en el suministro de servicios de acueductos y alcantarillado. ******ABSTRACT: This paper examines the long-term trends observed in the standard of living of the Colombian population during the past one hundred years, with special attention on health. We construct a historical index of human development for Colombia (HIHDC) for the 19th and 20th centuries by gender. We find that there were no major advances in living standards during the 19th century due to the stagnation of GDP per capita as a result of the lack of dynamism in exports. On the contrary, significant advances in the HIHDC were seen in the twentieth century, especially for women. During the first half of the 20th century, the improvements were mainly driven by a higher per capita income, while improvements after the 1950s were driven by greater public investment in education and health. The health data show that the percentage of deaths from tuberculosis, pneumonia, and gastrointestinal diseases decreased significantly throughout the century. On the contrary, deaths caused by cancer and heart diseases have increased considerably in recent decades. Results show that the decline in mortality rate was largely related with the expansion in the provision of public goods, namely aqueducts and sewerage services.
O10|Movimientos sociales y desarrollo económico en Chocó y Buenaventura|Desde mediados del siglo XX los movimientos sociales en Chocó y Buenaventura han sido la principal forma de reclamación por el rezago económico y social que experimentan estos territorios. En la mayoría de los casos las protestas han terminado con el compromiso del gobierno de realizar inversiones para superar las brechas. Sin embargo, las manifestaciones continúan, argumentadas en el incumplimiento o el poco avance de lo pactado. Ante esta situación han surgido dos visiones opuestas: la idea de un olvido estatal por parte de los habitantes y el uso ineficiente de los recursos existentes que sugiere el gobierno nacional. El principal objetivo de este documento es revisar la evidencia que permita examinar estas tesis. Los resultados muestran que, en efecto, los gobiernos nacionales y locales han ejecutado más recursos. Sin embargo, las necesidades de inversión que revelan los indicadores, y que coinciden con las peticiones de las protestas, superan en algunos casos los fondos disponibles. Mejorar la gestión pública local, a través de una mayor transparencia y calidad del gasto, podría ser una buena oportunidad para trabajar en la superación del rezago. **** ABSTRACT: Since the 1960s, social movements in Choco and Buenaventura have emerged to demand solutions for the region’s economic and social lag. In most cases, the population reaches an agreement with the government, where the latter compromises on specific investments to overcome the region’s lag. Despite the former, agreements aren’t totally fulfilled and protests continue. Hence, two opposing perspectives have emerged: the region’s inhabitants argue the government ignores their needs, while the national government claims an inefficient use of existing resources. The aim of this paper is to revise these arguments using available evidence. Results show that more resources have been executed in the region. However, investment needs, revealed both through indicators and protesters demands, surpass available funds in some cases. Improving public administration, through higher fiscal transparency and spending efficiency, might be a good opportunity to work on overcoming the region’s lag.
O10|Accountability, Political Capture and Selection into Politics: Evidence from Peruvian Municipalities|We estimate the effects of political accountability on the selection of politicians when accountability mechanisms are prone to political capture. Using a comprehensive dataset containing the characteristics and background of candidates running for mayor in the last three local elections in Peru, and a close election sharp regression discontinuity design, we compare candidates running for mayor in districts where the incumbent was ousted from office through a recall referendum in the previous electoral term with those who run in districts where the recall referendum failed by a small margin. Candidates in municipalities where the incumbent was recalled are less educated, have less experience in elected offices and in the public sector. These candidates are also less representative of indigenous groups. Our findings are consistent with a framework where potential candidates learn about an accountability mechanism which is prone to political capture, distorting the main objectives of improving the quality of governance, and instead discouraging high quality candidates to run. The negative selection of candidates is partially offset by voters, who elect the best politician out of a lower quality pool of candidates, but still we observe effects on policy outcomes.
O10|The slow road from serfdom : Labor coercion and long-run development in the former Russian Empire|This paper examines the long-run economic consequences of Russian serfdom. Employing data on the intensity of labor coercion at the district level in just prior to emancipation in 1861, we document that a greater legacy of serfdom is associated with lower economic well-being today. Our estimates imply that increasing historical serfdom by 25 percentage points reduces household expenditure today by up to 17%. The analysis of different types of labor coercion reveals substantial heterogeneity in the long-run effects of serfdom. Furthermore, we document persistence of economic development measured by city populations over the period 1800 - 2002 in cross-sectional regressions and panel estimations. Exploring mechanisms, our results suggest that the effect of serfdom on urbanization in Imperial Russia was perpetuated in the Soviet period, with negative implications for structural change, the spatial distribution and productivity of firms, and human capital investment.
O10|Resource Transfers to Local Governments: Political Manipulation and Household Responses in West Bengal|We study how political support of household heads respond to receipt of different private and public good benefits delivered by local governments, and whether upper level governments respond strategically by manipulating program budgets to lower level government in West Bengal, India. We exploit redistricting of electoral boundaries by a non-partisan Election Commission, a plausibly exogenous shock to political competition. Consistent with a model of politically motivated allocation, private recurring benefit programs contracted (resp. expanded) in villages redistricted to more competitive constituencies when bottom and upper tier governments were controlled by opposing (resp. same) parties. The resulting changes in household benefit flows help predict household political support, which in turn rationalize the inter-village targeting patterns. The results illustrate the tendency for political parties to manipulate transfers across constituencies in the absence of formula-based grants to local governments, and more generally for political incentives to focus on delivery of short-term private benefits rather than one-time benefits or public goods consistent with theories of political clientelism.
O10|Geographical Origins of Language Structures|This research explores the geographical origins of the coevolution of cultural and linguistic traits in the course of human history, relating the geographical roots of long-term orientation to the structure of the future tense, the agricultural determinants of gender bias to the presence of sex-based grammatical gender, and the ecological origins of hierarchical orientation to the existence of politeness distinctions. The study advances the hypothesis and establishes empirically that: (i) variations in geographical characteristics that were conducive to higher natural return to agricultural investment contributed to the existing cross-language variations in the structure of the future tense, (ii) the agricultural determinants of gender gap in agricultural productivity fostered the existence of sex-based grammatical gender, and (iii) the ecological origins of hierarchical societies triggered the emergence of politeness distinctions.
O10|Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, development economist|Accounts of Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen’s career as an economist usually focus either on the brilliance of his pioneer contributions to mathematical economics during the 1930s, or more frequently, on his later conversion to a critical approach to economic theory anchored on the centrality of the entropy law in a dynamic setting. These two disparate moments, however, were connected by Georgescu-Roegen’s strong attraction to the study of the problems afflicting underdeveloped societies. This began with his work on the agricultural economy of his native Romania, produced under the auspices of Harvard’s Russian Research Center in the late 1940s. Thenceforth, he embarked on a journey that spawned his early interest in Leontief-type linear models, an extended tour of Southeast Asia commissioned by Vanderbilt University’s Graduate Program in Economic Development, and several visits to Brazil during the 1960s to assist in the development of academic economics in the country. The paper highlights these lesser-known aspects of Georgescu-Roegen’s intellectual trajectory, while using his case to illustrate some of the paths open for inquiry during the heyday of development economics.
O10|Kinship Systems, Cooperation, and the Evolution of Culture|An influential body of psychological and anthropological theories holds that societies exhibit heterogeneous cooperation systems that differ both in their level of in-group favoritism and in the tools that they employ to enforce cooperative behavior. According to some of these theories, entire bundles of functional psychological adaptations – religious beliefs, moral values, negative reciprocity, emotions, and social norms – serve as “psychological police officer” in different cooperation regimes. This paper uses an anthropological measure of the tightness of historical kinship systems to study the structure of cooperation patterns and enforcement devices across historical ethnicities, contemporary countries, ethnicities within countries, and among migrants. The results document that societies with loose ancestral kinship ties cooperate and trust broadly, which appears to be enforced through a belief in moralizing gods, individualizing moral values, internalized guilt, altruistic punishment, and large-scale institutions. Societies with a historically tightly knit kinship structure, on the other hand, cheat on and distrust the out-group but readily support in-group members in need. This cooperation regime in turn is enforced by communal moral values, emotions of external shame, revenge-taking, and local governance structures including strong social norms. These patterns suggest that various seemingly unrelated aspects of culture are all functional and ultimately serve the same purpose of regulating economic behavior.
O10|Divorce and Gold Coins: A Case Study of Iran|The increasing divorce rate has become a major social concern for policy makers in the Islamic government of Iran. The price of gold coin is an important factor in cost-benefit analysis for individuals in their marriage and divorce decisions in Iran. Dowries (Mehrieh) are usually in the form of gold coin and a wife has a legal right to them upon both parties signing the marriage contract. Increasing the price of gold coin may intensify the internal stress and struggles within families, leading to a higher probability of divorce. We investigate the long-run relationship between real price of gold coin and divorce rate for the case of Iran over the period 1980-2014. Controlling for other factors, our regression results show that there is a positive and significant long-run relationship between real price of gold coin (as well as unanticipated changes in real price of gold coin) and marital instability.
O10|Machine Learning Indices, Political Institutions, and Economic Development|We present a new aggregation method - called SVM algorithm - and use this technique to produce novel measures of democracy (186 countries, 1960-2014). The method takes its name from a machine learning technique for pattern recognition and has three notable features: it makes functional assumptions unnecessary, it accounts for measurement uncertainty, and it creates continuous and dichotomous indices. We use the SVM indices to investigate the effect of democratic institutions on economic development, and find that democracies grow faster than autocracies. Furthermore, we illustrate how the estimation results are affected by conceptual and methodological changes in the measure of democracy. In particular, we show that instrumental variables cannot compensate for measurement errors produced by conventional aggregation methods, and explain why this failure leads to an overestimation of regression coefficients.
O10|Refugee resettlement, redistribution and growth|This paper studies the effect of refugee resettlement on human capital accumulation. The analysis is performed in a growth model with endogenous fertility. I show how refugee resettlement from a more advanced and wealthier economy to a less advanced and less wealthy economy combined with income transfers is Pareto-improving for indigenous populations in both countries. I also derive conditions for the proposed resettlement policy to stimulate human capital accumulation and hence economic growth in both economies.
O10|The Farmer, the Blue-collar, and the Monk: Understanding Economic Development through Saturations of Demands and Non-Homothetic Productivity Gains|To explain the process of development historically documented, we consider a model with three economic sectors (agriculture, manufacturing and services) characterized by different productivity gains and by saturation levels in the demands of agricultural and manufactured goods. Our parsimonious model captures within a single framework the process of development which is characterized by the structural changes in the workforce across sectors, variable growth rates (an initial “Malthusian regime” exhibiting slow growth, a fast growth regime after a takeoff, and a gradual slow down leading to a possible new stagnation) and the relative evolutions of prices across sectors. Reasonable calibration generates results quantitatively close to the observed empirical facts.
O10|Measuring Electoral Competitiveness: With Application to the Indian States|We consider alternative methods of measuring the competitiveness of a majoritarian electoral system in the context of an analysis of Indian State elections. Our analysis highlights a number of weaknesses in the construction and interpretation of commonly used measures such as the effective number of parties, the first versus second place vote margin and safe seats, while presenting these and their proposed alternatives for 14 major Indian states from 1952 to 2009. The alternative indexes we present are based in part on ideas that are longstanding in the literature but have not been fully adopted within the Indian context. These indexes incorporate vote volatility, allow for multi-party competition at the constituency level, and adjust for asymmetry among parties of safe seats in the legislature. We argue that these newly computed indexes capture distinct but related dimensions of electoral competition better than do the extant commonly used measures. The analysis of these indexes is then extended to consider the role of caste, class, regionalism and level of development to reveal interesting patterns of commonality and difference in electoral competition across the states.
O10|The Political Economyof Too-Big-To-Fail|"I consider a two-period model in which being “too big” is only a necessary condition for an insolvent firm to receive a government bailout because, in addition to meeting a threshold asset size, the firm must engage in a lobbying contest in order to be bailed out. The firm has a political advantage because its probability of winning the contest is increasing in its size. When the firm experiences an unfavorable price shock, I find that the balance between the size of the requisite bailout and the firm's political advantage of being ""too big to fail"" determines the firm’s probability of getting a bailout. Surprisingly but consistent with the US government’s differential treatment of Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns during the 2008-2010 financial crisis, I find that a smaller firm may receive a bailout while a bigger firm will not, although both firms meet the threshold size of “too big to fail” and a firm's political advantage is increasing in its size."
O10|Top Lights: Bright cities and their contribution to economic development|Tracking the development of cities in emerging economies is difficult with conventional data. We show that satellite images of nighttime lights are a reliable proxy for economic activity at the city level, provided they are first corrected for topcoding. The commonly-used data fail to capture the true brightness of many cities. We present a stylized model of urban luminosity and empirical evidence which both suggest that these 'top lights' can be characterized by a Pareto distribution. We then propose a simple correction procedure which recovers the full distribution of city lights. Our results show that the brightest cities account for nearly a third of global economic activity. Applying this approach to cities in Sub-Saharan Africa, we find that primate cities are outgrowing secondary cities but are changing from within. Poorer neighborhoods are developing, but sub-centers are forming so that Africa's largest cities are also becoming increasingly fragmented.
O10|Long-run Sustainability in the Green Solow Model|The aim is to advance in the analytical framework of green growth and to shed light on the concept of long run sustainability. We extend the Green Solow model by including a land-capital input and land degradation as a by-product of economic activity. In this framework, the effectiveness of technological progress in abatement depends on the degree of environmental stress, measured as the excess of output growth over land-capital growth. We build land-capital data at the country level using the Enhanced Vegetation Index and calibrate the model for the USA economy. In addition, we estimate the growth equation of per capita CO2 emissions over the period 2000-2011. We find convergence at the global level, statistical significance of the environmental stress parameter and a negative effect of land-capital investment on the growth rate of emissions, implying that in the long run the positive environmental effect is stronger than the production effect.
O10|Regional Industry Cluster Analysis for the Potomac Highlands in West Virginia|This part of the project identifies existing industrial clusters for the Potomac Highlands region in West Virginia and seeks potential industries or clusters for economic development. We also evaluate strengths and gaps of existing industry clusters. Our cluster analysis comprises three parts, including (1) location quotient (LQ) analysis, (2) shift-share analysis, and (3) input-output (I-O) analysis. Results of both location quotient and shift-share analyses are used for industry targeting, whereas input-output analysis measures existing cluster strengths and bottlenecks for potential cluster diversification strategies based on Jackson’s(2015) cluster and diversification strategy (CADS).
O10|What’s in a wedge? Misallocation and Taxation in the Oil Industry|Resource misallocation explains a large part of cross-country productivity differences. Although measuring gaps in marginal products of labor and capital across plants can quantify the extent of this misallocation, it cannot account for its source. We address this problem by using novel microdata from the oil industry (that includes information on taxation) to pin down both the extent and the source of misallocation in the rest-of-the-world versus the United States. We confirm the existence of sizeable gaps in marginal products across production units. However, once differences in direct taxation are accounted for, these gaps largely disappear. This provides strong evidence that gaps in marginal products - and hence productivity - are largely driven by differences in tax policies rather than more indirect distortions.
O10|En torno al Comunal en España: una agenda de investigación llena de retos y promesas|This working paper outlines the challenges faced by scholars studying issues around Spanish common lands from a historical perspective. The text is structured around found main topics: the typology of the commons, the quantification of collective resources, the role of the communal regime and the political economy of these resources.
O10|The ?Lewis Turning Point? in China and its implication for the emergence of a ?Middle Income Trap?: evidence from provincial data|Economic development in China has major implications for the world economy. A China which pushes on to become a high income economy will command considerable influence on the world stage. However, to the extent that China is caught in a middle income trap (MIT), that influence may be mitigated. The literature suggests that the emergence of the Lewis Turning Point (LTP) will signal the possible onset of a MIT. This paper, therefore, pursues the question of whether or not a LTP has been reached in China ? an issue of some debate in the literature ? through the application of provincial data to a simple fixed effects econometric model designed to detect the presence of a LTP.
O10|Economic Freedom in Albania|"At early stages of transition, markets are in their first steps and sometimes do not exist in the literal sense of the word. Even after many years of development, the markets in transitional economies may be imperfect as well as incomplete. In these circumstances we cannot pretend the market system itself will determine prices and reallocate resources to more productive sectors.Also, being for many decades isolated from the outside world and external development, the economy and enterprises themselves are in great need of new and advanced technology. Obviously, there is need of economic sustainability and the social environment for the establishment and development of private sector.In these circumstances, obviously there is need for some restrictions and obligations. These are necessary for the very existence of a country, but when these limits exceed the target then the problem arises. Economic freedom, inter alia, will be defined as ""the lack of pressure or governmental constraints on the production, distribution or consumption of utility goods beyond what is needed for citizens to protect and preserve their freedom to work, produce, consume and invested so that they feel they are productive ""(Angjeli, A; 2007: 70).Over two?thirds of studies on economic freedom, found it to correspond to a ?good? outcome such as faster growth, better living standards, more happiness, etc. ( Hall, C. J; Lawson, A. R; 2013) For these reasons, we are having a look on economic freedom to see how this indicator has affected the Albanian economy and whether its values are comparable to those of the countries we aspire to."
O10|The Digital Era, Viewed From a Perspective of Millennia of Economic Growth|I propose a synthetic theory of economic growth and technological progress over the entire human history. Based on this theory as well as on the analogies with three previous eras (the hunter-gatherer era, the agricultural era and the industrial era) and the technological revolutions which initiated them, I draw conclusions for the contemporary digital era. I argue that each opening of a new era adds a new, previously inactive dimension of economic development, and redefines the key inputs and output of the production process. Economic growth accelerates across the consecutive eras, but there are also big shifts in factor shares and inequality. The two key inputs to the digital-era production process are hardware and software. Human skilled labor is complementary to hardware and substitutable with software, which increasingly includes sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. I also argue that economists have not yet designed sufficient measurement tools, economic policies and institutions appropriate for the digital-era economy

O10|Geographical Origins of Language Structures |This research explores the geographical origins of the coevolution of cultural and linguistic traits in the course of human history, relating the geographical roots of long-term orientation to the structure of the future tense, the agricultural determinants of gender bias to the presence of sex-based grammatical gender, and the ecological origins of hierarchical orientation to the existence of politeness distinctions. The study advances the hypothesis and establishes empirically that: (i) variations in geographical characteristics that were conducive to higher natural return to agricultural investment contributed to the existing cross-language variations in the structure of the future tense, (ii) the agricultural determinants of gender gap in agricultural productivity fostered the existence of sex-based grammatical gender, and (iii) the ecological origins of hierarchical societies triggered the emergence of politeness distinctions.
O10|The Origins of the Division of Labor in Pre-modern Times|This research explores the historical roots of the division of labor in pre-modern societies. It advances the hypothesis and establishes empirically that intra-ethnic diversity had a positive effect on the division of labor across ethnicities in the pre-modern era. Exploiting a variety of identification strategies and a novel ethnic level dataset combining geocoded ethnographic, linguistic and genetic data, it establishes that higher levels of intra-ethnic diversity were conducive to economic specialization in the pre-modern era. The findings are robust to a host of geographical, institutional, cultural and historical confounders, and suggest that variation in intra-ethnic diversity is the main predictor of the division of labor in pre-modern times.

O10|American Radical Economists in Maoâ€™s China: From Hopes to Disillusionment|American radical economists in the 1960s perceived China under Maoism as an important experiment in creating a new society, aspects of which they hoped could serve as a model for the developing world. But the knowledge of â€˜actually existing Maoismâ€™ was very limited due to the mutual isolation between China and the US. This paper analyses the First Friendship Delegation of American Radical Political Economists (FFDARPE) to the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China in 1972, consisting mainly of Union for Radical Political Economics (URPE) members, which was the first visit of a group of American economists to China since 1949. Based on interviews with trip participants as well as archival and published material, this paper studies what we can learn about the engagement with Maoism by American radical economists from their dialogues with Chinese hosts, from their on-the-ground observations, and their reflection upon return. We show how the visitorsâ€™ own ideas conflicted and intersected with their perception of the Maoist practice on gender relations; workersâ€™ management and life in the communes. We also shed light on the diverging conceptions of the role for economic expertise between URPE and late Maoism. As the first in-depth study on the FFDARPE we provide rich empirical insights into an ice-breaking event in the larger process of normalization in the Sino- U.S relations, that ultimately led to the disillusionment of the Left with China.
O10|A Dangerous Alliance? The Relationship Between Ecuador and China|Abstract The aim of this article is to outline the relationship between Ecuador and China, highlighting its main threats to the development of the Ecuadorian Republic, and in particular how the implementation of the buen vivir economic paradigm which Ecuador is experimenting with may be affected if it does not change the terms of engagement with the Asian giant. The article is structured as follows: in the introduction, we present an overview of the historical framework of the Chinese relationship with Ecuador. There follows an analysis supported by data on the commercial situation between the two countries and its implications for the development of the Latin-American state. In our final remarks, we present the possible routes that Ecuador could follow to secure its path to development, while highlighting possible conditions under which Ecuador could cooperate with China while avoiding a state of dependency.
O10|Gender Composition of Children and Sanitation Behavior In India|Open Defecation has been linked to various public health issues and has gained significant policy attention. Investing in adoption of better sanitation has also been advocated on the grounds of providing women with privacy and protection from po-tential harassment. Nonetheless, previous research has shown that due to son-biased preferences, households in India under-invest in outcomes for their female children. I use the gender of the first-born child as an indicator of the presence of adult female children in households and find that, in certain cases, households reduce open defeca-tion if the first-born child is a girl. The findings in this paper provide a new first stage association between gender composition of children and sanitation behavior and also contribute to the economic literature on decision making in households belonging to developing countries.
O10|Distribuição Funcional da Renda e Crescimento Econômico: uma Síntese da Literatura Empírica|This paper aims to expose and present a collection of some of the major empirical evidences reported by the Bhaduri-Marglin distribution and growth literature. Furthermore, some of the critical aspects of this literature are probed, namely, the recurrent empirical regularities, the distinct econometric methodologies employed and the difficulties faced by said literature. First, an arrangement of the results produced by a portion of this literature, referred to as the single equation literature and characterized by the use of single equation econometric methods, is presented and discussed. In this perspective, it is possible to observe an evidential trend towards the wage-led nature of economic growth. These conclusions change slightly in favor of the profit-led alignment, once elements of trade are introduced. However, this switch is not enough to overturn the wage-led predominance of results. Meanwhile, the multiple equation portion of the literature, so named since it employs multiple equation econometric approaches, rose out of the need to tackle potential endogeneity issues not accounted for by the single equation studies. In this scope, evidential results are still scarce, given that multiple equation models are defined by their complexity in application. On the other hand, reported results of multiple equation studies do not reinforce the unequivocal wage-led trend detected by the single equation literature.
O10|Desenvolvimento e subdesenvolvimento econômicos: discussões teóricas da ortodoxia, da CEPAL e de Celso Furtado|The objective of this work will be to revisit the ideas from the orthodox authors, Lewis, Nurkse and Rostow, from the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (CEPAL) and from Celso Furtado about development and underdevelopment. The first authors who discussed the themes mentioned above had a liberal approach to analysis, linking the concept of development with that of economic growth, while the CEPAL and Furtadian analysis began to consider historical, structural and, above all, social aspects within a perspective of Latin American countries. The original of Cepal thought emerged as an alternative line of discussion of development from the point of view of its own elements that were incorporated into Furtadian thought. The paper does not pretend to exhaust such discussion on such a broad theme, but rather to try to link the theme, showing the main characteristics of each line of thought
O10|An Approach to the Problem of Employment in India|The challenge of employment in the Indian economy, especially after it growth acceleration since the mid-1980s, relates to its quality rather than its quantity. While employment growth has kept pace with the labour force over the long run, what has grown is informal employment. The coexistence of rapid capital accumulation, robust output growth and lack of growth of formal employment can be understood using the well-known Harris-Todaro model of a dual economy. This framework highlights the key role of the wage gap between the modern and traditional sectors as a determinant of urban informal employment. Hence, one of the most effective and egalitarian ways to address the employment problem is to adopt policies to increase agricultural productivity and income, which can reduce the wage gap. Since crop yields in India are far lower than many other countries in the world, including China, Brazil, and Bangladesh, there is ample scope for land-augmenting and labour-absorbing technological change in Indian agriculture. Efforts to ramp up industrialization should be taken up in earnest only after the wage gap has been narrowed significantly.
O10|Genetic Diversity and Economic Development : Assessing the Key Findings in Ashraf and Galor (2013)|We replicate Ashraf and Galor (2013) and find that its conclusions concerning the association between human genetic diversity and economic development depend substantially on coding errors and sample selection. We correct the coding errors and add or update data on genetic diversity and population density from high-quality sources. We find little support for the hypothesis that variation in genetic diversity among subpopulations has a systematic relationship with economic development.
O10|Development cooperation to ensure that none be left behind|The development cooperation system is undergoing a dramatic process of change. New actors are on stage, new instruments (beyond ODA) are being used, and the fields of work have been clearly widened. The enlargement of the development cooperation system is in line with the ambitious and comprehensive 2030 Agenda. However, those changes also imply massive tensions and challenges to the current development cooperation system in terms of its objectives, procedures and narrative. This paper presents some of these challenges in light of the â€œleaving no-one behindâ€ mandate. The paper discusses, firstly, how the development cooperation system can be brought up to date, taking into account massive changes in the international landscape; secondly, it argues why development cooperation may be still useful and effective in supporting an Agenda that goes beyond ODA; and finally, it discusses some dilemmas around the way in which resources should be allocated in order to preserve the distributive purpose of development cooperation.
O10|Innovation in Global Value Chains|Developing countries are faced with significant challenges related to building and deepening their innovation capabilities. In this chapter, we focus on innovation in global value chains and on the role that such chains play in building and deepening capability. We also focus on the trajectories along which firms, once inserted into global value chains and located in developing countries, acquire or lose innovation capability. To do so, we bring together the global value chains and innovation systems approaches. Our key arguments are that global value chains interact with innovation systems in multiple ways and that these interactions have important implications for the speed, depth, and overall quality of capability building in developing-country firms. We outline five innovation capability trajectories and show how capability building at the firm level interrelates with the various ways in which global value chains and innovation systems co-evolve.
O10|Top Lights - Bright Cities and their Contribution to Economic Development|The commonly-used satellite images of nighttime lights fail to capture the true brightness of most cities. We show that night lights are a reliable proxy for economic activity at the city level, provided they are first corrected for top-coding. We present a stylized model of urban luminosity and empirical evidence which both suggest that these ‘top lights’ follow a Pareto distribution. We then propose a simple correction procedure which recovers the full distribution of city lights. Applying this approach to cities in Sub-Saharan Africa, we find that primate cities are outgrowing secondary cities but are changing from within.
O10|Entrepreneurship contribution to the three pillars of sustainable development: What does the evidence really say?|Compared to the prior discussion of the emerging research on entrepreneurship and sustainable development, the purpose of this study is to investigate the ability of the entrepreneurial activity to simultaneously enhance economic growth, advance environmental objectives, and improve social conditions in developing countries. We mainly found that entrepreneurship in these countries positively contributes to the economic and social dimensions of sustainable development, while its contribution to the environmental dimension is negative. The results of causality test confirm the interactions among entrepreneurship and these three dimensions in both short and long-run. Limitations and future research directions, some managerial and policy implications for entrepreneurial action in sustainable development are also discussed.
O10|Research in Development Studies: Philosophy, Methods and Rigor|A better understanding of the role, epistemology and methodology of research are very important to generate evidence to strengthen development policies to improve development outcomes. This essay will discuss the philosophy and operationalisation of research in the development arena with the focus on the role of applied research, epistemological issues and boundary setting, the choice of research methods, and conceptualisation of rigour in development research.
O10|The Origins of the Division of Labor in Pre-modern Times|This research explores the historical roots of the division of labor in pre-modern societies. It advances the hypothesis and establishes empirically that intra-ethnic diversity had a positive effect on the division of labor across ethnicities in the pre-modern era. Exploiting a variety of identification strategies and a novel ethnic level dataset combining geocoded ethnographic, linguistic and genetic data, it establishes that higher levels of intra-ethnic diversity were conducive to economic specialization in the pre-modern era. The findings are robust to a host of geographical, institutional, cultural and historical confounders, and suggest that variation in intra-ethnic diversity is the main predictor of the division of labor in pre-modern times.
O10|La Ley Petty-Clark en el Área Metropolitana del Valle de Aburrá en Colombia, en el periodo 2000-2016<BR>[The Petty-Clark law in the Metropolitan Area of The Aburrá Valley in Colombia, in the period 2000-2016]|The topics of interest of the economists have been common since the emergence of the economic discipline like science in the beginnings of the Modernity; the theoretical contributions of William Petty are an example of this. The articles wants to trace the origin of the Petty Clark law from pre-classical thinking; verify compliance with the so-called Petty-Clark Law in the Metropolitan Area of the Aburrá Valley (amva) in Colombia; and to observe the effect of the definition of the Agreement of the City Council of the central city, which establishes the Territorial Planning Plan (pot) and, with respect to the rest of the amva, particularly to the north, show a dynamic, non-homogenous effect in relation to Medellín. Basic econometrics of time series is used between the year 2000 and the year 2016, paying particular attention to the year 2006 when the pot was approved with the use of dichotomous variables, as well as a very small exploration, with some data of the Public Employment Office for the northern municipalities.
O10|Why Companies Fail? The Boiling Frog Syndrome|Why nations fail? An answer is given by Acemoglu and Robinson (2012) by pointing out the importance of institutions for an economy that leads to innovations for economic growth. Christensen (2012) asks a similar question for a firm and diagnoses why companies fail. In this study, I relate Acemoglu and Robinson (2012) with Christensen (2012) in order to better understand how to make companies more prosperous, more powerful, healthier, and live longer via innovations.
O10|Governance, social infrastructure and productivity|I develop a neoclassical growth model in which the government accumulates contestable social infrastructure. In this framework, both a more accountable and more fairness governance encourages governmental accumulation of social infrastructure which fosters productivity. According to the calibrated model, for a country in the lower decile of the distribution of the index of social infrastructure, improving governance fairness by one standard deviation increases, on average, social infrastructure by 84% and GDP per worker by around 38%. However, the quantitative impact of improving governance accountability on social infrastructure and productivity is negligible.
O10|Property Rights, Predation, and Productivity|We develop a neoclassical growth model with imperfect property rights in which predation entails both waste of resources and deadweight losses, the latter becoming very large when the predation rate is high. According to the model, in the United States, the welfare costs of crime represent a loss of 18.6% of consumption per capita. For a country in the average of the last decile of the distribution of an index of business costs of crime across 94 countries, this loss is 57.8%. Moreover, a one standard deviation increase in the quality index of formal institutions securing property rights increases GDP per worker by 23% for a country with an institutional quality index equal to the average of the last decile of its distribution.
O10|Factor Returns and Circular Causality|The presence of circular causality in a region through factor returns is studied in a general equilibrium model in which firms producing final products engage in oligopolistic competition. The intermediate input is produced by capital and labor with a constant returns to scale technology. If the degree of increasing returns in the production of final products is sufficiently high, the return to a factor can increase with the amount of this factor. Thus a higher amount of a factor in a region leads to a higher return to this factor and attracts additional amount of this factor to move in. Capital movement and labor movement can be reinforcing. This type of circular causality means that unbalanced regional development can persist over time.
O10|Broadband and Uneven Spatial Development: The Case of Cardiff City-Region|The internet and e-connectivity more generally are increasingly held to be an important element of business success. Evidence however suggests that the productive impacts of such technologies are contingent on factors that include firm size and sector, and human capital. It follows that if companies with these characteristics are unevenly distributed across space, the increasing importance of broadband in economic activity might impact unevenly on economic outcomes across space. We examine the Cardiff City-Region in South Wales, where the distribution of businesses and skills suggests that without policy intervention the roll out of broadband might further increase economic disparities between the relatively prosperous coastal belt and the poorer post-industrial hinterland.
O10|Does Higher Economic Development Reduce Household Size? Evidence from India|The paper investigates the impact of higher economic development on average household size in India. The analysis finds that increasing income measured by net per capita state domestic product and per capita consumption expenditure has a negative effect on average household size. Variables such as, higher level education, health outcomes, extent of inequality and urbanization has negative effect on the average household size. Lower level of poverty is associated with lower level family size in long run, whereas, infrastructure has a mix effect. Results show that different religious and social groups have an effect on family size in India. Smaller family size faces several problems such as child rearing, depression, separation, anxiety and land distribution dispute. The paper argues that the issue needs to bring into current development policies for changing social structure, land distribution process, and helping for maintaining appropriate balance between work and family which are missing currently.
O10|End of Middle-Classes? Social Inequalities in Digital Age|The paper is about a socioeconomics and sociology of middle classes in a theoretical discussion and empirically focussing at “middle class” segments of different European societies for the time period between 2003 and 2014. The argumentation is strongly embedded to Schumpeterian thought of evolutionary economics but it is tried to link discussion about “creative destruction” to digitalization and the evolution of stratified societies in Europe on international comparison. The paper attempts to question assumptions of growing inequality theoretically and empirically by referring to Collins’ thesis of an increased de-middledization. We argue that the ability of ICT innovations (i.e. digitalization) to perform specialized, routine, and predicted tasks better than human allows them to supress middle skilled labor, affect to the polarization of jobs, and finally lead to de-middledization.
O10|The Knowledge-Diffusion Bottleneck in Economic Growth and Development|If learning and teaching were easy, the whole world would be developed and frontier knowledge would spread quickly. But learning is difficult and there is a finite capacity for teaching. The concept of a knowledge-diffusion ``bottleneck'' can be used to explain why there is a negative correlation between per-capita income growth rates and fertility rates, especially amongst countries that are in the early stages of industrialization. It can also explain why income distributions in rich countries have power-law tails (both upper and lower) and why income growth rates are independent of scale. A simple model of knowledge diffusion is calibrated to the observed paths of structural transformation in newly-industrializing countries. The resulting parameters are found to be consistent with the tail exponents seen in U.S. income data, suggesting a common mechanism of knowledge diffusion operating in developing countries and fully-developed countries.
