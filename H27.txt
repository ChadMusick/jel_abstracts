H27|Communal fees and election cycles: Evidence from German municipalities|The political business cycle theories describe that election-motivated politicians manipulate economic policy-making. Election cycles occur in many fiscal variables, for example tax rates. I examine whether electoral motives influence communal fees in Germany. Fees have to be paid for the use of many public services, for example waste management or sewerage provisions. Fees should be equivalent to the costs of a public service and thus correspond to the benefit principle in public finance. The German municipalities, however, have a leeway to determine fees. I use revenue data for around 7,000 West German municipalities from seven states over the period 1992–2006. The results show that municipalities increase communal fees in election years to a smaller extent than in the middle of the legislative period, while they increase fees more directly after elections. Fees increase in election years by 0.94 euro per capita less and directly after elections by 1.74 euro per capita more than in the middle of the legislative period. The results thus corroborate the predictions of the political business cycle theories.
H27|The impact of international tax information exchange agreements on the use of tax amnesty: evidence from Norway|In this paper we develop a model for tax amnesty applications in a multi-period setting. One key insight from the model is that applying for amnesty becomes more attractive at the moment when stricter enforcement is announced, even if the implementation of the policy is in the distant future. We use our model to make sense of how international tax information exchange agreements affects voluntary disclosure of wealth and income previously hidden in tax havens. Our data is from Norway. In accordance with the dynamic amnesty model we observe a strong announcement effect of a tax information exchange agreement between Norway and Switzerland and Luxembourg, the two most important tax havens for Norwegian tax evaders. However, the effect levels off very quickly, much faster than our model predicts. We think this is because the initial announcement of the tax agreement exaggerated the risk the agreement imposed to those who had hidden taxable income and wealth in Switzerland. We also estimate and find significant effects of the press releases the Norwegian Tax Authority issues to inform taxpayers about new international tax agreements and the amnesty, or voluntary disclosure, option that exists in the Norwegian tax code.

H27|Riflessioni sullâ€™autonomia finanziaria dei comuni italiani|Italian local governmentsâ€™ fiscal authonomy since the early 1990s heavily relied on the local tax on immovable property (ICI â€“ imposta comunale sugli immobili). Local governmentsâ€™ fiscal authonomy in the last 25 years however has not developed linearily, but has suffered from various pressures and reforms often prompted by other and different concerns and priorities. Hence local governmentsâ€™ fiscal authonomy has been affected by three main processes. First the wider development of the process of fiscal decentralisation in Italy, second political concerns for the reduction of fiscal pressure, and finally the wider economic developments, in particular the economic and financial crisis of 2008 and the related problems of public budget balance and growht of the Italian public debt. The purpose of this paper is to anayse the pillars of local governmentsâ€™ fiscal authonomy, starting with local governmentsâ€™ tax on immovable property, and then analysing other sources of financing such as special contributions, ear-marked taxes and urban development charges (oneri di urbanizzazione) with reference also to the tool of partecipatory budgeting.
H27|A Review of Rent-seekers, Profits, Wages and Inequality, The Top 20%, 2019 by Peter Mihalyi and Ivan Szelenyi|The authors, Péter Mihályi and Iván Szelényi, set themselves the ambitious task of formulating an alternative discourse about inequality in which the extent of inequality per se is not the problem but rather where inequalities stem from? Herein lies their fundamental divergence with Piketty (2014) for whom the excessive growth of “profits” is assumed to be the source of inequalities. The problem with mainstream economics and Piketty is that “profit” and “rent” are lumped together. A critical distinction between the two is warranted to grasp the relationship between inequalities, innovation and economic growth. In line with Kornai’s criticism of Piketty (2016), the authors insist on the source of inequality. Are they engendered by wages and profits earned on competitive markets or are they originated from rents due to imposed restrictions on market competition? In contrast with Piketty, the general assumption of the authors is that higher profits and wages often add to the annual growth or national income. Rents on the other hand lower annual growth. Although some forms of rent may even be useful, excessive rents breeds economic stagnation.
H27|Ein Vorschlag zur Grundsteuerreform|The German property tax is probably unconstitutional. Since this tax violates the ability-to-pay principle anyway, the author proposes a simpler design that preserves municipal and state revenues and also avoids increases in housing costs.
H27|Accountability and taxation: Experimental evidence|The Rentier State Hypothesis states that taxation promotes government accountability. The argument is that citizens demand more accountability for spending of tax revenue than for spending of windfall revenue (e.g., natural resource revenue). This paper presents evidence from a between-subject experiment that tests the effect of taxation on demand for accountability and the underlying mechanisms explaining this effect. The design focuses on two main features that distinguish tax from windfall revenue: Tax revenue is produced by citizens' work and has been in their possession before being collected as tax. These features are theorized to increase the salience of fairness considerations in public service provision, and this increased salience of fairness is in turn hypothesized to increase demand for accountability. The main finding is that taxation causes a higher demand for accountability when both features of taxation are present. This result is evidence in support of the Rentier State Hypothesis.
H27|Did the London Congestion Charge Reduce Pollution?|We examine the London congestion charge introduced in 2003 and demonstrate significant reductions in a number of pollutants relative to controls. We even find evidence of reductions per mile driven suggesting amelioration of a congestion externality. Yet, we find a robust countervailing increase in harmful NO2 likely reflecting the disproportionate share of diesel vehicles exempt from the congestion charge. This unintended consequence informs on-going concern about pollution from diesel based vehicles and provides a cautionary note regarding substitution effects implicit in congestion charging schemes.
H27|Tax Evasion and Financial Instability|This article explores the association between tax evasion and financial instability. The discussion also examines the effect of tax evasion for financial instability. The discussion shows that tax evasion can reduce the tax revenue available to governments to manage the economy and can weaken the government’s ability to promote stability in financial systems, while on the other hand, taxpayers who evade taxes feel they can use the evaded tax money to rather improve their own financial stability.
H27|Analisis Pemberdayaan Ekonomi Masyarakat Melalui Penyaluran Zakat Produktif Di Laz Zakat Center Cirebon<BR>[Analysis Of Community Economic Empowerment Through Distribution Of Productive Zakat In Laz Zakat Center Cirebon]|Zakat is an instrument of Islamic teachings that are concerned with humanitarian issues, especially relating to the topic of empowerment and economic welfare of the people. In the early days, zakat was given to Mustahik to deal with problems of financial difficulties consumptively and productively. However, today, the distribution of zakat is considered still not providing the first solution to poverty alleviation. What is done by several zakat institutions, including the Amil Zakat (LAZ) Alms Center of Thoriqotul Jannah in collecting and distributing zakat funds is part of an effort to fill the space. Providing productive business capital for Mustahik to be able to develop business is one of the efforts carried out by the LAZ. It is expected that the Mustahik who initially accept can someday give to become Muzakki.
H27|Study on Council Directive 92/83/EEC on the harmonization of the structures of excise duties on alcohol and alcoholic beverages|The purpose of this Study is to contribute to the Impact Assessment of a possible revision of Council Directive 92/83/EEC on the harmonization of the structures of excise duties on alcohol and alcoholic beverages. The Study includes a baseline assessment of a series of issues, which emerged from the previous evaluation of the Directive and analyses how these problems may evolve if no EU action is taken. Secondly, the Study formulates a set of possible policy options to address these problems and assesses their likely impacts.
H27|Tax Policies in the European Union: 2018 Survey|This report aims to improve the transparency of the European Semester process by publishing in a clear and accessible format the main indicators used to examine Member States' tax policies, alongside information on recent tax reforms. It also sets out some reform options and examples to act as inspiration for Member States looking to improve the fairness and efficiency of their tax systems.
H27|Taxation trends in the European Union: 2018 edition|This report contains a detailed statistical and economic analysis of the tax systems of the Member States of the European Union, plus Iceland and Norway, which are Members of the European Economic Area. The data are presented within a unified statistical framework (the ESA2010 harmonised system of national and regional accounts), which makes it possible to assess the heterogeneous national tax systems on a fully comparable basis.
H27|Transfer taxes and household mobility: Distortion on the housing or labor market?|We estimate the effect of the UK Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) – a transfer tax on the purchase price of property or land – on different types of household mobility using micro data. Exploiting a discontinuity in the tax schedule, we isolate the impact of the tax from other determinants of mobility. We compare homeowners with self-assessed house values on either sides of a cut-off value where the tax rate jumps from 1 to 3 percent. We find that a higher SDLT has a strong negative impact on housing-related and short distance moves but does not adversely affect job-induced or long distance mobility. Overall, our results suggest that transfer taxes may mainly distort housing rather than labor markets.
H27|Using Spatial Distribution of Outlets to Estimate Gambling Incidence|The paper proposes a simple and innovative methodology for measuring the incidence of gambling expenditure in countries for which household survey data is unavailable or unreliable. A first application of this methodology is presented by merging data on the geographical location of gambling outlets, together with residents’ socio-economic and demographic characteristics around that location across all of the 1,600 statistical areas in Israel. It was found that the Israel National Lottery (Lotto) and Toto tend to set up significantly more sales points in disadvantaged neighborhoods after controlling for standard list of factors such as population size and composition. The Suit Index is calculated based on the spatial estimation results and yields a measure of -0.42, which implies that the implicit tax associated with gambling is highly regressive.
H27|Are local governments maximizing land revenue? Evidence from China|This paper examines how political considerations affect local officials' revenue maximization behaviors in the context of urban land conveyance in China. Particularly, we analyze government intervention based on local officials' choice of two land auction types, namely, “English auction” and “two-stage auction”. The latter presumably serves as a tool of government intervention. We aim to address the research question: “Are local governments maximizing land revenue?” The major findings are threefold. First, for cities with higher housing prices, two-stage auctions are adopted more frequently than English auctions. In addition, land parcels in these “hot” cities adopt two-stage auctions more frequently during sensitive political events, suggesting that local officials respond positively to the real estate regulation policy from central government. Second, when city leaders are more incentivized to promote economic performance, they respond less positively to rises in housing prices. Third, such interventionist behavior results in a significantly depressed land price and housing price. Despite its intention of improving public welfare, this interventionism can susceptibly cause problems of misallocation and corruption.
H27|School spending and new construction|School districts that vote in favor of property tax levies may signal that they are education-oriented. Through Tiebout sorting and housing developer activity, new residents might move to such communities. New retail development may occur near these new residents, and office firms that rely on high-skilled residents might be drawn too. Using regression discontinuity we find school districts that renew property tax levies have a higher value of new construction than districts that do not renew these school expenditures. School tax levy renewal is responsible for 14% of new residential construction and 25% of new commercial construction.
H27|Taxing the unobservable: The impact of the shadow economy on inflation and taxation|Because the shadow economy cannot be taxed, it erodes the tax base and reduces tax revenues, forcing governments to resort to other ways to finance their expenditures. Accordingly, a larger shadow economy should give governments an incentive to shift revenue sources from taxes to inflation, in line with the public finance motive of inflation. In this paper, we recall that point in a simple canonical model, then empirically test it in a sample of up to 153 developed and developing countries over the 1999–2007 period. In line with the model’s prediction, we indeed observe a positive relation between inflation and the size of the shadow economy, and a negative relation between the tax burden and the size of the shadow economy. We find that both relations are conditional on central bank independence and on the exchange rate regime, implying that it is the strongest in institutional set-ups that constrain monetary policy the least. Both relations are present in the sub-sample of developed countries as well as the sub-sample of developing countries. Both relations survive several robustness checks, using various sets of control variables including the stock of debt, controlling for endogeneity, using alternative estimates of the shadow economy, and estimating the two relations as a system of equations.
H27|Non-tax revenue in the European Union: A source of fiscal risk?|Abstract Despite its relevance for fiscal policy, non-tax revenue is only defined by exclusion and it is an area that has been scarcely studied for developed economies. This study is an attempt to provide an analysis of this relevant component of government revenue, using comparable national accounts data. It assesses the size, composition and volatility of non-tax revenue in the European Union, and it explores, by means of panel data analysis, whether macroeconomic and fiscal conditions can explain the observed heterogeneity in non-tax revenue across the Member States. We also find that the relative variability of non-tax revenue is around three times higher than that of tax revenue, being a significant source of fiscal risk that is often overlooked.
H27|LoVe hurts: Verdsetting av Lofoten/Vesterålen/Senja|Med stort økonomisk verdipotensial og regionale ringverknadar i form av næringsutvikling og sysselsetting kan dei delte meiningane rundt olje og gassverksemd i Lofoten, Vesterålen og Senja kanskje fortone seg som gåtefulle. Basert på diskonterte kontantstraumer frå olje og gassressursane i området konkluderer denne analysen med at opning for olje og gassverksemd av Lofoten, Vesterålen og Senja er potensielt viktig for olje og gassnæringa, medan implikasjonane for statsfinansar og kapasitet til offentleg tenesteyting er mindre. Analysen indikerer at vern av området kan innrømmast til ein årleg kostnad på om lag 700 kroner per innbyggar.
H27|Citizens‘ preferences for a tax exemption for caregivers in inheritance taxation – an empirical analysis using German survey data|We analyze survey data on the proposal to introduce a tax exemption for caregiving heirs to the German inheritance tax. Some 80 percent of the participants support this exemption. We explain interpersonal differences in the support for this tax exemption using a wide range of personal characteristics, beliefs and attitudes. We find self-interest to be relevant: Subjects with alive parents are more likely to support the tax exemption. The same holds for subjects who have personal experience in long- term care provision. While women are at the heart of intergenerational exchange relations, their support for the tax exemption is not found to be higher than for men. Subjects are more likely to support the tax exemption if they adhere to the social norm of indirect reciprocity or overestimate the tax burden of the German inheritance tax.
H27|What are the Financial Implications of Public Quality Disclosure? Evidence from New York City’s Restaurant Food Safety Grading Policy|Grading schemes are an increasingly common method of quality disclosure for public services. Restaurant grading makes information about food safety practices more readily available and may reduce the prevalence of foodborne illnesses. However, it may also have meaningful financial repercussions. Using fine-grained administrative data that tracks food safety compliance and sales activity for the universe of graded restaurants in New York City and its bordering counties, we assess the aggregate financial effects from restaurant grading. Results indicate that the grading policy, after an initial period of adjustment, improves restaurants’ food safety compliance and reduces fines. While the average effect on revenues for graded restaurants across the municipality is null, the graded restaurants located geographically closer to an ungraded regime experience slower growth in revenues. There is also evidence of revenue convergence across graded and ungraded restaurants in the long-term.
H27|The effects of the tax mix on inequality and growth|Can reforms that shift the balance among different taxes in the revenue mix lastingly influence the overall prosperity of an economy and the distribution of income across households? The present study takes this question to the data, using the experience of 34 OECD countries over 1980-2014 to assess the effects of changes in the tax structure on the long-term level of average output per capita and the distribution of disposable income across households. Changing the revenue mix while keeping government size constant typically lift long-term output per capita when they involve cuts in the labour tax wedge below or above average incomes, cuts in corporate income taxes or increases in property taxes. The relative-income effects of revenue-neutral reductions in labour tax wedges are broadly in line with intuition: the relative position of those benefitting from them typically improves. In absolute terms, however, nearly all the income distribution benefits from revenue-neutral reductions in labour tax wedges, be they focused on below or average income earners.
H27|On the effects of repeated tax amnesties|We examine empirically the effect of tax amnesties on long term tax collection when such amnesties are used by a government as a regular source of revenue. We use data from the Tucuman province (Argentina) to test the main hypothesis of the model, namely, that amnesties lower the government’s revenue, as they reduce the penalties and make evasion more profitable. We find, however, that amnesties do not affect the long-term revenue. The other main result is in line with the theoretical predictions: the increase in short-run revenue is temporary and only accelerates the collection of the taxes but does not increase the amount collected. Thus, we conclude that amnesties were used only to obtain a short-run surge in revenue and to avoid more fundamental tax reforms.
H27|The reform of the tax system in Swaziland|This paper documents the tax reforms implemented in Swaziland since the 1990s and how they have contributed to revenue collection. Reforms have had a major impact on collection of indirect taxes (especially VAT) but no clear impact on receipts of direct taxes and trade taxes. Despite efforts to broaden the tax base, tax collection is still heavily concentrated on very few sources, with SACU receipts alone accounting for more than one-half of total revenue. Growth in revenue collections from direct taxes on income and profits, and indirect taxes on goods and services remain substantially too low to compensate for the loss in import tariff revenues.
H27|Analyzing of Oil Revenues Shocks Asymmetric Effects on Misery index in Iran Using Vector Error Correction Model|Since the major part of oil revenues are control by government and it forms government’s expenditures; therefore, recognition of oil revenues growth shocks and their impacts intensity on macroeconomic variables such as inflation and unemployment is very important for economic policymakers. This study examines the asymmetric effects of oil revenues shocks on misery index in Iran’s economy by using vector error correction method. For this purpose, we use annual macroeconomic data during 1971-2014 periods. The result shows that both positive and negative shocks have a significant and negative effect on misery index and also long-term trend in oil revenues have a positive and significant relationship with misery index. On the other hand, population growth rate, government expenditure and trade openness index as well as influencing variables on misery index in the model were brought that have a positive and significant relationship with misery index. Also according to the Wald test results, the hypothesis of symmetric effects of positive and negative shocks of oil revenues is rejected.
H27|Analysis of tax harmonisation in the SADC|This paper analyses tax harmonisation in the SADC region. Results of first attempt to devise a tax policy harmonisation measure (TPHM) by the use of a cross-sectional and panel data are reported. New methodology of computing optimum tax rates (OTRs) are introduced and a robustness test (via a sensitivity analysis) on the impact of taxation (based on new tax dataset from the TPHM and OTRs computation) on FDI inflows to the SADC is conducted.The research shows a need for the SADC countries to develop policies aimed at collectively expanding their corporate tax base in order to accommodate the relatively low optimum CIT rates. It is also shown that the adoption of an optimum VAT rate by all SADC member countries will reduce the usage of different politically motivated VAT rates by individual member states as instruments to gain voters' confidence. The research shows that, some further policy considerations towards enhanced harmonisation and tax revenue could include developing a benchmarking process with other regional economic groupings such as the EU and the EAC.
H27|The effect of tax harmonisation in the Southern African Development Community on Foreign Direct Investment|This paper investigates the effect of tax harmonisation on foreign direct investment (FDI) in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region. Findings of a first attempt to investigate the linkage between taxation (tax rates and policy) and FDI (in all 15 countries), using an eclectic panel data modeling approach from 1990-2010 are presented. A new value added tax (VAT) harmonisation variable is introduced (in addition to a corporate income tax (CIT) harmonisation variable) via a tax policy harmonisation measure (TPHM) in the panel empirical investigation, complemented by a sensitivity analysis (using the extreme-bound analysis (EBA) technique) on the impact of taxation on FDI inflows to the SADC. The investigation shows that when errors in the regressors (for instance contemporaneous correlation, heteroskedasticity, cross-sectional dependence, endogeneity) are controlled for, tax harmonisation (amongst other contributing factors) does indeed have a significant causal relationship with FDI in the SADC. The study generally provides empirical evidence to support the argument for effectively using taxation towards higher FDI inflows in the region. Policy considerations towards improved tax harmonisation emanating from the paper include the need for individual SADC governments to promote national tax policies aimed at supporting regional tax harmonisation objectives, through strengthening existing tax agreements and treaties. This is necessary to reduce disparity in tax rates (including the definition of tax bases), improve existing level of tax co-movement, mitigate tax leakages and promote FDI inflows.
H27|Study on Council Directive 2011/64/EU on the structure and rates of excise duty applied to manufactured tobacco|The purpose of this Study is to contribute to the Impact Assessment of a possible revision of Council Directive 2011/64/EU on the structure and rates of excise duty applied to manufactured tobacco. The Study includes a baseline assessment of a series of issues emerged from the previous evaluation of the Directive and analyses how these problems may evolve if no EU action is taken. Secondly, the Study formulates a set of possible policy options to address these problems, assesses their likely impacts (market functioning and development, regulatory costs, tax revenues, tobacco control policies, illicit trade etc.), and compares the outcome with the baseline situation.
H27|Option to include e-cigarettes within the scope of excisable goods for the Impact Assessment on a possible revision of Directive 2011/64/EU|The market of electronic cigarettes and corresponding e-liquids experienced in recent years enormous growth. Some EU Member States reacted on this development and introduced excise duties on e-liquids. The partial introduction of excise duties in the common market and the lack of harmonisation of their magnitude might cause distortions of the market.

H27|Non-Tariff Barriers, Enforcement, and Revenues: The Use of Anti-Dumping as a Revenue Generating Trade Policy|In contrast to developed countries, developing nations are especially reliant on trade taxes, particularly tariffs, as a source of government revenue. As such, tariff liberalization provides them with an incentive to switch towards other revenue generating trade barriers such as anti-dumping duties. The effectiveness of this is potentially limited due to the greater enforcement challenges with the exporter specific anti-dumping relative to broad-based tariffs. We examine this by estimating the impact of anti-dumping measures for 82 importing countries from 2008-2014. We find that anti-dumping's trade effects are larger for countries with greater policy enforcement, especially in low income countries. Although the results are somewhat sensitive to the measure of enforcement, our overall findings indicate that for countries with weak enforcement, tariff liberalization combined with a shift towards non-tariff barriers like anti-dumping is likely to lower government revenues and hamper their ability to provide the infrastructure and education needed for development.
H27|When and why hyperinflating monetary authorities abandon a currency|Hyperinflating monetary authorities occasionally abandon the currency with delay to extract remaining seignorage. Modeling the monetary authority as an exhaustible resource extracting monopolist shows the delay increases with higher remaining seignorage or real interest rates or lower seignorage maximizing rates.
H27|A microsimulation of property tax policy in China|China is exploring possible property tax reform to stabilize the booming housing market as well as providing sustainable revenue for the local government. In this paper we develop a theoretical model of property tax reform to decompose potential impacts of property tax reform in China. Then we used the China Family Panel Survey (CFPS) data to conduct a microsimulation model to examine potential impacts and incidences of alternative property tax designs in China. Our analyses suggest that a uniform property tax policy would bring substantially heterogeneous impacts across different income groups as well as different regions, mainly due to the differences in income distribution, housing prices and the degree of the Housing Demolition program. In terms of property tax incidence, our simulation suggests that utilizing tax revenue on the poor's public housing subsidy may mitigate the regressivity; in some case may even increase the overall social welfare. Finally, we use the cross-sectional information in the Chinese Family Panel Survey (CFPS) data to simulate for optimal tax scenarios for each region. Our microsimulation results provide some initial quantitative analysis in the literature and may shed some light on understanding the impacts of future property tax reform in China.
H27|Traffic accidents and the London congestion charge|In a rare effort to internalize congestion costs, London recently instituted charges for traveling by car to the central city during peak hours. Although the theoretical influence on the number and severity of traffic accidents is ambiguous, we show that the policy generated a substantial reduction in both the number of accidents and in the accident rate. At the same time, the spatial, temporal and vehicle specific nature of the charge may cause unintended substitutions as traffic and accidents shift to other proximate areas, times and to uncharged vehicles. We demonstrate that, to the contrary, the congestion charge reduced accidents and the accident rate in adjacent areas, times and for uncharged vehicles. These results are consistent with the government's objective to use the congestion charge to more broadly promote public transport and change driving habits.
H27|Higher taxes, more evasion? Evidence from border differentials in TV license fees|This paper studies the evasion of TV license fees in Austria. We exploit border differentials to identify the effect of fees on evasion. Comparing municipalities at the low- and high-fee side of state borders reveals that higher fees trigger significantly more evasion. Our preferred estimator indicates that a one percent increase in fees raises the evasion rate by 0.3 percentage points. The positive effect of fees on evasion is confirmed in different parametric and non-parametric approaches and survives several robustness checks.
H27|The paradox of land reform, inequality and local development in Colombia|Over two centuries, Colombia transferred vast quantities of land, equivalent to the entire UK landmass, mainly to landless and poor peasants. And yet Colombia retains one of the highest concentrations of land ownership in the world. Why? We show that the effects of land reform on inequality and economic and human development were heterogeneous. On average, rural properties grew larger, land inequality and dispersion fell, and development increased across Colombia’s 1100+ municipalities between 1961-2010. But pre-existing inequality counteracts these effects, resulting in smaller rural properties, greater dispersion, and lower levels of development. How? Land reform increased public investment in agriculture, raising consumption of public and private goods. But land concentration again counters these effects. Elites seem to have distorted local decision-making to benefit themselves. We conclude that land reform’s second-order effects, on the distribution of local power, are more important than its first-order effects on the distribution of land.
H27|Avoiding Taxes by Transfers Within the Family|We document an episode with considerable tax avoidance that occurred in Italy after 2008 when the Italian government reformed the property taxation by abolishing taxation on principal residences and increasing taxation on secondary properties. In presence of a very low inter vivos gift tax, Italian families found it beneficial to redistribute properties among their members. Difference-in-difference estimates indicate that property tax reform increased the probability that high-wealth donors made an inter vivos property gift by 3 percentage points and the size transferred by 4 square meters relative to less wealthy donors. Our estimates allow us to compute (back of the envelope) the amount of tax avoidance due to inter vivos transfer. The amount is around 78 million euros, or 4 percent of the annual tax revenue from principal residences.
H27|Terrorism and philanthropy: the effect of terror attacks on the scope of giving by individuals and households|Abstract Behavioral reactions to terrorism may be displayed in different ways. While some individuals react by holding back on their financial and charitable activities following stressful events, others may express more generosity by increasing their giving due to solidarity and empathy with the victims, or out of heightened nationalism and patriotism. Using a longitudinal analysis of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict as a case study to uncover the relations between terrorism and philanthropic behavior, we find that terror attacks increase considerably the scope of giving by individuals and households. Our empirical approach relies on a unique panel dataset of 152,731 tax itemizer philanthropists and terrorism data from 1999 to 2011. The results are statistically significant and robust across a multitude of model specifications. Furthermore, we use an instrumental variable approach to identify a causal link and address potential endogeneity concerns. This study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first attempt to empirically identify and quantify the effect of sequential terror attacks on philanthropy over a relatively long period using detailed micro-level information.
H27|Zakah Management for Poverty Alleviation in Indonesia and Brunei Darussalam|Concern for poverty is not new and has been the focus for centuries by historians, sociologists and economists. The cause has been identified, ranging from shortcomings in the administration of income support, until the injustice of the social and economic system. Various attempts have been proposed, from the reform of social security system for changes in the form of the socio-economic system. Because poverty is a multidimensional problem, solutions to poverty require a set of coordinated action, particularly through charity. Indonesia, which has a population with a large population, of course, the problem of poverty continues to be a problem in economic development. Nevertheless, the potential zakat Indonesia larger community and cooperation among stakeholders and government regulation is a solution to reduce the level of poverty in Indonesia. It is certainly different from the Brunei Darussalam to the level of a small population and large government revenues, management of zakat by MUIB in the form of cash grants, the capital of commerce, and others are implementable can solve the problem of poverty in this country.
H27|Citizens‘ preferences for a tax exemption for caregiving heirs – an empirical analysis|We analyze survey data on the proposal to introduce a tax exemption for caregiving heirs to the German inheritance tax. Some 80 percent of the participants support this exemption, about half of those supporting the tax exemption want to see it restricted to relatives. We explain interpersonal differences in policy preferences using a wide range of personal characteristics, beliefs and attitudes. Neither subjects’ sex, nor their valuation of the family is found to have an effect while personal experience in long- term care provision and having alive parents strongly shape policy preferences. Subjects with alive parents and/or personal experience in long-term care provision are more likely to support the tax exemption but less likely to support the restriction to relatives. This result supports the bottom line of the recent social science literature on home care provision and intergenerational relations within the family: Many citizens in Germany feel overburdened with caregiving.
H27|Should wealth transfers be taxed? Citizens’ view on a fundamental question|In a recent representative survey, German citizens are asked whether or not inherited wealth beyond a certain amount should be taxed. Almost 60 percent stated that it should not be taxed. We use this survey to identify the factors that drive this fundamental opposition against the taxation of inherited wealth. We find monetary self-interest and redistributive preferences to drive citizens’ attitude in this matter. We account for other intra-familial transfers, in partic-ular long-term care. Being at the heart of intra-familial exchange relations, women are more likely to oppose wealth transfer taxation than men are. Citizens’ attitude towards inheritance taxation does not depend on their personal experience in giving long-term care. Expecting the typical German family to reward intra-familial caregiving through a higher inheritance reduces the opposition against the taxation of inherited wealth.
H27|Should there be a more active role of family care assistants in long-term care provision? – survey evidence on the view of German citizens|This paper deals with the public acceptance of policies that pave the way for a more active role of family care assistants in long-term care provision. Family care assistants, i.e. non-relatives providing homecare services in the own private home of the care recipient, provide valuable help for adult children organizing long-term care for their parents. However, their support comes at the price of transferring more family-owned wealth to non-relatives. Based on a survey among German citizens, we provide empirical evidence on the factors that drive the support for a more active role of family care assistants. We find support to be higher among subjects who gave long-term care personally. Monetary self-interest is found to matter. In addition, we find evidence of a clear line of conflict: Citizens with alive parents are more likely to support a more active role of family care assistants than citizens whose parents are dead.
H27|Can Tax Increment Financing Support Transportation Infrastructure Investment?|This report reviews alternative sources of revenue to support new infrastructure and other development projects for which municipal funds are not readily available. We review two such instruments: Tax Increment Financing (TIF) and Land Value Capture (LVC). We found more frequent use of TIF than LVC. TIF has largely been used to fund small-scale projects, often not exceeding one or two hundred million dollars in capital costs. We could find only two TIF implementations that aimed to generate over a billion dollars in TIF revenue, and those projects fell short of meeting the revenue targets. The evidence for TIF efficacy is mixed and depends, to some extent, on the type of methods used in the analysis. Some studies found the TIF districts reported higher rates of development and greater real estate price appreciation than comparable non-TIF districts. Other studies reached different conclusions. Three key elements were repeatedly found to contribute to TIF success. (1) Mixed land use developments often met their intended TIF objectives. (2) The timing of TIF implementation mattered; TIFs initiated during recessions met with limited success. (3) Smaller TIFs were more successful in meeting revenue targets than larger ones. We simulate a 30-year TIF implementation along the Sheppard East corridor in Toronto, the route for the Sheppard subway line that started operations in 2002, and offer insights for local and higher tiers of government interested in implementing TIF. Our analysis of the Sheppard East corridor found that the net present value of the simulated TIF revenue covered only a small portion of the capital costs of extending the subway line.
H27|Tax Policy of Russia under the Crisis Conditions|The use of fiscal instruments in the process of anti-crisis regulation means a choice between increasing the level of taxation to ensure budget revenues and its decrease to support the economic activity of businesses. Using the implicit tax rates (ITR) it is shown that since 2009 the levels of taxation of income from capital and consumption were steadily declined as a result of tax measures. The level of small business taxation shrank only because of the inflationary decrease the value of the tax payments. The tax maneuver measures under the falling oil prices led to some growth of the profit tax receipts that does not compensate the total losses of the budget system.
H27|Demonetisation: Impact on the Economy|The argument posited in favour of demonetisation is that the cash that would be extinguished would be black money and hence, should be rightfully extinguished to set right the perverse incentive structure in the economy. While the facts are not available to anybody, it would be foolhardy to argue that this is the only possibility. Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate the short run and medium-term impacts that such a shock is expected to have on the economy. Further, the impact of such a move would vary depending on the extent to which the government decides to remonetise. This paper elucidates the impact of such a move on the availability of credit, spending, level of activity and government finances.
H27|When will privatization maximize the government's net revenues?|Governments often sell assets for revenues or economic efficiency. When the capital is durable, potential buyers may wait for the government to cut its price, since they know that as a monopoly it will initially price above marginal cost. Rather than sell, the government could continue to lease the capital to the public – that is, to sell the services that the capital generates, in exchange for a tax payment. Comparative statics indicate that a government maximizing its net revenues may prefer leasing to selling for a large inventory of capital-intensive products that buyers view as vital. For example, a socialist government contemplating a transition to markets must consider the impact on its own revenues. If its major assets are capital-intensive, the impact may be negative.
H27|Zakat Accounting: Metaphor and accounting treatment for business organization|The various sources of zakat accounting are actually going to provide an answer to the question of whether the accounting capable of acting stints zakat management. Zakat accounting will provide information or data of a general nature modified technically-practical reorganized to be able to calculate the zakat that in fact contain a special purpose, such as the purification of wealth. The business organization is generally oriented to profit by using the entity (entity theory), which means that the company is a separate entity from its owners. While zakah accounting as a part of shari'a accounting affirms that a company or business organization is united with its owner, so that he has an obligation to pay zakat. Consequently, the business organization to change the orientation, from profit and stockholder-oriented to zakah-oriented, conservation of nature-oriented, and stakeholders-oriented.
H27|Avoiding Taxes By Transfers Within The Family|We document an episode with considerable tax avoidance that occurred in Italy after 2008 when the Italian government reformed the property taxation by abolishing taxation on principal residences and increasing taxation on secondary properties. In presence of a very low inter vivos gift tax, Italian families found it bene cial to redistribute proper- ties among their members. Di erence-in-di erence estimates indicate that property tax reform increased the probability that high-wealth donors made an inter vivos property gift by 3 percentage points and the size transferred by 4 square meters relative to less wealthy donors. Our estimates allow us to compute (back of the envelope) the amount of tax avoidance due to inter vivos transfer. The amount is around 78 million euros, or 4 percent of the annual tax revenue from principal residences.
H27|The effects of replacing income tax with consumption tax on the state and the individual: a Canadian example|Consumption tax has been lauded as an alternative to income tax, in that it promotes savings and investment, and enables increased consumption over time. Despite these claims, no state has opted to replace income tax with consumption tax as the prime source of revenue. It is proposed that when consumption tax replaces income tax as the means of financing the state, investment increases, individuals are able to consume more over a lifetime, and levels of government revenue can be maintained. This study compares an average Canadian taxpayer in Canada?s current hybrid tax regime with a taxpayer in a hypothetical consumption tax regime. The rate of consumption tax is calculated to provide the equivalent amount of revenue the Canadian government currently receives. Comparisons are made between the two regimes in three scenarios to reflect different taxpayer behavior: holding investment steady, holding consumption steady, and maximizing the use of current tax shelters. The study concludes that in any scenario, individuals are able to enjoy more total consumption and purchasing power over time, adjusted for inflation, when a consumption tax substitutes for income tax. On the other hand, government revenue received from the average taxpayer in some scenarios is less when consumption tax replaces income tax, and is more in others. Government revenue was more when comparisons were made between taxpayers in the income tax regime who made use of current tax shelters, and those in the consumption tax regime who maximized their investment. This is the ideal behavior one would expect of taxpayers who are left with more disposable income. Opportunities for further study are suggested.
H27|Bütçe Kanununa Ekli Vergi Harcamaları Listesinin Mevzuatla Ücret Gelirlerine İlişkin Getirilen Muafiyet, İstisna ve İndirimler Bağlamında Analizi|Tax is the most important resource used in order to finance public expenditures. From time to time, states abondon public financing preference and interviene in the economical and social life through tax. This interference happens through the tax expenditures consisting of tax exceptions, exemptions and discounts which result in loss of revenue for the state and which have, in reality, a similar impact on the public expenditures but these tax expenditures are different in their manner of execution. This study examines, in a comparative manner, the exceptions, exemptions and discounts applicable to wages under the relevant legislation and the list of tax expenditures annexed to the budget act and analyses whether the exceptions and privilages applicable to wages and which are not mentionned in the tax expenditures list represent a standard tax practice.

H27|Land Reform, Latifundia and Social Development at Local Level in Colombia, 1961-2010|Abstract The paper analyzes the effects of land reform on social development –poverty and land distribution- at the local level. Land reform in Colombia, understood as the allocation of public land to peasant, has granted 23 million hectares which comprises around 20% of Colombian territory and about 50% of usable productive land. Theoretically, the net impact of land reform on development is the combination of a poverty effect and a land distribution effect. Our findings suggest that land reform from 1961 onwards has slightly reduced poverty and mildly improved land distribution. Nonetheless, municipalities with strong presence of latifundia prior to 1961 have experienced both a slower drop in poverty and a weaker improvement of land distribution. This paper finds that prevalence of latifundia partially offset the positive effect of land reform in promoting social development.
H27|Tax Policy Changes after the Crisis. The Rise of Bank Taxes|Seldom does public attention follow taxation as it does now. As a result of the global economic crisis, due to the fiscal consolidations, taxation plays an increasingly important role within financial policy. The emergence and the extensive spread of taxes on the financial sector is one of the consequences of the global economic crisis. This paper deals with some theoretical connections of this change in taxation.
H27|Dynamic elasticities of tax revenue: evidence from the Czech Republic| Tax revenue elasticities with respect to tax bases are key parameters for the modeling of public finances. Yet the existing studies estimating these elasticities for emerging countries disregard the effects of tax reforms on tax revenue, which renders their estimates inconsistent. We introduce a framework for estimating both short- and long-run tax revenue elasticities using quarterly data adjusted for the effects of reforms. Our results suggest that the long-run elasticities in the Czech Republic are 1.4 for wage tax, 0.9 for value added tax, 1.7 for profit tax and 1 for social security contributions. The adjustment process for value added tax and social security contributions is fast, but for the remaining two categories, it is important to distinguish between the short- and long-run elasticities: the initial response of revenue to changes in the bases is weak. In the case of wage tax it takes half a year for the elasticity to surpass unity.

H27|Does local governments’ budget deficit push up housing prices in China?|Budget deficit has been a common fiscal pressure facing Chinese cities since the 1994 fiscal reform. Meanwhile, land lease sales have become a significant off-budgetary revenue to local governments since 2003. This paper investigates whether financing budget deficit is an important driving force of the recent soaring housing prices when local governments function as the monopoly supplier of urban land. A conceptual framework is developed to illustrate a transmission mechanism from budget deficit to housing prices. This leads to an empirical model consisting of two simultaneous structural equations for housing prices and land prices. Using data for the 35 major Chinese cities from 2003 to 2011, an empirical exercise shows that although budget deficit has a positive effect on land prices, it is the factors from demand side, such as amenities, income and the user cost of housing capital, that have been pulling up the housing prices.
H27|Modeling the money launderer: Microtheoretical arguments on anti-money laundering policy|The existing literature treats the criminal – who generates criminal proceeds – and the launderer – who converts the ‘dirty’ dollars into ‘clean’ ones – as one and the same. And with good reason: it is clear from the evidence that such ‘standard’ vertically integrated launderers exists. Because professionals and institutions are also routinely prosecuted for money laundering transgressions, however, it appears that the market for money laundering is also supplied by third party, ‘professional’ launderers, whose core business lies outside the criminal sector, but who chooses to spend time supplying the market for money laundering.
H27|Local natural resource curse?|Utilizing an output based efficiency measure we investigate whether higher public revenues harm efficiency in the production of local public goods. Much variation in revenues among Norwegian local governments can be explained by revenues collected from hydropower production. This revenue variation, combined with good data availability, can be used to address a main concern in the resource curse literature; that public sector revenue, and in particular the revenue from natural resources, is endogenous. We obtain an exogenous measure of local revenue by instrumenting the variation in hydropower revenue, and thus total revenue, by topology, average precipitation and meters of river in steep terrain. We find support for what we term the Paradox of Plenty hypothesis—that higher local government revenue reduces the efficiency in production of public goods. We do not find support for what we term the Rentier State hypothesis—that revenue derived from natural resources should harm efficiency more than revenue derived from other sources such as taxation.
H27|Theoretical and Methodological Bases of Formation of the State Budget Resources|Article is devoted to theoretical and methodological approaches to the formation of the budgetary resources of the state in the conditions of transitive economy. It has been established that the resource part of the budget consists of two components: income and financing of the budget. Clarified the theoretical foundations generate revenues as the basis for the formation of the state budget resources. Determine the method of resource mobilization to the budget, in particular: tax (tax revenues), productive state work (business activities, government services), the realization of property and property rights (permanent income from renting of state property and use of the state corporate rights and one-time cash receipts from the sale of state and municipal property), debt (state and local loans, internal and external) and emission (monetary emissions). Concluded the systematization of sources of budgetary resources and their division into internal and external. Determined the economic structure of the financial category of 'budgetary resources of the state' in order to expand the theoretical foundations of the perception of domestic fiscal space.
H27|When it comes to container port efficiency, are all developing regions equal?|In this paper we carry out a container port performance analysis of the developing world between 2000 and 2010, using both parametric and nonparametric approaches. From a unique dataset – our sample covers 70 developing countries, 203 ports, and 1750 data points–, we examine the evolution and drivers of productivity and efficiency changes across developing regions. We show that productivity growth rates between 2000 and 2010 vary significantly and that this heterogeneity is explained by pure efficiency changes rather than scale efficiency of technological changes. Therefore, we carry out a detailed efficiency analysis to determine the drivers of port efficiency. Time series results show an upward trend for port efficiency in developing regions, as it increased from 51 percent in 2000 to 61 percent in 2010. Our analysis indicates that private sector participation, the reduction of corruption in the public sector, improvements in liner connectivity and the existence of multimodal links increase the level of port efficiency in developing regions.
H27|Measuring the negative externalities of a private leisure activity: hooligans and pickpockets around the stadium|Given the recent increase observed in crime related to football matches, we determine the extent to which this private leisure activity is responsible for negative crime externalities. We conduct an Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis and spatial regressions at the census tract level drawing on data for the matches played by Football Club Barcelona and geocoded crime data for the city of Barcelona (Spain); focusing on thefts (mainly pick pocketing) and assaults (interpersonal violence or hooliganism). We find an increase in the number of thefts across the whole city but, especially, in those census tracts within a 700-m radius of the stadium. These results are confirmed by the low number of crimes committed during away matches in the census tracts around the stadium. A similar spatial pattern is found for assaults. Our results provide evidence of a displacement effect of violent supporters (hooligans) towards the stadium on football days.
H27|Effects of R&D Costs on Profit of Producers of Oil Productions in Tehran Stock Exchange|In this paper, we survey effects of firm’ size, firm’ age, capital to endowment, debt to endowment, advertisement cost and R&D cost on profit of producers of oil productions in Tehran stock exchange. We use from data of period 2004-2014 and estimate model with panel method. Results of estimation reveal that capital to endowment, age and R&D cost have positive effect on these firm’s profit and firm’ size, debt to endowment and advertisement cost have negative effect on our firm’s profit.
H27|Policy preferences for inheritance taxation|We provide a comprehensive empirical study on the factors that drive citizens’ policy preferences regarding inheritance taxation. It builds on a representative survey among more than 1.000 German citizens in 2014 and 2015. Support for inheritance taxation is found to be driven by monetary self-interest and redistributive preferences. It is lower among females and among subjects who overestimate the tax burden. We look beyond the narrow scope of inheritances and account for other forms of transfers in the family, in particular the provision of longterm care. More than 75 percent of our respondents consider it fair that family members who provided long-term care receive higher inheritances in exchange. This fairness preference does not drive policy preferences, but acceptance for inheritance taxation is higher among subjects who expect the typical German family to reward intrafamilial care-giving through a higher inheritance.
H27|Improving Taxes and Transfers in Australia|Getting tax and transfer systems to efficiently deliver sufficient revenues to achieve macroeconomic targets, address goals in re-distribution and social welfare, encourage employment, accommodate business-competitiveness concerns and incorporate environmental issues is difficult. In Australia, slowing economic growth in the wake of the mining boom has sharpened the trade-offs and brought into focus the importance of encouraging broad-based advances in employment and productive capacity while also dealing with other long-term challenges, in particular population ageing and greenhouse-gas emission reduction. This review particularly recommends shifting away from income taxation to indirect taxation, for instance by raising more revenue from the Goods and Services Tax. The report also advises caution in some recent welfare-reform proposals, and advocates broad support for business rather than targeted subsidies and other forms of corporate welfare. As regards environmental policies, the report comments on the proposed Emission Reduction Fund for reducing greenhouse gases and supports reform to vehicle-related taxation. This Working Paper relates to the 2014 OECD Economic Survey of Australia (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-australia.htm). Améliorer le système de prélèvements et de prestations en Australie Il n’est pas facile de faire en sorte que le système de prélèvements et de prestations dégage suffisamment de recettes pour atteindre les objectifs de politique macroéconomique, de redistribution et de bien-être social, encourage la création d’emplois, réponde aux préoccupations de compétitivité des entreprises et contribue à relever les défis environnementaux. En Australie, le ralentissement de la croissance économique à la suite du boom minier a accentué les arbitrages et mis en lumière l’importance d’encourager de larges progrès en matière d’emploi et de capacités productives, tout en relevant d’autres défis à long terme, comme le vieillissement démographique et la réduction des émissions de gaz à effet de serre. Cet examen recommande en particulier de se détourner de l’imposition des revenus au profit de la fiscalité indirecte, par exemple en augmentant les recettes provenant de la taxe sur les produits et services. Le rapport met également en garde concernant certaines propositions récentes de réforme du système de protection sociale, et préconise un large soutien aux entreprises plutôt que des subventions ciblées et d’autres formes d’aide sociale aux entreprises. S’agissant des politiques d’environnement, le rapport formule des observations sur le projet de Fonds pour la réduction des émissions de gaz à effet de serre et appuie la réforme de la taxation des véhicules. Ce Document de travail se rapporte à l’Étude économique de l’OCDE de l'Australie, 2014 (www.oecd.org/fr/economie/etude-economique-australie.htm.).
H27|How can South Africa's tax system meet revenue raising challenges?|Reforms over the past two decades have produced a well-balanced, modern tax system. However, considerable revenues will be needed in the years ahead to expand social spending and infrastructure in order to raise growth and well-being. The challenge is to generate these revenues without penalising growth or exacerbating inequality. Income taxes represent around half of total tax revenue but are levied on small tax bases, partly reflecting the distribution of income. A revenue source less detrimental to growth is consumption taxes, which are mostly raised by the relatively broad value-added tax. Nonetheless, there is some scope to raise further revenue, particularly through broadening the base of these taxes further. Revenues from property taxation are currently limited by the inefficient municipal rates system, which does not function well. An important additional source of revenue is environmentally related taxes. In the design of the tax system, consideration should also be given to the appropriate taxation of the natural resources sector, which remains an important issue for a resource-rich country like South Africa. Le système fiscal en Afrique du Sud face à la nécessité de trouver des recettes Les réformes menées au cours des deux dernières décennies ont abouti à un système fiscal équilibré et moderne. Toutefois, des recettes considérables vont s’avérer nécessaires dans les années à venir pour renforcer les dépenses sociales et les infrastructures afin de favoriser la croissance et le bien-être. Toute la difficulté consistera à trouver ces recettes sans peser sur la croissance ni exacerber les inégalités. Les impôts sur le revenu représentent environ la moitié des recettes fiscales totales, mais leur assiette est étroite, ce qui s’explique pour partie par la distribution des revenus. Les impôts sur la consommation constituent une source de recettes moins pénalisante pour la croissance. Le principal impôt sur la consommation est la taxe sur la valeur ajoutée, qui est dotée d’une assiette assez large. Toutefois, il serait possible d’obtenir davantage de recettes, notamment en élargissant l’assiette de ces impôts. Les recettes tirées des impôts fonciers sont limitées, pour l’heure, par le système fiscal en place à l’échelon municipal, qui ne fonctionne pas de façon satisfaisante. Les taxes liées à l’environnement constituent une autre source importante de recettes. Dans le cadre de la conception du système fiscal, il faudrait aussi s’efforcer d’imposer judicieusement le secteur des ressources naturelles ; cette question reste importante pour un pays tel que l’Afrique du Sud, où ces ressources sont considérables.
H27|The Impact of Stagnating Casino Revenues on State and Local Tax Receipts|In the aftermath of the Great Recession of 2007-2009, the popular press has noted a rebound in casino revenues in some states, and some expect casino revenues to grow and increase again along with any economic recovery. However, before the recent recession, there were trends indicating stagnation or a peak of casino revenues in most states, and as the last recession has indicated, casino revenues were not “recession-proof” as most had thought previously. In fact, casino revenues in most states saw big declines. In this paper, we show that the casino revenues have stagnated or declined partially due to a saturation point being reached with regard to casino gaming in many areas of the United States. The growth rate of casino revenues as well as the tax receipts for the state governments from casinos follows an ‘S’ curve which is similar to a product life cycle curve. The introduction of more gambling venues as well as putting in slot machines at race tracks may give a temporary boost to state gambling tax receipts, but longer run trends indicate that the years of casinos showing large gains in revenues may be over unless casino operations continue to re-invent themselves.

H27|How can promoting desirable elderly employment opportunities alleviate the shortfalls of Thailand’s ageing society?|This research article considers a simulated scenario in which there exists policy infrastructure that promotes employment options to support desirable life after retirement with fiscal sustainability. Two proposed “demo” policy tools, among many others, include (1) legislative flexibility in employment and (2) tax incentives for employers. These measures aim at encouraging employment structure with working conditions favorable for elderly workers. The results of the simulation imply that, given suitable working conditions, a minimum of 50% of the potential elderly workforce participating in the market can yield marginal annual income of approximately 44,268 - 165,295 Baht per elderly worker and approximately 4.74 - 9.35% GDP increase from the baseline GDP growth with ageing population structure. Moreover, the estimated possible minimum marginal net tax revenue is approximately 33,279- 65,994 million Baht. This marginal government revenue, if allocated to old-age expenditure, amounts to approximately 4,000 Baht per elderly per year. The proposed scenario with policy infrastructure that encourages elderly labor participation in the economy constitutes a self-funded model with fiscal sustainability and represents a win-win scenario. Nevertheless, the success of implementing such policy tools depends on the understanding, co-operation and synchronization among the Thai public institutions as well as all parts of the society.
H27|Revenue Mobilization Effort of Special Category States: The Case of Assam in North-east India|Liberal resource transfer from the centre to economically backward states in India has ensured overcoming the mismatch between revenue generated and expenditure commitments of the states. From the point of view of long-term fiscal sustainability of states, however, greater effort to generate enough resources as per the potential of individual states is important, which makes the issue of revenue effort significant. Based on secondary data, this article is an attempt to analyze revenue mobilization efforts of the Government of Assam during 1991â€“2010. By examining the issues of arrears of uncollected tax and non-tax revenue, cost of collection of different taxes and duties, and cost recovery of different services, the study confirms low-revenue efforts on the part of the state government. The time series regression analysis between â€˜per-capita own tax revenueâ€™ and â€˜per capita GSDP of the stateâ€™ and â€˜per-capita revenue expenditure of the state in the previous yearâ€™ also confirms low-revenue efforts, necessitating the need of extra tax effort on the part of the state government.

H27|Post-Privatisation Corporate Performance in Poland. Evidence from Companies Privatized in 2008-2011|The 2008-2011 Polish privatization plan assumed that 740 enterprises would be privatized. The outcome of the plan implementation was 582 privatized companies, which is 78.64% of the initial plan. The Polish government assumed privatization’ revenue at the level of 54 billion PLN. Global financial situation and some privatization problems allowed reaching 44.02 billion PLN level, which was 81% of the planned value. The authors drew a broad picture of the privatization process and investigated the performance of 59 privatized companies, eventually focusing on a deeper analysis of three companies., and the United Kingdom, could collect up to 50% more revenue if they applied a unified tax on all consumption.
H27|Expected Incomes as a Factor of Entrepreneurship and a Firm Establishment Risk (Oczekiwane dochody jako determinanta przedsiebiorczosci i ryzyka zalozenia wlasnego podmiotu)|Entrepreneurship takes a central place in the imagination of economists. It is one of the reasons for both growth and development of the economy as well as an individual human being. Determinants and market competences of entrepreneurs indicate the importance of income as a factor supporting the creation of enterprises or deciding on their market survival. Based on this background, the concept of the study was created: do people who want to earn more in the labor market declare entrepreneurship as a method of achieving this aim and do they declare and take the higher risk associated with it. This study was undertaken based on an analysis of survey results and a conducted economic experiment. The results partly answered these research questions.
H27|Verkehrswegegebühren und Ausländerdiskriminierung|The German government’s recent plans to introduce road tolls (so-called infrastructure levies) have given rise to an intense debate over its distributional effects. Since the measure combines charges for all car drivers within the German road network with reductions in the tariff of the motor vehicle tax, which benefits German car owners only, strong objections continue to circulate. The article addresses the question whether such a package of infrastructure and tax policy measures can justifiably be blamed for causing discriminatory effects on foreigners. It is argued that while the burden of the measure is effectively imposed on non-German users of German roads, the combination of tax increases with tax cuts by a national government should — for the sake of a beneficial federal system — not be ruled out in response to unsubstantiated claims of discrimination.

H27|The Role Of Entrepreneurship In Economic Growth. Comparative Aspects Romania Versus European Union|There is a general appreciation regarding the major role that entrepreneurship along with innovation plays in economic competitiveness and job creation on a global scale. Stimulation of the SME sector should be made, in our opinion, by providing a competitive, stable and predictable business environment. In this context, public policies aimed at developing entrepreneurship in Romania, should have in the foreground entrepreneurship education at all levels, simplified and predictable regulatory framework and a competitiveness-oriented access to finance. In this paper we develop a comparative analysis of entrepreneurship in Romania and the EU, we highlight the main difficulties encountered by entrepreneurs and will propose solutions for its development into a friendly economic environment.
H27|The Effect of the UK Stamp Duty Land Tax on Household Mobility|We estimate the effect of the UK Stamp Duty Land Tax on household mobility using micro data. Exploiting a discontinuity in the tax schedule as a quasi-experimental setting, we isolate the impact of the stamp duty from other determinants of mobility. Our empirical strategy essentially compares similar households with self-assessed house values on either sides of a cut-off value where the tax rate increases from 1 to 3 percent. We find that a higher stamp duty strongly negatively affects a household's propensity to move: the 2 percentage-point increase in the stamp duty may reduce mobility of homeowners by around 40 percent. This adverse effect is mainly confined to short-distance and non-job related moves.

H27|Rig services and taxation|A long period of rig scarcity and high rates has led to innovation in the procurement of rig services and in relationships between oil companies and rig contractors. Discussions have been conducted on joint ventures between companies and contractors, for instance. This paper describes and analyses such a solution from a taxation perspective. Could a joint venture pose problems for revenue capture from the petroleum sector? Challenges in taxing drilling services - including recently adopted British restrictions on determining internal charter rates for drilling units - are also analysed. In addition to analysing topical issues related to taxation and rigs, the paper makes a general contribution by highlighting the connection between taxing rig services at oil-company and rig-contractor levels, and by placing rig taxation in a broader resource management perspective.
H27|Evaluación institucional y de procesos con énfasis en el ciclo de proyectos del Sistema General de Regalías|En 2011 a través de la creación del Sistema General de Regalías –SGR- se modificó la manera como se distribuyen los recursos de regalías en Colombia, permitiendo que participaran de manera equitativa todas las entidades territoriales del país. Después de varios años de entrada en vigencia de este nuevo sistema es necesario evaluar su diseño, gestión e implementación y su capacidad para el cumplimiento de los objetivos propuestos. Este documento evalúa la institucionalidad y los procesos del nuevo sistema, con un particular énfasis sobre el ciclo de proyectos. La evaluación se desarrolló a través de la recolección y análisis de información primaria y secundaria, de carácter cualitativo y cuantitativo, incluyendo un extenso trabajo de campo en ocho departamentos del país. La evaluación concluye que el esquema general planteado sigue un modelo institucional que supera el funcionamiento del sistema anterior, sin embargo advierte que el modelo es vulnerable al mal funcionamiento de sus eslabones los cuales en muchas ocasiones trascienden al SGR.
H27|Workplace Parking Levies: The answer to funding large scale local transport improvements in the UK?|Despite positive experiences in Australia of utilising area wide workplace parking place charges to pay for public transport improvement, only one UK local authority, to date, Nottingham City Council has chosen to implement a Work Place Parking Levy scheme (WPL). This scheme intends to allocate the revenue raised to fund (amongst other things) two new tram lines.
H27|Can Information Reduce Nonpayment for Public Utilities? Experimental Evidence from South Africa|"Nonpayment for public utilities is an important constraint to expanding service access in developing countries. As a potential policy response, this study implements and evaluates a randomized water education campaign in a low income peri-urban area in South Africa. We estimate substantial treatment effects: on the order of a 30% increase in payments over a three-month period. Surprisingly, these effects are not driven by an increase in householdsâ€™ knowledge. We consider various possible explanations, and argue that the intervention likely had ""nudging"" effects on households. Our findings have important implications for understanding energy conservation and other public information campaigns."
H27|The Conceptual Model of the Credit Information Exchange System in Global Terms|In current conditions, there are few rare initiatives regarding credit information exchange outside national borders. All of them have significant disadvantages and can only be applied on a limited number of countries. This paper proposes conceptual model of a credit bureau in global terms which succesfully solves the aforementioned problems and enables efficient credit information exchange in global terms. Our results point to the fact that efficient credit information exchange in global terms is preconditioned by an adequate model of national credit bureau, international standards of credit reporting and unique identification of natural persons and legal entities. The basis of the conceptual model of a system for credit information exchange in global terms is a national credit bureau model which is organized in a manner which enables simple information exchange and distribution of accurate and reliable data to its users. A variation of such model is commercially used by the banking sector in Serbia.
H27|Bitcoin - Between Legal And Informal|"The proliferation of technology emphasized new forms of payment. During the last years, current literature highlighted the role of virtual currency, the channels of payment through digital coins and the importance of assimilation of such platforms. Bitcoin or BTC is known as a digital coin, issued for the first time in 2009 and based on a peer to peer system. The difference from other forms of payment is that BTC is not controlled by any institution or central authority. BTC transactions have grown rapidly, ”asking"" for regulation measures or legal approval of governments. Although BTC has become very popular, the market is poor and unfortunately of no confidence. There is a lack of regulation which can determine a number of risks associated with criminal financing activities. However, the legal status of Bitcoin is present in many European countries like Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Slovenia, Switzerland or Turkey. Also, this type of currency has experienced a rapid evolution among coffee shops and restaurants."
H27|Reporting import tariffs (and other taxes)|This paper derives the implications for compliance and fiscal revenues of a tax base that is the product of several factors. For instance, in the case of import tariffs, the tax base is the product of quantity and unit value, both reported to, and during an audit assessed by, the custom authority. Import tariffs are particularly interesting as custom receipts represent an important share of government revenues in many developing countries and there has recently been a surge in empirical studies showing how evasion in this field is a pervasive phenomenon. I show that, with a multiplicative tax base, when the fiscal authority has an imperfect detection technology a greater declaration in one dimension actually increases the fine when evasion in the other dimension is detected. Therefore, there is an additional incentive for the taxpayer to underdeclare and a multiplicative tax base is subject to more evasion, compared to a tax base that can be assessed directly. As a result, fiscal revenues decrease with the dimensionality of the tax base. Also, voluntary compliance and fiscal revenues may be higher when the importer is required to declare only the total value of imports instead of quantity and unit value separately. This paper provides an argument in favour of uniform or specific tariffs and a reason for why a flat tax may improve compliance. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014
H27|Avoiding tax in South Africaâ€™s retail industry via customer loyalty programs|The Medium Term Budget Policy Statement presented by the South African Minister of Finance in late 2013, highlighted that government expenditure substantially exceeded revenues collected. In investigating the possible broadening of the South African tax base as well as improving revenue administration, there is evidence of a gap in the taxation of customer loyalty programmes within many industries. The problem is that customer loyalty award credits are currently not being taxed by the revenue authority in South Africa. This study uses a multiple instrumental case study design to identify the tax leakages resulting from inadequate revenue administration within the South African retail industryâ€™s use of customer loyalty programmes. The study has found that the loss to the fiscus in the non-taxing of customer loyalty award credits is substantial.
H27|Hydropower Policy and Energy Saving Incentives|Many Norwegian local governments are affected by hydropower production. A law passed in 1917 mandates that hydropower plants sell up to 10 percent of their power basis to local governments affected by the production. Historically, this concession power was meant to ensure the small rural local governments supply of electricity, in competition of the larger cities. Today, many local governments resell their concession power when prices are high and generate large revenues. However, the actual transferred concession power is restricted to general electricity consumption in the community. As a result, local governments with a positive gap between potential concession power and general electricity consumption have reduced incentives to save electricity. In other words, the concession power system has adverse effects on incentives for energy eciency. In this study, a simple two-period model to study energy efficiency is developed, and the model's predictions are supported by empirical findings. The results underline how misspecifed and outdated laws can reduce incentives for energy economizing projects.
H27|Natural Rerources and public Sector Wages|This paper studies the effects of natural resource abundance on wages for local public sector leaders in Norway. Local governments with high public revenues from the hydropower sector have fewer economic constraints compared with other local governments. High revenues might make it easier for public sector leaders to use their political power to increase leader wages relative to the wages received by other working groups. Novel data on local public sector wages, in combination with an exogenous instrument for hydropower revenues, lead to a unique empirical framework for this analysis. The instrumental variable estimates exploit the variation in geographical and topological characteristics, such as the length of rivers, river slope, water ow volume, and precipitation. Although the results indicate that public sector wages are positively a ected by local government revenues, there is no evidence that the revenue effect is stronger for leader wages than for the wages of other working groups.
H27|Motivations for gambling and the choice between skill and luck gambling products: an exploratory study|We analyze differences in gambling motivations for skill and luck gamblers on the basis of a questionnaire distributed to a sample of university students. We find that the probability of playing skill rather than luck games is positively correlated to being a male, to the socialization motive and to having a planning attitude, that we use to define the kind of amusement experienced in gambling, while it is negatively correlated to the money motive, the perceived risk of losing social esteem, and age. Results are then applied to marketing strategies and public policies, with particular attention to the online environment.
H27|An Alternative Solution (Other Than Taxation), To The Resolution Of Poverty And Unemployment In The Free Market World|This paper describes an alternative way (other than taxation) to eliminate poverty and unemployment from the world. This is done by creating a single money worldwide, and letting each government subsidize the economy of each country, through acting as a non-profit venture capital subsidizer, by forward borrowing on the economic growth that such a subsidization will produce through the increase in jobs and consumers created. This creation of wealth by government will be a process similar to the market's process of creating wealth through price fixing.
H27|Taxes and Economic Growth in Developing Countries : A Dynamic Panel Approach|This paper looks at the effects of taxes increase on economic growth of 47 developing countries. In developing countries, there is no magic tax strategy to encourage economic growth. Some countries with high tax burdens have high growth rates and some countries with low tax burdens have low growth rates. Despite much theoretical and empirical inquiry as well as political and policy controversy, no simple answer exists concerning the relationship of taxes on economic growth in developing countries. The research takes an empirical approach to analyze the effects of four types of taxes namely taxes revenue, taxes on goods and services, taxes on income, profits, and capital gains and taxes on international trade on economic growth. Mobilizing a dynamic panel data over the period 2000–2012 and using the system GMM estimator to address endogeneity issues, the econometric results yield that (i) there is a non-linear relationship between taxes revenue and economic growth, specifically, these taxes increase economic growth at short run and this effect then increases over time as these taxes increase, and (ii) there is a non-linear (U-shaped) relationship between taxes on income, profits and capital gains, taxes on international trade and economic growth, specifically, these taxes lower economic growth at short run and these effects then diminish over time as these taxes increase.
H27|Taxation and Economic Growth : An Empirical Analysis on Dynamic Panel Data of WAEMU Countries|This paper studies the impact of taxation on economic growth of the eight WAEMU countries. Among the critiques addressed to the public sector, numerous are those that refer principally to the negative effects which entail high weight and increasing of taxation. The growth rate can be influenced by economic policy choice relative to taxation which has an effect on the decisions of economic agents and is due to the productive public expenditures. The reason is that high level of taxation can be distortionary and like this negatively influences economic growth while law weight of taxation can generate some returns which will be enclosed in production. In order to catch this phenomenon in the WAEMU countries, we have contrary to the more previous studies accounted a non-linear effect of taxation on economic growth. Mobilizing a dynamic panel data specification over the period 1989–2012, the econometric results suggest the absence of a non-linear relationship between taxation and economic growth of WAEMU. Specifically, weak and high rates respectively at short run and long run do not create distortions and hence affect positively economic growth of WAEMU and generate income. This effect on economic growth then increase over time as the fiscal revenue increase.
H27|Short and long run income elasticity of gambling tax bases: evidence from Italy|In periods of economic recession and budget constraints, it becomes essential for the governments to understand which tax revenues are more likely to guarantee a stable or increasing amount of revenues able to support the provision of main public services without depending too much on variation in Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The aim of this paper is to analyze a particular source of tax revenues in Italy, namely gambling tax revenue split by game type (i.e. Lotto; Lotteries; Entertainment machines), in order to understand how tax bases react to changes in income, providing a measure of short run (variability over the business cycle) and long run (growth) income elasticity of different gambling tax revenues. Results show that gambling activities tend to be impressively reactive to variation in income in the long run, and, on the contrary, not particularly volatile in the short run.
H27|Analysis Of The Privatization Process In Poland In The Years 2008-2011 – Outcomes And Prospects|The paper focuses on the analysis of the privatization process conducted in the years 2008-2011 with an attempt to show a broad picture of privatization in Poland, indicate resources that still exist although hidden and show government practices in making privatization more effective or, on the contrary, in carrying out quasi-privatization practices. Three main issues are discussed. First, the privatization process that took place in 2008-2011 seems to be to some extent only sham privatization – many of the companies were simply communalized, or transferred to other state-controlled companies and various government agencies. Thus, contrary to opinions expressed by the government officials, the privatization process is far from being terminated. A new approach used by the Ministry of Treasury is to create special purpose vehicles in order to sell the state-controlled assets more effectively. It turns out that 76% of privatized enterprises in the years 2008-2011 were sold via a tender or auction mechanism - the rest can be considered sham privatization. Huge resources are still to be privatized - the companies have to be identified and should report to one government agency. The novelty is the government’s approach to privatization which involves packing assets into one market attractive entity. The hypothesis verification is preceded with analysis of privatization in Poland in the years 1989-2007, its relations with politics and the economic situation.
H27|Optimal pricing of public lotteries and comparison of competing mechanisms| This article establishes optimal pricing rules for rationing indivisible units of rival and otherwise nonexcludable goods by lottery or a hybrid of a lottery and outright sale by posted price. Given the distributional objective of maximizing expected consumer surplus, the solutions to unconstrained and constrained versions of the pricing problem may be expressed in classic inverse elasticity form, with the lottery price appearing as an entry fee, user fee or a combination of the two. Numerical analysis of a rich class of private value distributions indicates that sizable gains in expected consumer surplus can be realized over competitive pricing and zero pricing.
H27|Tax reforms in EU Member States - 2014 Report|The 2014 This report on Tax Reforms in EU Member States presents an overview of the reforms recently introduced by Member States in the main areas of tax policy and provides up-to-date analysis of the main challenges in each area. It also includes an indicator-based assessment, which gives an initial indication of Member States’ performance in each area
H27|Taxation trends in the European Union: 2014 edition|This report contains a detailed statistical and economic analysis of the tax systems of the Member States of the European Union, plus Iceland and Norway, which are Members of the European Economic Area. The data are presented within a unified statistical framework (the ESA95 harmonised system of national and regional accounts), which makes it possible to assess the heterogeneous national tax systems on a fully comparable basis.
H27|Comparative Analysis Regarding The Enterprises Taxation In Romania And Some European Union Member States|The main difficulties that SMEs meet in the current tax context is the tax burden, tax legislation lack of predictability and stability and bureaucracy. Compared with the Member States of the European Union, Romania is in the lead in terms of labour taxation (with an aggregated statutory rate for social contributions of 44%), in the middle of EU ranking when talking about security contributions, and on the last places as regards the consolidated budget revenues from security contributions. In this paper we are trying to make a comparison, in terms of taxation, of enterprises in Romania and other EU Member States and to propose some solutions for them to develop in a healthy and competitive economic environment.
H27|An Analysis of Petroleum Fiscal Regime in Thailand|This paper analyzes the Thai petroleum fiscal regimes, so called Thailand I and Thailand III, under the concession system for granting petroleum exploration and production rights. The analytical issues include the sharing of benefit between the government and concessionaires, assurance of the government’s share of the profits, and the incentive for entrepreneurs to invest and generate efficient operation. The findings reveal that the Thai petroleum regimes are not flexible because only one set of fiscal instruments is applied. The regimes cannot be adjusted to either the context of project fields and operation or the uncertainty of petroleum price. However, the regimes could generate sufficient sharing of benefit although the share of government cannot be firmly assured. The Thai government revenue is based only on the royalty and petroleum income tax; it does not receive as much a share of the profit as the neighboring countries have been receiving under their sharing systems, which is based on production and the project contracts granted according to types of petroleum and exploration as well as production areas. The Thai petroleum regimes, however, give enough incentive to investors. If the Thai government continues the concession system, it should consider applying an additional fiscal instrument, i.e. “supplementary income tax” to increase government revenue.
H27|El recaudo del impuesto predial en Cartagena de Indias, 1984-2010|En este trabajo se examinan los determinantes del recaudo del impuesto predial en el Distrito de Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, en el periodo 1984-2010. Este tributo representa el 33% de los ingresos corrientes del Distrito; con el impuesto de industria y comercio constituye la principal fuente de ingresos propios de la ciudad. A escala macro se analiza el efecto de la descentralización fiscal iniciada en los ochenta y profundizada en la segunda mitad de los años noventa, así como el cambio de modelo económico con la apertura comercial. También se consideran otras variables de este orden, como la inflación y la desigualdad en el ingreso. A escala local, se examinan los efectos de las reformas tributarias en el Distrito, la expansión de la construcción y el crecimiento demográfico, y siguiendo el enfoque de Iregui y otros (2004), del esfuerzo por recaudar otros impuestos y la respuesta de los contribuyentes ante cambios en el gasto social. Se encuentra que el recaudo del impuesto refleja las condiciones económicas de la ciudad, tanto por los ciclos de la urbanización y la distribución del ingreso como por el impacto de la inflación. Es posible mejorar el recaudo si la ciudadanía percibe aumentos de la inversión social. El fortalecimiento de la gestión tributaria permitirá superar dos serios problemas del recaudo: el efecto sustitución en las rentas propias (especialmente con el impuesto de industria y comercio) y la pereza fiscal. En los casos del impacto inflacionario y la desigualdad es evidente que la política tributaria más efectiva en el largo plazo es aquella que reduce la pobreza y la vulnerabilidad, y eleva la inversión y la eficiencia institucional en la gestión de recaudo.
H27|Niedrigzinsfalle: die Gefahr der finanziellen Repression|This paper describes the concept of financial repression. Under this regime, states aim at reducing the burden of their public debt by repressive measures aimed at financial markets, steady inflation rates and low nominal interest rates. In the past, such policies were widespread in many countries and it might be seen as a viable option of public debt reduction due to the high levels of debt accumulated during the European debt crisis. While financial repression can result in significant reduction of debt levels, it can have severe negative effects on private savers and investors for whom yields become low or negative and who do not have any options of evading financial repression. Dieser Beitrag beschreibt das Konzept der finanziellen Repression. Bei diesem Vorgehen versuchen Staaten, sich durch repressive Maßnahmen an den Finanzmärkten, stetiger Inflation und niedrigen Nominalzinsen verdeckt der Belastung durch die Staatsverschuldung zu entledigen. In der Vergangenheit gab es vielfach Phasen einer solchen Entwicklung und auch in der Folge der europäischen Schuldenkrise ist ein solches Vorgehen in vielen Industrieländern aufgrund der hohen Schuldenstände nach der Finanzkrise denkbar. Während durch finanzielle Repression eine deutliche Schuldenreduktion möglich ist, hat eine solche Politik vielfache negative Auswirkungen für Sparer und Investoren, welche häufig niedrige oder negative Renditen erzielen und kaum Ausweichmöglichkeiten zur Verfügung haben.
H27|Trends in tax systems in the EU|In 2013, the total tax burden in the euro area was almost back to the level prevailing at the beginning of the century. The financial and economic crisis had initially led to a reduction in the tax burden, but fiscal consolidation has generated a rise in revenue. However, there is no general trend observable in labour taxation or indirect taxation. The transfer of part of the burden from labour to consumption, as regularly recommended by international economic organisations, has taken place in a limited amount of countries. Corporation tax alone fell simultaneously in the euro area countries, as a result of tax competition. Following these developments, Belgium remains notable for its heavy taxes on labour and capital, while indirect taxes, particularly excise duties, are relatively low.
H27|The Problem Of Quantifying The Underground Economy: Applying The Method Of Metered Resources|The Underground Economy is a „shadow” of the real economy, endowed with elastic properties: it can be large, small (although not null) based on the specifics of a country, its leaders, economic and legal policies. In relation to the real economy, which is monitored by authorities, the underground economy is usually in a state of growth. In this context, methodologically-practical developments for quantitative estimation of unofficial economic activities are of interest. The problem is generated by a lack of a statistical accounting system, a system of economical indicators in the real economy that would serve as basis for a quantitative estimate of indicators pertaining to the underground economy.
H27|The System of Revenue Sharing and Fiscal Transfers in China|The main features of China’s current sub-national finance arrangements date back to the 1994 tax reform. China has a multi-level government structure that shares national tax revenues through a system of tax sharing and transfers, and divides spending assignments and responsibilities. Local governments have hardly any discretionary power to modify taxation, though they have some non-tax revenue from fees, levies and penalties. They can also spend the profit from the sale of land-use rights subject to central government restrictions. As the 1994 tax reform recentralised revenues and decision-making power, vertical gaps between revenue and expenditure at sub-national levels have grown. In order to accommodate this, the central government has raised the scale of transfers. Over the past decade, China’s transfer policy has addressed the horizontal imbalances and become markedly more redistributive. Nevertheless, fiscal disparities within provinces remain high and are much greater than between regions in OECD countries. The extent of fiscal equalisation within provinces varies, thus affecting the delivery of services. The government’s plan to equalise service provision across the country therefore calls for fine-tuning the transfer system and improving local revenue. Some local governments are testing a residential property tax but not in a form that would substantially raise tax revenue. A significant property tax would tend to lower the revenue from the sale of land-use rights and would, in general, improve the fiscal position of those local governments that already have strong budgets. This Working Paper relates to the 2013 OECD Economic Survey of China (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/china) Le système de partage des recettes et des transferts budgétaires en Chine Les principales caractéristiques des accords de financement infranationaux actuels en Chine remontent à la réforme fiscale de 1994. La Chine possède une structure administrative à plusieurs niveaux qui partage les recettes fiscales nationales par le biais d'un système de répartition des recettes fiscales et de transferts, et qui attribue les missions et responsabilités en matière de dépense. Les collectivités locales n'ont guère de pouvoir discrétionnaire afin de modifier la fiscalité, même si elles collectent des recettes non fiscales provenant de divers droits, prélèvements et amendes. Elles peuvent aussi dépenser les recettes provenant de la vente de droits d'usage des terrains sous réserve de restrictions imposées par le gouvernement central. Comme la réforme fiscale de 1994 a centralisé de nouveau les recettes et le pouvoir de décision, les déséquilibres verticaux entre recettes et dépenses au niveau infranational se sont accentués. Afin d'en tenir compte, le gouvernement central a augmenté le volume des transferts. Au cours de la décennie passée, la politique des transferts en Chine a répondu aux déséquilibres horizontaux et est devenue nettement plus redistributive. Néanmoins, les disparités fiscales au sein des provinces demeurent élevées et sont beaucoup plus grandes qu'entre régions des pays de l'OCDE. Le degré de péréquation au sein des provinces varie, ce qui affecte la prestation de services. Afin d’égaliser cette dernière dans tout le pays, le plan du gouvernement appelle donc à peaufiner le système de transferts et à améliorer les recettes locales. Certaines autorités locales sont en train de tester un impôt foncier résidentiel, mais pas sous une forme qui permettrait d'augmenter considérablement les recettes fiscales. Un impôt foncier important aurait tendance à réduire les recettes provenant de la vente de droits d'usage des terrains et, plus généralement, améliorerait la situation financière des administrations locales déjà dotées de solides budgets. Ce Document de travail a trait à l’Étude économique de l’OCDE de la Chine, 2013 (www.oecd.org/eco/etudes/chine).
H27|Tax-paying for Fun and Profit|Modern advances give us the ability to re-engineer the taxation system to benefit from computerized automation and the insights of modern psychology. People like to do things that bring a tangible reward. Tax-paying should be made FUN, not a chore. You will want to participate if you perceive a direct benefit. This new model selectively adapts the old English system of raising money by granting royal monopolies. A tax-paying entity would be allowed to make a bid on the percentage of tax it would pay for acquiring monopoly rights on a particular venture, posted publicly on a government-auction website for others to see and to post their alternative bids. Proposals put out for bid could immediately be tested for market viability by getting a thumbs-up/thumbs-down from the general public. The rewards to the proposer and to the public can be immediately perceived by all. Hence, the conditions for a positive stimulus-response-reward loop are fulfilled. Tax-paying becomes both fun and profitable, even more gratifying than betting in Las Vegas, because the bidder gets a perceptible benefit from it right away. The advantage to the state and its citizens is that monopoly efficiency does not just serve the monopolist but also the public. The would-be monopolist must make a precise calculation of how much to offer the state in taxes; upon pain of losing the auction to a competitor. With minimal government intervention, the “invisible hand” of economic theory is put to the task of serving the public good.

H27|Informal taxation systems – Zakat and Ushr in Pakistan as example for the relevance of parallel/semi-public dues|This article provides an overview of the religious background of Zakat and the organisation of the Zakat collection in several Islamic countries. Then the mandatory system in Pakistan of Zakat and Ushr is described in more detail. Zakat and Ushr are spent mainly on much targeted areas like social welfare, education and health care for certain population groups. Other types of public goods and services are not covered with funds received from Zakat. Hence, the question arises, whether an Islamic state is according to the Islamic laws entitled to collect additional revenues like taxes in addition to Zakat. A second question is answered in the text, in how far an engagement of religious leaders in tax reform activities is in line with the Islamic law and can contribute to development activities. Taking into account the cultural and religious factors and actors, the involvement of Mullahs or Friday prayers to promote tax morale requires the support of religious scholars, but might have broader impacts even than governmental activities on the public awareness. To answer both questions it is important that - according to important religious scholars - the Islamic state requires additional revenues to cover all necessary demands of its population. One permitted option to collect additional revenues is taxation. Finally the different types of individual giving increase the total amount paid to formal and informal taxation systems in Pakistan by about 1%. Nevertheless, formally the tax to GDP ratio does not change, because Zakat is statistically classified as social assistance benefits, which do not become part of the tax to GDP indicator.
H27|La (Inelástica) Demanda De Juegos Lotto|La mayoría de juegos lotto son operados por monopolios estatales en todo el mundo como una fuente alternativa de ingresos. Así, los estudios sobre la demanda en este ámbito han tratado de evaluar si la elasticidad precio estimada es consistente con la maximización de los ingresos (netos de premios). En este trabajo se emplean datos a nivel de sorteo para estimar la elasticidad precio de la demanda de diferentes juegos lotto ofrecidos en España. Los resultados obtenidos indican que estos juegos son operados en la zona inelástica de la demanda sugiriendo, entre otros, la posibilidad de incrementar el (atípicamente bajo) porcentaje de la recaudación no destinado a premios como estimulante de unos mayores ingresos por ventas. El posible impacto del popular sorteo de Navidad de la Lotería Nacional así como la posible estacionalidad de la demanda de juegos lotto son también analizados.
H27|Political Fragmentation And External Sources Of Funding In Local Governments. Do Power Struggles Matter?|The rationale for taking up the notion of political fragmentation in connection with local governments’ capacity to secure external sources of funding comes about from the fact that local governments continuously face shortages of funding. Their socio-economic development thus depends on their capacity to secure external funding. There are significant differences between localities in terms of fund-rising effectiveness. The aim of this paper is to analyse the role which political fragmentation in local government councils plays in that respect. Hypothesis tested in the paper is that “political fragmentation is negatively correlated with local governments’ capacity for absorbing external funding, in particular EU funds”. The research focuses on relating data on EU funding obtained by Polish municipalities to the level of political fragmentation in communal councils. Analysed data for absorption of EU funding covers the period between 2006 and 2011. Election results for two terms of office are also used.
H27|Southern African Customs Union Revenue, Public Expenditures and HIV/AIDS in BLNS Countries|This study sets out to investigate how revenue from the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) common revenue pool affect efforts to contain HIV/AIDS in Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland (BLNS countries). Using a panel data set of the BLNS countries covering the period 1990-2007 in annual frequency and a health production function, we show that an increase in either SACU revenue or aggregate government expenditure increases HIV prevalence rates. Disaggregating the government expenditures into health and non-health outlays reveals that the health expenditure component decreases HIV prevalence rates. We argue, therefore, that the type of public expenditure matters: public health expenditures decrease while public non-health expenditures increase HIV prevalence rates, with the ultimate direction of HIV prevalence rates determined by the dominant of the two effects.
H27|Anatomy of the Southern African Customs Union: Structure and Revenue Volatility|This paper studies the evolution of the Southern African Customs Union (SACU), tracing it from its inception in 1889 as the Customs Union Convention, the worldâ€™s first customs union, to its current status. While the union has operated under different agreements, which have been negotiated and renegotiated with changing circumstances, the study identifies the agreements of 1889, 1910, 1969 and 2002 as key to the unionâ€™s transformation. It is observed that SACU has evolved from a geopolitical organisation with a repressive colonial foundation to a well-integrated regional trading bloc that is perceived as a possible springboard for larger regional trading blocs in Africa. The study further explores evidence of declining SACU revenue, and investigates its implications on government expenditures in the small members of the union, namely, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland (BLNS Countries). It is found that among the members of the union, Lesotho and Swaziland are the most dependent on SACU transfers and consequently the most vulnerable to the current downward trend in SACU revenue. While Namibia has traditionally relied on diamond exports, it has also been receiving large SACU transfers relative to its GDP. In addition, the study observes that the present SACU revenue sharing formula adopted in 2002 exposes the BLNS countries to instabilities arising from global business cycles more than it does South Africa.
H27|Tax reforms in EU Member States - Tax policy challenges for economic growth and fiscal sustainability – 2013 Report|The 2013 edition of the report ‘Tax reforms in EU Member States’ contributes to the tax policy debate in the EU. Compared to previous editions, the report has been streamlined with a stronger focus on the Member State level. The report consists of two parts: (i) an extensive overview of recent tax reforms, and (ii) a discussion of selected tax policy challenges relevant for improving Member States’ tax systems in two analytical chapters. The chapter on recent tax reforms identifies common trends across countries and offers a typology of reforms consistent with the main messages of the European Semester. The first analytical chapter focuses on two wide ranging challenges that EU Member States are facing in the area of tax policy in times of slow growth and high fiscal consolidation needs: the potential contribution of taxation to consolidate public finances – in addition to expenditure control – and the growth-friendliness of the tax structure. Beside updating and refining last year's horizontal screening, various checks have been carried out to see how robust the results are. The second analytical chapter deals with economic challenges that EU Member States are facing with respect to the design of individual taxes and tax compliance. It deepens the analysis of tax expenditure with particular insights on personal income taxation and examines the debt bias in corporate taxation, notably its effects on banks’ capital structures. Applying an indicator-based approach, the report then provides an update of the analysis carried out in previous years on broadening the VAT base, on housing taxation, on environmental taxation and on improving tax governance. Finally, the chapter analyses the influence of taxation on income inequality.
H27|Recent Reforms of Tax Systems in the EU: Good and Bad News| This paper reviews to what extent Member States followed the tax policy priorities put forward by the European Commission in the Annual Growth Survey of November 2012: shifting taxation away from labour, broadening tax bases, reducing corporate tax debt bias and improving tax compliance. The ‘good news’ which emerges from the analysis is that overall Member States are making efforts to make tax systems more efficient, competitive and fair; the ‘bad news’ is that the extent of the challenges calls for more action in all the priority areas identified.

H27|Spatial Competition and Cross-Border Shopping: Evidence from State Lotteries|This paper investigates competition between jurisdictions in the context of cross-border shopping for state lottery tickets. Our theoretical model, in which consumers consider both travel costs and lottery payoffs, predicts that per-resident sales should be more responsive to prices in small states with densely populated borders. Using weekly sales data from US lotteries and drawing identification from the rollover feature of jackpots, we estimate this responsiveness and find large effects that vary significantly across states. Using these estimates, we show that competitive pressures from neighboring states may lead to substantially lower optimal prices. (JEL H27, H71, H73, R51)

Exploiting a discontinuity in the tax schedule as a quasi-experimental setting, we isolate the impact of the stamp duty from other determinants of mobility. Our empirical strategy essentially compares similar households with self-assessed house values on either sides of a cut-off value where the tax rate increases from 1 to 3 percent. We find that a higher stamp duty strongly negatively affects a household’s propensity to move: the 2 percentage-point increase in the stamp duty may reduce mobility of homeowners by around 40 percent. This adverse effect is mainly confined to short-distance and non-job related moves.
H27|Evaluation of Land Taxation in China|The emerging land-related unrest in China poses a pressing challenge on the legitimacy of the government. Through the perspective of good governance, the paper examines the role of land in government financing and its economic and political cost, as well as the erosion of government's credibility and its negative impact on private and collective property rights. The paper emphasizes the recent upward trend in land-related unrest as a consequence of abuses by local governments on land-source revenues. Our special concern rests on the institution of collective property which is slowly emerging from the shadow of the former state property in the course of economic transition. Collective property right could be a useful legal and economic institution but must receive political support to exist alongside with private property.
H27|How To Prevent A Negative Impact From Single Rate Business Tax Or Corporate Flat Rate Tax On Mexico Maquiladoras,Â¿Como Lograr Que El Impuesto Empresarial A Tasa Unica No Impacte Negativamente Las Finanzas De Las Maquiladoras En Mexico?|In this study, we identify the financial impact caused by the Single Rate Business Tax, also known as Corporate Flat Rate Tax on Mexican Maquiladoras. Specifics of the Corporate Flat Rate Tax including computations, taxable base, and tax credits are presented. Next, a comparison between this tax and the Income Tax is provided. Finally, we analyze the impact of the Corporate Flat Rate Tax on a maquiladora or manufacturing company in Mexico. The results show no impact on liquidity due to this new tax.
H27|IMFG Graduate Student Papers: (1) Development Charges across Canada: An Underutilized Growth Management Tool? (2) Preparing for the Costs of Extreme Weather in Canadian Cities: Issues, Tools, Ideas|(1) Increasingly, compact and sustainable development has become a priority for Canadian municipalities. In order to realize these growth objectives, it is possible to look not only to conventional land use and growth management policies, but also to fiscal instruments to achieve planning goals. Existing literature suggests that development charges, which are financial tools used by municipalities in several Canadian provinces to pay for the growth-related capital costs associated with new development or redevelopment, can influence how land resources are consumed and developments are designed. Drawing on information from the literature and interviews with key informants, this research analyzed how development charges are used in British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario, as well as the Halifax Regional Municipality, to understand how jurisdictions employ development charges and what role these charges currently play in achieving growth objectives. The research found that few municipalities use their development charges proactively to meet planning goals. Moreover, the research revealed a divide among practitioners, with some maintaining that development charges were a revenueraising tool and a poor mechanism by which to achieve planning objectives. Others recognized that development charges could be—and were being—used as a tool to encourage compact growth, but identified several barriers to more effective and widespread use as a planning tool. Suggested recommendations for policy changes include more flexibility within legislation to collect for transit and other services, ongoing support from provincial officials to assist municipalities in designing development charge programs with policy goals in mind, and further exploration of how fiscal tools can best be used as planning tools. (2) This paper reviews the risks to Canadian municipal finance from extreme weather and analyzes the financial tools that cities can use to prepare for extreme weather events: insurance, weather reserves, weather derivatives, and budget provision. Despite the threat of climate change, Canadian cities are not substantially increasing their use of these tools. However, improvements could be made to accounting procedures and disaster assistance regulations, and amalgamating smaller cities could improve their ability to manage risk, all of which will ameliorate the financial impacts of extreme weather. The paper proposes reasons why Canadian cities have failed to fully adapt their infrastructure to extreme weather: lack of information, low fiscal capacity, externalities, moral hazard in disaster assistance arrangements, and poor program design. It concludes by discussing how these arrangements may be overhauled to better prepare Canadian municipalities for extreme weather, including new provincial legislation and the creation of a federal infrastructure fund modelled on the United States’ Pre-Disaster Mitigation program.
H27|Improving the Tax System in Indonesia|Indonesia has come a long way in improving its tax system over the last decade, both in terms of revenues raised and administrative efficiency. Nonetheless, the tax take is still low, given the need for more spending on infrastructure and social protection. With the exception of the natural resources sector, increasing tax revenues would be best achieved through broadening tax bases and improving tax administration, rather than changes in the tax schedule that seems broadly in line with international practice. Possible measures to broaden the tax base include bringing more of the self-employed into the tax system, subjecting employer-provided fringe benefits and allowances to personal income taxation and reducing the exemptions from value-added taxes. Similarly, broad-based investment credits would be a less distortive way to enhance investment incentives than selective tax holidays. Introducing a targeted, simplified tax regime for small and medium-sized enterprises, as currently planned by the government, could foster their integration into the tax system in the longer run, even if its short-run revenue potential is limited. Upgrading tax administration has made substantial progress in Indonesia since 2002, although there is still scope to improve the training of tax officers and the administration’s audit and litigation capacities, while strengthening internal control systems and enhancing the transparency of administrative decisions. The audit system could be further improved by allocating more tax audits on the basis of compliance risks. In the natural resources sector, particularly in mining, there is a case for increasing the government’s share of resource rents through higher tax rates imposed on these rents, as opposed to taxing revenues. This would imply a willingness of the government to bear a larger share of the exploration and development risk than heretofore, which Indonesia, with its improved access to international financial markets and a diversified resource portfolio, is now well placed to do. In the mining sector, a powerful rent tax regime with a large government take would serve the country better than export taxes and ownership restrictions that have been decided recently. This Working Paper relates to the 2012 OECD Economic Review of Indonesia (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/Indonesia). Améliorer le système fiscal en Indonésie L’Indonésie a beaucoup amélioré son système fiscal au cours de la dernière décennie, tant en ce qui concerne le montant des recettes collectées que l’efficience administrative. Néanmoins, les recettes fiscales restent faibles au regard de la nécessité d’accroître les dépenses consacrées aux infrastructures et à la protection sociale. À l’exception du secteur des ressources naturelles, l’augmentation des recettes fiscales doit passer avant tout par l’élargissement de l’assiette et l’amélioration de l’administration fiscale, plutôt que par une révision du barème d’imposition qui semble globalement conforme à la pratique internationale. Parmi les mesures possibles pour élargir l’assiette figurent l’intégration des travailleurs non salariés dans le système fiscal, l’assujettissement à l’impôt sur le revenu des personnes physiques des biens en nature et des indemnités versés par l’employeur, et la réduction des exemptions à la TVA. Dans le même ordre d’idées, l’introduction de crédits d’impôt généreux en faveur de l’investissement serait un moyen de stimuler l’investissement qui induirait moins de distorsions que des exonérations fiscales sélectives. La mise en place d’un régime simplifié et ciblé pour les petites et moyennes entreprises, actuellement envisagé par les pouvoirs publics, pourrait favoriser leur intégration dans le système fiscal à plus long terme, même si l’effet à court terme sur les recettes est limité. La modernisation de l’administration fiscale a beaucoup progressé en Indonésie depuis 2002, bien qu’il soit encore possible d’améliorer la formation des agents des impôts et de renforcer les capacités de l’administration à mener des vérifications et à agir en justice, tout en consolidant les systèmes de contrôle interne et en accroissant la transparence des décisions administratives. Le système de vérification pourrait être perfectionné en fondant les décisions de contrôle fiscal sur les risques de non paiement. Dans le secteur des ressources naturelles, et notamment les industries extractives, il y a lieu d’accroître la part des rentes de ressources revenant à l’État en relevant les taux d’imposition de ces rentes, au lieu de taxer les recettes. Une telle mesure impliquerait la volonté des pouvoirs publics de prendre à leur charge une partie des risques d’exploration et de mise en valeur plus importante qu’auparavant, ce qui est tout à fait à la portée de l’Indonésie, qui bénéficie aujourd’hui d’un meilleur accès aux marchés internationaux de capitaux et d’un portefeuille de ressources diversifié. Dans le secteur minier, un régime performant d’imposition des rentes, qui permette à l’État de percevoir une fraction élevée des recettes, servirait davantage les intérêts du pays que les taxes à l’exportation et les restrictions à la propriété qui ont été décidées récemment. Ce Document de travail se rapporte à l’Étude économique de l’OCDE de l’Indonésie 2012 (www.oecd.org/eco/etudes/indonesie).
H27|The Need of Avoiding the Double International Assessment|Each state of the world has been always established the taxes in order to exhibit both the political and fiscal sovereignty. The state has been able to create its fiscal politics, its fiscal system, which do not contravene to the general international rights, do not favor some countries and do not oblige the states to the international double assessment. As regards the direct taxes, the financial flows amongst states or between states and bodies, regional or internal institutions do not manifest directly under the form of amount transfers over the border, by being subservient to a state or another. The state has not transferred abroad and hasn’t received amounts from incomings that signify direct taxes, income taxes or wealth taxes.
H27|Consideration Regarding the Taxation in Finland and Romania|The paper shows through comparison, in the first phase, the main features of the tax system focusing on direct and indirect taxes, in Finland and Romania, and then presents an analysis of the evolution of the structure and level of taxes in both countries. Last but not least, is presented an analysis of the level of tax burden and also the factors that influenced the pressure in these two countries. The diversity of the fiscality in Finland and Romania reflecting the political choice of a given moment and is the result of the economic and social structure of each country.
H27|Evaluating the Impact of Crime on Tourism in Barbados: A Transfer Function Approach|The impact of crime on tourism to Barbados was examined using a transfer function approach. Results indicate that an increase in the overall crime rate has a negative and significant impact on arrivals to the island, and the fall-off is delayed, starting 6 months after a one-unit increase in the crime rate. The impulse response function shows that a 1% shock to crime reduces arrivals to Barbados, but takes about 20 months for arrivals to return to normalcy. This results in direct income losses of US$47,000 and indirect losses of US$108,000. Impacts for murder, assault with intent to rob, rape, and residential burglary rates were also investigated. Qualitatively, the results resemble those for the overall crime rate; however, the magnitudes of the impacts are greater and income losses are generally in the millions. Given the country’s dependence on tourism receipts to sustain its current account, shocks to the crime rate can lead to balance of payment problems. Since there is a lag before the impact of increases in crime takes its full toll on arrivals, it is advised that at the first sign of heightened criminal activity policy makers should act to minimize losses.
H27|La diversité des systèmes de protection sociale en Amérique latine|Cet article propose une méthode d’analyse des systèmes latino-américains de protection sociale. Ceux-ci sont caractérisés par une extrême diversité en termes de dépense (niveau et destination) et d’organisation institutionnelle, et par la très grande complexité de chacun d’eux, ce qui est développé dans une première partie. La deuxième partie analyse les raisons de l’échec des efforts d’élaboration de typologies destinées à théoriser cette diversité, qu’elles soient dérivées des typologies élaborées à propos des systèmes européens, ou fondées sur un couplage entre système de protection sociale et type de régime politique. La troisième partie développe une proposition de méthode, qui fonde l’analyse des systèmes de protection sociale sur les configurations des droits sociaux. Cette proposition est faite en deux temps : d’un côté, une définition et un classement de droits sociaux très diversifiés. De l’autre côté la présentation de l’analyse en termes de « configurations de droits », dont on suggère la capacité heuristique.
H27|Der neue Kurs der Europäischen Zentralbank|In September 2012, the European Central Bank (ECB) announced its new “Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT)” programme, which entails unlimited purchases of member states’ government bonds. Following an idea by George Soros, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, the ECB intends to sterilise these purchases through the liabilities side of its balance sheet, i.e. through the issuance of ECB bonds. The article analyses this plan and argues that the ECB is introducing a second unlimited European Stability Mechanism (ESM). This clearly violates European law and is likely to be punishable under German criminal law. Copyright ZBW and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012

H27|Tax reforms in EU Member States - Tax policy challenges for economic growth and fiscal sustainability – 2012 Report|The 2012 edition of the report ‘Tax reforms in EU Member States’ intends to contribute to the tax policy debate in the EU. Following the successful 2011 edition, the report consists of two parts: i) a short analysis of tax revenue data and an overview of recent tax reforms in Member States, and ii) a discussion of selected up-to-date tax policy topics in the form of two analytical chapters. The first analytical chapter focuses on the economic implications and policy challenges of the EU VAT system, of which it provides an overview of the history and possible future. It analyses welfare gains and economic benefits from simplifying VAT procedures and reviews options to reduce VAT fraud and evasion. This chapter is particularly topical in light of two recent Commission Communications on ‘the future of VAT’ and on ‘concrete ways to reinforce the fight against tax fraud and tax evasion including in relation to third countries’. The second analytical chapter deals with economic challenges that EU Member States are facing in the field of taxation and tax policy in times of slow growth and high fiscal consolidation needs. Applying an indicator-based approach, the report identifies horizontal challenges related to (i) fiscal consolidation on the revenue side and growth-friendly tax structures, (ii) broadness of tax bases in both direct and indirect taxation, with a particular focus on corporate tax expenditure, (iii) the need to improve tax governance and (iv) specific tax issues, namely housing taxation, environmental taxation and some redistributive aspects of taxation.
H27|Taxation trends in the European Union: 2012 edition|This is the sixth issue of 'Taxation Trends in the European Union', an expanded and improved version of a previous publication, 'Structures of the taxation systems in the European Union'. The objective of the report remains unchanged: to present a complete view of the structure, level and trends of taxation in the Union over a medium- to long-term period.
H27|The Technology and Economics of Coinage Debasements in Medieval and Early Modern Europe: with special reference to the Low Countries and England|"Coinage debasement in medieval and early modern Europe remains an ill-understood topic; and indeed an often cited article (""The Debasement Puzzle"": Velde and Weber, 1996) sought to demonstrate that coinage debasements were both impractical and economically futile. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that aggressive debasements were generally very practical and effective, so long as they were properly devised to profit both the merchants who brought bullion to the mints and the princes who earned seigniorage revenues from those mints. To be sure, the general public often suffered the consequences of this seigniorage tax from the consequent inflation. But another goal of this study is to demonstrate that inflation was almost never proportionate to the extent of the debasement, even during Henry VIII's Great Debasement (1542-53); and to demonstrate that both merchants and the prince benefitted from debasements in real terms, provided that they spent the increased quantity of now debased coins (of the same face value) quickly enough, before the full force of inflation was felt. Central to the economic success of such debasements was the pre-modern mint technology: the very crudity of the techniques of ""hammered"" coinages whose mint outputs did not produce fully identical coins in each issue. For this and many other reasons explored in this study, domestic merchants and the general public almost always accepted coins by tale (number), at face value, and did not discount them for deficiencies in weight and fineness, except for those merchants dealing with gold coins in international trade. The second part of this study is an examination of the European princes' motives for conducting such coinage debasements. As the previous argument and so many previous studies have indicated, an obvious motive was profit-seeking, so that such debasements may be regarded more as fiscal than truly monetary policies. But an equally powerful and perhaps even more widespread monetary motive was defence of the realm's coinages and mints: i.e., necessary defences and retaliations against aggressive, profit-seeking debasements undertaken by neighboring prices (or city states). In essence, that meant a defence against the operations of Gresham's Law, whose frequency and effectiveness in international monetary flows are also examined in this study. The operation of Gresham's Law also involved, however, the deterioration of the general standard of domestic coins through counterfeiting, fraudulent clipping and sweating of the coins, and especially by normal wear and tear in domestic circulation. Such deterioration, for all these reasons, thus meant that freshly minted, full-bodied good coins were soon driven out of circulation (exported abroad, melted down, or just hoarded) by the prevailing circulation of 'bad' coins, thus necessitating a defensive debasement to reduce the mint standard, in weight and fineness, to that of the prevailing circulation. The problem of Gresham's Law, related to both aggressive and defensive debasements, was resolved, to obviate debasements, only by the advent of modern steam-powered machinery to produce perfectly round, milled, and exact replicas of coins struck. The final but brief aspect of this study is to answer the question raised by Sargent and Velde in their recent monograph: The Big Problem of Small Change (2002). Were such coinage debasement ever undertaken as a deliberate policy to expand the money supply (especially during the late-medieval ""bullion famines"") and in particular to remedy any chronic shortage of petty coins or ""small change"": other than as a defensive reaction to Gresham's Law? The answer advanced in this study, briefly, is simply NO (for the reasons explored in the conclusion)."
H27|Money Matters: A Critique of the Postan Thesis on Medieval Population, Prices, and Wages|This paper is a critique of Michael Postan's famous Malthusian-Ricardo model demonstrating that late-medieval prices and wages were essentially determined by demographic factors, especially after the Black Death, while contending that monetary factors played no role in determining prices or wages. His central argument is simple: that rapid and drastic depopulation (falling perhaps from ca. 1320) - by about 50% in England ca. 1450 - drastically altered the land:labour ratio so that real wages increased, both from a rise in the marginal productivity of labour and also from a corresponding fall in the costs of foodstuffs. As Ricardo had argued, a population decline necessarily led to lower grain prices, reduced rents, as well as to increased real wages. A related part of Postan's model is the contention that grain prices alone fell after the Black Death, while prices of most livestock products and especially industrial products rose, thus producing a widening divergence in commodity prices in late-medieval Europe. This paper seeks to show that monetary factors also played a role in determining or influencing both prices and real wages in medieval Europe, both before and after the Black Death. The evidence produced here reveals cycles of inflation and deflation from the late 12th to early 16th century: with a sharp deflation before the Black Death, an equally severe inflation for the quarter century following the Black Death, which was then followed by steep deflation into the early 15th century, after which the deflationary trend was broken only by the final phase of the Hundred Years' War and by civil wars in Flanders. Deflation resumed in the very late 15th century, enduring until the eve of the inflationary European Price Revolution, from ca. 1515-20 to ca. 1650. The tables in this paper demonstrate that during both periods of inflation and of deflation, agricultural and industrial prices rose and fell together, if not necessarily in full tandem. These cycles of inflation and deflation were essentially due to monetary and not demographic factors; but differences in relative prices can be explained as well by real factors. Thus the core theme of the paper: 'money matters', though monetary factors certainly do not explain all economic phenomena. The final section of the paper deals with post-Plague real wages, demonstrating first a sharp fall in real wages following the Black Death and then a sharp rise in real wages from the later 14th century. That was essentially a result and function of downward nominal wage-stickiness during the deflations that took place in this era, especially during the two bullion famines of ca. 1370 - ca. 1415 and ca. 1440 - 1475. An examination of the root causes of wage-stickiness, essentially a post-Plague phenomenon, has been more thoroughly explored in many other of my online working papers and numerous publications (since 2003). The statistical evidence on prices and wages is taken from both England and Flanders (up to ca. 1500): i.e., from both a basically rural agrarian economy (England) and a much more commercialized, industrialized, urbanized economy (Flanders). If such radically different economies experienced the same trends in commodity prices and wages (nominal and real)- as they did, the agrarian-based Ricardo model cannot provide the full explanation - so that again a role for monetary factors must be allowed, all the more so in light of the detailed monetary evidence supplied in this paper.
H27|Razvoj poreza na dohodak u Hrvatskoj: reforme i promašaji|The paper examines the development and effectiveness of the changes in Croatian personal income tax (PIT). Firstly, the paper analyzes the changes in the tax base and the nominal tax burden according to the sources of income for the period since 1994. when the comprehensive PIT was introduced till the end of year 2010. The second part contains the empirical research for the period since 2001 by 2010, where the average and effective tax burden according to the sources of income is analyzed, the effectiveness of changes in the PIT is tested, as well as the integration of the certain sources of income in PIT system. The survey results indicate a lock of consistency in the PIT development, the tax burden is unequally allocated among the observed sources of income as their lack of integration in the PIT system. Moreover, the findings presented in the paper raise the question of the comprehensive PIT existence because of the fact that the existing PIT system is almost completely based on the taxation of the employment as the only source of income.
H27|A comparative view on the tax performance of developing countries: Regional patterns, non-tax revenue and governance|Some countries fail to ensure that their citizens and businesses make an appropriate contribution to the financing of public tasks. But not all countries with a low tax ratio automatically fall into this category. This paper presents an approach to bridge the gap between probabilistic statements based on statistical analyses, and country-specific information. Rather than defining general across-the-board criteria, the approach accounts for different development levels and other influencing factors, such as regional patterns, non-tax revenue and governance. Findings on individual countries or groups of countries should put governments, donors and international organisations in a better position to decide on tax reform programmes and aid modalities.
H27|Informal Taxation|"Informal payments are a frequently overlooked source of local public finance in developing countries. We use microdata from ten countries to establish stylized facts on the magnitude, form, and distributional implications of this ""informal taxation."" Informal taxation is widespread, particularly in rural areas, with substantial in-kind labor payments. The wealthy pay more, but pay less in percentage terms, and informal taxes are more regressive than formal taxes. Failing to include informal taxation underestimates household tax burdens and revenue decentralization in developing countries. We discuss various explanations for and implications of these observed stylized facts. (JEL H24, H27, O12, O17, O23)"
H27|Testing Game Theory in the Field: Swedish LUPI Lottery Games|Game theory is usually difficult to test in the field because predictions typically depend sensitively on features that are not controlled or observed. We conduct one such test using both laboratory and field data from the Swedish lowest unique positive integer (LUPI) game. In this game, players pick positive integers and whoever chooses the lowest unique number wins. Equilibrium predictions are derived assuming Poisson distributed population uncertainty. The field and lab data show similar patterns. Despite various deviations from equilibrium, there is a surprising degree of convergence toward equilibrium. Some deviations can be rationalized by a cognitive hierarchy model. (JEL C70, C93, D44, H27)
H27|Public-Private Partnership - A Strategic Approach Of Public Services Management|Public-private partnership is a solution in the management of public services by government authorities. Often faced with budget restrictions and laws limits, the administration was asked to address the problem of investments to develop local communities. In this issue has been addressed collaboration between public and private sector through partnerships. In states with tradition, including France, Britain, Spain, United States was demonstrated that the risks and benefits are shared between partner, and development of projects through public-private partnerships have a real chance of success. This paper proposes an analysis of the types of partnerships used their characteristic, the advantages and disadvantages to their use. Are envisaged the partnership agreements of states which has been adopted, aiming at finding solutions to their implementation in Romania.
H27|A Wealth Tax Abandoned: The role of the UK Treasury 1974-6|The distribution of wealth is widening in many countries and with it the importance of inherited wealth. In 1974 a Labour Government came to power in the United Kingdom committed to introducing an annual wealth tax. It left office without doing so. Using the official archives of the time and those of a key advisor this paper traces both the origins of the policy and its fate in Whitehall. It explores two related questions. What does this experience tell us about the role of the civil service in the policy process in the UK and what lessons might be learned by those wishing to tackle the issue of widening wealth disparities today?
H27|Land Taxation in China: Assessment of Prospects for Politically and Economically Sustainable Reform|The emerging land-related unrest in China poses a pressing challenge on the legitimacy of the government. Through the perspective of good governance, the paper examines the role of land in government financing and its economic and political cost, as well as the erosion of government¡¯s credibility and its negative impact on private and collective property rights. The paper emphasizes the recent upward trend in land-related unrest as a consequence of abuses by local governments on land-source revenues. Our special concern rests on the institution of collective property which is slowly emerging from the shadow of the former state property in the course of economic transition. Collective property right could be a useful legal and economic institution but must receive political support to exist alongside with private property.
H27|Public policy towards the sale of state assets in troubled times: Lessons from the Irish experience|The sale of state assets, both tangible (e.g. commercial firms) and intangible (e.g. radio spectrum), can address budgetary shortfalls. However, drawing on the Irish experience to inform this important issue, it becomes clear that much more is involved in selling state assets in electricity, gas, and transport than ranking such assets by value. Wider public policy considerations need to be taken into account in deciding what to sell and under what conditions. The paper outlines how these wider issues, relating to competition and regulation, can be dealt with so that the sale of state assets will enhance societal welfare.
H27|Effects of inflation tax versus Tanzi effect on the real value of tax revenues: Evidence from Turkey|The paper analyzes the effects of inflation on real tax revenues by relying on empirical findings. Real tax revenues are obtained by dealing with the two adverse impacts of inflation including the inflation tax increasing the revenues and the Tanzi effect reducing the overall income. Bootstrap VAR models are performed to carry out the short term relationship between inflation and real tax revenues. Bootstrap techniques are preferred to overcome the small sample data problem. Major findings, unlike the expectations with respect to Tanzi effect, show that inflation positively affects the real tax revenues. The impact of the inflation, taken as some sort of hidden tax, is visibly stronger during the period between 1987 and 2005. In addition, the performances of the analytical method and the bootstrap methods are compared, resulting in a better performance in the estimates by bootstrapping.
H27|Tax-benefit incidence of value added tax on food and medicine to fund progressive social expenditure|In 2009, the Mexican Congress received a proposal of a generalized 2% increase in the statutory VAT rate, including currently untaxed food and medicine. Whereas opponents emphasized the regressive effect, supporters argued that progressivity of the compensatory expenditures included in the bill more than compensated the bottom income quintiles. In this paper I present a tax-benefit incidence of this proposal using national survey data on household's income and consumption. Despite the regressive effect of the tax increase, the data shows that the progressive expenditure offsets this effect. Overall the proposal was progressive. This finding undermines the arguments in favor of keeping food and medicines exempt of VAT to prevent a regressive effects. This result also contributes to the debate about the regressive effects of a single VAT to all consumption and no exemptions. To illustrate that, I analyze the redistributive effect of this policy. The result is that the increase in public expenditure can offset the regressive effect of this policy.

H27|What Does Norway Get Out Of Its Oil Fund, if Not More Strategic Infrastructure Investment?|"For the past generation Norway has supplied Europe and other regions with oil, taking payment in euros or dollars. It then sends nearly all this foreign exchange abroad, sequestering its oil-export receipts—which are in foreign currency—in the ""oil fund,"" to invest mainly in European and US stocks and bonds. The fund now exceeds $500 billion, second in the world to that of Abu Dhabi. It is claimed that treating these savings as a mutual fund invested in a wide array of US, European, and other stocks and bonds (and now real estate) avoids domestic inflation that would result from spending more than 4 percent of the returns to this fund at home. But the experience of sovereign wealth funds in China, Singapore, and other countries has been that investing in domestic infrastructure serves to lower the cost of living and doing business, making the domestic economy more competitive, not less. This paper cites the debate that extends from US 19th-century institutional doctrine to the approach of long-time Russian Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Yevgeny Primakov to illustrate the logic behind spending central bank and other sovereign foreign-exchange returns on modernizing and upgrading the domestic economy rather than simply recycling the earnings to US and European financial markets in what looks like an increasingly risky economic environment, as these economies confront debt deflation and increasing fiscal tightness."
H27|Reckoning Without the Water Host. How Will Italians Pay for Water and Sanitation After the 2011 Referendum?|The 2011 popular referendum has abolished the norm setting among the principles for setting water prices the «adequacy of capital remuneration»: in the promoters' own strategy, this aims at stopping any commercial approach to the supply of water and sanitation services and oblige to manage them as «common goods». This article, rooted in the contemporary theory of common properties, analyzes the potential usefulness of the «commons» idea in the economy of a service whose industrial complexity and financial needs call in any case for a role of capital markets. Alternative financial mechanisms are discussed, showing that they should be considered as complementary to water tariffs rather than alternatives.
H27|Community Budget Financial Instrument of EU|The general budget of the European Union is the instrument wchich set out and authorises the total amount of revenue and expenditures deemed necessaryfor the European Union and European Atomic Energy Community for each year. According to this can be observed every year EU policy priorities and guidelines. Its evolution over time reflects the successive transformations of European construction. EU budget differs fundamentally from national budgets of EU Member because, first of all, public institutions are in the responsibility of Member States and are funded from national budgets, and on the other hand, costs of government institutions (European Commission, Parliament, Council, Court of Justice) are reduced..
H27|Il gioco pubblico in Italia fra tradizione e innovazione: aspetti economici e di marketing|In recent years there has been a substantial increase in the Italian gambling market and we have witnessed major changes in the taxation and regulation of gambling, as well as the introduction of new technological supports (e.g. the internet, mobile and fixed telephony, dedicated TV channels, new generation gaming machines). Together with the entrance of new suppliers and the widening of the product portfolio, these factors have induced a deep renewal of the industrial and supply structure for these services. This paper offers some reflections on the challenges that this important sector of the national economy faces today.
H27|A Distributional Analysis of the FairTax Plan: Annual and Lifetime Income Considerations|Dissatisfaction with the current federal tax system is fostering serious interest in the FairTax Plan, which would replace most of the federal taxes with a national retail sales tax. The FairTax is promoted as being progressive, but there is considerable skepticism of this claim. We examine the distributional effects of the FairTax, as well as the current system it intends to replace, under both annual income and lifetime income approaches. Global measures of progressivity suggest that the current federal tax system is progressive while the FairTax is regressive. Our results are also robust to different assumptions used for estimation.
H27|Tax Reforms in EU Member States 2011: tax policy challenges for economic growth and fiscal sustainability|Fiscal sustainability and economic growth are key concerns at the current juncture. The focus of tax policy has now shifted away from stimulus measures towards a much needed consolidation of public finances, made even more necessary in light of the difficulties currently faced by some Member States in refinancing their sovereign debt. At the same time, tax policies may play an important role in enhancing the growth potential of the EU economy, which is a goal per se but also a condition for making public finance sustainable. A growth-friendly tax structure is particularly important to cope with today's policy challenges. As a background for the analysis, the 2011 issue of the report ‘Tax reforms in EU Member States’, subtitled this year as ‘Tax policy challenges for economic growth and fiscal sustainability’, provides an overview of recent trends in tax revenues and of tax measures adopted in Member States in 2010 and the first half of 2011. In addition to these descriptive chapters, this year's report provides an analytical focus on two topics of particular relevance at the current juncture. The first analytical chapter of the report addresses the multi-faceted concept of the quality of taxation – particularly relevant for any future tax reforms – with a particular focus on the tax structure. A ‘good’ tax system should design taxes so as to reduce distortions to the minimum possible and, where appropriate, correct market failures. Well-designed tax reforms promoting employment and growth can go hand in hand with social equity. To avoid adverse interaction between cross-country tax systems, tax policies should benefit from an efficient coordination at the EU level. The second analytical chapter discusses three types of potential challenges in the area of tax policy currently faced by EU Member States: (i) addressing severe fiscal consolidation challenges also on the revenue side, (ii) making the overall tax structure more growth friendly and (iii) improving the design of the tax system for individual types of taxes. Applying an indicator-based approach, the report identifies in which euro-area Member States higher tax revenues might potentially contribute to consolidation and which countries might benefit from a shift from labour taxes, in particular those bearing on vulnerable groups, to consumption and real estate taxes. Analysing more specific horizontal challenges related to the design of individual taxes, the report concludes that almost all euro-area Member States face at least one challenge.
H27|Elasticities of Financial Instruments, Profits and Remuneration|The European Commission has asked Copenhagen Economics to undertake a study on the tax elasticity and semi-tax elasticity of various tax bases that could fall under the taxation of the financial sector. The study will be focused on bringing forward all empirical studies that have analysed how the financial sector responds to taxes. We look at responses in three broad areas: 1) their location, 2) their financial activities, and 3) their transactions.
H27|VAT in the Public Sector and Exemptions in the Public Interest|The European Commission has asked Copenhagen Economics and KPMG AG in collaboration to study the VAT rules applied to the public sector in EU member states, and make a comparison with the VAT/GST rules applied in key OECD countries outside the EU.The study collects and analyses relevant studies already carried out at international, EU or national level. The study describes the problems that arise from current VAT rules applied in the public sector. We analyse what the drivers and underlying causes of such problems are. We investigate the impact from differential VAT treatment between public and private entities on the input side in public entities and on the output side where competition between private sector entities and public sector entities are distorted. We have not looked at the postal sector in this study, however, because of the existing Commission proposal. Having identified problems and causes, we present main policy options, which has been defined in co-operation with the Commission services. These options are analysed and quantified using among others, a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the EU-economy. Discussions of costs of compliance are included in the analysis. In our economic model, we specifically model the so-called ‘core’ services waste disposal, cultural services, education, hospital services and broadcasting in agreement with the EU Commission. Hence, the modelling scenarios produce changes in output in these public activities which make up the results regarding the changes in public sector output. In order to model the quantitative effects from the policy options we needed to asses the baseline scenario as precisely as possible. To do this, we constructed a legal and an economic questionnaire and submitted them to our network in the majority of Member States.
H27|Taxation trends in the European Union: 2011 edition|This report contains a detailed statistical and economic analysis of the tax systems of the Member States of the European Union, plus Iceland and Norway, which are Members of the European Economic Area. The data are presented within a unified statistical framework (the ESA95 harmonised system of national and regional accounts), which makes it possible to assess the heterogeneous national tax systems on a fully comparable basis. The standard classifications of tax revenues (by major type of tax or by level of government) presented in most international tax revenue statistics are hard to interpret in economic terms. This publication stands out for offering a breakdown of tax revenues by economic function (i.e. according to whether they are raised on consumption, labour or capital). This classification is based on disaggregated tax data and on a breakdown of the revenue from the personal income tax. Besides revenue data, the report also contains indicators of the average effective tax rate falling on consumption, labour and capital, as well as data on environmental taxation and on the top rates for the personal and corporate income tax. Country chapters give an overview of the tax system in each of the 29 countries covered, the revenue trends and the main recent policy changes. Detailed tables allow comparison between the individual countries and European averages. Data cover the 1995-2009 period and are presented both as a percentage of GDP and as a percentage of total taxation. This year's edition of the report for the first time includes data on average effective tax ratios (EATRs) for non-financial corporations. In addition, the report also contains a detailed new analysis of the impact of the economic and financial crisis on the tax systems of all EU Member States.
H27|A Site Value Tax for Ireland: Approach, Design and Implementation|Ireland's Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the EU/IMF requires government to introduce a recurring annual property tax. While the MoU has not specified the precise form this new taxation measure will adopt, commitments in the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014 and Fine Gael/Labour Programme for Government have pointed towards the introduction of an annual Site Value Tax (SVT). Budget 2011 suggested that the yield from this tax source would grow from €180m in 2012 to reach €530m in 2014. Similarly the MoU commits government to raising additional taxation revenues of €1.5bn in 2012 and €1.1bn in 2013 with both to be partly funded by a property tax and increases to that tax. To date assessments of the feasibility of a SVT (by the Commission of Taxation and the Department of Finance) have pointed towards a series of practical difficulties associated with its introduction. This paper outlines a proposal to overcome these difficulties and to introduce a credible, fair and reliable annual SVT from January 2013. The paper uses the land registry database of the Property Registration Authority of Ireland (PRAI) to outline the structure and administration of a SVT.
H27|Evolution of Asia's outward-looking economic policies: Some lessons from trade policy reviews|This Working Paper contains some observations concerning the evolution of trade and trade-related policies in the Asia-Pacific region since the establishment in 1989 of the Trade Policy Review Mechanism (TPRM), whose goal is to improve the transparency of these policies. It also draws some lessons from the Reviews undertaken. In particular, the Paper examines how reforms, either unilateral or in connection with bilateral, regional or multilateral trade agreements, can be greatly facilitated by transparency, including cost-benefit (C-B) analyses of policies and measures that take full account not just of the interests of domestic producers, but also those of other groups, including exporters and domestic consumers. While high quality transparency is not cheap, the costs of achieving it pale in comparison with the financial assistance involved and efficiency losses associated with such assistance. Trade Policy Reviews (TPRs) throw light not only on measures that appear to contravene WTO rules, although that is not their purpose; more importantly, they identify measures not seemingly covered by WTO rules, which can, nonetheless, have economic effects equivalent to measures that are subject to these rules. One of the main lessons from these TPRs is that impediments to economic development are largely homegrown. Consequently, unilateral structural reform, of which liberalization of both trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) has been an integral part, is of paramount importance. By fostering transparency, particularly evaluating the effectiveness of policies and measures in achieving their objectives and their overall impacts (intended or unintended) on the economy, the TPRM can be a catalyst for unilateral reform, including liberalization of trade and FDI. Although the latter has received added impetus from multilateral liberalization under the auspices of the GATT/WTO, the stalling of negotiations in connection with the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) should not preclude further unilateral liberalization. By contrast, the benefits of preferential trade agreements are far from obvious, notwithstanding their proliferation during the past decade throughout the Asia-Pacific region, where few governments have subjected these agreements to rigorous cost-benefit analysis.
H27|Is Lottery Gambling Addictive?|We present an empirical test for the addictiveness of lottery gambling that exploits an exogenous shock to local market consumption of lottery gambling. It uses the sale of a winning jackpot ticket in a zip code as an instrument for present consumption and tests for a causal relationship between present and future consumption. This test estimates the time path of persistence nonparametrically. Data from the Texas State Lottery suggests that after 6 months, roughly half of the initial increase in lottery consumption is maintained. After 18 months, roughly 40 percent of the initial shock persists, though estimates become less precise. (JEL D12, H27, H71)

H27|Import Tariffs Enforcement with Low Administrative Capacity|Import tariff receipts represent an important share of government revenues in many developing countries and there has recently been a surge in empirical studies showing how evasion in this field is a pervasive phenomenon. In the case of import tariffs, the tax base is the product of quantity and unit value, both of which have to be reported and need to be assessed by the custom authority during an audit. I show that when the fiscal authority has an imperfect detection technology, there is an additional incentive for the taxpayer to underdeclare, as a greater declaration in one dimension actually increases the fine when evasion in the other dimension is detected, and a tax base presenting this feature is subject to more evasion compared to a tax base that can be assessed directly. Also, when enforcement capacity is low, voluntary compliance is higher when the importer is required to declare only the total value of imports.
H27|Booms, Busts, and Gambling: Can Gaming Revenues Reduce Budget Volatility?|Over the past 20 years, state and provincial governments in North America have expanded legal gambling opportunities to consumers. One of the primary policy goals of this expansion of gambling opportunities has been to increase government revenues. Gambling is an attractive source of new government revenues because consumers are relatively insensitive to the implicit “tax” rate imposed on gambling activities and gambling is a voluntary activity; only those who chose to gamble are subject to this implicit tax. In this paper, we document the contribution that gambling revenues make to state and provincial tax receipts, and the extent to which variation in gambling revenues contributes to the volatility of tax revenues over time. We adopt an approach from the finance literature. In finance, the relationship of the return to an individual stock to total return in a portfolio, or total return the entire stock market, is often summarized by a “Beta” which can be estimated from actual returns on portfolios and individual stocks. We investigate the contribution of gambling revenue, and revenue from other sources, to variation in total government revenues, by estimating a beta for various government revenue sources in states and provinces in North America over the period 1989-2009. The estimated betas for gambling revenue in many provinces and states are negative, indicating that variation in gaming revenue has negative correlation with variation in own source revenues, reducing the variation in total state and provincial revenue over time.
H27|Corporate Tax Stimulus and Investment in Colombia|This paper uses a yearly dataset of plant-level investment in Colombian firms during the period 1997 to 2007 to assess the impact of a tax incentive for firms that invest in fixed assets implemented in 2004. A positive and statistically significant correlation is found between the boom observed in investment and the adoption of the tax policy. However, the correlation vanishes when year-specific effects are controlled for. This result is robust to changes in the empirical specification, changes in estimation techniques, the inclusion of additional controls, and changes in the data set, among other tests. Overall, it is concluded that the tax stimulus analyzed was ineffective in promoting investment in Colombia.
H27|Old George Orwell Got It Backward: Some Thoughts on Behavioral Tax Economics|It is entirely appropriate that the study of public finance take seriously 'behavioral' inconsistencies with traditional models of individual and collective decision-making. This raises the question of whether the state should play a role in protecting individuals from themselves, and whether individuals are susceptible to manipulation, or even exploitation, by the people who comprise the state. In this essay I two aspects of this issue - tax complexity and tax compliance. In addressing these issues I ask, and offer some tentative answers to, what is distinctive about behavioral tax economics as a sub-field of behavioral economics and as a sub-field of tax economics.

H27|Banking Redefined|Taxation, tax collection, tax enforcement, tax compliance, allocation of revenues to various ministries or departments and money supply into the economy are unified and integrated in the banking system. There will be no Direct and Indirect taxes, tax collection departments, tax tribunals and tax enforcement agencies. Citizens need not maintain separate account books and submit tax returns annually for paying either Direct taxes on personal incomes or Indirect taxes while running business or industry. There will be no tax collection expenditure for the Governments and no tax compliance cost for the people. Yet, the tax revenues from only single tax called “TOP Tax”, collected by banks, will be 30 to 40% more when compared to tax revenues accrued from all taxes in the present tax system.
H27|Do Tourism Receipts Contribute to the Sustainability of Current Account Deficits: A Case Study of Barbados|Given Barbados’ recent history of persistent current account deficits and reliance on tourism as a major source of foreign exchange and driver of the economy, this paper investigated the contribution of tourism receipts to the sustainability of Barbados’ current account deficits. Utilizing an inter-temporal budget approach, it was found that Barbados’ current account deficits were weakly sustainable as a result of tourism’s contribution, underscoring the island’s dependence on the industry.
H27|Import tariffs enforcement with low administrative capacity|Import tariff receipts represent an important share of government revenues in many developing countries and there has recently been a surge in empirical studies showing how evasion in this field is a pervasive phenomenon. In the case of import tariffs, the tax base is the product of quantity and unit value, both of which have to be reported and need to be assessed by the custom authority during an audit. I show that when the fiscal authority has an imperfect detection technology, there is an additional incentive for the taxpayer to underdeclare, as a greater declaration in one dimension actually increases the fine when evasion in the other dimension is detected, and a tax base presenting this feature is subject to more evasion compared to a tax base that can be assessed directly. Also, when enforcement capacity is low, voluntary compliance is higher when the importer is required to declare only the total value of imports
H27|The Tobin Tax A Review of the Evidence|The debate about the Tobin Tax, and other financial transaction taxes (FTT), gives rise to strong views both for and against. Unfortunately, little of this debate is based on the now considerable body of evidence about the impact of such taxes. This review attempts to synthesise what we know from the available theoretical and empirical literature about the impact of FTTs on volatility in financial markets. We also review the literature on how a Tobin Tax might be implemented, the amount of revenue that it might realistically produce, and the likely incidence of the tax. We conclude that, contrary to what is often assumed, a Tobin Tax is feasible and, if appropriately designed, could make a significant contribution to revenue without causing major distortions. However, it would be unlikely to reduce market volatility and could even increase it.
H27|Innovative Financing at a Global Level|"The European Commission services published a staff working document assessing the main sources of innovative financing under discussion.

H27|Tax Policy after the Crisis: Monitoring Tax Revenues and Tax Reforms in EU Member States 2010 Report|The report is prepared jointly by DG ECFIN and DG TAXUD of the European Commission. As the previous edition, the report analyses recent trends in tax revenues and tax reforms in EU Member States. A particular focus of this year's edition is on the consequences of the global economic and financial crisis on revenue systems and the need to provide adequate policy responses. Given the size of the budgetary consolidation required after the crisis, a contribution from the revenue side will be necessary in many countries. The report analyses how revenue increases and tax systems in general could be designed in a growth-friendly way and to what extent some of the reforms would entail a need for coordination at the EU level. Moreover, it discusses tax policy issues related to the crisis and contributes to the ongoing discussion on financial sector taxation.

H27|Taxation trends in the European Union: 2010 edition|Taxation trends in the European Union: 2010 covers the development of taxation in all 27 Members of the European Union, Iceland and Norway in a comparable format since 1995. This edition of the publication 'Taxation trends in the European Union' covers the 1995-2008 period, corresponding to the years for which national accounts data are generally available in the ESA95 format. The publication is divided into three parts. Part I reviews the major trends and developments in taxation in the Union, putting it into perspective with economic activity. Part II presents the economic classification of taxes and conducts a comparison of implicit tax rates between Member States. Part III contains 29 country chapters, which review the main trends in the development of the overall tax burden and give an overview of the tax system and of the main recent policy changes. This year's edition of the Taxation trends in the European Union appears two years from the start of a global recession, which has brought forth a wide range of tax policy measures. The measures up to spring 2010 are synthesised and quantified in a box in the report.
H27|The Coinages and Monetary Policies of Henry VIII (r. 1509-1547): Contrasts between Defensive and Aggressive Debasements|The renown or infamy of Henry VIII's Great Debasement (1542 - 1553), which the government of his successor, Edward VI, continued for another six years after his death, has unfairly obscured his earlier and far more modest coinage changes and public-spirited monetary policies. Furthermore, despite the renown of and the ample literature devoted to the Great Debasement this unusual episode in early-modern monetary history still lacks a fully accurate exposition and explanation. For example, did it begin in 1542 or 1544? How did it work, and why and how did it prove to be successful or profitable'. This study seeks to provide such an accurate exposition and explanation, and thus to provide a proper contrast with Henry VIII's earlier coinage changes and monetary policies while also providing a brief comparison with those of Edward IV, whose debasements of 1464-65 were the last undertaken before those of Henry VIII. The subject of coinage debasements remains an arcane subject, ill understood not only by students of European history but also by many of the historians and economists who have published on topics in monetary history. A major problem is that historians have not clearly asked one fundamental question: were debasements fundamentally aggressive or defensive in nature? The second question to be asked is the nature of the goals sought from debasement: were they fundamentally monetary or fiscal? The fiscal aspect of coinage debasements is derived from the fact that in pre-modern western Europe minting was a princely or government monopoly from which the prince or government derived a fee known as seigniorage. The central thesis of this study is that aggressive' coinage debasements were undertaken primarily as fiscal policies to increase mint profits: profits from an increased mint output and from a increased seigniorage rate. In most, of not all cases, the fiscal motive was to finance warfare, even if indirectly. As this study shows, aggressive coinage debasements worked best if the offending mint could lure coinage and bullion from not only domestic but also foreign sources. Since neighbouring lands were thus affected and afflicted by such coinage debasements, their rulers were so often forced to respond with retaliatory if purely defensive coinage debasements, to protect their own mints and also their domestic money supplies from the effects of Gresham's Law. Indeed, some variant of Gresham's Law can be found as an excuse for coinage debasements in western Europe, especially from the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries so that it is often difficult to tell from an ordinance whether a debasement is aggressive or defensive. The other defensive aspect of such coinage debasement was the consequence of long-term wear and tear', clipping', sweating', counterfeiting, and other factors that over time diminished the mean precious metal contents of the circulating coinage. The result was that legal-tender coins lost their agio over bullion an agio justified by circulating coins at tale', rather than measuring them, thus saving on transaction costs. The loss of that agio prevented bullion from being delivered to the mints; and the consequences were another variant of Gresham's Law (as examined in this paper). In sum this paper explains why Henry VIII's two related coinage debasements of August and November 1526 were purely defensive, and as such monetary policies, while the Great Debasement was an aggressive fiscal policy, and one highly effective in financing Henry VIII's wars with France and Scotland. The Great Debasement was not, however, medieval England's only aggressive debasement, for the same can be shown of Edward IV's debasements of 1464-65. The proof for these assertions lies in the mint accounts and the evidence for the mintage fees: low with purely defensive debasements; high with aggressive debasements (a factor that would not have been true if aggressive debasements were monetary in their motivations). Finally, this study also presents proof that the extent of inflation during the Great Debasement (1542-1553) was less than that anticipated by monetary formulae, so that inflation did not nullify the merchants' gains from spending debased coins (a reason some have cited to challenge the logic and utility of medieval coinage debasements).
H27|Voluntary giving and economic growth: Time series evidence for the US|This study analyzes the sensitivity of US giving to both business cycle fluctuations and trend growth. With tax revenues as a point of reference, US giving constitutes a relatively stable source of revenue. Total giving is characterized by a business cycle volatility which is comparable to the moderate one of indirect taxes. However, this overall finding is composed of the respective sub-components' very different short-run GDP-elasticities. Individual and, to an even larger extent, corporate giving is quite sensitive to cyclical fluctuations. By contrast, foundation giving and charitable bequests tend to stabilize total giving over the business cycle. The macro estimates for the income elasticities lie in the upper band of the well researched micro-estimates. This is consistent with a social multiplier view according to which individual giving is mutually reinforcing.
H27|Trends and prospects for tax evasion|Tax evasion represents nowadays a complex economic and social phenomenon. It is also the central vector of the informal economy that proves the true amplitude of the informal plateau of the economy, being in interaction and in interdependence with the other components specific for economic and financial crime. Tax evasion phenomenon has a direct and prompt effect on the level of tax revenues, which leads directly to imbalance in market forces as well as to the illicit enrichment of the practitioners of this method of fraud affecting the state and, ultimately, each of us, honest taxpayers. Present both in the economic area and in the informal economy, where the phenomenon is widespread, tax evasion has reached in the last 19 years, in Romania, relatively large dimensions. The rise of this phenomenon in our country makes it so real that it became a daily presence in all income generating economic zones.
H27|Local Fiscal Equalization in Estonia: Is a Reform Necessary?|Estonian municipalities should perform a broad range of functions, while their fiscal resources are often limited and large disparities in fiscal capacity prevail among them. Moreover, the power to regulate fiscal affairs is mostly in the hands of the central government. We discuss how a strict application of the connexity principle can protect municipalities from the fiscal bottleneck. We also recommend the introduction of the principle of parallelism and investigate its effects on the unconditional, down-flow grant system in Estonia. In particular the procedure of determining the total sum of block grants appears to be changed.

H27|Financing transportation with land value taxes: Effects on development intensity|A significant portion of local transportation funding comes from the property tax. The tax is conventionally assessed on both land and buildings, but transportation increases only the value of the land. A more direct, efficient way to fund transportation projects is to tax land at a higher rate than buildings. The lower tax on buildings would allow owners to retain more of the profits of their investment in construction, and have the expected side effect of increased development intensity. A partial equilibrium simulation is created for Minneapolis, Richfield and Bloomington, Minnesota to determine the intensity effects of various levels of split-rate property taxes for both residential and nonresidential development. The results indicate that split-rate taxes would lead to higher density for both types of development in all three cities.
H27|Value Capture for Transportation Finance|As vehicles become more fuel-efficient and overall levels of travel stagnate in response to increases in fuel prices, conventional sources of revenue for transportation finance such as taxes on motor fuels have been put under increasing pressure. One potential replacement as a source of revenue is a set of policies collectively referred to as value capture policies. In contrast to fuel taxes and other instruments that impose charges on users of transportation networks, value capture policies seek to generate revenue by extracting a portion of the gains in the value of land that result from improvements to transportation networks. In this paper we identify a set of eight policies that contain elements of the value capture approach. These policies include land value taxes, tax increment financing, special assessments, transportation utility fees, development impact fees, negotiated exactions, joint development, and air rights. We evaluate each of the policies according to four criteria: efficiency, equity, sustainability (in terms of revenue adequacy and stability), and feasibility. The value capture concept is placed within a more general framework of transportation finance that emphasizes the relationship between different types of charges and groups of beneficiaries from transportation investments.
H27|Konzessionsabgaben und Länderfinanzausgleich|In Germany, local authorities charge supply companies with concession dues on gas, water, and electricity (Konzessionsabgaben), which are similar to some local taxes (e.g., local business tax, real property tax). Because these local taxes have already been included in the German fiscal equalization system, concession dues should be treated alike in the future. Also the importance of concession dues in revenue terms is an additional for this: concession dues amount to 1.9 bn. euro compared to real property tax of typ A of 0.3 bn. euro. However, if concession dues are treated as local taxes, payments in the fiscal equalization system may be strategically manipulated. The paper is organized as follows. First, concession dues and their effects on the payments in the fiscal equalization system will be described. Then I will have a look at the aforementioned strategic behaviour and analyze its effects on the payments within the fiscal equalization system. Last I will discuss ways to contain strategic behaviour using the example of the so-called city-states (Stadtstaaten). Copyright Springer-Verlag 2009

H27|Warfare, Liquidity Crises, and Coinage Debasements in Burgundian Flanders, 1384 - 1482: Monetary or Fiscal Remedies?|Coinage debasements were a prevalent and generally very harmful feature of most economies in late-medieval western Europe, and most certainly in Burgundian Flanders (1384-1482). Flanders also experienced several economic recessions or contractions from three related sources: warfare; the so-called ï¿½bullion faminesï¿½, with liquidity crises; and the irredeemable decline of its former mainstay, the woollen textile industries. Since many of my previous publications dealt with the Flemish cloth industry, this paper focuses on the other two major economic problems, of which warfare was the most important factor. The question posed therefore is simply this: did the Burgundian dukes undertake coinage debasements principally as a monetary or as a fiscal policy? In a recent and highly praised monograph, Sargent and Velde (The Big Problem of Small Change, 2002) have contended that almost all late-medieval and early-modern coinage debasements were undertaken to remedy not just coin shortages, but especially shortages of petty or billon coins. For the Burgundian era, one may make a strong prima facie case that Flanders (and all the Burgundian Low Countries) suffered from two major ï¿½bullion faminesï¿½, or certainly from severe coinage scarcities, including very severe scarcities of petty coins: from the 1390s to about 1415, and from the early 1440s to the early 1470s. In both periods, moreover, Flanders suffered from very severe deflations. In this paper, I contend that warfare was indeed, directly and indirectly, a primary cause of those monetary scarcities, especially in reducing the income velocity of money and thus in increasing hoarding ï¿½ in my view, far more important than any supposed balance of payments deficits and ï¿½bullion outflows to the Eastï¿½. Nevertheless, I can find no convincing evidence that the Burgundian rulers ever undertook coinage debasements to remedy these coinage scarcities and to combat deflation (with one minor exception, in 1457, for petty coins). Instead, the thesis of this paper is that the Burgundian rulers undertook coinage debasements primarily as aggressive fiscal policies, and primarily to finance warfare. Almost all medieval princes exacted a seigniorage tax on bullion minted. They sought to maximize these revenues both by increasing this tax rate and by enticing much larger quantities of bullion into their mints: by both the techniques of debasement and by auxiliary bullionist policies. The paper seeks to show that the Flemish coinage debasements were generally successful, by satisfying three conditions: (1) that merchants delivering bullion to the mints received in return a greater number and greater face value of coins than before (and a greater value than from any competing mints); (2) that the public continued to accept debased, or more debased, coins at nominal face value, receiving them by ï¿½taleï¿½ rather than by weight and intrinsic value; and (3) that such merchants, also benefitting from asymmetric information, were able to spend their new coins before their gains were eroded by inflation. This paper demonstrates that the inflationary consequences from Flemish coinage debasements were always less than would be predicted from strictly mathematical formula for price changes ï¿½ perhaps because the debasements did not counteract the prevailing forces of monetary contraction and deflation. At the same time, however, because so many principalities then pursued coinage debasements as veritable guerres monï¿½taires, many princes undertook coinage debasements for purely defensive reasons: to protect their domestic mints from foreign competition and their realms from influxes of foreign debased and especially counterfeit imitations: i.e., to counteract Greshamï¿½s Law. This study concludes with a striking anomaly in Spanish monetary history: Spanish monarchs, having agreed to abjure and forgo seigniorage taxes on coinage, did not engage in any debasements, of either the gold or silver coinages, from 1497 to 1686. But they had the luxury of alternative revenues from taxes on imports of vast quantities of silver from the Spanish Americas during most of this era. The Burgundian dukes had no such alternative sources of revenue to finance their wars.
H27|Coinage and Monetary Policies in Burgundian Flanders during the late-medieval 'Bullion Famines',. 1384 - 1482|This paper seeks to answer two questions: were the coinage debasements in Burgundian Flanders (1384-1482) undertaken principally as monetary or fiscal policies; and were they beneficial or harmful? In a recent monograph, Sargent and Velde (Big Problem of Small Change: 2002) contend that monetary objectives governed almost all medieval, early-modern debasements, especially to remedy the chronic shortages of petty coins. Despite overwhelming evidence that Burgundian Flanders, along with most of north-west Europe in the later 14th and 15th centuries, experienced severe monetary scarcities and liquidity crises, especially in the periods ca. 1390 - ca. 1415 and ca. 1440 - ca. 1470, both periods of severe deflations, eras commonly known as ï¿½bullion faminesï¿½, there is no compelling evidence that the Burgundian rulers debased their coinages on the basis of any such monetary policies. My thesis is that the Burgundian rulers of Flanders, in competition with neighboring princes, undertook their debasements primarily as aggressive fiscal policies, specifically to finance warfare. Their goal was to increase their seigniorage revenues, the tax imposed on bullion brought to their mints, by two means: by increasing the tax rate itself, and by enticing an increased influx of bullion into their mints, both by the debasement techniques themselves and by auxiliary bullionist policies. Those policies were successful so long as three conditions were met: (1) that merchants supplying bullion received more coins of the same face value and thus with a greater aggregate money-of-account value than before (or than from other mints); (2) that the public accepted such debased coins at the same face value, by tale; and (3) that the merchants spent their increased supply of coins quickly, before any ensuing inflation eroded those gains. This study further demonstrates that the inflationary consequences of debasements were always less than those predicted by mathematical formulae ï¿½ possibly because those debasements failed to counteract the prevailing forces of monetary contraction and deflation. Because so many princes pursued similar fiscal policies, many others engaged in debasement for purely defensive reasons: to protect their mints from foreign competition and to protect their domestic money supplies from influxes of debased and also counterfeit imitations: i.e., to counteract Greshamï¿½s Law. If many debasements were retaliatory measures against a neighbourï¿½s bullionist policies, those policies in general, and not just debasements, were also products of late-medieval warfare, which was also the primary culprit responsible for periodic monetary contractions: by impeding coinage circulations and bullion flows, and by provoking increased hoarding. The answer to the final question is that debasements were usually far more harmful than beneficial. Note that this is an extensively revised and shortened version of an earlier working paper (no. 355), correcting some errors in that paper (concerning Spanish coinage): with the same tables, but with a new set of graphs,
H27|Gambling at Lucky Stores: Empirical Evidence from State Lottery Sales|"We show that the week after selling a large-prize Texas Lotto winning ticket, a retailer experiences a 12 to 38 percent relative increase in ticket sales. Some increase persists for up to 40 weeks. We document that the sales response increases with jackpot size and is larger in areas with more economically disadvantaged populations. Sales patterns across games and across retailers are not consistent with most advertising explanations. Furthermore, response patterns are not consistent with representativeness-based explanations for the hot hand or gambler's fallacy; we suggest an alternative explanation for the observed ""lucky store"" effect.

H27|Sintetiche considerazioni qualificatorie in ordine alla dismissione dei beni immobili pubblici mediante cartolarizzazione ai sensi del D.L. 25 settembre 2001, n. 351|Sintetiche considerazioni qualificatorie in ordine alla dismissione dei beni immobili pubblici mediante cartolarizzazione ai sensi del D.L. 25 settembre 2001, n. 351 - The securitization of governmental real estate is the object of a renewed and intense interest, mainly on the plan of economical and financial policy, as it is a fundamental instrument in order to find liquid assets for public finance. Nonetheless this particular structured finance process sets intricate problems of qualification, which necessarily influence the concrete configuration of the process of securitization de quo and, at the same time, the modality and typologies of legal actions which can be undertaken by the subjects of securitization. The present essay analyses in detail the ontology of the securitization of governmental real estate, assessing the fiduciary nature of the property right upon the real estate, sold to SPV (special purpose vehicle) or, better, SPC (special purpose company); then the private or public characterization of this particular kind of companies and, consequently, of the their acts and transactions and, moreover, the disposition of the public interests to conform the ontology and the teleology of the complex process of securitization of governmental real estates.

H27|The Revenue Effects of Uganda’s Tax Reforms, 1989-2008|The Revenue Effects of Uganda’s Tax Reforms, 1989 - 2008 focuses on the link between tax reforms and revenue mobilization. It explores the options available for policy-makers on revenue mobilization in Uganda and tackles fundamental policy questions about what measures could result into fast revenue growth for Uganda, focusing on the tax reforms and macroeconomic issues. The elasticity and buoyancy indexes computed for the pre- and post-reform periods as well as for the combined period constitute a framework through which the impact of the reforms on each index between the two periods can be discerned. The approach provides the basis for identifying the sources of fast revenue growth and/or lagging revenue growth in the tax system, and the components of revenue growth which are within or outside the control of authorities. This paper offers practical lessons for Uganda and other African countries attempting to achieve their revenue targets.
H27|The economics of casino taxation| In this article, a model of the costs of a casino is developed that focuses on the implications for economic welfare of different taxation schemes for casinos. The situation being considered is in a country where casinos cater exclusively to foreign tourists. The goal of the country is to determine the maximum amount of taxes that can be extracted from the activities of this sector under different systems of taxation. When the price of gambling is set by regulation above its competitive level, the economic losses created by excessive investment in the sector can be reduced by taxation. A turnover tax on the amount gambled can maximize both tax revenue and the economic welfare of the country. Due to administrative constraints, a number of countries rely on the taxation of the casinos' fixed assets or a combination of a turnover tax and a tax on fixed costs. The model is applied to the situation in North Cyprus. The annual economic efficiency loss from its poorly designed tax policies on casino gambling is estimated to be about 0.5% of GDP.
H27|Deregolamentazione del mercato del lavoro ed effetto Laffer: evidenza empirica dall’Italia (1997-2001) / Labour deregulation and the Laffer curve:empirical evidence from Italy (1997-2001)|According to J.M Buchanan, Laffer effects, increases in revenues produced by tax cuts that offset the fall in tax revenues the reduction caused, are delayed through time. This occurs because the demand for goods and factors of production affected by the reduction of tax rates tend to increase only through time. The delay may cause a trap because governments that plan to reduce taxes may not reap the benefits of the increased revenues in the legislature in which the policy decision was made. However, situations might occur in which the delay does not prevent governments from taking advantage already during the life of a legislature of the new tax revenues generated by the measures taken. This may be the case of tax cuts targeted specifically at supply-side areas with the highest elasticity as part of deregulatory policy that seeks to stimulate increases in demand in those areas positively impacted by a cut in tax rates. We have tested this hypothesis for the Treu reform, i.e., the Italian (centreleft) Government policy of partial deregulation of labour contracts that foresaw substantial reduction of social security contributions (SC) rates in the 1997-2001 period. The reform had positive effects not only on employment, but also on SC revenues, although with a somewhat delayed Laffer effect. The results were obtained by an econometric research whose technical details are presented in another paper. Here, we focus on the nature and effects of the Treu reform, which introduced new types of flexible labour contracts and related SC rates reductions. The results, in terms of new employment and SC revenues, are compared with the hypothetical employment and SC revenues in the absence of the reform. And they increase substantially through time. The results may throw light on the likely Laffer effects of other policies of detaxation cum deregulation such as, for instance, reduction of taxes on over-time earnings.
H27|An Econometric Analysis of the Employment and Revenue Effects of the Treu Reform in the Period 1997-2001|An employment package (EP), reducing the social security taxes (SC) and increasing labour flexibility, was introduced in Italy by the centre-left Government in 1997. We show econometrically that EP had positive effect also on the SC revenue. Using time series techniques, with data 1980-1996, we estimate a model of labour market implicitly based on the old SC regime and assess the hypothetical level of employment without EP for 1997-2001. We, thus, determine the difference between the actual SC-revenues and SC-revenues without EP. This difference results positive and increasing through time, showing a peculiar Laffer effect.
H27|Indian System of Fringe Benefits Tax|A recent controversial move by the Indian income tax authorities was the introduction of a fringe benefits tax (FBT) in 2005. Its introduction has been justified on the grounds that it taxes fringe benefits which are collectively enjoyed by employees and are in the form of facilities and amenities that are difficult to identify, segregate and apportion and tax among beneficiaries. Accordingly, the tax liability has been fixed on employers and not on employees. FBT collection data for the first two years have been analysed to gain deeper insight into reforming and fine-tuning the FBT regime. It has been found that banking and insurance, infotech and petrochemicals are some important sectors of the economy that contribute significantly to FBT collection. Further, out of the expense heads specified as the base of FBT, it was found that â€˜employee welfareâ€™, â€˜conveyanceâ€™, â€˜telephonesâ€™ and â€˜maintenance of carsâ€™ are most important in terms of collection. Evidence from statistical tests shows that the proportion of FBT collection from different heads has remained constant over the two years of its operation, even at the level of economy sectors. Other tests show that there are significant interaction effects between FBT heads and economy sectors. However, statistical evidence shows that sample data are not homogeneous, which points towards arbitrary booking of expenses under different heads, possibly to avoid the FBT.
H27|Do College Football Games Pay for Themselves? The Impact of College Football Games on Local Sales Tax Revenue|This paper analyzes the net impacts of college football games on the sales tax revenues and taxable sales of four mid-sized cities in Texas. The paper addresses the question in the title, but also asks whether state policy makers might be justified in encouraging schools in their state to play one another based on the local economic impact those games will have. In general, our evidence suggests the answer to that question is no.
H27|Taxation trends in the European Union: 2008 edition|Taxation trends in the European Union: 2008 covers the development of taxation in all 27 Members of the European Union and Norway in a comparable format since 1995. The report is organised as follows: Part I offers an overview of taxation in Europe, describing the trends in the total tax ratio, the structure of revenues by tax type, the distribution of revenues amongst government levels, and the main developments in the rates of the personal and corporate income tax. Part II focuses on taxation of consumption, labour, and capital, as well as on environmental taxation. Part III consists of 28 Country Chapters illustrating, for each Member State (and Norway), the revenue trends and supplying a summary description of the tax system. This chapter outlines the main results from Parts I and II.
H27|Bidding for Horizontal Multinationals| We present a model in which governments bid for firms by taxing/subsidizing setup costs. Firms choose both the number and the location of the plants they operate, and the equilibrium industry structure is affected by governments' subsidy choices. We show that the endogenous presence of horizontal multinationals attenuates the race to the bottom and yields some results that run counter to traditional findings in the literature. First, in the presence of multinationals, increasing subsidies decrease firms' profits by exacerbating price competition due to more firms going multinational. Second, instead of being always subsidized, firms may actually be taxed in equilibrium. Last, subsidies may become strategically independent policy instruments, instead of being strategic complements. (JEL: F12, F23, H27, H73, R12) (c) 2008 by the European Economic Association.
H27|Economic and Political Inequality in Development: The Case of Cundinamarca, Colombia|Is inequality harmful for economic growth? Is the underdevelopment of Latin America related to its unequal distribution of wealth? A recently emerging consensus claims not only that economic inequality has detrimental effects on economic growth in general, but also that differences in economic inequality across the American continent during the 19th century are responsible for the radically different economic performances of the north and south of the continent. In this paper we investigate this hypothesis using unique 19th century micro data on land ownership and political office holding in the state of Cundinamarca, Colombia. Our results shed considerable doubt on this consensus. Even though Cundinamarca is indeed more unequal than the Northern United States at the time, within Cundinamarca municipalities that were more unequal in the 19th century (as measured by the land gini) are more developed today. Instead, we argue that political rather than economic inequality might be more important in understanding long-run development paths and document that municipalities with greater political inequality, as measured by political concentration, are less developed today. We also show that during this critical period the politically powerful were able to amass greater wealth, which is consistent with one of the channels through which political inequality might affect economic allocations. Overall our findings shed doubt on the conventional wisdom and suggest that research on long-run comparative development should investigate the implications of political inequality as well as those of economic inequality.
H27|Das georgische Steuersystem im Transformationsprozess|During the transformation process, the reform of public finances (in particular the tax system) is crucial for Georgia. There are a lot of proposals and suggestions in the financial literature concerning the introduction of tax systems in transition countries. Individual taxes or the entire tax system should be elaborated regarding certain criteria. This paper analyzes the tax reform procedures during the transition of Georgia to the free-market economy as well as the existing tax system. Concerning the taxes, the current tax system is more or less duplicated from the Western European countries. It becomes obvious that the chance of developing a rational, sustainable and adjusted tax system for transition countries was missed.

H27|The policy dilemma of economic openness and seigniorage-maximizing inflation in dollarised developing countries: The Ghanaian experience|In this paper a comprehensive framework for measuring total gross seigniorage as suggested by Neumann was employed to analyze the implications of economic openness and inflation in dollarised developing countries with special reference to Ghana within the context of an extended Cagan model. Using quarterly data, the paper examined the relationship between inflation and seigniorage for the 1996-2005 period and shows how analogous this relationship is to the popular Laffer curve comprising seigniorage generation and inflation rates for Ghana. The main findings of this study are that, in Ghana, economic openness Granger-causes inflation and dollarisation whilst seigniorage-maximizing rate of inflation varies from 102% in the short-run to 74% in the long-run. On the average, foreign currencies constitute more than one-third of the total monetary aggregates in developing countries which is a testimony of high levels of dollarisation making the effectiveness of monetary policies below par. Based on the empirical results, the paper recommends that in dollarised developing countries such as Ghana, the appropriate policy option to deepen the financial sector should not be that which focuses on arbitrary opening of the economy which has the potential of promoting dollarisation of the economy causing inflation and making monetary policy implementation ineffective. Furthermore, considering the high inflation threshold for seigniorage maximization, it would be prudent for Ghana to find an alternative source of budget finance that is non-inflationary in the long-run.
