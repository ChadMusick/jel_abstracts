F54|El papel de la economía en el proyecto decolonial|El presente trabajo aborda la globalización desde sus crisis, fases y herencias con el fin de pretender una solución a los problemas que en esta se presentan. El análisis que se lleva a cabo y la solución que se propone se realizan desde una perspectiva transdisciplinar, más allá de una simple mirada económica; es decir, desde puntos de vista como los de la filosofía, el derecho, la lingüística, la historia, la sociología, etc. Se traza un mapa general de la teoría decolonial con el estudio de conceptos como colonialidad del poder, eurocentrismo, epistemología, matriz colonial del poder, colonialidad del ser, transmodernidad, gubernamentalidad, etc., en conexión con la historia económica y la transformación social que esta conlleva. A partir del análisis histórico-económico de la globalización, la importancia de la institucionalidad, del Estado y de las formas de gobierno en este proceso, se llega a un aporte desde la economía a este proyecto, fundamentado en la libertad y en el desarrollo de los individuos y su contexto social, esto es, en relación con su propia realidad. *** This paper addresses globalization from its crisis, phases and inheritances in order to seek a solution to the problems that arise in it. The analysis and the proposed solution are made from a transdisciplinary perspective, beyond the simple economic view; that is to say, from viewpoints such as philosophy, law, linguistics, history, sociology, etc. A general map of the colonial theory is drawn to the study of concepts such as coloniality of power, Eurocentrism, epistemology, colonial matrix of power, coloniality of being, postmodernity, governmentality, etc., in connection with economic history and social transformation that this entails. From the historical-economic analysis of globalization, the importance of institutionalism, State and forms of government in this process, it is possible to get a contribution from the economy to this project, based on freedom and the development of individuals and their social context, that is to say, in relation to their own reality.
F54|Subordinate financialization in emerging capitalist economies|In the explosion of literature on financialization, there is a much smaller but growing interest in what the phenomenon means for emerging capitalist economies (ECEs). We hold that for agents located in ECEs, the encounter with financialization is from a subordinate position: first, in relation to global production, ECE firms occupy subordinate locations in global production networks, providing cheap labor and raw, or at best, intermediate inputs; Second, in relation to global finance, ECEs are structurally subordinated to ACEs, that is, both trade and the most liquid capital markets are denominated in the currency of ACEs. Subordination in production means firms based in ECEs are able to capture less of the value created than firms higher in the hierarchy and must pay more to hedge macroeconomic risk. In circulation, strategies may emerge in ACEs wherein increased household indebtedness and/or asset market inflation maintain aggregate demand. In finance, ECEs’ subordinate position in relation to money and capital markets means that capital inflows are predominantly short-term, seeking financial yields rather than assuming productive risk. The results are continued volatility, external vulnerability and subordination to the currencies of the ACEs, which themselves serve to further deepen domestic financialization. We conclude that, while by no means pre-destined, financialization as experienced in ECEs may serve to further cement their subordinate position in the global structure.
F54|Has China replaced colonial trade?|Abstract China is often suspected of taking over the extraordinary trade relationships that former colonies had within colonial empires. Besides preferential bilateral relationships built after independence, the two other potential determinants of the increase in trade with China are the improvement in China’s export capacity and the natural redirection caused by independence. We investigate and quantify the three reasons that explain the level of former colonies’ trade flows with China. Using structural gravity equations, we show that methodological issues can be largely responsible for displaying and estimating abnormally high trade levels between former colonies and China. Increased trade between these pairs of countries is the result of unilateral factors rather than more intense bilateral preferences. We then measure the reorientation of trade flows from former colonies’ metropoles towards China and show that independence has produced the expected redistribution: trade flows with China would be 15 $$\%$$ % lower, had former colonies not become independent.
F54|The impact of Brexit on Francophone Africa|Whereas the impact of Brexit on Anglophone Africa was a major issue in the controversial British discussions on the pros and cons of Brexit, possible repercussions on French-speaking Africa have been rarely mentioned up to now. If at all, mostly indirect general effects were declared, both concerning the former British Empire in Africa and a fortifori for the former French colonies as well. Yet, the range of possible Brexit effect is impressive. It spreads from direct influence on farm-gate cocoa-prices in the CFA-currency regions and subsequent percussions on the state budget of these countries, over more indirect effects, e.g. on the cooperation between CEMAC, WAEMU and the EU concerning EDF-programs of which Great Britain has been a major contributor so far, as well as enforced re-negotiation of controversial EPAs, to the revival of progressive social networks in Francophone Africa. The latter are already demanding more political and economic sovereignty, for example with respect to the increasingly anachronistic F CFA currency. Yet, in view of the lack of countervailing power of Britain within the EU in the case of Brexit, the murky network of Françafrique could be re-vitalized and consolidated as well. Besides, there could develop also direct effects of the Brexit. For example, on coca-farmers in Francophone West Africa, because their product is traditionally traded in Pound Sterling. Thus, any fall in the value of the Pound Sterling against the Euro once Britain leaves the EU would have damaging consequences, not only for the producers but also for public finances, because cocoa is priced in Sterling and the CFA franc is linked to the Euro. This impacts also on the revival of the long-standing controversy on the ill-adapted and increasingly anachronistic F CFA. African activists already demand a genuine African debate and a referendum on these issues similar to the Brexit vote.
F54|Senegal: Presidential elections 2019 - The shining example of democratic transition immersed in muddy power-politics|Whereas Senegal has long been sold as a showcase of democracy in Africa, including peaceful political alternance, things apparently changed fundamentally with the Senegalese presidentials of 2019 that brought new configurations. One of the major issues was political transhumance that has been elevated to the rank of religion in defiance of morality. It threatened political stability and peace. In response, social networks of predominantly young activists, created in 2011 in the aftermath of the Arab Spring focused on grass-roots advocacy with the electorate on good governance and democracy. They proposed a break with a political system that they consider as neo-colonialist. Moreover, Senegal’s justice is frequently accused to be biased, and the servility of the Constitutional Council which is in the first place an electoral court has often been denounced.
F54|Krieg, Frieden und Mediation - eine wettkampftheoretische Perspektive<BR>[War, Peace and Mediation - a Contest Theory Perspective]|Since the Refugee Crisis and the subsequent focus on combating the causes of migration, efforts to promote the peaceful resolution of armed conflicts have gained in importance and urgency, both in Germany and at the international level. Since 2016, the German Federal Government has significantly increased its commitment to the prevention, stabilization and termination of civil wars. Based on the economic theory of contests, this paper outlines options for how third parties can support peaceful resolution of armed conflicts. In contest theory, peace is interpreted as a stationary equilibrium of military capabilities of the warring parties. The transition from war to peace is either (1) a result of the individual rationality of the parties (endogenous peace) and, depending on the military configuration, can take place with or without the involvement of a mediator (passive mediation), or (2) the result of a targeted intervention of a third party in the calculus of (at least) one of the conflict parties (exogenous peace; active mediation). A contest theory analysis provides new insights into the value of third parties in the transition from war to peace. According to the analysis, (3) passive mediation can be used in 25% of all conceivable military configurations. (4) The 'mutually hurting stalemate' proposed in the mediation literature as a prerequisite for peace negotiations is an absolute exception (2.7%). (5) Passive mediation is much more likely in situations of 'one-sided weakness' (11.1%). To be effective (6) a passive mediator must dispose of immaterial resources such as impartiality, discretion and credibility. (7) Active mediation can be used in the remaining 75% of all conceivable military configurations. (8) To be effective, an active peace broker must have significant material resources (finances, military capabilities, private information). For potential active mediators with limited resources, cooperation with powerful fourth parties could be an attractive option.
F54|L'impact du Brexit sur l'Afrique francophone<BR>[The impact of Brexit on Francophone Africa]|ABSTRACT: Whereas the impact of Brexit on Anglophone Africa was a major issue in the controversial British discussions on the pros and cons of Brexit, possible repercussions on French-speaking Africa have been rarely mentioned up to now. Yet, the range of possible Brexit effect is impressive, including the revival of progressive social networks in Francophone Africa.

Yet, in view of the lack of countervailing power of Britain within the EU in the case of Brexit, the murky network of Françafrique could be re-vitalized and consolidated as well. Finally, the Brexit and its spread-effects could also impact negatively on acquired human rights, both in Europe and in Africa. The withdrawal in general will have widely disregard implications for hitherto shared ethics. In fact, the Brexit constitutes a retrograde step in promoting a political and socio-cultural climate which could become similar to that of Apartheid South Africa. This includes the pursuit of ultranationalist goals and compromising on established human rights, for example with respect to growing inequality and the crusade against infidels and outsiders. More generally, the Brexit will also impact negatively on acquired ethics concerning popular articipation, both in Europe and in Africa.
F54|The ethics of African regional and continental integration|The decision of African leaders on the creation of an African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) in 2018 was not merely a political decision with economic implications. It has significant and complex ethical dimensions too. This, not only concerning a possible trade-off between economic growth and well-being, employment, remittances, corruption, the depletion of natural resources and related ecological and gender problems. AfCFTA will also impact harmfully on growing xenophobia, nationalism and populism, the likely outcome of growing capital and labour mobility.

Sie hat auch bedeutende und komplexe ethische Dimensionen. Dies betrifft nicht nur einen möglichen Kompromiss zwischen Wirtschaftswachstum und Wohlergehen, Beschäftigung, Rücküberweisungen, Korruption, Erschöpfung der natürlichen Ressourcen und damit verbundenen ökologischen und geschlechtsspezifischen Problemen. Die AfCFTA wird sich auch nachteilig auf die Zunahme von Fremdenfeindlichkeit, Nationalismus und Populismus auswirken, die sich wahrscheinlich aus der Zunahme der Kapital- und Arbeitskräftemobilität ergibt.
F54|The impact of the EU-MERCOSUR deal on Africa in times of growing protectionism|ABSTRACT & RÉSUMÉ & ZUSAMMENFASSUNG : The EU-Mercosur deal of 2019 was heralded as a milestone of free trade agreements worldwide in times of growing protectionism and nationalism. Critics condemned deficient ecological and sanitary standards as well as persistent non-tariff barriers to trade. The EU farm lobby complained about a sell-out of European interests in advantage of dominating multinationals. However, the fatal repercussions of the deal on Africa have rarely been mentioned. They include increasing cut-throat competition and asymmetrical partnership to the detriment of the African poor. Given the additional destructive impact of the Brexit crisis, African governments should use their increased bargaining power vis à vis the EU27 and the UK, in times of stiffening competition concerning the EU’s Africa trade with new global players such as China and India, to enforce EPAs re-negotiations on a level playing field. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- RÉSUMÉ : L'accord de 2019 entre l'UE et le Mercosur a été qualifié de jalon dans les accords de libre-échange dans le monde entier à une époque de protectionnisme et de nationalisme grandissants.

Le lobby agricole de l'UE s'est plaint de la vente d'intérêts européens au profit de multinationales dominantes. Cependant, les répercussions fatales de l'accord sur l'Afrique ont rarement été mentionnées. Ils incluent une concurrence acharnée et un partenariat asymétrique au détriment des pauvres en Afrique. Compte tenu de l'impact destructeur supplémentaire de la crise du Brexit, les gouvernements africains devraient utiliser leur pouvoir de négociation accru vis-à-vis de l'UE27 et du Royaume-Uni, en période de durcissement de la concurrence concernant le commerce africaine de l'UE avec des nouveaux acteurs mondiaux tels que la Chine et l'Inde, pour imposer des renégociations des APEs sur un pied d’égalité. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ZUSAMMENFASSUNG : Das Abkommen zwischen der EU und dem Mercosur von 2019 wurde als Meilenstein für weltweite Freihandelsabkommen in Zeiten wachsenden Protektionismus und Nationalismus eingeläutet.

F54|Growing Against the Background of Colonization? Chinese Labor Market and FDI in a Historical Perspective|This article investigates how the legacy of colonization shapes the impact of inward FDI on employment in the Chinese labor market. The analysis utilizes provincial panel on overall employment and employment in the service sector during 2006-15. We find that inward FDI significantly promotes employment and that this relationship is stronger in regions once colonized by Western countries. Conversely, regions with a legacy of Japanese colonization display a weaker, and even negative, relationship between FDI and employment. These findings are robust to controlling for the length and intensity of colonization, as well as for endogeneity of FDI.
F54|The context of conflict resolution - international relations and the study of peace and conflict|This paper provides a brief review of almost one century of academic research within the discipline of International Relations with a focus on the thinking about Peace and Conflict and its links to approaches in Conflict Resolution. The framework of analysis is based on the definition of science, what is studied and how it is studied, which delimits the analysis into the four debates in IR: between 1919 and the 1940s, the idealist versus realist debate; in the 1950s and 1960s, the traditionalist versus behaviourist debate; in the 1970s and 1980s, the inter-paradigm debate, and, since the 1990s, the rationalist versus reflectivist debate. This paper identifies how the classical conception of security centred on the state, the military and external threats was broadened by different approaches to include other actors (individuals, groups, societies, civilizations), other sectors (economic, political, social, environmental) and internal threats. In tandem, it maps the epistemological and sometimes ontological challenges to positivism and rationalism found in (Neo) Realism, (Neo) Liberalism and Marxism, by a set of post-positivist and reflective theories or approaches, such as the cases of Human Security, Feminism, Post-structuralism, Constructivism, Post-Colonialism, Critical Studies, and the Copenhagen School. The emergence and development of all these theories and approaches are historically contextualized alongside developments of Conflict Resolution approaches.

F54|The Economics of Missionary Expansion: Evidence from Africa and Implications for Development|One of the most powerful cultural transformations in modern history has been the dramatic expansion of Christianity outside Europe. Recent, yet extensive, literature uses Christian missions established during colonial times as a source of exogenous variation to study the long-term effects of religion, human capital and culture in Africa, the Americas and Asia. We argue that the endogeneity of missionary expansion may be underestimated, thus questioning the link between missions and economic development. Using annual panel data on missions from 1751 to 1932 in Ghana as well as cross-sectional data on missions for 43 sub-Saharan African countries in 1900 and 1924, we show that: (i) locational decisions were driven by economic factors, as missionaries went to healthier, safer, and more accessible and developed areas, privileging the best locations first; (ii) these factors may spuriously explain why locations with past missions are more developed today, especially as most studies rely on historical mission atlases that tend to only report the best mission locations. Our study identifies factors behind the spatial diffusion of religion. It also highlights the risks of omission and endogenous measurement error biases when using historical data and events for identification.
F54|The Napoleonic Wars: A Watershed in Spanish History?|The Napoleonic Wars had dramatic consequences for Spain’s economy. The Peninsular War had higher demographic impact than any other military conflict, including civil wars, in the modern era. Farmers suffered confiscation of their crops and destruction of their main capital asset, livestock. The shrinking demand, the disruption of international and domestic trade, and the shortage of inputs hampered industry and services. The loss of the American colonies, a by-product of the French invasion, seriously harmed absolutism. In the long run, however, the Napoleonic Wars triggered the dismantling of Ancien Régime institutions and interest groups. Freed from their constraints, the country started a long and painful transition towards the liberal society. The Napoleonic Wars may be deemed, then, a watershed in Spanish history.

F54|Rethinking odious debt in the age of predatory lending: Old ideas for new problems|This essay suggests that odious debt needs a restatement to stay relevant in the face of important changes affecting state (i.e. “sovereign”) debt. Today, a major issue affecting creditor-debtor relations in the sovereign sector is the predicament of over-lending. Examples abound of reckless creditors pressuring vulnerable states to borrow for projects they do not need and at conditions they do not fully understand. This development, which recalls the aggressive business tactics used by predatory lenders in consumer lending, has become a ubiquitous problem affecting both developing and developed nations. Yet, this problem remains largely unaccounted for in international law and in the odious debt doctrine in particular. The future of odious debt depends upon a collective endeavor to make the legal doctrine more sensitive to issues of predatory lending. This essay offers insights into the benefits that such efforts may yield on states and their creditors.

F54|The French Curse? On the Puzzling Economic Consequences of French Colonization|More than 50 years after independence, the majority of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa remain poor with limited rates of economic growth. One of the most striking features of economic development on the sub-Saharan subcontinent is the remarkably poor performance of French colonies relative to British ones. While British and French colonies had similar GDP per capita shortly after independence, their economic trajectories have increasingly diverged, with particularly large gaps in the post-2000 period. Neither measures of human capital, geography nor measures of institutional quality appear to explain this gap, suggesting that colonialism affected deeper societal factors that are crucial for economic growth but that are not captured in standard macroeconomic variables.
F54|Regional disintegration in South Asia : evidence from the end of the British Empire on maritime networks|In the early 20th century, the British Empire primarily governed South Asia, and these regions shared similar administrations, institutions and commercial practices. After the Second World War, decolonization in South Asia became evident through the partition of India and countries gaining independence. These subsequent events can be seen as regional disintegration, and they offer a potential scope for examining the impacts of such institutional changes on maritime transport networks. By examining a new database detailing vessel movement between South Asian ports and the rest of the world from 1890 to 2000, we explore how maritime transport networks evolved in South Asia. Specifically, we compare the trends of shipping routes among ports before and after 1947. Applying the methodology developed by Redding, Sturm, and Wolf (2011) and Xu and Itoh (2017), we show that regional disintegration clearly lowered vessel movements for the routes that became international after 1947. Additionally, we examine two points; relationship with UK, and the independence of Bangladesh. For most of the cases, we find significantly negative impacts on vessel movements directly affected by regional disintegration.
F54|Togo - 2017: domestic politics, foreign affairs and socio-economic development|ABSTRACT & RÉSUMÉ & ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: The demand for political alternance, initiated by institutional and electoral reforms, constituted the major contentious issue between the government and the challengers of the Gnassingbé regime throughout the year. Civil society organizations and representatives of the Christian church supported the demands of the opposition. The protest of the notorious divided opposition took a new momentum since August with the lead by a hitherto hardly known opposition party and its charismatic leader, Tikpi Atchadam. He organized huge demonstrations of all the 14 opposition parties in the second half of the year which put the government progressively under pressure. Foreign affairs were dominated by the impact of increased aid by the international donor community. Socio-economic development was marked by diminishing human development and economic freedom. ------------------------------------------------------------ RÉSUMÉ: La demande d'alternance politique, initiée par des réformes institutionnelles et électorales, constitue le principal contentieux entre le gouvernement et les challengers du régime Gnassingbé tout au long de l'année. Les organisations de la société civile et les représentants de l'église chrétienne ont soutenu les demandes de l'opposition. La protestation de l'opposition divisée notoire a pris un nouvel élan depuis le mois d'août avec à sa tête un parti d'opposition jusqu'alors méconnu et son leader charismatique, Tikpi Atchadam. Il a organisé d'énormes manifestations de l'ensemble des 14 partis d'opposition au cours de la seconde moitié de l'année, ce qui a mis le gouvernement sous pression. Les affaires étrangères ont été dominées par l'impact de l'aide accrue de la communauté internationale des donateurs. Le développement socio-économique a été marqué par la diminution du développement humain et de la liberté économique. ------------------------------------------------------------ ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: Die Forderung nach politischer Alternanz, initiiert durch institutionelle und Wahlreformen, war das größte Streitthema zwischen der Regierung und den Herausforderern des Gnassingbé-Regimes während des ganzen Jahres. Zivilgesellschaftliche Organisationen und Vertreter der christlichen Kirche unterstützten die Forderungen der Opposition. Der Protest der zerstrittenen Opposition nahm ab August mit der Führung einer bisher kaum bekannten Oppositionspartei und ihres charismatischen Führers Tikpi Atchadam eine neue Dynamik an. Er organisierte in der zweiten Jahreshälfte große Demonstrationen aller 14 Oppositionsparteien, die die Regierung zunehmend unter Druck setzten. Auswärtige Angelegenheiten waren von den Auswirkungen der verstärkten Hilfe der internationalen Gebergemeinschaft geprägt. Die sozioökonomische Entwicklung war von abnehmender menschlicher Entwicklung und wirtschaftlicher Freiheit geprägt.
F54|Humanism or Racism. Pilot Project Europe at the Crossroads|This policy paper combines a large number of acute contemporary problems in political economy and shows that it is possible to bring them under one broad common umbrella: The choice between humanism or racism. To do so more fine grained definitions of humanism and racism are put forward. From that theoretical perspective the possible policy options for further European Integration are discussed. It is argued that Europe could be a role model for global evolution if it is possible to overcome racism and to use diversity as a creative force. As a driving agent for such a development the emerging class of organic intellectuals is identified.
F54|Britain & Africa: heading for the Brexit rocks|High-flying illusions on the part of the proponents and grim predictions of the sceptics characterize the controversy about Brexit. The article analyses five issues at stake for the Post-Brexit relationships between Britain, the EU and Africa with a focus on the Commonwealth Sub-Saharan Africa: market access, FDI, aid, security and partnership . The British government’s vision of a ‘Global Britain’ relies heavily on a reinforced co-operation with Commonwealth nations. However, most likely this would be possible only at the expense of the poor in Africa and elsewhere. Concerning security cooperation with Africa, London apparently exaggerated its defence input in order to enhance its bargaining position with the EU. It will be crucial for both the EU and UK to find post-Brexit agreements to stem irregular migration and the growth of jihadist groups and terrorism. In a nutshell, the analysis of these different policy field shows that expectations of Brexiteers and African politicians alike concerning an enhanced, partner-like Post-Brexit Commonwealth relationship are largely unfounded.

F54|Revisiting Vagrancy and Loitering Provisions in the Light of International Law|As part of the colonial heritage of Africa, vagrancy laws criminalising idleness and disorderliness still form part of existing legislation. These laws originated in England?s Vagrancy Act of 1824 and remain in the penal codes and by-laws (prohibiting loitering) of former British colonies. Globally, vagrancy laws subsequently became the subject of constitutional scrutiny due to their tendency to typify a specific action or inaction as illegal and to criminalize, as Ocobock notes, the ?personal condition, state of being, and social and economic status? of offenders. With the adoption of The Principles on the Decriminalisation of Petty Offences by the African Commission on Human and Peoples? Rights by the African Commission on Human and Peoples? Rights in November 2017, the reconsideration of vagrancy and loitering has become immanent to African legislators. Vagrancy laws are still entrenched in African penal codes stemming from the colonial era. These laws provide for the arrest of street vendors, beggars, street kids, homeless people, and sex workers. In South Africa, vagrancy legislation was used during the 19th and 20th century but the body of law has been repealed. However, petty offences are still prohibited by by-laws pertaining to issues such as nuisance, noise, street trading and littering in a city. In particular, petty offences may refer to bathing or washing in public; urinating or defecating in public; using abusive or threatening language in public; drunken behaviour; fighting or acting in a riotous manner in public; and drying or spreading laundry in a public place or on a fence on the boundary of a public road. In this paper I will investigate the implications of international law (regional and other international instruments as well as soft law) in terms of the obligations created with specific focus on vagrancy and loitering provisions. These provisions are suspect because of their origin in ideologies aimed at controlling labour and space and do not reflect the commitment of member states to promote and protect human and peoples? rights. In particular, I want to focus on the provisions governing the use of public space.
F54|The Internet and the grassroots foundation of civil society in Indochina|It is widely believed that the social contract, credited to Magna Carta of Englandin the 13th century and subsequent thinkers such as Thomas Hobbes, JohnLocke, is the major factor that has empowered the concept of civil society in theworld, starting from the West. This perspective paper suggests that althoughthat still holds to a large extent, the case of Indochina shows a diametrical, andunnatural, difference as civic engagement in social matters of deep influence wasborn out of the state’s necessity to tolerate diverging voices, either bycontrolling, empowering or engaging, in order to cope with social conflicts. Thisobservation gives rise to the need for further studies on the nature of theinformation-power nexus in the age of big data and social networks.
F54|The Confederacy and the American Civil War, 1861-1865: Greed Or Grievance?|A contribution to the literature on the causes of civil war, specifically the American Civil War, 1861 – 1865, looking from the secessionist’s side. A model is developed allowing for the quantification of greed (retention of income flows deriving from the system of slavery) and grievance (assertion of state’s rights) as causes of Confederacy secession. War costs and preferences over how quickly war costs needed to be recouped are central in the analysis. A key finding is, even if the Confederate states did not under-estimate war costs, there was still a strong case for attempting secession to protect the economic return on slavery. While in many scenarios this makes it unnecessary to invoke willingness to pay to assert state’s rights, this too is not ruled out, but it is reasoned that greed was quantitatively the stronger motive. Given sufficient data the methodology can be applied to quantify motives in other civil wars.
F54|Britain & Africa: heading for the Brexit rocks|High-flying illusions on the part of the proponents and grim predictions of the sceptics characterize the controversy about Brexit. The article analyses five issues at stake for the Post-Brexit relationships between Britain, the EU and Africa with a focus on the Commonwealth Sub-Saharan Africa: market access, FDI, aid, security and partnership . The British government’s vision of a ‘Global Britain’ relies heavily on a reinforced co-operation with Commonwealth nations. However, most likely this would be possible only at the expense of the poor in Africa and elsewhere. Concerning security cooperation with Africa, London apparently exaggerated its defence input in order to enhance its bargaining position with the EU. It will be crucial for both the EU and the UK to find post-Brexit agreements to stem irregular migration and the growth of jihadist groups and terrorism. In a nutshell, the analysis of these different policy fields shows that expectations of Brexiteers and African politicians alike concerning an enhanced, partner-like Post-Brexit Commonwealth relationship are largely unfounded.
F54|L’Angleterre, le Brexit et l’Afrique|High-flying illusions on the part of the proponents and grim predictions on the part of the sceptics have characterised the controversy around Brexit. The article assesses five key issues at stake for post-Brexit relationships between Britain, the EU, and Africa: market access, foreign direct investment (FDI), aid, security, and the nature of the partnership. The analysis focuses on those sub-Saharan African countries that belong to the Commonwealth, as the British government’s vision of a “Global Britain” relies heavily on its reinforced cooperation with Commonwealth nations. The review of potential developments in these different policy fields shows that the expectations of Brexiteers and African politicians alike concerning an enhanced, partnership-like post-Brexit Commonwealth relationship are largely unfounded. Although the post-Brexit United Kingdom will increase African countries’ choices regarding preferred trading partners, it remains questionable whether London could offer something new that other global players with increasing interest in Africa, such as China, do not already have on their agenda.
F54|Breaking Badly: The Currency Union Effect on Trade|As several European countries debate entering, or exiting, the Euro, a key policy question is how much currency unions (CUs) affect trade. Recently, Glick and Rose (2016) confirmed that currency unions increase trade on average by 100%, and that the Euro has increased trade by a still-large 50%. In this paper, we find that the apparent large impact of CUs on trade is driven by other major geopolitical events correlated with CU switches, including communist takeovers, decolonization, warfare, ethnic cleansing episodes, the fall of the Berlin Wall and the whole history of European integration. We find that moving from robust standard errors to multi-way clustered errors alone reduces the t-score of the Euro impact by 75%. Looking at individual CUs, we find that in no cases does the time series evidence support a large trade effect, and that the effect breaks particularly badly once we find suitable control groups. Overall, we find that intuitive controls and omitting the CU switches coterminous with war and missing data render the trade impact of the Euro and all CUs together statistically insignificant.
F54|Was Colonialism Fiscally Sustainable? An Empirical Examination of the Colonial Finances of Spanish America|This paper examines the long-run fiscal sustainability of the colonial finances of Spanish America. Using econometric tests of intertemporal stability and a macroeconomic budget constraint framework, the analysis revisits how the long-run fiscal dynamics of the colonial treasuries adjusted for inflation changed over time. Findings suggest that in spite of historical breakpoints associated to major financial difficulties during wartime, in general the treasuries achieved sustainable fiscal balances. However, there was a shifting pattern of fiscal sustainability between the treasuries across the colonial period.
F54|War and Conflict in Economics: Theories, Applications, and Recent Trends|We review the main economic models of war and conflict. These models vary in details, but their implications are qualitatively consistent, highlighting key commonalities across a variety of conflict settings. Recent empirical literature, employing both laboratory and field data, in many cases confirms the basic implications of conflict theory. However, this literature also presents important challenges to the way economists traditionally model conflict. We finish our review by suggesting ways to address these challenges.
F54|Colonial legacy, polarization and linguistic disenfranchisement: The case of the Sri Lankan War|We introduce a new ethnolinguistic polarization measure that takes into account the impact of historical factors on intergroup relations in Sri Lanka. During the colonial era, intergroup relations changed considerably due, in part, to the uneven spread of the English language on the island and its role in British governance. Accordingly, our measure is sensitive to regional differences in English language acquisition before independence. By using a data set on victims of terrorist attacks by district and war period during the protracted war in Sri Lanka, we find that our measure is more strongly correlated with the number of victims, and is associated with 70% more victims, on average, than is a polarization measure based on the context-independent linguistic distances between groups. Thus, the historical underpinnings of our measure illustrate in a quantitative manner the relevance of history for understanding patterns of civil conflict.
F54|Cross-border mergers and acquisitions: Evidence from the Indochina region|We study cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As) in ten countries in the Indochina region during the period 1993–2015. Countries with a French colonial history showed markedly lower levels of cross-border M&As (value as well as volume) than other countries, whether previously colonized or not. This difference persists even after accounting for the known drivers of cross-border M&A activity, including legal origin, trade openness, and labor cost levels. Together, these findings suggest that the colonial past of a country plays an important role in cross-border M&A activity.
F54|Weather shocks and agricultural commercialization in colonial tropical Africa: did cash crops alleviate social distress?|A rapidly growing body of research examines the ways in which climatic variability influence economic and societal outcomes. This study investigates how weather shocks triggered social distress in British colonial Africa. Further, it intervenes in a long-standing and unsettled debate concerning the effects of agricultural commercialization on the abilities of rural communities to cope with exogenous shocks. We collect qualitative evidence from annual administrative records to explore the mechanisms linking weather extremes to harvest failures and social distress. We also conduct econometric testing on a novel panel dataset of 143 administrative districts across west, south-central and east Africa in the Interwar Era (1920-1939). Our findings are twofold. First, we find robust evidence that rainfall anomalies (both drought and excessive precipitation) are associated with spikes in imprisonment (our proxy for social distress). We argue that the key causal pathway is the loss of agricultural income, which results in higher imprisonment for theft, unrest, debt and tax default. Second, we find that the impact of weather shocks on distress is partially mitigated by the cultivation of export crops. Our findings suggest that, even in the British colonial context, smallholder export crop cultivation led to higher private incomes as well as greater public investment. Our findings speak to a topic of considerable urgency today as the process of global climate change accelerates, generating more severe and unpredictable climatic extremes. An increased understanding and identification of adaptive and mitigating factors, would assist in targeting policy interventions and designing adaptive institutions to support vulnerable rural societies.
F54|Editorial Volume 13|Dear Reader, Those among us who have reached a certain age tend to have developed a long-term perspective and inclination to look back on individual years and to compare them for their respective blessings and injuries. In that sense, 2016 seems to take a special rank as an annus horribilis not just in my own assessment but in numerous commentaries we have come across over the past weeks. Foremost in our awareness featured the surprises: Nobody in my direct acquaintance foretold the Trump phenomenon or the Brexit decision. To find events equally unanticipated and far-reaching, one would have to go back to the 2007/8 financial crash, the 9/11 attacks, the dissolution of the USSR, or the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.
F54|Threats to Security Posed by ISIS in Syria: A Human Security Approach|The civil war in Syria coupled with the attacks by ISIS, has resulted in one of the largest humanitarian crises since World War II. Although international efforts have resulted in regaining control of important cities, these military approaches have escalated and inflamed the violence of which innocent civilians bear the consequences. The continuing violence and resulting threats or insecurities negatively affect the lives, freedom, dignity and development of the people to name but a few. For that reason, the aim is to explore the applicability of a human security approach to the conflict in Syria that focuses on, among other aspects, minimising violence, mitigating the effects of the conflict, protecting people, restoring peace and eliminating the grounds that resulted in the development of these conditions in the first place.
F54|Emerging Security Challenges to Africa: The Case of Haphazard Disposal of Pharmaceuticals in Ghana|The study of the Disposal of Unused/Unwanted Medicines Project examines ways in which medicines are disposed of in Ghana and assesses how disposal methods can impact water resources. The study showed a number of challenges: gaps in the legislative framework for the disposal of medicines; environmentally-unfriendly methods of disposal of medicines; and large quantities of medicines potentially disposed of indiscriminately with major impact on the environment. It recommends a review of the legal framework to ensure the proper disposal of all unused medicines; policies to mop up excess medicines with members of the public; review of prescribing and dispensing practices to reduce excess medicines; and further research into the types of pharmaceuticals that are present and persist in the environment, their effects and how they affect quality of life.
F54|Decentralized Despotism? Indirect Colonial Rule Undermines Contemporary Democratic Attitudes|This paper identifies indirect and direct colonial rule as causal factors in shaping support for democracy by exploiting a within-country natural experiment in Namibia. Throughout the colonial era, northern Namibia was indirectly ruled through a system of appointed indigenous traditional elites whereas colonial authorities directly ruled southern Namibia. This variation originally stems from where the progressive extension of direct German control was stopped after a rinderpest epidemic in the 1890s, and thus constitutes plausibly exogenous within-country variation in the form of colonial rule. Using this spatial discontinuity, we find that individuals in indirectly ruled areas are less likely to support democracy and turnout at elections. We explore potential mechanisms and find suggestive evidence that the greater influence of traditional leaders in indirectly ruled areas has socialized individuals to accept non-electoral bases of political authority.
F54|Dynamic Trade, Endogenous Institutions and the Colonization of Hong Kong: A Staged Development Framework|To explore the interplays between trade and institutions, we construct a staged development framework with multi-period discrete choices to study the colonization of Hong Kong, which served to facilitate the trade of several agricultural and manufactured products, including opium, between Britain and China. Based on the historical data and documents that we collected from limited sources, we design our dynamic trade model to capture several key features of the colonization process and use it to characterize the endogenous transition from the pre-Opium War era, to the post-Opium War era and then to the post-opium trade era, which span the period 1773-1933. We show that while the low opium trading cost and the high warfare cost initially postponed any military action, the high valuation of the total volume of bilateral trade, the rising opium trading cost and the anticipated increase in the demand for opium eventually led the British government to declare the Opium Wars, legalizing opium trade via the colonial Hong Kong. We also show that, in response to a drastic drop in opium demand and a rising opium trading cost, it became optimal for the British government to abandon opium trade soon after the founding of the Republic of China.

F54|Blockchains and Extra-Terrestrial Nations: Role of Blockchains in the Socio-Political Milieu of Future Extra-Terrestrial Settlements|Humanity is on the cusp of a great wave of space exploration and colonization of Extra-Terrestrial Bodies (ETB). This paper deals with the socio–political issues that may arise between Earth and E.T Settlements and the possible ways to resolve them. Firstly we discuss as to how early maritime explorations compare to present day space voyages. Based on the lessons learnt, we will analyse the socio–political relation between Earth and Extra-Terrestrial Settlements (ETS) and how some possibilities of conflicts can arise. We then evaluate as to how Blockchain systems can potentially keep earth and ETS tethered to each other and provide a way for harmonious co-existence. The paper concludes by summarizing the possible Socio–Political and Economic conflicts between Earth and future ETS and ways to resolve them.
F54|The Reality Behind the Jihad in Syria: Powers, Proxies and Mercenaries|Targeting Syria the so-called ?Soviet satellite? as a government or ?regimes? by the U.S. and the British administrations, the neighboring states with their interests in Syria: Turkey, Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar?is not new. Battling Syria goes back precisely to the 1950s the decolonization or the postcolonial period. Then main Arab countries were in line with the colonials?the time when the CIA and MI6 started conducting covert activities in Syria ranging from plans to overthrow consequent governments to assassination plots. Macmillan and Eisenhower backed assassination plot of 3 Syrian top government officials in 1957. This started the coupe de d'état-era in Syria. The strategy was to destabilize the country and conclusively install (PPAG) Puppet-Pro-American Governments. Creating such instability had been and still is being paid for by the target countries such as the Syrians who presently became uprooted and displaced. Destabilizing Syria created chaos: not only in the Middle East and Syria, but also in the entire West itself. Europe found itself forced into paying an expensive price that was not taken into account, and will still even pay more. The Western taxpayer found himself a victim of the super power?s desperate efforts of obtaining more power and securing the flow of more oil. This paper will shed light on the facts and the actors behind the Syrian scene.
F54|Transition from civil war to peace: The role of the United Nations and international community in Mozambique|With the heavy involvement of the United Nations (UN) and the international community, the Rome General Peace Agreement (GPA) of 1992 ended more than 16 years of civil war in Mozambique. The peace agreement and post-conflict initiatives by the international community was successful in transforming the Mozambique National Resistance?(Renamo) from a rebel group into a viable political party. Key components of Mozambique's success in negotiating peace and creating conditions for political stability and democracy were the provision of demobilisation before democratisation, decentralisation of humanitarian and relief efforts to provincial and district levels, financial support directly for the development of political parties and budget support to sectors relevant to peacebuilding. Though imperfect, Mozambique remains an important case study in how the UN and international community can help in post-conflict environments. Thus, the paper argues (both theoretically and empirically) that success in peacebuilding operations depends on credible and impartial international support through the UN, as opposed to 'unilateral' peacebuilding operation through a 'powerful state'.
F54|Multinational firms and the extractive sectors in the 21st century: Can they drive development?|Historically, extractive sector MNEs have been seen as an obstacle to sustainable development, because they operated in enclaves with limited local engagement. Import-substitution policies aimed to increase the local benefits of these resources, restricting FDI. Since liberalisation, extractive MNEs have re-engaged with developing countries through looser governance structures with greater potential for linkages. Despite the increased potential, few host countries have seen meaningful MNE-led development because of weak domestic firms and poor location advantages. New MNEs from emerging economies have also not shown a greater propensity to local linkages. Only countries that have continued to invest in location advantages have seen substantial benefits.
F54|Poverty and the Colonial Origins of Elite Capture: Evidence from Philippine Provinces|This paper offers new evidence on the causal link between poverty and elite capture within a democratic country. The extent of elite capture was derived from the names of 64,152 elected officials in four election cycles at the provincial and municipal levels in the Philippines. To identify the causal relationship between elite capture and poverty, this study exploits the exogenous variation in the number of churches constructed in the Philippines during the Spanish colonization period (1521-1898). These structures were built in locations where political families developed and persisted to the present. Using the number of colonial churches as an instrument in a two-stage least-squares regression, this study finds that poverty in Philippine provinces is inversely proportional to the percentage of positions controlled by elites and directly proportional to decreased competition among elites. Results are robust to the measure of poverty used as well as controlling for other plausible channels through which the presence of colonial churches may influence poverty in the Philippine provinces.
F54|Decentralized Despotism? Indirect colonial rule undermines contemporary democratic attitudes|We identify indirect and direct colonial rule as causal factors in shaping support for democracy by exploiting a within-country natural experiment in Namibia.

Using this spatial discontinuity, we ﬁnd that individuals in indirectly ruled areas are less likely to support democracy and turnout at elections.
F54|Understanding African Poverty over the Longue Durée: A Review of Africa's Development in Historical Perspective|The sixteen essays edited and synthesized by Emmanuel Akyeampong, Robert H. Bates, Nathan Nunn, and James A. Robinson contribute significantly to our understanding of the following questions: (1) When did Africa become poor? (2) Why did Africa become poor? (3) Why has Africa remained poor? Although these questions are impossible to answer in a definitive way, the partial explanations offered in this book are insightful and thought provoking and are summarized in this article. However, they also rest primarily on economic and political arguments. The importance of geography, which is mostly not explored in these essays, is reviewed in the final section of this article.
F54|Impact of Economic Partnership Agreements on Regional Integration and Trade Relations|The article briefly presents the concept and framework of regional integration in Africa. It then discusses the principles, history, and current state of negotiations to disclose the effects of EPAs on regional integration efforts in Africa. Then it analyses the trends in international trade relations between the EU and the five EPA regions in Africa for the period 2003-2013, aiming to assess if EPAs have the envisaged positive impact on trade for both the EU, the EPA regions and the participating countries. The analysis includes the direction, dynamics and commodity structure of EU trade with African EPA regions. As a conclusion, the paper presents some general questions posed by the analysis on the future development of EPAs and the trade policy of the EU towards Sub-Saharan African countries.
F54|Klimatske Promjene I Njihov Uticaj Na Zemlje Regiona|Savremene promjene i globalno zagrijavanje izazvane ljudskim aktivnostima su teme koje privlače mnogo pažnje na svim nivoima društva, kao i zainteresovanost od strane naučnika za detaljnije proučavanje. Uticaj klimatskih promjena zavisi od stope klimatskih promjena, izloženosti i osjetljivosti ekološkog i socio-ekonomskog sistema, kao i sposobnosti društva da se prilagodi tim promjenama. Procjenjuje se da će najviše štete donijeti zemljama u razvoju, jer nijesu spremne na ovakve promjene. Time se promoviše korišćenje obnovljive i čiste energije, kao i djelovanje zemalja na međunarodnom planu, a sve u cilju suzbijanja štetnih efekata klimatskih promjena. Veza između klimatskih promjena i održivog rasta je istaknuta i u mnogim međunarodnim okvirima koji su zaključeni do sada, a glavni razlog za njihovo kreiranje je borba protiv klimatskih promjena. Okvirna Konvencija UN o Klimatskim Promjenama, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) i Kjoto protokol su jedni od bitnijih okvira i njihovo glavno dostignuće je uvođenje obavezujućih mjera za smanjenje emisije gasova sa efektom staklene bašte za razvijene zemlje zajedno sa principima zajedničkih, ali različitih odgovornosti i fleksibilnih mehanizama koji se koriste da bi se označili ekološki, sociološki i ekonomski ciljevi na integrisan način. Posebna pažnja u ovom radu se daje regionu Zapadnog Balkana ili zemljama jugoistočne Evrope.
F54|Ruská Makká Moc V Baltských Krajinách (Russia’S Soft Power In The Baltic States)|Predkladaný článok sa zameriava na súčasný výskum, ktorý poukazuje na fakt, že Rusko okrem tradičných nástrojov hospodárskeho a vojenského nátlaku na Baltské štáty, rozšírilo svoje pôsobenie o nástroje mäkkej moci za účelom legitimizovania svojich záujmov v post – sovietskom priestore ako výsledok existencie veľkej rusko-jazyčnej minority.Cieľom state je predstaviť nástroje mäkkej moci na základe výskumu Joseph-a Nye-a. Článok je informatívny a predkladá finančnú, organizačnú, diplomatickú, ideologickú, legislatívnu a hospodársku analýzu, ponúkajúc tak náhľad do podstaty ruskej mäkkej moci a snažiac sa zároveň analyzovať skutočné záujmy Ruskej federácie v post – sovietskom priestore. Poukazuje na jej obmedzenosť v dôsledku jej zamerania takmer výhradne na rusko-jazyčnú menšinu. Jej pozitívom však môže byť konštruktívna kritika USA. This paper focuses on the latest researches that show apart from traditional economic pressure and military policy, Russia has extended tools of influence in the Baltic States by soft power instruments to legitimate interests in the post-Soviet space as a result of the presence of large Russian-speaking minorities. The aim of the paper is to present the soft power sources and instruments of influence with factual backup from Joseph Nye. The paper is informative and provides financial, organisational, diplomatic, ideological, legal policy and economic analysis; providing an indication into the nature of Russia’s soft power and to transpose what Russia's real intentions are to advance pressure on the post-Soviet space. The result of which; Russia’s soft power is regarded as weak due to Russia’s influence directed to a particular audience of Russian-speaking citizens only. The advantage of this influence maybe, leading the constructive opposition to the United States, amongst authoritarian regimes
F54|The culture of entrepreneurship|We study the cultural process through which a society inculcates an entrepreneurial spirit. People work for a guaranteed wage or operate a firm whose risky return depends on business expertise. The latter is culturally acquired, within the family or outside, and people may choose an occupation different from the one they were socialized into. A cultural bias towards safer occupations from colonial and post-colonial policies leads to stagnation where entrepreneurs do not upgrade technology because of their proficiency with existing methods. An aggregate productivity shock can tip this economy towards growth led by established businesses. A human capital shock where existing business expertise is less useful is more disruptive; growth occurs through the emergence of a new class of entrepreneurs. We conclude that culture is not destiny: it adapts even when some cultural traits do not.
F54|US Aid, US educated Leaders and Economic Ideology|The Unites States (US) openly promotes its economic ideology on free-markets through foreign aid. It also regards foreign education in the US as way of spreading own ideas and values among the powerful elite in developing countries. US educated aid recipient country leaders may thus receive more US aid, if they share both the cultural values and the economic ideology of the US. I test this hypothesis using a panel fixed-effects regression model for 896 leaders and 143 countries over the period from 1981 to 2010. I address self- and donor-selection biases by including leader fixed effects in the regression analysis, in addition to the country and year fixed effects. In result, I find that on average the US allocates 30 percent more bilateral aid to US educated right leaders compared to US educated left leaders. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the findings are driven by right-wing US leadership.
F54|Romania And The Eurasian Union. Plans, Predictions And Perspectives|Following the events in Ukraine, Romania might represent one of the key points for the Eurasian perspectives that have circulated in the last years in Moscow. Through our text we intend to present and to highlight the main ideas and plans of Eurasian inspiration regarding Romania, as well as the interesting predictions made, in certain moments, by some representative characters for the Eurasian paradigm, like Aleksandr Dugin, for instance, who is its main ideologist and promoter. At the same time, one must not neglect the signals of discontent from Moscow about the need of dissipating the so-called sanitary cordon of the Western powers, in which the Baltic States, Poland, and Romania are included – another aspect bearing a particular importance for understanding certain gestures, attitudes and statements related to the role and the place of the Eurasian Union.
F54|What Made Great Britain so Great? From the Fiscal-Military State to the First Industrial Revolution|Recent research in economic history casts doubts on the role played by good economic institutions in Great Britain after the 1688 Glorious Revolution. What undoubtedly emerged from the latter is a strong Fiscal-Military state under the influence of a Parliament dominated by Whigs. After presenting related empirical evidence, I develop a parsimonious model to understand how the influence of a strong military apparel on international trade can foster the implementation of more productive technologies. When this is the case, development by one country can foster de-industrialization for its trading partners, as has been the case historically in India during the 19th century.
F54|Editorial Volume 12|Dear Reader, As I write this first official reports confirm the existence of gravitational waves which Albert Einstein predicted a century ago. Ground breaking scientific discoveries such as this reaffirm to me the spatial relationships between the universe and human security issues, placing those issues into a new perspective that contrast with perspectives formed by our everyday lives. Nevertheless, for the majority of humanity, human security in its diverse manifestations remains the most significant consideration in their lives whereas the nature of gravity is hardly given a thought until such time when some clever technologist uses such a new insight and ends up revolutionising our lives.
F54|Human Security: Chinaâ€™s Discourses and Experience|This article addresses three research questions by elaborating on how the idea of human security is understood or defined by the government and social actors in China; how the distinction between the â€œprotectionâ€ aspect and â€œempowermentâ€ aspect of human security is understood and accepted; and what particular downside risks are perceived as pressing human security issues in China. Amongst these the major ones include air pollution, food security, and cyber security. The study reveals that, whilst as a term â€œhuman securityâ€ is not frequently used, there have been significant discussions leading to the consideration and implementation of various human security practices in China. The idea of human security has been firmly established and threats to human security detected. For both the government and academic community in China, human security and state security are not necessarily confrontational but can rather be combined, often complimenting each other. Recent developments in China are pointing to a positive direction in terms of human security in the country.
F54|A Review of 'New Explorations into International Relations: Democracy, Foreign Investment Terrorism and Conflict'|"Author and Scholar Seug-Whan Choi's ""New Explorations into International Relations: democracy, foreign investment, terrorism and conflict"" serves as a nexus of interdisciplinary analysis and findings rooted in evidenced based research. Indeed, the author set out to challenge and test traditional international relations (IR) theories by implementing rigorous scientific methods in an attempt to produce policy recommendations and encourage a frameshift in methodological approaches. One underlying theme that recurs throughout this work is the requirement for rigorous statistical analysis and education in the field of political science. This has already begun and a re-emphasis is encouraged and greatly welcomed."
F54|A Review of 'Law's Impunity: Responsibility and the Modern Private Military Company'|The mercenaries and mercenarism are two points of concern for scholars studying the rules of war throughout history. Both in jus ad bellum (JAB) and jus in bellum (JIB) we can find a framework of international law crafted to impede the participation of individuals motivated to take part in hostilities to get private gain. Nevertheless, paradoxically, the problem is when corporations are supported by domestic law to perform serviced in ground combats abroad. In the latter case, Human Rights Law (HRL), International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and International Criminal Law (ICL) present numerous gaps that make it difficult to incriminate corporations, which perpetuate the impunity among private organizations involved in human rights violations in conflict zones.
F54|A Piece of Land or Peace on the Land: How Much Is a Peasant's Life Worth in Brazil?|Land inequality in Brazil is alarming and several poor individuals living in rural areas do not have enough income to survive decently. The struggle to access land should lead to a paradigm shift with social movements leading this process since democratization. Their strategies vary, but usually focus on complementary activities of mass mobilization that culminate in the occupation of unproductive land that is not fulfilling its social function in order to force expropriation and the creation of new settlements. This study aims to investigate, through empirical evidence, if such strategies are having the desired effect of allowing the poor to access land, without increasing the already high numbers, and potentially aggravating the violent characteristics, of such disputes. During the Cardoso and Lula presidential administrations the relation between the number of new settlements and the number of deaths caused by land disputes increased. However, there is still a long way to go to improve this policy and achieve positive results. Overall, is this struggle for the reduction of inequality in the Brazilian countryside being won? Is the sacrifice paying off? And what is the price regarding the relation between land conflict victims and the creation of new rural settlements?
F54|Pacification & Mega-events in Rio de Janeiro: Urbanization, Public Security & Accumulation by Dispossession|This paper outlines how Brazil's latest public security initiative-its highly controversial Police Pacification Campaign (UPP)-is an integral component of a neoliberal political framework that is enacting rapid urbanization projects in and around strategically located favelas (informal settlements or slums) of Rio de Janeiro. Specifically, it evaluates what kinds of economic development initiatives are moving forward, how they are facilitated by the UPP, how they connect to the city's mega-events, and who is profiting from them. The article also examines how the pacification has affected residents in three favelas over a seven-year period from the inauguration of the UPP in 2008 through to mid-2015.
F54|On Unstable Ground: Issues Involved in Greening Space in the Rocinha Favela of Rio De Janeiro|This paper is based on fieldwork undertaken in conjunction with Green My Favela, a land use restoration project that works with informal and vulnerable income sector residents to reclaim chronically degraded public areas by creating gardens inside the urban favelas of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The paper reveals how government intervention policies employed in the lead up to the 2016 Olympics are destabilizing the fragile social fabric of the cityâ€™s largest favela, Rocinha, through military occupation and urbanization activities that threaten an already low and unstable human security threshold.
F54|Rio De Janeiroâ€™s Olympic Legacy: Public Security for Whom?|As Rio de Janeiro struggles to hold itself together through the Games of the XXXI Olympiad, its much lauded public security Games plan, including its highly controversial police pacification programâ€”long promoted as one of the cornerstones of Rioâ€™s Olympic legacyâ€”descends into a state of near total collapse. This paper takes an intimate look at what is likely the last days of this contentious pacification policy, the part it plays in the wider â€˜Games Security Planâ€™, and how and why it has been implemented in the lead up to the 2016 Summer Olympics.
F54|Review of On-Scene Management of Mass-Casualty Attacks|Background : The scene of a mass-casualty attack (MCA) entails a crime scene, a hazardous space, and a great number of people needing medical assistance. Public transportation has been the target of such attacks and involves a high probability of generating mass casualties. The review aimed to investigate challenges for on-scene responses to MCAs and suggestions made to counter these challenges, with special attention given to attacks on public transportation and associated terminals. Methods : Articles were found through PubMed and Scopus, â€œrelevant articlesâ€ as defined by the databases, and a manual search of references. Inclusion criteria were that the article referred to attack(s) and/or a public transportation-related incident and issues concerning formal on-scene response. An appraisal of the articlesâ€™ scientific quality was conducted based on an evidence hierarchy model developed for the study. Results : One hundred and five articles were reviewed. Challenges for command and coordination on scene included establishing leadership, inter-agency collaboration, multiple incident sites, and logistics. Safety issues entailed knowledge and use of personal protective equipment, risk awareness and expectations, cordons, dynamic risk assessment, defensive versus offensive approaches, and joining forces. Communication concerns were equipment shortfalls, dialoguing, and providing information. Assessment problems were scene layout and interpreting environmental indicators as well as understanding setting-driven needs for specialist skills and resources. Triage and treatment difficulties included differing triage systems, directing casualties, uncommon injuries, field hospitals, level of care, providing psychological and pediatric care. Transportation hardships included scene access, distance to hospitals, and distribution of casualties. Conclusion : Commonly encountered challenges during unintentional incidents were added to during MCAs, implying specific issues for safety, assessment, triage, and treatment, which require training. Effectively increasing readiness for MCAs likely entail struggles to overcome fragmentation between the emergency services and the broader crisis management system as well as enabling critical and prestige-less, context-based assessments of needed preparatory efforts.
F54|Economic Institutions and Comparative Economic Development: A Post-Colonial Perspective|Existing literature suggests that either colonial settlement conditions or the identity of colonizer were influential in shaping the post-colonial institutional environment, which in turn has impacted long-run economic development, but has treated the two potential identification strategies as substitutes. We argue that the two factors should instead be treated as complementary and develop a novel identification strategy that simultaneously accounts for both settlement conditions and colonizer identity to estimate the potential causal impact of a broad cluster of economic institutions on log real GDP per capita for a sample of former colonies. Using population density in 1500 as a proxy for settlement conditions, we find that the impact of settlement conditions on institutional development is much stronger among former British colonies than colonies of the other major European colonizers. Conditioning on several geographic factors and ethno-linguistic fractionalization, our baseline 2SLS estimates suggest that a standard deviation increase in economic institutions is associated with a three-fourths standard deviations increase in economic development. Our results are robust to a number of additional control variables, country subsample exclusions, and alternative measures of institutions, GDP, and colonizer classifications. We also find evidence that geography exerts both an indirect and direct effect on economic development.
F54|Le fonctionnement des comptes d'opérations et leur rôle dans les relations entre la France et les pays africains|The French authorities are responsible for the fixity of the CFA franc (XOF) / Euro exchange rate. Half of the currency reserves of the African countries of the Franc zone (ACFZ) are centralised on an operation account managed by the French Treasury. The CFA system is more flexible than a currency board, nevertheless it is not enough to match the monetary policy with the specific needs of a developing economy. On the external side, the CFA acts as an import subsidy and a tax on exports. On the internal side, the room to manœuvre remains limited in the present context as reserves are weakening with the decrease in commodity prices. The needs of the ACFZ could be better fulfilled through a more flexible exchange rate and the idea of monetary stability has to take into account the inevitable imbalances occurring on the goods and services market in a developing economy

F54|Beyond Economic and Political Borders-Identities in American Homelands|Recent years have seen a growing interest in geography as an ideologically loaded discourseabout the world and its inhabitants. The purpose of the present paper is to investigate the complexrelationship between borders (seen as barriers, bridges, symbols) and the concept of homelandsfrom a cultural perspective, as well as their impact on the larger American homeland. Astute attention has been paid lately to three fundamental concepts â€˜languageâ€™, â€˜cultureâ€™ andâ€˜identityâ€™. Language is a potent and visible marker of identity, helping the construction of spaces inwhich a sense of belonging can develop. For individuals as well as for communities, language is acommunicative vehicle and it is granted a symbolic value. People stamp the environment with theircultural impress, they give names to geographical locations around them, or attach symbolicsignificance to them- the area in turn shapes them and their language. From here feelings ofattachment and belonging start developing.
F54|Arab Spring - Islamic Winter - North-African Exodus. An explanation of the political economy of Mediterranean long-run dynamics|This paper sets out to explain the links between the upheavals in Arab states in spring 2011 and the current wave of immigration in Europe. As it turns out, an understanding of these dynamics involves not only the tightly interwoven net of economic and political motives and actions, it also is necessary to understand the working of ideological warfare (including religions) in a new age of information and communication technology. Thus there is the intermediate step of an ‘Islamic Winter’ between the ‘Arab Spring’ and the ‘North-African Exodus’.
F54|Ethnic or nonethnic. What are the political parties in SubSaharan Africa|The paper examines the issue of ethnicity in political parties and its implications for democracy in three African countries: Nigeria, Ghana and Namibia. It also examines the ways ethnic and nonethnic parties deal on political market in different countries. Ethnicity seems to be one of the most important factors that affects on political and social life in African countries. Moreover, since the colonialism and its ruthless and formal end, it is still present in daily life with double power. It is also a frequent element of political parties and their formation. Does it help or leads to conflicts? Is it necessary or avoidable? African politics seems to be accustomed to its ethnical affects and political organizations with ethnic factor are prevalenced all over the continent. It is not a rule however and we have some countries with the advantage of nonethnic parties. For sure the understanding of the ethnicity issue on the political scene allows for more insightful research of party development and dynamics on the continent.
F54|Developing or Under-developing? Implications of Chinaâ€™s â€˜Going outâ€™ for Late Development|Since the turn of the century, Chinaâ€™s influence on world development has increased enormously. This paper seeks to analyse major attributes of the influence of Chinaâ€™s â€œgoing outâ€ , centring on the argument that the influence has been in the main conducive to the rest of the developing world. Specifically, this paper offers a critique of relevant, popular theses such as â€œChinaâ€™s neoliberalization crowds out world developmentâ€ , â€œChina under-cuts the conditions of the worldâ€™s working classâ€ , and â€œChina exhibits a tendency towards imperialismâ€ , etc. It is argued that, in the context of a neoliberal world economy that is increasingly speculation-oriented, Chinaâ€™s production-oriented activities can be seen as an important countervailing force. Whether this China influence is to continue to be conducive to world development in the future, or to turn to become detrimental, depends critically on the broader political-economic context.
F54|Economic Development and Foreign Policy, The Case of Syria 1949-1954|This paper aims to enhance our understanding of the relationship between economic development and foreign policy in Syria in the post-independence period. In this endeavour, Syria has been taken as a state of the global South that was bound to be preoccupied with its condition of underdevelopment, dependence, vulnerability and permeability. Adopting a political economy approach to examine a period of instability marked by three military coups, this paper presents socioeconomic needs of the country as a source of foreign policy and identifies the acquisition of external resources as a key foreign policy objective.
F54|War and Relatedness|We find that more closely related populations are more prone to engage in international conflict with each other. We provide an economic interpretation based on two connected mechanisms. First, more closely related groups share more similar preferences over rival goods and are thus more likely to fight over them. Second, rulers have stronger incentives to conquer populations more similar to their own, to minimize postconflict heterogeneity in preferences over government types and policies. We find support for these mechanisms using evidence on international conflicts over natural endowments and on territorial changes, including decolonization.
F54|The Multidimensional Nature Of Young Immigrants’ Well-Being|On arrival in a new country, migrants usually face language and cultural barriers, discrimination, and other sources of unjust contextual conditions, which limit their opportunities for a successful experience. This scenario compromises levels of well-being in the migrants and accentuates a tendency towards social fragmentation in the places of settlement. Therefore, the present work aims to investigate which factors can support young immigrants’ well-being in our country focusing on a set of demographic, psychological, and relationship with the context variables. There were 408 young immigrants participating in the research, aged between 19 and 29 years old (M = 24.08, SD = 2.89). The results show that life satisfaction of the immigrant is thus given by individual factors but in close connection with others and with the community, in a process that mutually reinforces oneself and the other, oneself and the community
F54|Od Alžírského Osvobozeneckého Hnutí K Myšlence Kabylské Nezávislosti (From The Algerian Liberation Movement To The Idea Of Kabyle Independence)|Francouzi vytvořili během kolonizace Alžírska pozitivní stereotyp vyzdvihující Kabyly nad Araby. V odborné literatuře je tento stereotyp označovaný jako kabylský mýtus. Přestože za Alžírské osvobozenecké války bojovali Kabylové a Arabové bok po boku bez odkazování se na koloniální etnické stereotypy, po nezávislosti se Kabylové začali s kabylským mýtem čím dál více ztotožňovat. Cílem tohoto textu je analyzovat, z jakých důvodů a jakým způsobem získal kabylský mýtus v sebevnímání Kabylů na síle a jak ovlivnil jejich emancipační boj a osvětlit, jakým způsobem se z Kabylů, angažovaných bojovníků za alžírskou svobodu, stali zastánci kabylské nezávislosti. Pojednáno je také o tom, jakou úlohu v kabylských emancipačních snahách hrají kabylské emigrantské komunity v zahraničí. (The French, during their colonization of Algeria, developed a positive stereotype favoring Kabyles over Arabs. This stereotype is known as the Kabyle myth in academic sources. Though Kabyles and Arabs fought side by side in the Algerian War of Independence without referring to any colonial ethnic stereotypes, after gaining independence the Kabyle people started to identify themselves with the myth more and more. The aim of this text is to analyze why and how the Kabyle myth gained on strength in the Kabyles’ self-perception, how it influenced their emancipation struggle, and clarify how the Kabyles, once committed fighters for Algerian freedom, became promoters of Kabyle independence. We will also discuss what role in Kabyle emancipation efforts is played by the Kabyle emigrant communities abroad.)
F54|European Development Assistance Policy: A Diachronic Approach|As the world’s biggest donor, for the developing countries, the European Union is an example of how to solve complex problems in a more and more interconnected world. Article hypothesis is represented by the fact that European values and principles have been established and developed around the construction of a new action concept, designed to meet the challenges of the European space. This paper analysis the context in which were formed and developed EU values and principles, basic elements in construction and development of European Development Assistance Policy. Which were the philosophical, political, economic and social determinants that contributed to building the European values and principles? To what extent geopolitical context changes have influence the evolution of development cooperation policy of the European Union? What are the effects that development policy has produced, analyzed from a diachronic perspective? These are the questions we will answer during the work, critically analyzing the literature and empirical data from the field.
F54|Divisas e imperialismo en las crisis económicas argentinas|Este artículo trata sobre la naturaleza de las crisis económicas en la Argentina. La opinión usual las vincula con la escasez de divisas. En este ensayo se polemiza con esta tesis. El punto de partida del análisis es la teoría del imperialismo. A principios del siglo xx, la economía mundial adquiere ciertos rasgos que condicionan las relaciones económicas entre países. El análisis busca asociar el movimiento de entrada y salida de divisas de la Argentina y el fenómeno de las crisis económicas con estos condicionantes históricos. ****** This article discusses the nature of economic crises in Argentina. The usual view relates them to a juncture of foreign exchange shortages. This essay argues a different point of view. The starting point of the analysis is the theory of imperialism. Certain features that emerged in the early twentieth century strongly affected economic relations between countries in the world economy. The analysis seeks to associate inward and outward foreign exchange to and from Argentina, and its economic crisis, with these historical conditions.
F54|The Model of French Development Assistance – Who Gets the Help?|Development cooperation is an important element of international relations because it influences the power balance between major players on the world markets and in the political debate. The aim of the article was to analyze the French development assistance model based upon the amount of help sent to Africa over the period 2001–2012. The motivation of donor country is a crucial factor of development assistance, which influence not only the relations between donors and recipients, but also the effectiveness of aid. We estimated a series of dynamic panel models to assess whether the poverty-related factors play a dominant role in the distribution of help. On the contrary, we found that the most important variables appeared to be the political and economic dependencies, among others: colonial history and oil/gas reserves.
F54|Dispersion and distortions in the trans-Atlantic slave trade|Market distortions can lead to resource misallocation, which can further lead to inefficiency. Throughout the history of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, qualitative evidence of various sources of distortion abounds. No study, however, has quantified the inefficiency in the slave trade due to these distortions. We use a structural approach to identify the dispersion of distortions in the slave trade from wedges in first order conditions. We then calculate the TFP gains had the dispersion of distortions disappeared. Two main results emerge. First, dispersion of distortions had the smallest damage to TFP in Great Britain, followed by Portugal, and then France. Second, dispersion of distortions in the product market had a bigger impact on TFP than that of the capital and labor markets.
F54|The comparative effects of independence on trade|Empirical evidence suggests that belonging to an empire favours trade by lowering transaction costs and establishing preferential trade agreements. Does the end of an empire invert this effect, and if so, through which channels? This paper uses an original dataset to explore the impact of independence on former colonies’ bilateral trade over the 1948–2007 period. We show large differences across empires. Whereas independence reduces the trade (imports and exports) between former French colonies and their coloniser, as well as with other colonies of the same empire, we do not find any comparable effect for former British colonies. We attribute this finding to the particularly protectionist trade policy implemented by France during the colonial era, and we are able to rule out alternative explanations related to transaction costs. We also find that after independence, all former colonies trade more with third countries, and we relate this result to the geographical diversification of trade.
F54|Democracy and income inequality: revisiting the long and short-term relationship|This paper studies the relationship between democracy andincome inequality in long- and short/medium-run. Using appropriate econometrictechniques on both, averaged and panel data for the period 1962-2006, we findno evidence that democracy is associated with tighter income distribution. Ourresults are robust to different specification techniques, to exclusion ofdeveloped as well as the transition countries. We speculate that the different(and opposing) transmission mechanisms, as well as the nature and thedefinition of the democracy variables (both Polity IV and Freedom House)influence our results. Improvement of conceptualization and measurement of democracycould shed further light onto the democracy-inequality nexus.
F54|Enforcement and the Effective Regulation of Labor|This paper provides new measures of labor law enforcement across the world. The constructed dataset shows that countries with more stringent de jure regulation tend to enforce less. While civil law countries tend to have more stringent de jure labor codes as predicted by legal origin theory, they enforce them less, suggesting a more nuanced version of legal origin theory. The paper further hypothesizes that in territories where Europeans pursued an extractive strategy, they created economies characterized by monopolies and exploitation of workers, which ultimately led to stringent labor laws in an attempt to buy social peace. Those laws, however, applied de facto only in firms and sectors with high rents and workers capable of mobilizing. Finally, it is shown that territories with higher European settler mortality presently have more stringent de jure labor regulations, lower overall labor inspection, and larger differences in effective regulation of bigger firms.
F54|The European Union As A Driver Of Regional Cooperation In Its Southern Neighbourhood|The European Union's policy towards its southern periphery in North Africa and the Middle East has sought to promote regional cooperation both between itself and the Arab partner states and, most importantly, among the Arab states. The Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, and later on, the Union for the Mediterranean introduced, after decades of superficial institutionalization of Euro-Mediterranean relations, an element of novelty in the form of the regionalism it promoted and the multilateral setting it was creating. However outstanding at its debut, this experiment of „building” a Mediterranean region, where security and peaceful change would be brought about by the states' willingness to cooperate through multilateral mechanisms has failed. The EU's efforts to create a Mediterranean region have been stymied not only by what can amount to an unrealistic perception regarding intra-Arab dynamics, but also by changes in the substance of the Euro-Mediterranean institutional setting. Namely, the region-building multilateralism of the EMP has been side-lined by the pragmatic bilateralism of the UfM.
F54|The Failure Of The First Romanian Central Bank: Bad Design, Bad Luck, Or Both?|In this paper we will analyze the failure of the National Bank of Moldavia, a bank that was chartered by the Principality of Moldavia in 1856, to act primarily as a privileged source of liquidity for its economy. Although the project of a state chartered, privileged bank was planned many years in advance by the princes of the Romanian Principalities, the National Bank of Moldavia suspended payments shortly after its establishment, in early 1858, and had its charter revoked. We will discuss, from the point of view of modern monetary thought, the ideas that were advanced in the justification of its creation, and in the rationalization of is failure. We will analyze the structure of the credits and other problems in its balance sheet. Also, we will study the role that the Crisis of 1857, and the already emerging European economic integration, had in its demise.
F54|Response to reviewers on “The Tyranny of Experts”|I respond to the three excellent reviewers, who have covered well some of the most difficult issues raised by the arguments in The Tyranny of Experts. These include the good intentions of aid officials supporting autocrats, the role of Western history and current Western travails in the debate on freedom, distinguishing good and bad experts, advocating principles vs. tangible interventions, the serious flaws of democracy and not overstating the case for democracy, the question of whether some academics are also technocrats, the value of freedom as an end in itself, and the definition of democracy as to whether it includes individual rights. Finally and most controversially, I address the biggest question raised by the reviewers (and many others): what should we do? I say why I believe this question is the wrong one, why I refuse to answer it, and suggest more constructive ways to debate freedom and development.

F54|Editorial for Journal of Human Security Volume 11|This editorial marks the beginning of the journal's eleventh year since its inception as the Australasian Journal of Human Security. As a sample from an exÂ­tremely tumultuous era in human history, this time span has consistently provided an abundance of human security issues for me to comment on. Yet, for the first time since that fateful day in September of 2001, I feel that the world has arrived at another historical turning point. I am referring to the attack on the Paris office of the satirical journal Charlie Hebdo on January 7 and the events immediately following it.
F54|Human Security Workers Deployed in Austere Environments: A Brief Guide to Self-Care, Sustainment, and Productivity|Since the early 1990s, the human security movement has sought to expand the concept of security beyond the traditional military defense of national borders to focus on the intra-state security needs of populations at the individual level. Specific initiatives frequently address problems of population health, ethnic conflict, religious extremism, human rights, environmental or natural disasters, and other critical issues. For expatriate human security workers in the field, the environment may present meaningful challenges to their wellbeing and productivity. This can be especially so for those who have relatively more experience in academic, business, or administrative settings, and less in the field. The authors' goal is to illuminate practices that have demonstrated their efficacy in enhancing wellness, sustainment, and productivity for human security and other humanitarian and development workers deployed to austere environments. The content represents a synoptic consensus of best general practices and guidance from a range of resources comprising United Nations agencies and activities, national and international non-governmental organizations (NGO's), private volunteer organÂ­izations (PVO's), national military services, and international business concerns.
F54|A Review of 'Humanitarian Intervention and Legitimacy Wars: Seeking Peace and Justice in the 21st Century'|In his book Humanitarian Intervention and Legitimacy Wars: Seeking Peace and Justice in the 21st Century , Richard Falk argues that, with the growing prevalence of soft power, historical lessons of asymmetric warfare and legitimacy wars must be taken into account. Falk rejects the realist notion that the state is the only rational actor, offering a more constructivist approach that focuses on the norms, culture and morality of the international community. He asserts that humanitarian intervention is on the decline, and legitimacy wars are increasing. Much of this legitimacy is based on international law and its relevance in the international community.
F54|Notes from the Field: The Humanitarian Crisis in Ukraine|Humanitarian crises are politically and socially charged, and as actors, donors and organizations move in to help, duplication of services can ensue. Despite the influx of humanitarian actors into the war zone of eastern Ukraine, more are still needed to address immediate threat to the health of more than 5 million at-risk people in the area. The humanitarian disaster in Ukraine requires fast support and stakeholder involvement to mitigate preventable death among at-risk populations. As the crisis unfolds and many more people are caught in the crossfire with no health security, WHO is leading the charge to organize healthcare and humanitarian action to relive human suffering and engender health security for all.
F54|Educational Pathways to Remote Employment in Isolated Communities|Those who live in isolated communities often lack reliable, skilled employment opportunities, which fundamentally undermines their human security. For individuals who wish to remain in their isolated communities for family, religious, philosophical or other reasons, their attachment to their communities creates a disincentive for higher education. This promotes low educational achievement, which in turn results in low socioeconomic status, lack of social mobility, and a generational cycle of poverty. The human misery that results from such a feedback loop is observed in isolated communities throughout North America, including aboriginal communities in Canada. Fortunately, maturation of information and communication technologies now offers individuals the potential to gain high-skilled employment while living in an isolated community, using both (i) virtual work/remote work and (ii) remote training and education. To examine that potential, this study: 1) categorizes high-skill careers that demand a higher education and are widely viable for remote work, 2) examines options for obtaining the required education remotely, and 3) performs an economic analysis of investing in remote education, quantifying the results in return on investment. The results show that the Internet has now opened up the possibility of both remote education and remote work. Though the investment in college education is significant, there are loans available and the return on investment is generally far higher than the interest rate on the loans. The results identified several particularly promising majors and dozens of high-income careers. The ability to both obtain an education and employment remotely offers the potential to lift many people living in isolated communities out of poverty, reduce inequality overall, and provide those living in isolated communities with viable means of employment security, which not only allows personal sustainability, but also the potential for personal growth.
F54|Redefining Human Security for Vulnerable Migrants in East Asia|This article proposes human security as an analytical framework to understand the current trends of irregular migration (both forced and unauthorised) in East Asia and revisits the seven pillars of human security defined in the 1994 Human Development Report by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). It explains how the concepts of human security are parallel to those prescribed in international human rights conventions but different in terms of the attitude towards states. Human security does not directly challenge state authority and adds a sense of urgency and moral authority that requires extra-legal measures by the states. The author argues that human security is the securitisation of human rights and is a better framework and policy discourse than human rights to engage with state and non-state actors, especially in East Asia where political leaders are more receptive to the former idea. The study draws examples from stateless Rohingyas, undocumented sex workers in Thailand and Singapore, trafficked brides from Vietnam and Cambodia, and smuggled North Korean refugees in China to demonstrate the nexus between human security and irregular migration.
F54|Sustainable Health for All? The Tension Between Human Security and the Right to Health Care|In the current global environmental crisis medical aid and disaster relief is given by the UN and its branches, by governments and by NGOs, who regard it as their duty to address large-scale humanitarian catastrophes. The duty to give medical aid rests on traditional interpretations of health security and on the bioethical imperatives to relieve suffering and to save lives. However, those principles are not easily reconciled in the current situation of global environmental change and the threats it poses to human security. The global demand for health care has already outpaced resources in many regions, and those resources are likely to decline further. An ethic based on more comprehensive concepts of human security can lessen the contraÂ­dictions between ethical priorities because it takes into account environmental security. HowÂ­ever, that approach leads to clashes with common interpretations of human rights, including the so-called right to health care. The argument presented in this paper states that, under the imperative of ensuring the survival for humanity in acceptable and sustainable ways, the latest generation of human rights pertaining to health care and environmental quality have become ungrantable. While this does not render them negligible, it does necessitate a new approach to global development aid and health security, with severe consequences for individual autonomy.

Integration is seen as a means for ensuring competitiveness by better opportunities in international trade and as a factor supporting the resolution of the political and economic problems of the continent. Integration processes go through several stages of development, in which the focus gradually shifted from political to economic goals – the establishment of a functioning African Economic Community.
F54|Donor’s double talk undermines African agency : Comparative study of civic agency in Burkina Faso and Togo|Despite a long-standing controversy about aid-effectiveness in general and the impact of aid-dependency on governance in particular, little is known on the effect of donors policies on civic agency for democratization in aid dependent autocratic regimes. In this study it is argued that the long-term effects of double-talk of donors, who openly promote democracy and freedom but covertly follow overriding hidden interest, are a neglected source of failure of civic protest and democratic revolutions in autocratic regimes. The differing outcome of 'democratic revolutions' in Togo and Burkina Faso – both 'aid darlings' for decades-serves to substantiate this thesis. A systematic and holistic consideration is necessary for an unbiased evaluation of the hidden adverse impact of aid on collective action at the grassroots. Therefore, a rethinking of temporal and disciplinary 'fault lines' in development politics as well as in development studies is essential.
F54|The Struggles for the Establishment of the National Bank of Moldavia In Light of the Theory of Political Entrepreneurship|At the middle of the XIX century, the historical provinces of Moldavia and Wallachia had simultaneous and coordinated plans to establish two national banks, one for each province, as state-sanctioned, official, central banks. While the plan for the Wallachian central bank was thwarted by the ouster of Prince Barbu Dimitrie Stirbey in 1851, the plan for the National Bank of Moldavia was finally realized by Prince Grigore Alexandru Ghica, in 1856, when the international developments weakened the grip that the Russian Empire had over Moldavia. The first Romanian National Bank was, however, a short-lived initiative. In this paper, we will look at the way it was established.
F54|Identity, Nations and the Requirements of Global Justice: Limits of the Debate in Democratic Politics|How do we, as individuals, communities and nations, arbitrate between the requirements of justice or our sense of justice, at the local or national level, as compared to our idea of justice in the world at large? Is the demand for global justice a demand for greater equality among nations, for systems of just global governance to manage an increasingly interconnected world of increasing complexity, or just another utopian ideal? This article seeks to bring together two separate debates in contemporary social sciences and social philosophy to discuss these questions. The first part of this article examines questions of identity, individual and collective, and the expressions and practice of nationalism that forms the basis of international exchanges based on the debates between communitarian and universalist social philosophers. The second part of the article analyzes how the idea of global justice, and in particular, international distributive justice, is limited or constrained by the questions of identity and nationalism under the democratic and institutional compulsions of nation states, even when they accept the necessity of institutions of global governance. The later work of Rawls and their extensions are a common thread in these two debates. JEL: F6, F52, F54, D63
F54|Burnished Ornamentalism: Making Sense of History, Iconography and the Visual Cultural Practices of Postcolonial Elite Schools in Globalizing Circumstances|This presentation probes deeply into the tangled of historicities that animate British-bequeathed elite schools now operating in new competitive transnational educational markets in selected post-developmental states. The scenarios of this competition are increasingly moving online in photo and video-sharing websites such as YouTube, Facebook and Flicker and in the websites that individual schools are creating to consecrate their school heritages. I examine closely the work that postcolonial elite schools in a nine-country international study are doing with their historical archives, preserved cultural objects, architecture, emblems, mottos and their school curricula as they martial these cultural resources at the crossroads of profound change precipitated by globalization and attendant neoliberal imperatives. This change is articulated across the whole gamut of global forces, connections, and aspirations. And, it is in relation to and through these dynamics that postcolonial elite schools must now position and reposition themselves?acting and intervening in and responding to new globalizing circumstances that often cut at right angles to the historical narratives and the very social organization of these educational institutions linked to England. Globalizing developments have precipitated efforts on the part of these schools to mobilize their rich heritages and pasts as a material resource and not simply as a matter of indelible and inviolate tradition. History, then, I maintain in this context, cannot be reduced to the realm of epiphenomena of securely linear school chronologies. Instead, drawing on Walter Benjamin, I look at the way in which postcolonial school histories are ?active in the present? and the way in which schools in India, Barbados and Singapore are adroitly and selectively managing their school identities in the light of globalization. The results of these interventions are not guaranteed. They often run up against the revolution of rising expectations of school youngsters and their parents, the taste for global cultures and global futures indicative of the global ambitions of the young, and the pressures of alumni and other stakeholder interests which must be navigated.
F54|The Geography of Hostility - Discursive and Semiotic Means of transforming Realities in Geography school books|This paper examines the linguistic and semiotic ways in which ideologies are recreated in Geography schoolbooks and transform Geo-political realities. Five schoolbooks currently used in Jewish mainstream schools in Israel were analyzed for the use they make of language and visuals such as photographs, maps, graphs, icons and colour in order to recontextualize both disciplinary and political discourses to education.The paper argues that in all those books scientific conventions and principles of visual and verbal representation are compromised by political messages and the commitment of these schoolbooks to promote Jewish territorial and national Identity, which is largely based on the denial of the identity of Palestinians, both the citizens of Israel and those that live under Occupation. The distortion of geopolitical and social facts and the concealment of any meaningful life beside the Jewish one promote hostility and reproduce Elite Racism .
F54|Donor’s double talk undermines African agency: Comparative study of civic agency in Burkina Faso and Togo|Despite a long-standing controversy about aid-effectiveness in general and the impact of aid-dependency on governance in particular, little is known on the effect of donors policies on civic agency for democratization in aid dependent autocratic regimes. In this study it is argued that the long-term effects of double-talk of donors, who openly promote democracy and freedom but covertly follow overriding hidden interest, are a neglected source of failure of civic protest and democratic revolutions in autocratic regimes. The differing outcome of ‘democratic revolutions’ in Togo and Burkina Faso – both ‘aid darlings’ for decades - serves to substantiate this thesis. A systematic and holistic consideration is necessary for an unbiased evaluation of the hidden adverse impact of aid on collective action at the grass-roots. Therefore, a rethinking of temporal and disciplinary ‘fault lines’ in development politics as well as in development studies is essential.
F54|Predation, Taxation, Investment, and Violence: Evidence from the Philippines|The literature relating economic activity to political violence posits greedy rebels (Collier, 2000) but not greedy governments. Could capturing tax revenue motivate governments to step up their counter insurgency operations, just as extortion motivates rebel violence? Panel data on political violence in the Philippines distinguish government from rebel attacks, which we link to private investment across 70 provinces. To formally explore these data we expand an established theory of asymmetric substate conflict –the “information-centric” model, adding firms, investment, taxation and predation (i.e., extortionary violence by rebels in response to investment) to the interplay of government, rebels and civilians, generating testable implications. The data show that increases in investment predict increases in both government-initiated attacks and rebel-initiated attacks. In the year following increased investment government attacks decrease. In the context of our expanded model, these empirical results suggest that both rebels and governments contest economic rents.
F54|Diseño institucional, prácticas y crédito notarial en Buenos Aires durante la primera mitad del siglo XVII|El presente trabajo procura comprender el desempeño del crédito de corto plazo escriturado notarialmente en Buenos Aires durante la primera mitad del siglo XVII ante la escribanía pública y de Cabildo, único registro notarial de la comarca hasta comienzos del siglo siguiente. El análisis de los datos provistos por los protocolos notariales evidencia que las operaciones de este sistema crediticio escriturado notarialmente expresan el desarrollo de transacciones de crédito no condicionadas por la proximidad relacional. Y la distribución de tales instrumentos crediticios notariados no resultó en una concentración exclusiva entre los actores del grupo económicamente dominante de esta sociedad oligárquica. Este desempeño podrá encontrar su razón a partir de la interrelación entre las singularidades de la estructura institucional dispuesta localmente por la Corona, el funcionamiento efectivo de la institución notarial que participaba de aquella y las singularidades socioeconómicas del puerto, mostrando que la relación medular entre diseño institucional y desempeño económico no necesariamente se revela causal ni unidireccional.

F54|Príspevok Geografov K Ekonomike Rozvojových Štátov (The Contribution Of Geographers To The Economics Of Developing Countries)|Problémy modernizácie, regionálneho rozvoja a ekonomického rastu rozvojových krajín sú predmetom neustálych diskusií. V sociálnych vedách sa kryštalizujú dva zdanlivo protichodné pohľady na fungovanie ekonomiky a spoločnosti rozvojových krajín. Jeden je ekonomický, druhý geografický. V tomto článku sa pokúsime ukázať, aký je príspevok ekonomických geografov k riešeniu problémov nerovnomerného rozvoja, chudoby a hladu. V príspevku ponúkneme odpovede na tieto otázky: Aké sú prvotné príčiny hladu a chudoby? Môžu ekonomické normy a pravidlá prevzaté z iných regiónov sveta vyriešiť tieto problémy? Akú úlohu tu zohráva geografia? (Modernization, regional development and economic growth in developing countries belong to the most discussed issues of the contemporary world. In social science, two seemingly contradictory views on economy and society of developing countries have emerged. These are the economic view and the geographical perspective. In the present paper, we identify contributions of economic geographers to the search for solutions of problems of unequal development, poverty and famine in developing countries. The main questions discussed in the paper include: What are the primary causes of famine and poverty? Is application of economic norms and strategies used in other regions of the world a suitable solution? What is the role of geography in this aspect?)
F54|More than Words and Good Intentions: The Political Agenda-Setting Power Behind Foreign Aid Mechanisms|In this paper, international aid is examined as a tool for political agenda-setting. A theoretical model is constructed for the analysis, incorporating the incentives created by foreign aid, on the political benefits of recipient governments. The model also incorporates the compensating benefits provided by these governments through the legitimization of the donor country's political agenda. The main results of this model indicate that governments which offer international assistance can influence the political agenda of recipient countries through two channels: 1) By reducing the political costs of official intervention in issues that receive aid, and 2) By generating incentives for additional political rent-seeking. The results are studied in the case of aid provided by the USA to Colombia during the period 1998-2012, which shows the power of US presidents to establish part of the Colombian political agenda related to drugs and terrorism. The results are obtained through a novel content analysis of presidential speeches in both countries and from a set of estimates corrected by possible problems of endogeneity in foreign aid allocation.
F54|Colonial Legacy, Linguistic Disenfranchisement and the Civil Conflict in Sri Lanka|Polarization measures that are used in examining the empirical relationship between ethnic divisions and violent conflict, heavily rely on mechanisms of group identification and often use somewhat arbitrary divisions of a society into ethnic groups. In this paper we construct two new measures of polarization, one that accounts for differences in linguistic policies across localities during the colonial era and one that accounts for the differences over time and across localities in the experience of violence throughout the conflict episode. By examining the protracted war in Sri Lanka and applying these indices (and their combination) to a data set describing victims of the civil conflict by district and year, we are able to better identify the effect of ethno-linguistic polarization on the civil conflict in the country. We find that, for each of our polarization indices, there is a positive effect on the conflict. The historical underpinnings of our indices allow us to demonstrate in a quantitative and concrete way the relevance of historical processes for understanding episodes of civil conflict.
F54|La formation de l'accountability en situations conflictuelles|This doctoral thesis examines Robert’s (1991) conceptualization of accountability in conflicting situations. In organizational contexts, individuals give account in two ways; at a distance, to show that their actions are aligned with the main goals of the company – hierarchical accountability -; in face-to-face situations, to provide explanations to people they meet - social accountability. First I study how accountability takes shape when an individual faces two antagonist demands for accountabilities towards the same act. Interviews were conducted with employees from CSR departments, whose mission is about providing an answer to social demands in the name of the company, while staying aligned with business principles. With the help of Foucaldian concepts of “Ethics” and “Moral” (1991), I show that employees interpret those two demands within their own norms and provide an answer that satisfies themselves first. This specific answer is rejected. Accountability is interrupted. In order to re-establish accountability, a community is created around that specific answer, gathering employees from various companies. This community provides a space to give accounts and confirms CSR managers are acting appropriately.Second, analysing ethnographic material, I try to understand how accountability takes shape when certain employees oppose the mission of their colleagues. Precisely, the discussion takes place regarding a product, which has been developed especially for poor rural populations, who are assimilated into the “underdeveloped world” and with which the Malian elite would not be associated. First, with the help of Saïd (1978) and Fanon’s (1952) work, I explain the reason for that class conflict through the dichotomy between “North and South”. This dichotomy has been translated south to “local elite / rural population”. Second, I show that to overcome difficulties, employees develop alternative forms of accountabilities toward villagers and toward themselves. The second form aims to develop mutual support but also reinstate accountability toward hierarchy by using their personal positions and degree of power in order to take a coordination action.Overall, this doctoral thesis shows that hierarchical accountability can be momentarily interrupted and later can be restored by the development of alternative types of social accountability.
F54|Crown Rule, Home Charges, and U.K.-India Terms of Trade|This paper examines possible determinants of the long-run bilateral commodity terms of trade between the United Kingdom and British India during the Crown Rule period of 1858-1947. The potential influences of aggregate real incomes, price levels/money supplies, international transportation costs, and the exchange rate are included in the analysis, but we especially focus on the Home Charges that India was obliged to pay to Britain. The econometric results provide some support for the hypothesis that a rise in Home Charges was associated with an improvement in Britain’s terms of trade with India. In addition, a clear role was played by changes in transport costs and in the exchange rate.
F54|Institutional foundations of export diversification patterns in oil-producing countries|While it is well known that resource exporting countries have higher export concentration, it is lesser known that there is substantial variance in export concentration fortunes within resource-based countries. Using several estimation techniques and other sensitivity checks, this paper offers a new explanation for success and failure in export diversification patterns in oil countries, an explanation which has an institutional and political background. In measuring the number of years between the beginning of oil production and the attainment of political independence in oil developing countries, we found that the greater the number of years, the higher the degree of export diversification ceteris paribus. Our interpretation of this result is grounded in an analysis of political constraints to diversification in resource-based countries. Institutions, unfavorable to diversification, which arose from the pre-independence period, were blocked in their positive evolution by national political elites in the post-independence period. This result contributes to a better understanding of the dynamics of institutions in resource-based countries.
F54|Oil wealth and the well-being of the subaltern classes in Sub-Saharan Africa: A critical analysis of the resource curse in Ghana|In 2007, Ghana joined the club of Gulf of Guinea oil-rich countries when transnational corporations discovered proven reserves in the Jubilee Field, off of the Cape Three Points along its Western coast. This has generated debate on whether Ghana would escape the resource curse. The orthodox resource curse approach (ORCA), dominant in most discussions on the issue to date, offers some valuable theoretical and policy insights but is also highly problematic: it is uncritical, ahistorical and reductionist. Fixated on internal political and economic factors, the ORCA ignores the longue durée of capitalist exploitation and its negative structural effects on the economy. This article formulates a critical political economy approach (PEA) which brings a fresh perspective on the oil-curse debate, focusing specifically on the case of Ghana. Using theoretical argumentation and empirical evidence, the paper explains why, in the context of ORCA, many would argue that a liberal democratic context, relatively good governance and long history of gold mining will help Ghana minimise the probability of a resource curse. But when analysed using a more dynamic PEA, it becomes clear that the danger of a resource curse ‘epidemic’ surfacing in Ghana is very real: the continuous exploitation by global capital, which has perpetuated the existence of enclave extractive industries and a dependence on the export of low-value commodities. A PEA brings into sharper focus the global political economy underpinnings of the resource curse in Sub-Saharan Africa by highlighting the way in which the dynamics of ‘uneven and combined’ capitalist development have conditioned the region, both resource-rich and poor, to become dependent on the production and export of raw commodities.
F54|Professionalizing the role of Shari'ah auditors: How Malaysia can generate economic benefits|The paper presents arguments on the need for inventing the profession of Shari'ah auditing and why Malaysia should take the lead to create an Association of Chartered Shari'ah Accountants and Auditors (ACSAA) that can result in long run economic benefits for the country. The paper also critically analyzes how accounting and auditing membership is being exported worldwide by few dominant players to generate economic benefits for their respective origin countries and how existing Islamic accounting and auditing qualification suppliers have failed to deliver and create holistic Shari'ah accountants/auditors required to serve in an ideal Islamic economy. The paper proposes 2 models through which ACSAA can be made a practical reality.
F54|The Chinese in Colonial Rabaul: An Informal History|This paper is concerned with the economic history of immigrant Chinese in colonial Rabaul and its hinterland (in German, later Australian, New Guinea) over almost a century to the Independence of Papua New Guinea in 1975. It is a companion piece to another study concerned with how Tolai people of the hinterland accommodated themselves to the colonial market economy (Conroy, forthcoming). Without pretension to novelty in the historical narrative it asserts the value of viewing events through the lens of 'informal economy', as constructed by Keith Hart. The Chinese are shown as operating an informal economy parallel to, and inter-penetrating, the formal colonial market economy. That formal economy conformed with norms of Weberian 'rational-legal' bureaucracy, guided (in the case of the Wilhelmine state) by an ideology of 'national-economic purpose'. Under Australian administration, and after the Pacific War, the prevalent intellectual model became one of 'economic development'. Under both administrations, however, Chinese demonstrated to the Tolai that it was possible to participate in the market economy without complying fully with bureaucratic norms. The Germans found it difficult to confine Chinese to dependent and subordinate roles, and Chinese often colluded with Tolai to frustrate German (and, later, Australian) efforts to regulate economic activity to their own advantage. The paper describes the growth and increasing formalization of Chinese business in Rabaul, while noting a continuing strain of informality in their economic activity right up until Independence. It suggests that knowledge of the history of the early colonial-period Chinese may be useful for understanding the character and trajectory of 'new' Chinese settlement in Papua New Guinea in the twenty-first century.
F54|Reverse assimilation? Immigrants in the Canadian labour market during the Great Depression|This paper uses Canadian census data from 1911 to 1931 to trace the labour market assimilation of immigrants up to the onset of the Great Depression. We find that substantial earnings convergence between 1911 and 1921 was reversed between 1921 and 1931, with immigrants from Continental Europe experiencing a sharp decline in earnings relative to the native-born. The effect of Depression labour market conditions was particularly pronounced among older immigrants with long tenures in Canada.

The historical underpinnings of our indices allow us to demonstrate in a quantitative and concrete way the relevance of historical processes for understanding episodes of civil conflict.
F54|Economic Integration in Africa â€“ Overview, Progress and Challenges|State and government leaders of the African Union are strongly committed to adopt and implement decisions for regional integration, seen as a common strategy for the development of the continent. The major objective at continental level is the establishment of the African Economic Community as the last of six consecutive stages of integration, including the strengthening of inter-sectoral cooperation and the establishment of regional free trade areas, monetary union, common market, monetary and economic union, covering the entire continent. Currently there are 16 Regional economic communities in Africa and 8 of them are officially recognized as the foundation for the development of the African economic community. In our paper we review their goals, their main achievements and issues and also the progress made in the integration process and the challenges it faces.
F54|Throwing the Spanner in the Works: The Mixed Blessing of FDI|FDI is generally attributed to have positive impact for developing countries. In contrast, this paper shows that foreign capital inflows may cause an economy to be stuck in a middle-income trap. Introducing a simple capital market imperfection into a standard neoclassical (open-economy) model of growth, I show that FDI crowds out domestic investment when countries are still growing. If profitable investments are pursued by foreign capital owners, this does reduce chances for domestic entrepreneurs that they would have otherwise been able to take, by means of economy-wide savings. The long term losses due to the crowding-out effect occur despite the short-term gains that sudden capital inflows entail, as in static models. At the same time, savings that are not invested leave the country in turn, generating reverse capital flows.
F54|Editorial for Journal of Human Security Volume 10|Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela's death on 5 December 2013 and his funeral ten days later were taken as an occasion in the global media to discuss the merits of political leadership for human security, with occasional comments on its pitfalls. This particular leader is not the most politically safe object of discussion, as, for a long time, he openly advocated civil disobedience and resistance, initially of the non-violent kind, but later becoming violent. Predictably, the local hegemon reacted with great brutality and sweeping measures to the resistance of the ANC, policies that shocked many in the western world. This reaction by the govÂ­ernment and its supporters and the counterreaction it incited amounted, in the long run, to little more than a vast reduction in human security for most citizens of South Africa, lasting until the ANC's victory and Mr Mandela's ascendance to the presidency in 1994.
F54|Human Security in World Affairs: A Pedagogical, Multi-disciplinary Approach|Alexander and Sabina Lautensach (editors) propose that their book is primarily intended for students and for teaching, and that a pedagogical approach was prioritised rather than a reproduction in the standard format of an academic monograph (p. XVII). Throughout, they aim for a diverse, multi/trans-disciplinary approach in content and presentation by contributors with potential student outcomes focused on flexibility and a broad spectrum knowledge and understanding of human security. To these ends they have been very successful. This hefty tome, almost encyclopaedic in its scope and depth, needs to be approached by students in a certain way. ThatÂ is, students will benefit from some directed guidance regarding approach and methodology in order to successfully navigate through the many detailed concepts, theories and practicalities contained in the book. This is clearly provided in the preface where the authors spend quite some time outlining the rationale of the book in a simple and easy to understand way that will be particularly useful for students and other engaged readers.
F54|Fragile States, Infectious Disease and Health Security: The Case for Timor-Leste|Timor-Leste is a very young and developing nation state. Endemic infectious disease and weakened health security coupled with its growing and inclusive public institutions keep Timor-Leste fragile and in transition on the spectrum of state stability. The objective here is to systematically review Timor-Leste's state and public health successes, showing how a fragile state can consistently improve its status on the continuum of stability and improve health security for the population. The case study follows a state case study approach, together with a disease burden review and a basic description of the health portrait in relation to Timor-Leste's fragile state status. Disease burden and health security are directly proportional to state stability and indirectly proportional to state failure. Timor-Leste is a clear example of how public health can feed into increased state stability. Our discussion attempts to describe how the weak and fragile island nation of Timor-Leste can continue on its current path of transition to state stability by increasing health security for its citizens. We surmise that this can be realized when public policy focuses on primary healthcare access, inclusive state institutions, basic hygiene and preventative vaccination programs. Based on our review, the core findings indicate that byÂ increasing health security, a positive feedback loop of state stability follows. The use of Timor-Leste as a case study better describes the connection between public health and health security; and state stability, development and inclusive state institutions that promote health security.
F54|A Case for Cohabitative Security: The Philippine and Malaysian Experience|This article attempts to explore and analyse the evidence for cohabiting the human security concept into the national security frameworks of ASEAN countries. Using the Philippines and Malaysia as case studies, the article determines the extent to which public officials and policymakers have redefined and reenvisioned national security by incorporating non-traditional, people-centered elements of human security. The word 'cohabitation' refers to national governments' efforts to amalgamate statist and humanist dimensions of security when articulating and implementing their national security rhetoric and agenda. It argues that human security naturally complements state security, and vice versa. As such, human security and state security co-exist in a constructive manner that enhances the overall level of national security. In other words, they are mutually constitutive rather than mutually corrosive. Both cases underscore a two-pronged assumption. First, the meaning and provision of national security can neither be eloquently articulated nor completely substantiated without considerations for 'below the state' actors and issues. And second, the eminent status vis-Ã -vis power of the state in providing national security can neither be trivialized nor undermined.
F54|The Praxis of Social Enterprise and Human Security: An Applied Research Agenda|The growth of social enterprise within development NGO work might lead one to suspect it has been irredeemably corrupted by neo-liberal capitalism. However, using the tools of capitalism is not the same as subscribing to the values of capitalism. This paper is situated at the intersection of five fields: human security, international development, social enterprise, social franchising, and left-wing anti-capitalist thought. It examines the relevance of social enÂ­terprise to human security and to development, the relationship between social enterprise and the anti-capitalist values of the left, and it then focuses on social franchisingâ€”a subset of social enterprise that highlights the importance of cooperationâ€”suggesting that it may be a useful methodology for NGOs carrying out educational work in parts of the developing world. It synÂ­thesises and extends ideas that I have presented elsewhere [1-3], it draws on ethnographic fieldwork on the Thai-Burma border, and it puts forward an agenda for further applied research that is rooted in a sociological analysis of civil society and contributes to the human security paradigm.
F54|Human Security and Developmental Crisis in the Contemporary West Africa|The last two decades were characterized by severe conflicts in the West Africa subregion. The era of conflict resolution, management and peace building thus came to define theregion. The destruction left by long years of protracted conflicts and the present state of devel opment is reason enough to warrant attention both from within and beyond. The study expounds, operationalizes and clarifies the concept of human security and development, and how human security issues lead to underdevelopment. The paper investigates the human security concerns in the post-conflict period and also looks at the crisis of development in the sub-region. It highlights details on the developmental crises that have bedevilled the sub-region and at the same time exposes the threats these crises pose on national security and peace in the subregion. This paper concludes that there is no appreciable effort in operationalizing human security in West Africa and this will lead to instability. The paper maintains that human security issues now complicate the developmental crisis in the sub-region due to its ambiguity. The paper suggests that policy makers should address human security issues in order to tackle developmental crisis in the sub-region.
F54|The Fragility of the Liberal Peace Export to South Sudan: Formal Education Access as a Basis of a Liberal Peace Project|This study examines the disjuncture between the policy transposition of the Liberal Peace Project (LPP) in South Sudan from the country's local context. It underlines how deep rooted historical exclusion from social welfare services reinforces political exclusion and exacerbates poor civic engagement among different ethnicities in the country causing a constant relapse to violence. The study combines a qualitative review of data from Afrobarometer, the National Democratic Institute, international NGOs, and South Sudan's government reports within depth interviews and participants' observation. The research finds that restricted access to formal education alongside the conservative and orthodox approaches to peacebuilding, which broadly focus on centralised urban political institutions and exclude diverse local needs and preferences, limit citizenship participation to elections and preclude an equitable social order in South Sudan, establishing a continuum of fragile authoritarian peace, institutional peace and constitutional peace. In an emancipatory approach, the study proposes a framework that prioritizes an extended access to primary and post-primary vocational education as a more credible establishment for sustainable civil peace in the country. The LPP by the international community needs to be tailored to enhance the political will of the South Sudan government to extend free primary education access, incentivize primary education with school feeding programmes and to invigorate vocational training curricula. These will yield civil peace dividends, which avert South Sudan's structural source of relapse into violence with sustainable disincentives. Apart from women's empowerment through education and in all spheres of life, the government needs to ensure sustainability by guaranteeing a sustainable future for the present and for returning refugees by reducing the effects of climate change so as to cope with the increasing pressure on natural resources.
F54|Can the Pragmatic East Asian Approach to Human Security Offer a Way for the Deepening of the Long Peace of East Asia?|"East Asia (including Southeast and Northeast Asia) has witnessed the most spectacular pacification in the world during the past 30 years. Certain dimensions related to human security have been perceived as weak points in the long peace of East Asia. Despite progress, authoritarian violence is still a reality in East Asia. At the same time, certain other dimensions of human securityâ€”most distinctively those elements related to ""freedom from want""â€”have developed very well during the long peace of East Asia. This article will study whether the concept of human security constructs realities that are useful for peace in East Asia. For this, the article will look at how the way in which ""human"" and ""security"" are linked, serve and deepen the existing social realities of peace in the region. Furthermore, the article will look inside the concepts of ""human"" and ""security"" to see how human security is constructed and whether the construction serves to deepen the long peace of East Asia. The article will argue that the East Asian human security debate could be an intellectual adaptation strategy useful for the promotion of the long peace of East Asia in a deeper sense."
F54|More than Words and Good Intentions: The Political Agenda-Setting Power|Abstract In this paper, international aid is examined as a tool for political agenda-setting. A theoretical model is constructed for the analysis, incorporating the incentives created by foreign aid, on the political benefits of recipient governments. The model also incorporates the compensating benefits provided by these governments through the legitimization of the donor country's political agenda. The main results of this model indicate that governments which offer international assistance can in inffluence the political agenda of recipient countries through two channels: 1) By reducing the political costs of official intervention in issues that receive aid, and 2) By generating incentives for additional political rent-seeking. The results are studied in the case of aid provided by the USA to Colombia during the period 1998-2012, which shows the power of US presidents to establish part of the Colombian political agenda related to drugs and terrorism. The results are obtained through a novel content analysis of presidential speeches in both countries and from a set of estimates corrected by possible problems of endogeneity in foreign aid allocation.
F54|Horse trading? EU-African Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs)|EU- Africa Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) are on the brink. In February 2014 West African leaders agreed in principle to conclude an agreement. However, last-minute objections of the heavy-weight Nigeria which wants to protect its infant industries as well as promising trade relations with new global players are likely to prevent the deal. Whether the ECOWAS EPA in its current form would really create a win-win situation for both partners as asserted by the EU is open to question. Scholarly evaluation of the EPAs reveal double-talk and significant barriers to a sustainable development of African economies. The growing preparedness of African states to challenge EU mercantile interest has been effectively backed by agitation of civil society organisations.
F54|Argumentación y guerras civiles<BR>[Argumentation and Civil Wars]|In this article, basic aspects of the argumentation, the argumentation relations with the concept of logical inference and illustration argumentation on international comparative policy analysis are presented. The argumentation is understood as part of a deliberative process reasons for or against a point of view that can be defended by a confrontation of ideas. Therefore who argues: proposed refutes defeat or justify a particular worldview. For this purpose, a brief preliminary description of deductive argument systems (SDA). Degree of formalization from logic to structure the foundations of argumentation in general is introduced, then an illustration is provided based on a case widely recognized in international politics: the conditions of the public debate that led to the invasion and war against Iraq.

F54|Регионална Икономическа Интеграция В Африка (Дисертация)<BR>[Regional Economic Integration in Africa (Ph.D. Thesis, full text)]|The dissertation is dedicated to specific processes of regional economic integration in Africa. The main goal is to assess systematically the development and potential of regional economic communities in Africa through: - systematization of factors that influence the motivation of developing countries to participate in integration, as well as its specific impact on them; - laying out the possibilities and challenges in the processes of regional economic integration in Africa through an analysis of the direction and structure of international trade of African countries and regional blocks; - assessing the different channels of impact of the EU on the integration processes in Africa. The Introduction sets out the importance of the topic and the goal of the paper and outlines the structure, methodology and the limitations of the research. The first chapter discusses the definition and typology of economic integration, traditional and new theories on its effects (static and dynamic analysis) while the main focus is on the determinants of integration among developing countries. The second chapter presents the development of integration processes in Africa, the economy of regional economic communities, the structure and dynamics of their international trade as well as the results and challenges to their integration. The third chapter systemizes the different channels of impact of the EU on the integration processes in Africa paying special attention on the new framework of trade relations – the Economic partnership agreements. The Conclusion summarizes the general conclusions of the research answering the imposed research hypotheses: - first, that traditional and new integration theories with the drawn in them effects and benefits of integration processes are weakly or not at all applicable to developing countries and in particular to regional economic integration in Africa; - second, that the impact of the EU on regional economic integration in Africa is twofold – it has the potential to give impetus to its development but on the other hand it poses some challenges to the already complicated integration processes.

F54|Racism in Canadian Elementary School History and Social Studies Textbooks|Do Manitoba elementary schools? history and social studies textbooks contain racist knowledge towards Indigenous peoples in Canada? Data is collected from a range of textbooks that are published between 1960 and 2013; all were found in schools? libraries and classrooms within the past year. Youth are using even the dated books for research, and therefore consider them legitimate academic sources. The more recent publications are listed on the Manitoba Textbook Bureau, a government agency that designates acceptable books for teachers to use in the province. Surveying these textbooks illuminates various problematic ways that race and Indigenous peoples are taught and portrayed. Older textbooks rely on overtly racist rhetoric, such as labelling Indigenous peoples ?barbarians,? ?Noble Savages,? or suggesting that white settlers were the first people to live in Canada. More recent textbooks move away from this open racism towards a new subtle racism that blurs the lines between learned cultural traits and biological characteristics, essentializing social features. The notion that skin colour provides any deep genetic meaning has long been scientifically disproven. A result of this new, covert racism found in schools? textbooks, combined with the accessibility of old overtly racist ones, is that racialized thinking becomes normalized amongst youth early on.
F54|The Role of Infrastructure in International Relations: the Case of South Caucasus|The role of infrastructures has always been appreciated by the leading powers of the world while pursuing their own goals in the global policy-making process. Though the level of infrastructural development was not so high (in comparison with that of nowadays), in almost all periods of human history states have shared a prominent interest in preserving a total control over infrastructures and undermining the influences of their enemies on them. For example, the Silk road has always been a trouble point in international relations of the Middle East, as it played a key role in regional wars between the Roman Empire and Persia, Byzantium and Arab Caliphate, Ottoman Empire and Safavid Persia.Taking into consideration the fact that the evolution of the world society, the progress in high technologies, the diversification and intensification of economic, political and financial relations have increased the importance of infrastructures, the research is concentrated on the impact of hard types of infrastructure on international relations in one of the most complicated regions of the world, South Caucasus. The point is that transport, energy and water management infrastructures have always played a key role in the formulation of foreign strategies of Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan. The dislocation of various types of infrastructure has highly influenced the level of relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan. Sometimes the economic and political relations of South Caucasian republics with the neighboring states (i.e. Russia, Turkey and Iran) have been conditioned by the ?quantity? and the ?quality? of infrastructural development that Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan possessed.Therefore the research aims at investigating impact of regional infrastructures on regional affairs in the post-Soviet era, simultaneously drawing parallels with the pre-Soviet period, i.e. during the existence of independent regimes in Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan (1918-1921). The immense progress in high technologies has had a prominent impact on the factor of communications in the national security concepts of the region. Thus, the struggle for ?more infrastructures? becomes more and more important in the context of geopolitical terms, therefore the struggle ?through infrastructures? is considered to be one of the efficient ways of policy-making process in ?South Caucasian concert?.
F54|A New Legal Approach Towards the Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict Peaceful Resolution|The current research aims at proposing a new legal approach regarding the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between The Nagorno-Karabakh (Artsakh) Republic and Azerbaijan, as well as The Republic of Armenia as a third party involved in the case. The conflict emerged with its current embodiment in late 1980s, due to the national movement of the Armenians in Karabakh for self-determination and reunification with Armenia. The non-violent phase of the conflict lasted no more than half a year and soon after the emergence of the Armenian movement, Azerbaijani then authorities with the help of the Soviet Internal Security Forces and OMON, launched a military attack towards the Armenian population in Karabakh intending to disarm the local Armenian self-defense militia detachments and uproot the Armenian livings in the given region. The active phase of the conflict, i.e. war of national liberation of Karabakh Armenians against the newly independent Azerbaijani Republic lasted from 1991 till 1994. During the war the newly independent Republic of Armenia conducted humanitarian, military and moral support to its compatriots in Karabakh. Azerbaijan in its turn gained the full support of The Republic of Turkey, as well as solidarity of some Islamic states etc. Russia was amongst the sole countries conducting a policy of keeping balance between belligerents both by arms supply and diplomatic stance. Generally by the Russian mediation the Armenian sides and the Azerbaijani side signed a truce agreement in May, 1994 which is in force up till now.The OSCE Minsk Group is delegated the mandate to provide a multilaterally acceptable peaceful resolution for both sides. The negotiations so far proved a little success, though they are an effective tool in keeping the fragile peace in the front line.The current research presents a thorough investigation of the historical roots of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, the current legal paradigm of the conflict, as well as some basic postulates and theoretical approaches necessary for understanding and dealing with the conflict both on the scientific and academic sphere and on the ?realpolitik? level.As the quintessence of the paper, the author suggests a new legal approach towards the conflict resolution assuming as a basis both the principles and norms of international law as well as the local conditions and factors peculiar to this single conflict.

F54|Wirtschaftliche Partnerschaftsabkommen (EPAs) der EU mit Afrika: Dominanz der EU Exportinteressen statt Partnerschaft auf Augenhöhe|Angesichts des globalen Wettlaufs um Afrikas Ressourcen ist die EU darauf aus, Wirtschaftliche Partnerschaftsabkommen (EPAs) mit afrikanischen Staaten bis Oktober 2014 abzuschließen. Diese EPAs sind sollen nicht nur der Liberalisierung des Handels dienen, sondern auch die Wirtschaftsentwicklung in Afrika fördern und so eine win-win Situation in einer Partnerschaft auf Augenhöhe schaffen. Viele Afrikaner verdächtigen die EU jedoch mit doppelter Zunge zu reden und egoistisch eigene Exportinteressen zu Lasten eines inklusiven Wachstums in afrikanischen Ländern zu verfolgen. Die vorgeschlagenen EPAs der ECOWAS dienen als Beispiel um zu zeigen, dass die Spannungen zwischen afrikanischen Ländern und der EU im Wesentlichen auf der Diskrepanz zwischen dem Diskurs und der Praxis der EU Außenhandels- und Entwicklungshilfepolitik beruhen, ebenso wie auf versteckten Interessen der EU-Direktorate und Mitgliederstaaten. Die wachsende Bereitschaft afrikanischer Staaten, die EU-Außenhandelsinteressen in Frage zu stellen wird effektiv unterstützt durch nachhaltige pro-aktive Agitation von NRO und zivilgesellschaftlichen Gruppen innerhalb und außerhalb Afrikas.

F54|Commercial Imperialism? Political Influence and Trade during the Cold War|We provide evidence that increased political influence, arising from CIA interventions during the Cold War, was used to create a larger foreign market for American products. Following CIA interventions, imports from the US increased dramatically, while total exports to the US were unaffected. The surge in imports was concentrated in industries in which the US had a comparative disadvantage, not a comparative advantage. Our analysis is able to rule out decreased trade costs, changing political ideology, and an increase in US loans and grants as alternative explanations. We provide evidence that the increased imports arose through direct purchases of American products by foreign governments. (JEL D72, F14, F54, N42, N72)
F54|Is Georgia the Next “New” Wine-Exporting Country?|The former Soviet republic of Georgia is reputedly the cradle of wine and has enjoyed at least 8,000 vintages. It has also been a major supplier of wine to Russia for at least 200 years, but to few other countries. In 2006, however, Russia imposed a ban on beverage imports from Georgia. Since then this relatively poor country, in which nearly half the population is rural and most farmers have a vineyard, has been seeking to develop new export markets for its wine. This paper assesses the potential for growth in Georgia's wine production and exports. It then outlines ways to addresses the challenges involved in trying to realize that potential, drawing on the experience of other countries that have rapidly expanded their wine exports in the past two decades. Implications for policy are drawn, particularly for ensuring that poverty is reduced as exports expand and the economy grows. (JEL Classifications: F14, F15, F54, Q17)
F54|Three paradigms of governance and administration: Chinese, Western and Islamic|This essay argues that there are (at least) three paradigms of governance and especially public administration: Chinese, Western, and Islamic — paradigms understood here as potentiality and theory rather than reality and practice as observed today. It then discusses classical Chinese, i.e. Confucian, and Islamic, specifically Ottoman, public administration, from this perspective. The guiding question is whether we arrive more easily at good public administration if we realize that there are different contexts and thus, potentially at least, different ways thither, as well as legitimately different goals.
F54|Úloha UNASUR v latinskoamerických integračných procesoch na začiatku 21. storočia|Jedným z najnovších a najambicióznejších integračných zoskupení v Latinskej Amerike je Únia juhoamerických národov (UNASUR), vytvorená v roku 2008 na podporu regionálnej integrácie v otázkach demokracie, vzdelávania, energetiky, životného prostredia, infraštruktúry a bezpečnosti a so zámerom odstrániť sociálnu nerovnosť a vylúčenie. Vytvorená je podľa vzoru Európskej únie a rovnako ako EÚ má UNASUR veľmi rozsiahle a ambiciózne ciele. Hlavným cieľom UNASUR je politická, ekonomická, sociálna a kultúrna integrácia kontinentu. Realizácia cieľov si bude vyžadovať väčšiu politickú podporu a posilnenie organizačného aparátu UNASUR, čo napomôže efektívnej sektorovej kooperácii v infraštruktúre, energetike, financiách, ale aj v iných oblastiach zameraných na podporu medzinárodnej konkurencieschopnosti a sociálnej kohézie. Pre ďalšie napredovanie UNASUR bude potrebné zosúladiť viaceré, niekedy protichodné, stratégie členských štátov a taktiež adekvátne vyriešiť problémy spôsobené značnými vnútornými nerovnováhami a asymetriami regiónu.
F54|Sýrie A Její Měnící Se Pozice Na Blízkém Východě|Blízký východ je oblastí neklidnou a nestabilní, a to nejen ve vývoji hospodářském, sociálním, kulturním, ale převážně ve vývoji politickém. Dle některých odborníků je hlavním zdrojem konfliktů zasahování velmocí do blízkovýchodní politiky. Analýza vlivů v novodobé historii Blízkého východu je předmětem této studie, se zaměřením na Sýrii, která působila od svého vzniku v r. 1944 jako významný ovlivňovatel blízkovýchodní politiky, avšak v posledních dvou letech se ocitla spíše v průsečíku těchto vlivů. Tato studie si klade za cíl prozkoumat působení Sýrie jako jednoho z hlavních aktérů blízkovýchodní politiky, jejího zasahování do politik a vývoje okolních států, zejména Libanonu, a to z pohledu mladé teorie mezinárodních vztahů – neorealismu.
F54|Nový Regionalizmus A Zmena Integračnej Paragidmy V Latinskej Amerike Po Rozpade Bipolárneho Usporiadania Sveta|Integrácia mala v histórii Latinskej Ameriky vždy veľký význam. Procesy s ňou spojené sa zintenzívnili v druhej polovici 20. storočia a vyústili do troch vĺn regionalizmu. Tento príspevok sa zaoberá novým regionalizmom ako integračnou stratégiou zameranou na podporovanie rozvoja a zlepšenie medzinárodného postavenia Latinskej Ameriky. Nový regionalizmus sa vyznačuje multidimenzionálnym aspektom, v rámci ktorého došlo k rozšíreniu spolupráce aj do iných ako ekonomických oblastí. V deväťdesiatych rokoch 20. storočia sa rozvíjal formou otvoreného regionalizmu, ktorý vychádzal zo zásad Washingtonského konsenzu. Na začiatku 21. storočia však bol pre mnohé nedostatky odmietnutý a nahradený postliberálnym regionalizmom, ktorý posúva latinskoamerickú integráciu kvalitatívne dopredu, no musí sa vysporiadať s mnohými komplikáciami globalizovaného sveta.
F54|From mine to coast: Transport infrastructure and the direction of trade in developing countries|Mine-related transport infrastructure typically connects mines directly to the coast, a pattern that is most clearly seen in Africa. We estimate the effect of such infrastructure on the pattern of bilateral trade flows. We find that a standard deviation increase in the number of mines over the mean biases a country's pattern of trade flows in favor of overseas trade, to the extent that these mining countries import 56% less from neighboring countries (relative to overseas countries), than do countries with an average number of mines. However, this effect is reversed for mining landlocked countries, who import relatively more from neighbors. We rationalize this finding through the unequal effect that mines have on a country's network of infrastructure: because the mine-related transport infrastructure connects the coast rather than neighboring countries, it lowers the cost of trading with overseas countries more than with neighbors. In contrast, for landlocked countries trade costs are also lowered with some neighbors through which infrastructure is built to reach the coast. The effect is specific to mines and not to oil and gas fields, because pipelines cannot be used to trade other commodities. The effect is robust to measuring the stock of mine-related infrastructure by distance along roads between mines and ports, and to taking into account their relative position to routes used for trade between ports and main cities. We discuss the welfare implications of our results for development, and relate these to the recent surge of Chinese infrastructure investment in Africa.
F54|China’s Development Finance to Africa: A Media-Based Approach to Data Collection|How big is China’s aid to Africa? Does it complement or undermine the efforts of traditional donors? China releases little information, and outside estimates of the size and nature of Chinese aid vary widely. In an effort to overcome this problem, AidData, based at the College of William and Mary, has compiled a database of thousands of media reports on Chinese-backed projects in Africa from 2000 to 2011. The database includes information on 1,673 projects in 51 African countries and on $75 billion in commitments of official finance. This paper describes the new database methodology, key findings, and possible applications of the data, which is being made publicly available for the first time. The paper and database offer a new tool set for researchers, policymakers, journalists, and civil-society organizations working to understand China’s growing role in Africa. The paper also discusses the challenges of quantifying Chinese development activities, introduces AidData’s Media-Based Data Collection (MBDC) methodology, provides an overview of Chinese development finance in Africa as tracked by this new database, and discusses the potential and limitations of MBDC as a resource for tracking development finance. This working paper accompanies the release of AidData’s Chinese Official Finance to Africa Dataset, Version 1.0, available for download at http://china.aiddata.org/datasets/1.0, and a live, interactive database platform (at http://china.aiddata.org). AidData’s MBDC methodology is also available for download at http://china.aiddata.org/MBDC_codebook.

F54|The Informal Economy in Monsoon Asia and Melanesia: West New Guinea and the Malay World|his is the third in a series of papers concerned with the intellectual history of the 'informal economy' and its relevance to current concerns in Papua New Guinea (PNG; the eastern half of the island of New Guinea). Proceeding from the observation that monetized informal economic activity in PNG has been of relatively limited importance, the paper seeks explanations by comparing two stylized constructs, Monsoon Asia (where the informal economy is dynamic) and Melanesia (where it is limited in scope and contribution to livelihoods). Papua (occupying the western half of the island of New Guinea) is seen as a meeting point, or zone of transition, between Monsoon Asia and Melanesia. A long history of 'trading and raiding' on this frontier marked the encounter between ceremonial exchange, as practiced by Melanesians, and the system of tribute imposed on Papuans by Moluccan sultanates. Limited economic specialization and exchange in Melanesia contrasted with the Asian household economy, enmeshed in complex social hierarchies and systems of occupational differentiation. Historically, the Malay Archipelago engaged in a world trading system, into which it drew west New Guinea/Papua over millennia. Travelling peddlers played a key role in the archipelagic trade system, demonstrating the antiquity of the informal economy tradition in the cultures of Monsoon Asia. The paper seeks explanations for the comparative absence of that tradition in Melanesia. Finally, it examines the recent and rapid emergence of an informal economy in Papua, dominated by non-Melanesian immigrants, in the wake of the incorporation of (Dutch) west New Guinea into the Republic of Indonesia in 1963.

F54|La crisis financiera internacional. Ocho lecciones de y para América Latina|The international financial crisis of 2008-09 exposed the strengths and weaknesses of the current paradigm of development in Latina America, a paradigm based on liberalized capital accounts and significantly improved macroeconomic conditions. This paper presents lessons derived from the crisis, not only for the region it self, but also for other developing countries that might seek economic growth in the context of greater integration to the international capital markets. Some of the lessons are not new but have been reinforced by the crisis, such as Latin America’s imperative need for export diversification (not only in products but in partners). Other lessons break with longstanding myths about the region, such as its inability to undertake counter-cyclical policies —at least on the monetary side. Yet other lessons reflect new developments in the current growth paradigm, such as a renewed assessment of (1) the relative roles of foreign and domestic banks in shielding the financial system against external shocks and (2) the potential costs of adopting blanket international financial regulations that do not account for a country’s degree of development. Taken together, the lessons in this paper bring a new sense of optimism for growth in Latin America.// La crisis financiera internacional del 2008-2009 puso de manifiesto las fortalezas y debilidades del paradigma prevaleciente en materia de desarrollo en América Latina. Éste se basa en una cuenta de capitales liberada que a su vez ha mejorado de manera importante las condiciones macroeconómicas. Este artículo proporciona lecciones provenientes de la crisis, no solamente para la región, sino para otros países en desarrollo que buscan conseguir crecimiento económico en un contexto de mayor integración a los mercados internacionales de capital. Algunas de las lecciones no son nuevas pero han sido reforzadas con la crisis, como la necesidad de que América Latina diversifique sus exportaciones (no sólo de productos sino de socios comerciales). Otras lecciones desmitifican otros elementos, como por ejemplo la imposibilidad de aplicar políticas contracíclicas, al menos del lado monetario. Otras lecciones incluyen i) el papel relativo de la banca nacional y extranjera como amortiguadores de los choques financieros externos, y ii) el costo potencial de adoptar regulaciones financieras internacionales que no tomen en consideración el desarrollo de cada país. Tomadas en conjunto, las lecciones arrojan un nuevo sentido de optimismo para el crecimiento de América Latina.Keywords: América Latina, crisis financiera, mercados de capital
F54|How colonial education practices helped shape the pattern of decolonization in West Africa|This paper argues that the pattern of decolonization was a logical consequence of the nature of human capital transfers from the colonizersâ€™ to the elites of the former colonies, and this shaped the strategic interaction between these two groups. Where the educational ideology emphasized assimilation, the system tended to produce elites that depended highly on the colonizer for their livelihood, hence necessitating a continuation of the imperial relationship even after independence. On the contrary, where the ideology emphasized the strengthening of the â€˜solid elementsâ€™ of the countryside, the system tended to produce elites that were quite independent of the colonizer and consequently had little to loose from a disruption of the imperial relationship at independence. The results of the model shed light into why the French decolonization process in West Africa was generally smooth and transited from colonialism to neo-colonialism whereasBritish decolonizations in West Africa were generally antagonistic, culminating in complete independence from England. The unique contribution of the paper is in providing an alternative explanation of 20th century decolonization, anchored on human capital transfers, an approach that unifies both the Eurocentric and Afrocentric perspectives.
F54|Colonialism and development in Africa|In this paper we evaluate the impact of colonialism on development in Sub-Saharan Africa. In the world context, colonialism had very heterogeneous effects, operating through many mechanisms, sometimes encouraging development sometimes retarding it. In the African case, however, this heterogeneity is muted, making an assessment of the average effect more interesting. We emphasize that to draw conclusions it is necessary not just to know what actually happened to development during the colonial period, but also to take a view on what might have happened without colonialism and also to take into account the legacy of colonialism. We argue that in the light of plausible counter-factuals, colonialism probably had a uniformly negative effect on development in Africa. To develop this claim we distinguish between three sorts of colonies: (1) those which coincided with a pre-colonial centralized state, (2) those of white settlement, (3) the rest. Each have distinct performance within the colonial period, different counter-factuals and varied legacies.
F54|Sustaining growth: Interests versus institutions|Nations that were able to sustain high catch-up growth followed flexible and contextual policies. Inclusive institutions make correct policy choices more likely. India started out with highly inclusive political institutions since it adopted democracy with universal suffrage at independence. But extractive economic institutions, inherited from the British, were made more so by economic controls. In addition, a heterogeneous electorate allowed politicians to cultivate vote-banks and populist schemes instead of delivering better public services and governance. India's opening out was adequately nuanced and flexible but was sometimes used as a substitute for harder domestic reforms. It, however, added to the growing constituencies that benefit from growth, and are pushing for more inclusive economic institutions, that enable productivity, not just redistribution. Broader interest groups create better institutions and incentives. Examples from general governance, the regulation of industry, and agricultural marketing show the process, although messy and prolonged, is in the right direction.
F54|Hartz IV ist tot – Es leben die Hartz-Reformen!|Die Hartz IV Reform des Arbeitsmarktes ist eine der politisch umstrittensten Reformen, die seit der Wiedervereinigung in der Bundesrepublik durchgeführt wurden. Mit ihr werden Gefährdungen des Lebensstandards bis hin zu Armut verbunden. Gleichzeitig konnte die Bundesrepublik ihre Arbeitslosenquote über die letzten Jahre so stark senken wie fast kein anderes Land in Europa oder in anderen Ländern der OECD. Welche Rolle spielen die Hartz Reformen in dieser Erfolgsgeschichte? Andrey Launov und Klaus Wälde (2013a) zeigen, dass die Hartz IV Gesetzte de facto keinen erwähnenswerten Beitrag lieferten zur Reduktion der Arbeitslosigkeit. Gleichzeitig waren die anderen Reformen, Hartz I bis Hartz III, umso hilfreicher.
F54|Geography, institutions, and the making of comparative development|While the direct impact of geographic endowments on prosperity is present in all countries, in former colonies, geography has also affected colonization policies and, therefore, institutional outcomes. Using non-colonized countries as a control group, I re-examine the theories put forward by La Porta et al. (J Law Econ Org 15(1):222–279, 1999 and Acemoglu et al. (Am Econ Rev 91(5), 1369–1401, 2001 . I find strong support for both theories, but also evidence that the authors’ estimates of the impact of colonization on institutions and growth are biased, since they confound the effect of the historical determinants of institutions with the direct impact of geographic endowments on development. In a baseline estimation, I find that the approach of Acemoglu et al. ( 2001 ) overestimates the importance of institutions for economic growth by 28 %, as a country’s natural disease environment affected settler mortality during colonization and also has a direct impact on prosperity. The approach of La Porta et al. ( 1999 ) underestimates the importance of colonization-imposed legal origin for institutional development by 63 %, as Britain tended to colonize countries that are remote from Europe and thus suffer from low access to international markets.

F54|The encomienda and the optimizing imperialist: an interpretation of Spanish imperialism in the Americas|During the conquest and early administration of Spain’s American colonies the most controversial policy was the granting of temporary encomiendas, or temporary rights to collect tribute from Indians, as a reward for conquest. The contribution of the encomienda to the destruction of Indian populations was recognized by Spanish authorities at the time, yet the Crown persisted in introducing the most destructive form of the institution during the early stage of each colonial venture for over 200 years. Because the Crown financed the defense of its colonial possessions against other European imperialists, an addition to colonial capital, by increasing the return to an aggressor, imposed a defense-cost externality on the Crown. Since the cost of defending additional assets was higher in the Americas than in Spain, an efficient policy would have been to encourage the rapid transformation of human services into durable assets that could be transported to Spain. According to our defense-externality argument, the temporary encomienda and its parallel modification in each colonial episode becomes a rational Crown policy. The administration of Spain’s distant colonial possessions, especially the adjustments in the restrictions on encomiendas, required information about the local conditions, and we argue that the Church, as designated “protector of the Indians,” may have played an unwitting role in the communication of information.

F54|Central Asian Trade Relations in the Post-Soviet Era|By looking at post colonial trade relationships of the world countries for period of 1948-2006, Head and Mayer (HM [Head et al. (2010)]) conclude that a country's trade with the colonizer, typically, erodes by 60% after 30 years of independence. However, the CAR (Central Asian Republics(CAR) arehave been independent from itstheir colonizer, Russia for over 22 years, but their trade since 1995 has been is steady and increasing. As a highly-specific application of Head and Mayer's (HM[Head et al. (2010)]) study of post-colonial ties, CAR-Russia trade may appear to contradict the predictions or imply that there are interesting factors at work. We aimed to investigate what is explaining CAR-Russia trade based onn the CAR's' bilateral trade forin the Post-Soviet period under a gravity framework according to in terms of a combination of monadic (country-specific) effects, such as national GDP, and dyadic (bilateral) effects associated with relative trade costs. We find that (1) dyadic time-varying “RTA” and time-invariant “Landlockedness”, and monadic “importer's GDP” are highly significant in trade with the Central Asian Republics while “Tariffs” have low importance; (2) the CAR-Russia pair unobservable trade costs that are sensitive to global shocks had increased by 20%, their trade continued to be steady and increasing which is due to monadic effects (i.e., GDP growth, following the recovery in wWorld oil prices increase); (3) dynamics analysis of 185 country pairs trade show that 3/4 cases of observed changes in country pair trade is explained by country-specific features and 1/4 cases by bilateral trade relationships. Additionally, we find that country pair trade of the less liberal CARs (Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan) forwas 96% driven byexplained by a monadic effect, while for the more liberal CARs (Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan), trade for 50% is influenced by a dyadic effect.
F54|Distance to default and the financial crisis|This paper analyses contingent-claims based measures of distance to default (D2D) for the 41 largest global banking institutions over the period 2006H2 to 20011H2. D2D falls from end-2006 through to end-2008. Cross-sectional differences in D2D prior to the crisis do not predict either bank failure or bank share prices decline, but D2D measured in mid-2008 does have some predictive value for failure by end-year. The ‘option value’ of the bank safety net remains small except at the height of the crisis and there is little indication of bank shareholders consciously using the safety net to shift risk onto taxpayers.

F54|The United States and the Arab Spring|This article reveals, by studying correlative relationships between US regime support and regime properties, that the US foreign policy in the Middle East has traditionally helped governments to limit the political participation of Islamists, communists, enemies of Israel and populations that could be hostile to the US oil interests. This way the US economic and strategic security interests have contributed to human insecurity in the region. With the exception of the last interest, the US has relaxed its support for repression of the above-mentioned groups. This seems to be one of the international factors that made the Arab Spring possible.

F54|Doing Justice to Human Security: A Textbook in Tune with its Time|I begin this brief review of this important volume with the confession that I have not personally pursued a teaching style that has employed a self-acclaimed textbook for many, many years, preferring to construct courses around monographs, articles and other visual materials. However, were I provided the opportunity to teach a course at the upper division undergraduate level or early gradate level in the subject of human security, this would certainly be the book I would choose (with the caveat introduced below). Alex and Sabina Lautensach have given careful and thoughtful consideration to every aspect of the text: the preface and introduction, written by the editors, lay out both the logic of the text and frame the subject matter that will locate the reader firmly in the midst of the vast challenges that constiÂ­tute the issue of human security. They do so by emÂ­phasizing both the multiple dimensions along which the issue of human security can be located and the inseparable nature of these as they interact with each other in complex ways. In many respects this strikes me as one of the most important contributions to the textâ€”its steady insistence that human security as a construct is in a discursive state of constant emerÂ­gence, such that in some important ways all its varied dimensions insistently co-vary. To make such a claim is in itself dauntingâ€”to demonstrate its validity and mutual engagements through the complex subject matters of its 20 chapters, is a tour de force. Their conclusion is sufficiently rich to stand alone as an illustrative text in other course materials.
F54|The Radicalisation of Prison Inmates: A Review of the Literature on Recruitment, Religion and Prisoner Vulnerability|It should come as no surprise that prisons can become breeding grounds for radicalisation and terrorism as prisons serve as reservoirs for societyâ€™s most dangerous individuals (Useem & Clayton, 2009). Prisons are places of vulnerability and they provide a space where radical and extremist ideologies can flourish. Despite being a popular topic among researchers and policymakers, there still remain significant gaps in our understanding and many unanswered questions. This paper provides a literature review on prisoner radicalisation. It specifically explores the role religion plays in prison and its link to radicalisation, prisoner vulnerability to radicalisation, the radicalisation process, and outlines the current debate as to where terrorist prisoners should be held. This paper concludes by identifying the major gaps in the literature and offering concluding remarks.
F54|The Global Dimension of Poverty|The problem of world poverty is always of importance. In the last 20-30 years ideologies that glorified globalization appreciated that from the accentuation of globalization all the countries in the worldwould benefit as much as possible, and in each country as many citizens as possible would benefit. We now realize that poverty reduction not only did not occur at the anticipated level, but also, in some aspects, the problems facing the poor have widened. The differences between the rich and the poor have widened on a global level and Africa, which has been the primary supplier of raw materials for developed countries, currently occupies first place in the world regarding the share of the poor in the total population. The evolution of poverty, its causes and its impact on the population are the main issues that I have tried to capture in this paper.
F54|Успехи И Предизвикателства На Регионалната Икономическа Интеграция В Африка<BR>[Achievements and Challenges of Regional Economic Integration in Africa]|State and government leaders of the African Union adopt and implement efforts for regional integration as a common strategy for the development of the continent. The objective at continental level is the establishment of the African Economic Community as the last of six consecutive stages, including the strengthening of inter-sectorial cooperation and the establishment of regional free trade areas, monetary union, common market, monetary and economic union, covering the entire continent. Currently there are 16 Regional economic communities in Africa and 8 of them are officially recognized as the foundation for the development of the African economic community. The study analyses the progress made in the integration process as well as the challenges it faces.
F54|'Who are you?' – Constructing managerial identities in post-apartheid South Africa|This study focuses on the construction of identity concepts and values, in the process of developing managerial identities within a selected publically owned utility in South Africa. The methodology used is a multi-method case study approach which is conducted in the phenomenological, qualitative research paradigm. The findings show that managers define themselves in terms of “intra-personal” and “social identities” which are based on strong individual and socio-cultural value foundations. Data highlight that managerial identities are connected to the organisational identity. Seventeen years after the end of apartheid, managerial identities are no longer reduced and limited to fixed racial, cultural or professional identities founded on historic perspectives, but are rather viewed as a dynamic cross-cultural construct of interpersonal interactions. This article provides the reader with new insights into managerial identity constructions in a multicultural public utility setting in post-apartheid South Africa.
F54|Contradictions: Finance, Greed, And Labor Unequally Paid|This volume analyzes two decisive factors that have become embedded in the world spread of capitalism, a shift toward dominance of the financial sector, now entailing massive greed and calling into question whether the ‘rules’ of capitalism have been broken, and of global wage differentials so deep that recognition of a labor aristocracy cannot be avoided. These chapters are supplemented by two additional showing that gold still regulates the dollar’s value, and that unpaid reproductive labor of women adversely affects labor productivity. (New paragraph) Analysis of finance engenders discussion of its place in value theory, posed around the rate of profit, and is more complex than often presented. Furthermore, the varying rates of profit at the firm level, not just for financials, are distributed in a manner exhibiting more frequent extreme cases than a Bell-curve would suggest. Implications for incorporation of randomization into political economy are drawn. The final chapters provide evidence that Marx was more correct than Kalecki and Minsky when arguing the lead of profits for investment, and that product innovations can mitigate problems of over-production resulting from process innovations.
F54|Features of tertiarisation in the developed economies and worldwide offshoring|In the last decades, the world economy has been undergoing a process of production reorganisation and relocation of unprecedented scale and scope. The era of 'globalisation' has been characterised by falling barriers to trade and increasing capital flows, both of speculative and investment nature. Huge trade deficits and surpluses have emerged, which have raised a renewed interest in international trade issues as well as concern within the scientific community, as is witnessed in the literature about global imbalances. Since the Nineties, few rich countries (United States, Great Britain, France, Japan, Switzerland, Germany and the Netherlands) have been securing a substantial stake in worldwide production through FDI, a phenomenon mirrored by increasing FDI negative positions for nations such as China, Mexico, Brazil and Ireland. The building up of this dualistic international structure can be detected also analysing the dynamics of net exports of royalties and license fees. This fact might suggest a new perspective from which to study the rise of the 'tertiary economy', which could then be considered as 'post-industrial' having offshored manufacturing production, while paying for the imports of goods with the profit stream accruing from FDI, the sale of property rights and the exports of other sophisticated services. This interpretation, however, would explain the recent development path of only a subset of FDI net exporter countries, namely the US, Great Britain, France and, partially, Japan, whereas Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands are running a growing merchandise trade surplus. This heterogeneity calls for further investigation. The paper therefore, combining information from trade flows and net asset positions worldwide and their evolution since the Seventies-Eighties, proposes a tentative classification of countries based on their relative strength in manufacturing and several services categories so as to identify, among them, a core and a periphery in the chain of worldwide production. To do that several indicators are considered, such as each country's comparative advantages, its dependence on net exports and its market share in the world economy by relevant trade category. The picture resulting is that of a growing specialisation among advanced as well as emerging economies. Paradigmatic examples of this heterogeneity are the United States, increasingly involved in financial activities, vis-Ã -vis the export-driven Germany, or the industrial producer China and the offshoring of services towards India.
F54|The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation: Comment| Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson's (2001) seminal article argues property-rights institutions powerfully affect national income, using estimated mortality rates of early European settlers to instrument capital expropriation risk. However, 36 of the 64 countries in the sample are assigned mortality rates from other countries, often based on mistaken or conflicting evidence. Also, incomparable mortality rates from populations of laborers, bishops, and soldiers--often on campaign--are combined in a manner that favors the hypothesis. When these data issues are controlled for, the relationship between mortality and expropriation risk lacks robustness, and instrumental-variable estimates become unreliable, often with infinite confidence intervals. (JEL D02, E23, F54, I12, N40, O43, P14)
F54|The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation: Reply|" Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001) established that economic institutions today are correlated with expected mortality of European colonialists. David Albouy argues this relationship is not robust. He drops all data from Latin America and much of the data from Africa, making up almost 60 percent of our sample, despite much information on the mortality of Europeans in those places during the colonial period. He also includes a ""campaign"" dummy that is coded inconsistently; even modest corrections undermine his claims. We also show that limiting the effect of outliers strengthens our results, making them robust to even extreme versions of Albouy's critiques. (JEL D02, E23, F54, I12, N40, O43, P14)"

F54|Vývoj Regionalizmu V Latinskej Amerike|Integrácia má v Latinskej Amerike historicky veľký význam. Procesy s ňou spojené sa výraznejšie začali rozvíjať v druhej polovici 20. storočia, pričom rozlišujeme tri vlny regionalizmu. Starý regionalizmus šesťdesiatych a sedemdesiatych rokov 20. storočia má takmer výlučne ekonomický charakter a je spojený s protekcionistickými opatreniami a s politikou substitúcie dovozu. Po skončení studenej vojny sa začal rozvíjať nový regionalizmus, ktorý má multidimenzionálny aspekt a v rámci ktorého došlo k rozšíreniu spolupráce aj do iných ako ekonomických oblastí. V deväťdesiatych rokoch 20. storočia sa rozvíjal v podobe otvoreného regionalizmu, ktorý vychádzal zo zásad Washingtonského konsenzu. Na začiatku 21. storočia však boli pre mnohé nedostatky tieto odmietnuté a začína sa rozvíjať postliberálny regionalizmus, ktorý posúva latinskoamerickú integráciu kvalitatívne dopredu, no musí sa vysporiadať s mnohými komplikáciami globalizovaného sveta.
F54|Postavenie Brazílie v Latinskej Amerike na začiatku 21. storočia|Brazília vstúpila do 21. storočia po veľkej transformácii v deväťdesiatych rokoch 20. storočia. Nasledovali roky dynamického rozvoja, ktoré pribrzdila až svetová finančná kríza. Na minimálny pokles HDP a skutočnosť, že Brazília bola krízou zasiahnutá ako jedna z posledných krajín a prekonala ju ako jedna z prvých, mali okrem veľkého vnútorného trhu vplyv zdravý bankový systém, malá otvorenosť ekonomiky, relatívna diverzifikácia brazílskych exportov, dobrá makroekonomická politika a rozsiahle vládne investície. Avšak aj napriek tomuto pokroku, v Brazílii pretrvávajú určité problémy, ako napr. vysoký verejný dlh, nadhodnotená mena, slabá konkurencieschopnosť domácich firiem, komplikovaný daňový systém, problémy s bezpečnosťou a iné. Brazílii sa však aj napriek tomu úspešne darí posilňovať svoju pozíciu v regióne Latinskej Ameriky a vo svete a jej vplyv a význam neustále rastie.
F54|Súčasné a očakávané budúce trendy prílevu čínskych priamych investícií do Afriky|Čínske investície vo svete naberajú na význame. Niektoré krajiny ich vnímajú ako príležitosť, iné zas ako hrozbu. Najviac kritizované investície Číny prúdia predovšetkým do afrických krajín a je za ne často titulovaná novodobým kolonizátorom Afriky. Na základe sledovania nárastu čínskeho investičného záujmu v jednotlivých afrických ekonomikách v predkladanom článku identifikujeme tie, ktoré sa do stredobodu čínskeho záujmu dostali len nedávno. Následne analyzujeme čínske investície v týchto štátoch zo sektorálneho hľadiska a skúmame determinanty čínskych investícií v nich. Napokon na základe analýzy súčasných trendov čínskych investícií identifikujeme tie štáty, do ktorých možno očakávať ďalší nárast investícií a prichádzame k záveru, že Čína novodobým kolonizátorom Afriky nie je.
F54|Estimating the impact of currency unions on trade using a dynamic gravity framework|This paper revisits the early time series estimates of currency unions on trade from an historical perspective using a dynamic gravity equation and by conducting in-depth case studies of currency union breakups. The early large estimates were driven by omitted variables, as many currency union exits were coterminous with warfare, communist takeovers, coup d'etats, genocide, bloody wars of independence, various other geopolitical travesties, or were predated by trade collapses. Static gravity estimates are found to be sensitive to controlling for these omitted variables, while a dynamic gravity specification implies that currency unions do not increase trade.
F54|Bilateral trade, colonial heritage and common currency arrangement: An Oceanian perspective|We reassess the trade impact of common currency arrangements – the Rose effect – on the basis of new empirical evidence stemming from the Oceanian Island Countries. In particular, we investigate how the conjunction of a common colonial heritage and membership in a common currency arrangement can impact bilateral trade. To do this, we use different specifications of the gravity equation over an original panel dataset covering the period from 1980 to 2009. Our results first show that the trade impact of common currency arrangements is much more prominent and significant for country pairs that share a common colonial heritage than for country pairs with distinct former colonizers. Second, while a common colonial heritage does significantly and positively affect trade, whether the underlying country pair is in a common currency arrangement or not, the pro-trade effect of a common colonial heritage is nonetheless enhanced by the existence of such a common currency arrangement. These results suggest, more generally, that further steps towards monetary integration in the zone could not be contemplated without taking historical factors into account.
F54|Chronic Specie Scarcity and Efficient Barter: The Problem of Maintaining an Outside Money Supply in British Colonial America|Colonial Americans complained that gold and silver coins (specie) were chronically scarce. These coins could be acquired only through importation. Given unrestricted trade in specie, market arbitrage should have eliminated chronic scarcity. A model of efficient barter and local inside money is developed to show how chronic specie scarcity in colonial America could prevail despite unrestricted specie-market arbitrage, thus justifying colonial complaints. The creation of inside paper monies by colonial governments was a welfare-enhancing response to preexisting chronic specie scarcity, not the cause of that scarcity.
F54|ISI and New Industrial Conditions in Latin America and Africa|This paper examines the relationship between industrial value added and economic liberalization for a variety of relatively small economies that adopted import-substituting industrialization (ISI) and export led growth in the past. The strong economic performance by some Sub-Saharan African countries in an era of globalization induces inquiry into the contribution of industry to economic growth for a variety of small economies with different political structures and industrial policies. Using cointegration and time series data, this paper finds that industry value added has a long-run relationship with economic liberalization in the case of Ghana, but not for all countries considered.
F54|Foundations of Collective Action in Asia : Theory and Practice of Regional Cooperation|This paper argues that the collective action in Asia by its regional organizations has historically suffered from a â€œcapabilityâ€“legitimacy gapâ€ : a disjuncture between the capability (in terms of material resources) of major Asian powers to lead regional cooperation on the one hand and their political legitimacy and will as regional leaders on the other. Successful collective action requires leadership with both capability (as suggested by rationalist theories) and legitimacy (as suggested by constructivist approaches). A central point of the paper is that the putative or aspiring leaders of Asian regionalism throughout the post-war period never had both. Actors who were materially capable of providing leadership and direction (the United States [US]1 and Japan) have lacked the necessary legitimacy, while those who have possessed legitimacy (India and the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China [PRC])2 in the 1940s and 1950s, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) since 1967, and Indonesia in the context of Asia as a whole) have lacked the necessary resources. The result has been that while the ASEAN-led Asian institutions have made a significant normative contribution to regional order, they have not proved to be effective instruments of regional problem solving. But the capability-legitimacy gap has both costs and benefits. While Asian regional institutions remain weakly institutionalized and attract criticism as â€œtalk-shops,â€ they have helped to ensure that Asia does not degenerate into a hegemonic order or a concert of power. It remains to be seen whether regionalism in an era of a rising PRC and India could bridge this gap. It is theoretically possible that the PRC and India could develop and possess both the resources and political will and standing to provide collective goods and lead Asian regionalism, but their mutual rivalry might prevent this.

F54|The Evil Technology Hypothesis: A Deep Ecological Reading of International Law|This short paper advances the hypothesis that international law, far from being a purely neutral 'indeterminate' technology that can lend itself to both good and bad uses, might actually be structurally biased to produce exploitative outcomes. This hypothesis is presented through several steps. The first part presents Martti Koskenniemi's indeterminacy thesis, followed by Anthony Anghie's depiction of international law as a technology. The possibility of an inherent bias of technology, such that it will lend itself to exploitative uses, even with the best of intentions, is then introduced in Section III, using the writing of radical ecological thinkers Ran Prieur and Derrick Jensen. This theory is then discussed specifically in relation to international law in Section IV.
F54|An Outline Of The Europe – South Africa Relations During And Post The Apartheid Era|South Africa was always a main interest region for European countries. The United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France and many others at lesser extent, tried to establish control over the country due to its special geographical position. On the other hand, since 1948, South Africa had been characterized by a tremendous regime, the so-called apartheid. The idea of this paper is to clarify the position of certain European countries towards South Africa during this severe period for the latest and to outline the major development agreements between the EC/EU and South Africa after the fall of apartheid, since South Africa is an important trade partner for the Union.

F54|Кризата В Европа – Последици За Африка<BR>[The EU Crisis – Impact on Africa]|The ongoing debt crisis in some EU countries carries serious risks for the economic development of Africa. Although so far it only affected individual countries, there is an increased risk that the crisis could spread rapidly to include not only more European countries, but other parts of the world. The escalation of the crisis in the Euro-zone, on the one hand, reduces confidence in the developed countries, while on the other, negative shocks create tension in developing countries, which will undoubtedly have an effect on the economic development of Africa. The main channels through which it affects the continent are: trade - in terms of the declining demand for African exports from Europe; reduction of official development assistance; reduction of financial income as foreign direct investment, remittances, tax revenues; restructuring of the global demand etc.

F54|L'emigrazione italiana nell'Africa mediterranea|From the period of Unification until the mid-seventies of last century, Italy – latter a country of immigration – has witnessed considerable migratory flows towards foreign countries. In the paper are analyzed, from a predominantly demographic perspective, the outflows which covered the Mediterranean countries of Africa aiming at tracing back the extent and nature. Following the process of decolonization, the important Italian presence in the countries of the Southern shore of the Mediterranean is extremely limited and presents very different features from those that characterized the period of our “mass migration”.
F54|China’s Foreign Trade: Perspectives From the Past 150 Years|This paper studies the trade of China in the past 150 years, starting from the first opening of China after the Opium War. The main purpose of the paper is to identify what is (and was) China's 'normal' level of foreign trade, and how these levels changed under different trade regimes, from 1840 to the present. We present new evidence on China's foreign trade during the treaty port era (1842-1948), drawn from disaggregated trade data collected by the Chinese Maritime Customs Service, that yields important findings for current research. First, although the volume of foreign trade remained limited initially, there was a notable expansion in the diversity of products, with many new goods being imported into China. Second, the regional diffusion of foreign goods through China was greatly facilitated by the expansions of the port system. Third, the importance of Hong Kong as an intermediary in China's trade has undergone long-term fluctuations suggestive of learning effects. China's recent wave of liberalization has led by the early 1990s to a trade level comparable to the high of the 1920s. While much of China's recent growth in world trade is in line with her income growth, there is no doubt that China's trade openness today, comparable by some measures to Denmark's, is a stunning reversal relative to the pre-1978 and also the pre-1840 period. The paper emphasizes the roles that history and institutional change have played in this.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

F54|Questioning Ethnic Fragmentation's Exogeneity - Drivers of Changing Ethnic Boundaries|Ethnic fragmentation is a variable increasingly used in the economic literature to explain differences in economic development level, growth or the incidence of conflicts. Nearly all articles have in common that they treat ethnic fragmentation as a static, exogenous fact. Only recently some contributions outlined first ideas, why different levels of ethnic fragmentation evolved based on biodiversity and evolutionary theories. This article has two main goals. In connecting with these recent findings, the article boldly confirms their results that a ‘base-level’ of fragmentation evolved due to geographical and evolutionary factors. Additionally, it draws the attention to the impact of colonization on fragmentation, especially on how a country was colonized. The main goal, however, is to show that ethnic fragmentation is not only evolving over centuries, but changes over a short period of time. As static factors, e.g. geographical ones, can’t be responsible for changes in the short run, the article offers a structured assessment of factors that may influence diversity levels in the short term. Although migration is the most obvious factor, urbanization and especially education play an even more important role in influencing a country’s ethnic boundaries.

We show how in this period, coinciding with the first era of globalization, of discord within the Spanish Empire and of incipient prosperity in the archipelago, the economic and social foundations were laid for Rizal and his contemporaries to conceive of and demand greater autonomy and, ultimately, independence.
