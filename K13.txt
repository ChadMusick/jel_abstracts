K13|Smart products: liability, timing of market introduction, and investments in product safety|This paper addresses the role of product liability for the emergence and development of smart products such as autonomous vehicles (AVs). We analyze how the liability regime affects innovative activities, as well as the timing of market introduction and market penetration of such smart products. We develop a dynamic model in which at each point in time, a potential (monopolistic) innovator decides on how much to invest in the safety stock of the smart product and on the product price, once it has been launched. Calibrating the model to the U.S. car market, our analysis reveals policy-relevant trade-offs when shifting more liability on the producers of AVs. First, while this improves the safety of AVs in the long run, the safety stock is accumulated more slowly. Second, it delays the market introduction of AVs, and also slows down market penetration, which hampers the innovator’s incentives for safety investments in the short- and intermediate term. As a result, the safety level of AVs at a given point in time decreases as the liability regime becomes more stringent. Furthermore, there is a threshold for the innovator’s burden of liability beyond which she forgoes to develop the AV altogether. Finally, we find that direct AV safety regulation is welfare-superior compared to a stringent liability regime, as it induces higher levels of AV safety in the short and intermediate term.
K13|Compensation in Personal Injury Cases: Mean or Median Income?|Courts typically base compensation for loss of income in personal injury cases on either mean or median work income. Yet, quantatively, mean and median incomes are typically very different. For example, in the US median income is 65 percent of mean income. In this paper we use economic theory to determine the relation between the appropriate make-whole (full) compensation and mean and median work incomes. Given that consumption uncertainty associated with compensation generally exceeds that associated with work income, we show that the appropriate make-whole compensation exceeds mean (and therefore median) work income. Hence, if the compensation must be either the mean or the median work income, then mean work income should be selected.
K13|Risk-Mitigating Technologies: the Case of Radiation Diagnostic Devices|We study the impact of consumers' risk perception on firm innovation. Our analysis exploits a major surge in the perceived risk of radiation diagnostic devices, following extensive media coverage of a set of over-radiation accidents involving CT scanners in late 2009. Difference-in-differences regressions using data on patents and FDA product clearances show that the increased perception of radiation risk spurred the development of new technologies that mitigated such risk and led to a greater number of new products. We provide qualitative evidence and describe patterns of equipment usage and upgrade that are consistent with this mechanism. Our analysis suggests that changes in risk perception can be an important driver of innovation and shape the direction of technological progress.
K13|Laws and Norms: Experimental Evidence with Liability Rules|We conduct an experiment where participants choose between actions that provide private benefits but may also impose losses on strangers. Three legal environments are compared: no law, strict liability for the harm caused to others and an efficiently designed negligence rule where damages are paid only when the harmful action causes a net social loss. Legal obligations are either perfectly enforced (Severe Law) or only weakly so (Mild Law), i.e.,material incentives are then nondeterrent. We investigate how legal obligations and social norms interact. Our results show that liability rules strengthen pro-social behavior and suggest that strict liability has a greater effect than the negligence rule.

K13|On the Redesign of Accident Liability for the World of Autonomous Vehicles|This article studies a model of liability for automobile accidents in the coming world in which automobiles will be autonomous. In that world, travelers will not be drivers, rendering liability premised on driver fault irrelevant as a means of reducing accident dangers. Moreover, no other conventional principle of individual or of manufacturer liability would serve well to do so. Indeed, in the model considered, strict manufacturer liability, recommended by many commentators, would actually tend to leave accident risks unchanged from their levels in the absence of liability. However, a new form of strict liability––the hallmark of which is that damages would be paid to the state––would be superior to conventional rules of liability in alleviating accident risks and would be easy to administer.

K13|Actions en justice et rémunération des avocats : une revue de la littérature|Plusieurs pays européens ont désormais adopté (ou envisagent d’adopter) l’honoraire de résultat comme mécanisme de rémunération des avocats dans le cadre d’actions en responsabilité civile. Ce type d’honoraire implique que l’avocat ne soit rémunéré qu’en cas de transaction amiable ou de victoire au procès, percevant soit un bonus horaire (ou forfaitaire), soit une part de l’indemnisation obtenue par son client. Dans cet article, nous dressons un état des lieux de la littérature économique théorique portant sur l’analyse de ces modalités de rémunération, via l’étude de leurs implications sur les comportements des parties prenantes au litige (que ce soit lors de sa résolution ou, plus en amont, lors de son émergence). Sur cette base, il apparaît que l’honoraire de résultat présente plusieurs avantages potentiels, notamment en termes d’accès au droit, de sélection des affaires, de transfert de risque et de régulation du phénomène d’aléa moral, nous amenant à penser que sa généralisation à l’ensemble des pays occidentaux est souhaitable à de nombreux égards. Pour être plus affirmatif, il faudrait néanmoins que ces avantages soient plus largement confirmés sur un plan empirique.
K13|Costly Pretrial Agreements|Legal disputes are either settled or end up in Court. Settling a dispute involves some costs (time and money invested in preparations) that the parties have to incur ex-ante, in order for the pretrial negotiation and possible agreement to become feasible. Even in a full information world, if the distribution of these costs is sufficiently mismatched with the distribution of the parties' bargaining powers, a pretrial agreement may never be reached even though actual Court litigation is overall wasteful. As parameters vary, the equilibrium of our full information model with costly pretrial agreements sheds light on two key features of how disputes are initiated and subsequently handled. First, in some cases a Plaintiff may initiate a law suit even though the parties fully anticipate that it will be settled out of Court. Second, the “likelihood” that a given law suit ends up in Court is unaffected by the way trial costs are distributed among the litigants (e.g. English Rule or American Rule). The choice of fee-shifting rule can only affect whether the Plaintiff files a law suit in the first place. It does not affect whether a given suit is settled before trial or litigated in Court.
K13|Legal Efficiency and Consistency|We consider a stylized model of judicial decision making under common and civil law to study whether and why legal institutions affect economic outcomes. Judges are of two types: some judges are conservative and mechanically follow the precedent or the statute, while others maximize social welfare. The civil law and common law traditions have different centers of authority (legislatures vs. judges), but they also differ with respect to the timing of legal decisions (ex-ante vs. ex-post). As a motivating example, we study the enforcement of property rights in courts. We analyze the efficiency and consistency of courts' decisions in both legal systems. We find that legal certainty is higher under common law than under civil law. We show that common law achieves higher expected welfare than civil law regime when the proportion of conservative judges is neither too low nor too high, and judges are sufficiently forward looking. In changing economic environments, civil law courts do not respond to economic shocks. Conversely, common law courts change the law only if shocks are persistent. Shock persistence is what makes common law more likely to dominate civil law because of its greater adaptability.
K13|The unilateral accidenct model under a constrained Cournot-Nash duopoly|Summary: This paper extends the basic unilateral accident model to allow for Cournot competition. Two firms compete with production input and prevention as strategic variables under asymmetric capacity constraints. We find that liability regimes exert a crucial influence on the equilibrium price and outputs. Strict liability leads to higher output and higher risk compared to negligence. We also study the conditions under which both regimes converge. Key Words: Tort Law, Strict
K13|Legal Advertising and Frivolous Lawsuits|Following a recent wave of deregulation, lawyers now use a large variety of media to advertise their services. A common argument against this increasing reliance on advertising is that it might stir up frivolous lawsuits. In this article, we investigate the relevance of this argument by developing an asymmetric information game of litigation. The main results show that this stirring-up effect does not necessarily occur in equilibrium and advertising may improve welfare by decreasing the social cost of accidents. Therefore, the liberalization of legal advertising should not necessarily be considered as a threat to the efficiency of the tort system.
K13|On consumer preferences for (partial) products liability|Traditional law and economics analyses of products liability find that different liability regimes lead to the same market outcome, implying that risk-neutral consumers are indifferent between products liability and no products liability. We present a setup in which a group of consumers supports the implementation of products liability although its enforcement is costly. All consumers may prefer the same level of (partial) products liability.
K13|Expertise économique et droit français de la concurrence|L’expertise économique dans le domaine de la concurrence se compose, d’une part, des recherches théoriques et empiriques menées, dans un cadre académique, par les universitaires et les chercheurs sur l’objet, la nature et la portée des règles ainsi que sur les décisions de justice et, d’autre part, dans un cadre amiable ou contentieux, des missions réalisées par des « hommes de l’art ». L’objet de cet article consiste à présenter, dans le cadre du droit français, un panorama des différentes modalités d’expertise pouvant être mobilisées dans le cadre d’une affaire de concurrence et la place qu’y occupent les économistes. Nous centrerons notre analyse sur les experts judiciaires et les cabinets d’expertise économique et soutiendrons que les économistes peuvent utilement contribuer à la résolution des contentieux, mais qu’ils n’ont pas encore toute la place qu’ils pourraient avoir.
K13|Stigmatization, Liability and Public Enforcement of Law|In the theory of public enforcement of law the choice of the liability rules is between strict liability and fault-based liability. In this paper, we study the determinants of compliance when in addition to standard economic incentives wrongdoers take into account stigmatization costs. In this context, this cost is not simply a transfer of resources. We show that a non-guiltiness standard — the fault standard equal to the deterrence level — is never optimal. In this scenario, we show how the optimal policy choice depends on the interplay between the magnitude of the harm and the stigmatization cost.
K13|The Tort Law and the Nucleolus for Generalized Joint Liability Problems|We analyze a legal compensation scheme axiomatically under the situation where causation of the cumulative injury appears in multiple sequences of wrongful acts caused by tortfeasors. This situation is a generalization of joint liability problems on tort law, and it is described by a rooted-tree graph. We show that there is a unique compensation scheme that satisfies three axioms, one about lower bounds of individual compensations, one about upper bounds of individual compensations, and one about case-system consistency. These axioms are derived from legal observations on tort law. The unique compensation scheme satisfying the three axioms yields the Nucleolus of an associated liability game.
K13|When does Product Liability Risk Chill Innovation? Evidence from Medical Implants|Liability laws designed to compensate for harms caused by defective products may also affect innovation. We examine this issue by exploiting a major quasi-exogenous increase in liability risk faced by US suppliers of polymers used to manufacture medical implants. Difference-in-differences analyses show that this surge in suppliers’ liability risk had a large and negative impact on downstream innovation in medical implants, but it had no significant effect on upstream polymer patenting. Our findings suggest that liability risk can percolate throughout a vertical chain and may have a significant chilling effect on downstream innovation.
K13|Accuracy and Costs of Dispute Resolution with Heterogeneous Consumers. A Conjectural Approach to Mass Litigation|This study focuses on the tradeoff between accuracy and costs in consumer mass dispute resolution. The model investigates how a defendant-firm formulates its settlement offer given the fact that faces a large population of heterogeneously risk-averse claimants. Although firms can learn something about consumers’ reaction to a given settlement offer thanks to repeated litigation, equilibrium settlement can be far –i.e. lower– from the correct claim value. From the societal perspective, this brings up the issue related to the desirability of out-ofthe-court cheaper resolution and the risk of underpricing the value at stake. The paper also deals with the effects of aggregate litigation as an additional means to resolve consumer mass litigation. Results show that the overall cost of dispute resolution (aggregated costs of in-court-litigation plus costs of inaccuracy) is generally decreasing in the unit litigation cost. This suggests that litigation costs may be used as a leverage to favour not only more, but also more accurate, settlements. Finally, aggregate litigation might push the business defendant to negotiate a more generous settlement
K13|Efficient Liability in Expert Markets|"We study the design of efficient liability in expert markets. An expert may misbehave in two ways: prescribing the ""wrong"" treatment for a consumer's problem, or failing to exert proper effort to diagnose the problem. We show that under a range of liabilities, the expert will choose the efficient treatment based on his information if the price margins for alternative treatments are close enough. Moreover, a well-designed liability rule motivates the expert to also exert diagnosis effort efficiently. The efficient liability is facilitated by certain restriction on equilibrium prices; unfettered competition between experts, while maximizing consumer surplus, may undermine efficiency."

В доклада се разглежда проблематика, свързана с установяване на качество на стока в производство при предявена рекламация. На база актуален анализ на нормативната уредба и съвременните фактори влияещи върху правото на потребителя на предяви рекламация при установено от него несъответствие на качеството на стоката, се правят изводи и препоръки с практическа насоченост.
K13|Current state of the cyber insurance market|The aim of the paper is to present the current state of the cyber insurance market. Based on recent industry reports, we identify its opportunities and threats, and discuss the most important challenges that have to be overcome by the insurance industry. The role of cyber risk reinsurance in providing capacity for insurance carriers is also shown. Finally, we try to identify current trends in demand for cyber coverage and verify if all needs of cyber insurance buyers are satisfied. In order to attract more cyber insurance customers, insurers should at least: clarify the language and the scope of cyber insurance policy, expand the advantages of cyber policy beyond simple risk transfer, develop personal cyber insurance offer.
K13|Punitive Damages ? A Rising Star in International Commercial Arbitration?|Punitive damages in international commercial arbitration has been considered more a theoretical than a practical issue, especially in civil law countries. Nevertheless, the national law regulations must provide a way how to react on such claims, particularly in the area of international commercial arbitration. This article is considered primarily with the analysis of the current status quo of certain civil law countries related to punitive damages since not only applicable substantive law, but also procedural law of the seat of arbitration has an impact on the availability of punitive damages in international arbitration. It also discusses legal reasons why punitive damages are of limited relevance in international commercial arbitration that consequently leads to a minimal number of arbitral awards of punitive damages. Despite of infrequency, the importance and clear approach to whether punitive damages should have a place in international commercial arbitration must be drawn.
K13|The Unilateral Accident Model under a Constrained Cournot-Nash Duopoly|This paper extends the basic unilateral accident model to allow for Cournot competition. Two firms compete with production input and prevention as strategic variables under asymmetric capacity constraints. We find that liability regimes exert a crucial influence on the equilibrium price and outputs. Strict liability leads to higher output and higher risk compared to negligence. We also study the conditions under which both regimes converge.
K13|Minimum Asset and Liability Insurance Requirements on Judgment-Proof Individuals When Harm is Endogenous|Minimum asset requirements are an increasingly common form of regulation intended to motivate better decision making by individuals who participate in potentially harmful ac- tivities. Shavell (2005) studied the optimality of this type of regulation within a framework in which an individual can influence the probability of an accident but not the magnitude of the resultant harm. We reinvestigate Shavell's model for the opposite accident scenario, in which an individual can influence the magnitude of harm but not the probability of an accident, and find policy implications different than Shavell's. In particular, we show that in certain situations it could be optimal to completely ban judgment-proof individuals from participating in a potentially harmful activity. We also examine the effect of liability insurance, and find that regulatory authorities should tighten standards relative to the pure asset requirement and that liability insurance increases social welfare.
K13|Medical Malpractice Liability and Physiciansâ€™ Behavior:Experimental Evidence|Medical liability systems have been accused of increasing health expenditure insofar as they induce the practice of defensive medicine. Despite the large evidence on the role of medical malpractice liability, the identification of its causal effect on physiciansâ€™ treatment decisions is a difficult task. In this paper we study for the first time in a controlled laboratory setting the effect of introducing the risk of being sued for medical malpractice on the provision of physiciansâ€™ medical services. In our experimental sessions both medical and non-medical students choose how many medical services to provide for heterogeneous patients. We implement exogenous variations in the presence of medical malpractice liability and expected probability of being sued, and thus we exploit the within-subject variation in the provision of medical services to infer the causal effect of malpractice liability. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of malpractice liability under different physiciansâ€™ payment methods, which allows us to discuss the interplay between medical liability and payment systems. Our behavioral data show that introducing malpractice liability pressure does lead physicians to choose a higher amount of medical services, regardless of the physiciansâ€™ payment system. However, we also find that the payment system in which malpractice liability is implemented makes the difference under the societal perspective, with relevant implications for health policy.
K13|Liability for third-party harm when harm-inflicting consumers are present biased|This paper analyzes the workings of liability when harm-inflicting consumers are present biased and both product safety and consumer care influence expected harm. We show that present bias introduces a rationale for shifting some losses onto the manufacturer, in stark contrast with the baseline scenario in which strict consumer liability induces socially optimal product safety and precaution levels. In addition, we establish that strict liability with contributory negligence may induce socially optimal product safety and precaution choices without aggravating the output level distortion.
K13|How does product liability risk affect innovation? Evidence from medical implants|Liability laws designed to compensate for harms caused by defective products may also affect innovation incentives. This paper examines this issue, exploiting a major quasi-exogenous increase in liability risk faced by US suppliers of polymers used to manufacture medical devices implanted in human bodies. Difference-in-differences analyses suggest that the surge in liability risk had a large and negative impact on downstream innovation in medical implants but no significant effect on upstream polymer patenting. These findings show how tort laws may affect the development of new technologies and how liability risk may percolate through an industry's vertical chain.
K13|Regulation with Experimentation: Ex Ante Approval, Ex Post Withdrawal, and Liability|Dynamic adoption policies of activities with uncertain returns are characterized by three key decisions: in the ex ante experimentation phase, the decisions when to abandon experimentation and when to introduce to market; in the ex post learning phase, the decision when to withdraw following the accumulation of bad news. In a tractable continuous-time model, we study the optimal mix of the three instruments regulators employ to align the private incentives of firms: ex ante approval regulation, ex post withdrawal regulation, and liability. Our results can rationalize the array of regulatory environments observed across applications ranging from product safety to patent protection. We also consider costly lying and show that the social planner can be better off when the firm privately observes research results.

K13|Tort Liability and Unawareness|Unawareness is a form of bounded rationality where a person fails to conceive all feasible acts or consequences or to perceive as feasible all conceivable act-consequence links. We study the implications of unawareness for tort law, where relevant examples include the discovery of a new product or technology (new act), of a new disease or injury (new consequence), or that a product can cause an injury (new link). We argue that negligence has an important advantage over strict liability in a world with unawareness–negligence, through the stipulation of due care standards, spreads awareness about the updated probability of harm.
K13|Consumers’ costly responses to product-harm crises|Using an ideal setting from a major food safety crisis, we estimate a full demand model for the unsafe product and its substitutes and recover consumers' preference parameters. Counterfactual exercises quantify the relevance of di erent mechanisms -changes in safety perceptions, idiosyncratic tastes, nutritional characteristics, and prices-driving consumers' response. We find that consumers' reaction is limited by their taste for the product and its nutritional characteristics. Due to the costs associated with switching away from the a ected product, the decline in demand following a product-harm crisis tends to understate the true weight of such events in consumers' utility. Indeed, we nd that a large fraction of consumers are unresponsive to the crisis even when they significantly downgrade their product safety perception. For an accurate assessment of the crisis, managerial strategies should therefore account for how di erent demand drivers bind consumers' substitution patterns.
K13|A Note on Trial Delay and Social Welfare: The Impact of Multiple Equilibria|Greater trial delay is commonly associated with decreasing demand for trials, thereby bringing about an equilibrium for a given trial capacity. This note highlights that – in contrast to this premise – trial delay may in fact increase trial demand. Such an outcome is established for a scenario in which the number of cases is endogenous based on the deterrence effect of lawsuits. That trial demand may increase with longer delay makes multiple stable equilibria possible. This reality has important policy implications, which are discussed.
K13|Why Agents Need Discretion: The Business Judgment Rule as Optimal Standard of Care|Should managers be liable for ill-conceived business decisions? One answer is given by U.S. courts, which almost never hold managers liable for their mistakes. In this paper, we address the question in a theoretical model of delegated decision making. We find that courts should indeed be lenient as long as contracts are restricted to be linear. With more general compensation schemes, the answer depends on the precision of the court’s signal. If courts make many mistakes in evaluating decisions, they should not impose liability for poor business judgment.
K13|Exploring the nexus between certainty in injury compensation and treatment selection|We study the effect of reduced medical liability due to the implementation of scheduled damages on the overuse of cesarean sections. Using data from inpatient discharge records on deliveries in Italy, we exploit the fact that hospitals are distributed across court districts and that only some courts introduced schedules during the period of observation. This allows us to identify the effect of a decrease in liability using a difference-in-difference approach while minimizing the heterogeneities between treated and control hospitals. We show that decreased medical liability increases the incidence of unnecessary cesarean sections by 7 percentage points, which corresponds to a 20% increase at the mean of cesarean sections. The magnitude of the response is higher for hospitals with lower quality and that are far from consumer association headquarters. Lower schedules and higher levels of reimbursements per delivery also increase the overuse of cesarean section. The analysis of the response times, combining the difference-in-difference approach with a regression discontinuity design, shows that the response to decreased liability is already detectable in the short run. Our findings are robust to several sets of robustness checks and are not driven by anticipatory effects or a change in the composition of the treated patients.
K13|Compensation for Loss of Work Income in Personal Injury Cases|What is the appropriate lump-sum compensation for loss of work income in personal injury cases? Since generally future work income is not known with certainty, compensation for its loss must be based on statistical considerations. Typically, courts have based awards on mean or median work income, but apparently without meaningful grounding in economics. We use economic theory to address this issue. We find that the relation between the appropriate compensation and the mean and median work income depends on the uncertainties of work income and of consumption facilitated by the lump-sum compensation awarded, as well as the degree of risk aversion. Since the consumption uncertainty associated with compensation generally exceeds that associated with work income, we conclude that the lump-sum compensation should exceed mean and therefore median work income.
K13|Laws and Norms: Experimental Evidence with Liability Rules|We conduct an experiment where participants choose between actions that provide private benefits but may also impose losses on strangers. Three legal environments are compared: no law, strict liability for the harm caused to others, and an efficiently designed negligence rule where damages are paid only when the harmful action causes a net social loss. Legal obligations are either perfectly enforced (Severe Law) or only weakly so (Mild Law), i.e., material incentives are then nondeterrent. We investigate how legal obligations and social norms interact. Our results show that liability rules strengthen pro-social behavior and suggest that strict liability has a greater effect than the negligence rule.
K13|Un modèle d'accident unilatéral: incertitude non-radicale et estimations différenciées|Cet article reconsidère le modèle d'accident unilatéral standard en univers probabiliste (hors incertitude radicale). Contrairement à ce dernier, les agents (porteur de préjudice et victime) forment des estimations différentes sur la distribution de probabilité d’accident et l'évaluation des dommages. En conséquence, le coût social d'un accident varie suivant le type de responsabilité civile (invariable dans le modèle standard). La correspondance entre les régimes de la responsabilité sans faute et la règle de la négligence n'existe plus sauf dans l’hypothèse où le pollueur estime les coûts des dommages à un niveau supérieur à celui de la victime.
K13|Prevention and cleanup of dynamic harm under environmental liability|This paper explores incentives for accident prevention and cleanup when firms are subject to environmental liability. In our two-period setup, the level of environmental harm in the second period depends on first-period harm when cleanup was incomplete. Under strict liability, in the first period, firms with a positive probability of going out of business before the second period have inadequate prevention and cleanup incentives. The fundamental disconnect between private incentives and social optimality cannot be remedied by using a multiple of harm as the level of compensation. Under negligence with a causation requirement, incentive problems remain; however, under negligence without such a requirement, first-best incentives may emerge, and using a multiple of harm as the level of compensation can ensure the efficient solution.
K13|Statutory Modification of the Collateral Source Rule|Statutory law governing application of the collateral source rule is surveyed for the fifty states, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. The statutes are described using a classification scheme involving eight major substantive categories that have elements varying in number up to as many as seven distinct items. The classifications are presented in a comprehensive table that notes the number of jurisdictions in which each elemental modification appears. A second table presents the amassed information in a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction fashion.
K13|Is limiting financial supervisory liability a way to prevent defensive conduct? The outcome of a European survey|Abstract One of the arguments frequently used to limit the liability of financial supervisory authorities is the idea that normal liability rules result in defensive conduct and, therefore, in ineffective financial supervision. The impact of tort law on financial supervisory authorities is, however, highly debated, and no overwhelming empirical evidence exists to support it. This article presents findings from an empirical study on financial supervisors in the member states of the European Union. Targeting senior financial supervisors, the survey presented a series of statements, asking respondents to state their opinions about the impact of financial supervisory liability. In summary, most of the respondents seem to classify the impact of financial supervisory liability as neutral or positive. At most, the evidence from the survey implies an arguably modest degree of deterrence. Because the survey found no significant differences between respondents who perceive the liability of their organization as limited and those who do not, it suggests that limiting financial supervisory liability does not have an impact on the behavior, or at least on the perceptions of the impact of financial supervisory liability, of financial supervisors. Therefore, the study calls into question the widely accepted argument of defensive conduct as a reason for limiting the liability of financial supervisory authorities.
K13|Uncertain product risk, information acquisition, and product liability|We describe how product liability interacts with regulatory product approval in influencing a firm’s incentives to acquire information about product risk, using a very parsimonious model. The firm may have insufficient information acquisition incentives if it is not fully liable for the harm caused by its product. The firm may also have excessive information acquisition incentives under both full and limited liability. Our analysis identifies efficiency-inducing liability rules.
K13|Allocation of Liability: On the Efficiency of Composite Sharing Rules|Distributing liability according to injurers' relative fault produces incentives for rent-seeking (excessive care) or free-riding (insufficient care) if precautions are complements or substitutes. We show that composite sharing rules consisting of different weights of proportional and equal allocations calibrate injurers' incentives. The optimal weight of the proportional relative to the equal allocation increases with the degree of substitutability between injurers' precautions. As the number of injurers increases, the optimal composite rule tends to an equal allocation if precautions are pure complements or one where the most careless injurer is liable for the entire harm if precautions are pure substitutes.
K13|Efficient Compensation: Lessons from Civil Liability|This paper deals with compensation requirements ensuring efficient incentives in a setting with two active parties whose decisions affect a third party through an external effect. To achieve efficient incentives under civil liability, expectation damages should be based on a reasonable-person standard, and enrichments due to deviations from obligations may have to be returned. Adapting these lessons to the takings interpretation of the model would require unusual steps, unheard of in actual compensation practice. Yet, if taking decisions are reached in line with theories of public choice, an externality is implicitly present that, if neglected, tends to distort incentives.
K13|Subrogation and the Theory of Insurance When Suits Can Be Brought for Losses Suffered|The theory of insurance is considered here when an insured individual may be able to sue another party for the losses that the insured suffered—and thus when an insured has a potential source of compensation in addition to insurance coverage. Insurance policies reflect this possibility through so-called subrogation provisions that give insurers the right to step into the shoes of insureds and to bring suits against injurers. In a basic case, the optimal subrogation provisions involve full retention by the insurer of the proceeds from a successful suit and the pursuit of all positive expected value suits. This eliminates litigation risks for insureds and results in lower premiums—financed by the litigation income of insurers, including from suits that insureds would not otherwise have brought. Moreover, optimal subrogation provisions are characterized in the presence of moral hazard, administrative costs, and non-monetary losses and it is demonstrated that optimal provisions entail sharing litigation proceeds with insureds in the first two cases but not when losses are non-monetary.
K13|The Effect of Malpractice Law on Physician Supply: Evidence from Negligence-Standard Reforms|We explore whether the composition of the physician work force is impacted by the clinical standards imposed on physicians under medical liability rules. We theorize that physicians of particular backgrounds will be attracted to regions when the malpractice laws of those regions favor the type of medicine characteristic of those backgrounds. To test this prediction, we rely on a quasi-experiment made possible by states shifting from local to national customs as the basis for setting standards at court, a distinction that captures meaningful differences in the clinical expectations of the law in light of the well documented phenomenon of regional variations in medical practices. Using data from the Area Health Resource File from 1977 to 2005, we find that the rate of surgeons among practicing physicians increases by 2-2.4 log points following the adoption of national-standard laws in initially low surgery-rate regions—i.e., following a change in the law that effectively expects physicians to increase practice intensities. We find that this response is nearly three times greater in rural counties. We also find that this supply effect is unidirectional, with no evidence to suggest that surgeons retreat when initially high-surgery-rate regions change their laws so as to expect less intensive practice styles.
K13|Foundations of Welfare Economics and Product Market Applications|A common problem in applied economics is to determine the impact on consumers of changes in prices and attributes of marketed products as a consequence of policy changes. Examples are prospective regulation of product safety and reliability, or retrospective compensation for harm from defective products or misrepresentation of product features. This paper reexamines the foundations of welfare analysis for these applications. We consider discrete product choice, and develop practical formulas that apply when discrete product demands are characterized by mixed multinomial logit models and policy changes affect hedonic attributes of products in addition to price. We show that for applications that are retrospective, or are prospective but compensating transfers are hypothetical rather than fulfilled, a Market Compensating Equivalent measure that updates Marshallian consumer surplus is more appropriate than Hicksian compensating or equivalent variations. We identify the welfare questions that can be answered in the presence of partial observability on the preferences of individual consumers. We examine the welfare calculus when the experienced-utility of consumers differs from the decision-utility that determines market demands, as the result of resolution of contingencies regarding attributes of products and interactions with consumer needs, or as the result of inconsistencies in tastes and incomplete optimizing behavior. We conclude with an illustrative application that calculates the welfare impacts of unauthorized sharing of consumer information by video streaming services.
K13|Liability in Markets for Credence Goods|"We study the role of liability in disciplining an expert's behavior in a credence good market. The expert, who can provide two potential treatments for a consumer's problem, may misbehave in two ways: prescribing the ""wrong"" treatment given his private information, or failing to exert proper effort to diagnose the problem. We show that under a range of liability rules, the expert will choose the efficient treatment based on his information if the price margins for the two treatments are close enough. Moreover, a well-designed liability rule can motivate the expert to choose efficiently both the treatment and the diagnosis effort. This efficiency result continues to hold when the expert's diagnosis effort generates only a noisy signal about the nature of the consumer's problem, provided the signal is sufficiently informative."
K13|Comparison of liability sharing rules for environmental damage: An experiment with different levels of solvency|Civil liability is the legal requirement to compensate victims when damage is caused. When two firms jointly cause environmental damage, their liability depends on the applicable liability rule and on the solvency level of each firm. Under non-joint liability, each injurer is liable for part of the damage up to its financial capacity. Under joint and several liability, if damages cannot be recovered from one in jurer for insolvency reasons, they are borne by the other one to the extent that it is solvent. We theoretically and experimentally investigate the impact of these two liability rules in terms of incentives to care, varying according to the degree of (in)solvency of each firm. We show that when there is (at least) one insolvent firm, non-joint liability leads to higher social welfare than joint and several liability, whereas the latter should be preferred in the presence of solvent firms only.
K13|Consumers’ Costly Responses to Product-Harm Crises|"Exploiting a major food safety crisis, we estimate a full demand model for the unsafe product and its substitutes and recover consumers' preference parameters. Counterfactual exercises quantify the relevance of different mechanisms|changes in safety perceptions, idiosyncratic tastes, product characteristics, and prices|driving consumers' responses. We nd that consumers' reaction is limited by their preferences for the product observable and unobservable characteristics. Due to the costs associated with switching from the affected product, the decline in demand following a product-harm crisis tends to understate the true weight of such events in consumers' utility. We nd that, in the specific crisis we study, the demand would have declined 19% further if consumers had had access to a closer substitute in terms of product characteristics and 23% further if consumers' idiosyncratic unobserved taste for the affected product category was as low as that for one of the main substitute categories. For an accurate assessment of product-harm crises, managerial strategies should therefore account for how different demand drivers bind consumers' substitution patterns."
K13|Exploring the Nexus between Certainty in Injury Compensation and Treatment Selection|We study how legal and financial incentives affect medical decisions. Using patient-level data, we identify the effect of a change in medical liability pressure exploiting the geographical distribution of hospitals across court districts, where some districts improve the certainty of expected damages per injury while others do not. As certainty increases, unnecessary c-sections increase by 20%. This increase is higher for hospitals with lower quality, farther from consumers associations, facing lower expected damages, and paid more per c-section. Combining the difference-in- difference with a regression discontinuity design, we show that the effect is already detectable in the short-run.
K13|Joint Use of Liability and Regulation in Environmental Law|In this paper, we argue that the joint use of ex-ante regulation and ex-post liability rules is efficient when there are uncertainty surrounding causal investigations and regulatory myopia. As these conditions are generally met in environmental cases, we provide an explanation for the frequent coexistence of these two instruments to control activities that create a risk for the environment. Moreover, we suggest that a joint use of liability and regulation should more frequently be optimal at the European (Federal) level than at the Country (State) level.
K13|Interplay between patents and standards in the information and communication technology (ICT) sector and its relevance to the implementation of the WTO Agreements|The interplay between patents and standards in the information and communication technology (ICT) sector has been intensively debated at international, regional and national levels over the past decades. In essence, the debate is firstly about the extent and impact of patent holdup and holdout in the ICT sector, and then about how to eliminate or reduce these practices. While standard setting organizations (SSOs), industry bodies, as well as judicial and administrative authorities have made great efforts to solve the issue of patent holdup and holdout, there is still an ongoing struggle among divergent stakeholders. Patent holdup and holdout directly impacts the innovation and dissemination of patented technology, the harmonization and implementation of standards, and international trade, which are promoted by the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) and the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement). This working paper provides an overview of the current debate on patent holdup and holdout in the ICT sector, analyses existing policy measures and their limitations, and then highlights the relevance of the WTO to this debate.
K13|Tort law under oligopolistic competition|This article extends the unilateral accident standard model to allow for Cournot competition. Assuming risk-neutrality for the regulator and injurers, it analyzes three liability regimes: strict liability, negligence rule, and strict liability with administrative authorization or permits systems. Under competition the equivalence between negligence rule and strict liability no longer holds, and negligence insures a better level of social care. However, enforcing both a permit system and strict liability restores equivalence between liability regimes. Furthermore, whatever the current regime, competition leads to lower the global safety level of industry. Indeed, the stronger firm may benefit from safety rents, which they may use to increase production rather than maintaining a high level of safety.
K13|The Negligence Rule Specificity under Radical Uncertainty|This article is an attempt to reassess the relationships between the strict liability regime and the negligence rule under radical uncertainty (ambiguity theory). In an accident model two representative agents (potential injurer and victim) form divergent beliefs about the probability distribution of an accident and the potential damage scale. It issues on the following results: 1) When the injurer's wealth cover the damage cost, then the socially first-best level of care is established by the injurer under strict liability only. When, the injurer's wealth is insufficient, this level is not reach (capped strict liability regime for instance). 2) Under negligence, the authorities (Regulator or Court) can choose as first best level of care either the level that favors the injurer's interests or the victim ones of. No rational rule can justify a choice rather than the other. 3) The efficiency of both regimes cannot be compared because they obey to different logics.
K13|Introduction to the Symposium on Wrongful Death|The idea for a published symposium arose in early August 2015 when it was recognized that a number of forensic economists were trolling the same waters in search of somewhat different fish, but fish all the same. All of the invited papers address some aspect of the law and/or forensic economics practice involved in cases alleging wrongful death, yet the papers deal with different legal and/or practice aspects. The symposium departs from Journal of Legal Economics customary practice in that the papers were invited by the Editor, as opposed to having been submitted in unsolicited fashion; and peer review was accomplished amongst the invitees themselves subsequent to nearly all papers having been presented at professional society meetings and having received preliminary comment there. The papers, however, are not connected by virtue of a previously convened symposium event organized for their presentation, so this effort is presented as a print symposium.
K13|Wrongful Death: Who Recovers What, Where, and How?|State law determines how recovery of damages in wrongful death cases occurs, either through a wrongful death action, a survival action, or a combination of the two. Who may recover and what may be recovered under each type of action can be profoundly affected by where the matter is adjudicated. After exploring and explaining these salient aspects, a set of stylized examples highlight the major differences between wrongful death actions and survival actions.
K13|The Reduction for Decedent Self-Consumption: Jurisdictional Mandates for Personal Consumption or Personal Maintenance|In a wrongful death or survival action, economic damages in most state jurisdictions are assessed recognizing that some portion of the future earnings of the decedent absent the death event would have been consumed by the decedent in the act of living. Where account is taken of this aspect, there is a reduction for what is termed herein as the decedentï¿½s self-consumption. In the vast majority of U.S. legal jurisdictions, the reduction is accomplished according to a norm of personal consumption, which measures the amount a decedent could be expected to have actually consumed in the future absent the death event and after netting out any joint consumption (i.e., any amounts that would have been consumed by the decedent and one or more household members simultaneously, like household heat). There are, however, five states that apply at least in part an alternative norm of personal maintenance, which measures the amount minimally necessary for the decedent in the absence of the death event to have consumed to maintain existence and well being needed to continue to function as an earner. This article presents the results of a 2015 survey of U.S. state-level legal jurisdictions concerning the particular treatment of the reduction for decedent self-consumption, including references to applicable law.
K13|Recoverable Damages for Wrongful Death in the States: A 2015 Review of Statutory Law|Statutory law of the 50 states, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands is examined regarding money damages recoverable under wrongful death actions. Categories of loss claims, limitations on recoverable damages, and the characteristics of award determination are recorded in a manner that mimics as closely as possible two previous published surveys with regard to the elements of wrongful death statutory law in 1995 and 2005, respectively. Unlike the previous two surveys, the present study relies exclusively on primary sources, namely the jurisdictional statutes themselves. The categorized results are presented by jurisdiction in a comprehensive tabular format. The text highlights certain prominent changes in statutory law arising during the decade ending mid-2015.
K13|State Variation in Certain Rules Governing Expert Witness Testimony|States differ by statute in the degree to which they follow aspects contained in four federal rules governing expert witness testimony. Where departures exist, they tend to occur in patterns involving two or more states. The variation across states and the District of Columbia are catalogued as of July 2016 and presented in tabular form. The tables show (a) where there is state adherence to one or more of the federal rules surveyed; (b) the most common departure from each of the federal rules examined; (c) less common departures from the federal rules examined; and (d) a state-by-state listing with the various departures identified for each state.
K13|Assessing Economic Damages in Personal Injury and Wrongful Death Litigation: The State of Rhode Island|This article presents the legal framework for the assessment of economic damages in the state of Rhode Island. Special attention is given to the statutes and case law that govern the estimation of damages in personal injury and wrongful death actions, including medical malpractice. An overview of the role of the damages expert is included.

K13|Relative performance of liability rules: experimental evidence|We compare the performance of liability rules for managing environmental disasters when third parties are harmed and cannot always be compensated. A firm can invest in safety to reduce the likelihood of accidents. The firm’s investment is unobservable to authorities. The presence of externalities and asymmetric information call for public intervention in order to define rules aimed at increasing prevention. We determine the investments in safety under No Liability, Strict Liability, and Negligence rules, and compare these to the first best. Additionally, we investigate how the (dis)ability of the firm to fully cover potential damage affects the firm’s behavior. An experiment tests the theoretical predictions. In line with theory, Strict Liability and Negligence are equally effective; both perform better than No Liability; investment in safety is not sensitive to the ability of the firm to compensate potential victims. In contrast with theory, however, prevention rates absent liability are much higher and liability is much less effective. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014
K13|Do Doctors Prescribe Antibiotics Out of Fear of Malpractice?|This paper investigates whether doctors prescribe antibiotics to protect themselves against potential malpractice claims. Using data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey on more than half a million outpatient visits between 1993 and 2011, I find that doctors are 6% less likely to prescribe antibiotics after the introduction of a cap on noneconomic damages. Over 140 million discharge records from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample do not reveal a corresponding change in hospital stays for conditions that can potentially be avoided through antibiotic use in the outpatient setting. These findings, as well as a stylized model of antibiotic prescribing under the threat of malpractice, suggest that liability-reducing tort reforms can decrease the amount of antibiotics that are inappropriately prescribed for defensive reasons.
K13|Optimal liability for optimistic tortfeasors|Abstract As Alicke and Govorun (The self in social judgment, Psychology Press, New York, 2005, p. 85) observed, “most people are average, but few people believe it.” Optimism and other forms of inflated perception of the self lead parties to exercise suboptimal precautions when undertaking risky activities and often undermine the incentive effects of tort rules. In this paper, we show that the presence of optimism undermines several critical assumptions, upon which law and economics scholars have relied when modeling the incentive effects of tort law. We construct a model representing the incentives of “optimistic” tortfeasors and victims, and consider mechanisms for mitigating the effects of biased decision-making. We show that in the presence of optimism, comparative negligence rules are preferable to contributory negligence rules (i.e., the traditional equivalence between contributory and comparative negligence does not hold). Further, we discover the surprising conclusion that the most effective way to correct optimism may often simply be to “forgive” it, shielding optimistic individuals from liability, rather than holding them liable for the harms they cause.
K13|Legal compliance and litigation spending under the English and American rule: Experimental evidence|We investigate fee-shifting rules in litigation with regard to their impact on legal compliance, settlement, and litigation spending. We develop a model to compare the English rule, according to which the winning party is compensated by the losing party, to the American rule, according to which parties pay their own expenses independent of the outcome of the trial. We conduct an experiment to put the predictions to an empirical test. In accordance with the model, we find that litigants spend substantially more under the English rule than under the American rule. Defendants are significantly more compliant under the English rule when out-of-court settlement is not possible, but not when settlement is possible. Settlement rates do not significantly differ between the two rules, nor do they differ within the subsets of strong or weak cases.
K13|Controlling Product Risks when Consumers Are Heterogeneously Overconfident: Producer Liability versus Minimum-Quality-Standard Regulation|Contributing to the literature on the consequences of behavioral biases for market outcomes and institutional design, we contrast producer liability and minimum-quality-standard regulation as alternative means of social control of product-related torts when consumers are heterogeneously overconfident about the risk of harm. We elucidate the role of factors shaping the relative desirability of strict liability vis-á-vis minimum-quality-standard regulation from a social welfare standpoint. We also clarify when and why joint use of strict liability and minimum-quality-standard regulation welfare dominates the exclusive use of either mode of social control of torts.
K13|Self-insuring against Liability Risk: Evidence from Physician Home Values in States with Unlimited Homestead Exemptions|When faced with financial uncertainty, rational agents have incentives to take steps ex ante to reduce the probability (self-protection) or size (self-insurance) of a loss. However, in the case of liability risk, especially physician responses to malpractice risk, most empirical analyses have focused exclusively on measuring self-protection. This paper studies whether physicians invest in self-insurance by exploring how they respond to policies that allow them to lower the financial cost of malpractice liability. Specifically, we test whether physicians exploit provisions of bankruptcy laws and adjust the value of their home purchases to protect assets from liability claims exceeding their malpractice policy limits. We find that in states with unlimited “homestead” exceptions—provisions of state law that protect home equity when individuals file for bankruptcy—physicians invest 13% more in the value of their homes compared to what they would have invested in the absence of an exemption, whereas no such effect is true for other professionals of similar family income, family size, demographics, and city of residence. Additionally, the response of physicians to unlimited homestead exemptions is larger in areas with higher liability risk, where physicians would have greater incentive to insure against financial risks. Our findings suggest that physicians take financially costly decisions to protect themselves from uninsured malpractice risk, implying more generally that individuals self-insure against liability risk when insurance markets are incomplete.
K13|Three-Party Settlement Bargaining with an Insurer Duty to Settle: Structural Model and Evidence from Malpractice Claims|"Prior efforts to specify and then empirically estimate structural models of the outcomes of tort lawsuits involve only two parties—plaintiff and defendant. We incorporate the defendant’s insurer and its ""duty to settle"" into a three-party settlement model. In medical malpractice cases, there is both anecdotal and quantitative evidence that policy limits and the insurer’s duty to settle are central parts of settlement bargaining. We estimate the model using a Texas database of closed, paid medical malpractice claims. Both the data and our model predict a mass of cases with a settlement offer by the plaintiff exactly at limits; a smaller but still sizeable mass of cases with payout exactly at limits (both in pre-trial settlements and after trial), and substantial haircuts (payout < damages) in tried cases with damages > limits. In counterfactual analysis, we predict that, as duty-to-settle liability becomes stricter, there will be: more at-limits offers, fewer trials, fewer at-limits payments in tried cases, more insurer payments above limits, and smaller haircuts. (JEL K13, K41)"
K13|Product Liability versus Reputation|"Market reputation is often perceived as a cheaper alternative to product liability in the provision of safety incentives. We explore the interaction between legal and reputational sanctions using the idea that inducing safety through reputation requires implementing costly ""market sanctioning"" mechanisms. We show that law positively affects the functioning of market reputation by reducing its costs. We also show that reputation and product liability are not just substitutes but also complements. We analyze the effects of different legal policies, and namely that negligence reduces reputational costs more intensely than strict liability, and that court errors in determining liability interfere with reputational cost reduction through law. A more general result is that any variant of an ex post liability rule will improve the functioning of market reputation in isolation. We complicate the basic analysis with endogenous prices and observability by consumers of the outcome of court’s decisions. (JEL K13, K23, L51, H24)"

K13|Tort Law under Oligopolistic Competition|This article extends the unilateral accident standard model to allow for Cournot competition. Assuming risk-neutrality for the regulator and injurers, it analyzes three liability regimes: strict liability, negligence rule, and strict liability with administrative authorization or permits systems. Under competition the equivalence between negligence rule and strict liability no longer holds, and negligence insures a better level of social care. However, enforcing both a permit system and strict liability restores equivalence between liability regimes. However, whatever the current regime, competition leads to lower the global safety level of industry. Indeed, the stronger firm may benefit from safety rents, which they may use to increase production rather that maintaining a high level of safety.
K13|Rewards and punishments: informal contracting through social preferences|This paper develops a positive model of informal contracting in which rewards and punishments are not determined by an ex ante optimal plan but instead express the ex post moral sentiments of the arbitrating party. We consider a subjective performance evaluation problem in which a principal can privately assess the contribution of an agent to the welfare of a broader group. In the absence of formal contingent contracts, the principal chooses ex post transfers that maximize her social preferences. We characterize the incentives induced by the principal's preferences, contrast them with ex ante optimal contracts, and derive novel testable predictions about the way externalities are internalized in informal settings.
K13|An Axiomatic Analysis of Joint Liability Problems with Rooted -Tree Structure|For joint liability problems concerning tort law, a legal compensation scheme may be based on lower and upper bounds of compensation for injury and on case-system consistency. Introducing several properties inspired from this observation, we analyze compensation schemes axiomatically under the situation where causation of the cumulative injury appears in multiple sequences of wrongful acts. The situation underlying the model is described by a rooted-tree graph. We show that there is a unique compensation scheme that satisfies three axioms, one about lower bounds of individual compensations, one about upper bounds of individual compensations, and one about case-system consistency. This unique compensation scheme is the nucleolus of an associated liability game.
K13|Are Automated Vehicles Coming at the Right Speed?|Recent press reports have celebrated the development of automated or â€˜self-drivingâ€™ cars and the benefits they would bring, yet actual benefits may fall far short of this potential. Drivers are exposed to only a fraction of the costs of accidents that they cause, they may underestimate the risks of accidents, and automated features may work in only a fraction of all driving situations. Studies have found that some drivers respond to safety devices by driving more â€˜intensely,â€™ and some drivers refuse to accept even proven occupant protection devices such as seat belts. More drivers will resist the purchase and utilization of automated vehicle features that change their driving behaviour, especially if this reduces the speed or enjoyment of their driving. This paper analyzes the likely response of drivers to automated safety features. It suggests that benefits will be much less than forecast and will mostly occur a decade or two in the future because of driver behaviour and our likely reluctance to force drivers to submit to automated control in most driving situations. The shortfall in benefits will depend in part on the details of motor vehicle insurance policies and on public policies adopted by state, provincial and federal governments. There is an economic argument for policy encouragement of cost-effective accident-avoidance features but not for features that save time for the driver.
K13|Risk, Ambiguity and Efficient Liability Rules: An experiment|We conduct experiments to study the incentive effects of strict liability by comparing both regimes, unlimited and limited liability in the domain of risk and ambiguity. We assume that the firm’s activities cause a risk of technological disaster and can invest in prevention to reduce the likelihood of accident. We assess Lampach and Spaeter’s theoretical predictions. We find on average high levels of investment under limited liability in the domain of risk, consistent with the theory, but lower level of investment in prevention in the domain of ambiguity. We do not find that subjects’ degree of optimism affect the decision choice albeit we demonstrate strong evidence in favor of inequity aversion, fairness and risk preferences.
K13|Multiple tortfeasors in high risk industries: how to share liability?|We develop a model in which two firms contribute to a risk of accident, each firm being financially unable to compensate for the entire damage. One firm directly operates the risky activity (and can make an effort in care to reduce the probability of an accident occurring), while the other firm provides an input technology whose quality has an impact on the likelihood an of accident occurring. We define a second-best rule of apportionment of liability between these two firms, and we show that this optimal sharing rule is sensitive to the market relationship on the technological market; thus calling for a collaboration between agencies in charge of risk regulation and those in charge of competition issues.
K13|Fostering safer innovations through regulatory policies: The case of hazardous products|We consider the case of a firm selling a product which can cause damage to consumers (e.g. a product containing hazardous chemicals which can cause diseases). The firm has the possibility to make an effort in R&D in order to discover a new substitution product. This R&D could lead to a new but more dangerous product than the historical product (situation of “regrettable substitution”). We compare four policy regimes (two forms of ex ante approval, civil liability, and a combination of approval and civil liability) according to their impact on the firm’s decisions (R&D, and technological choice) and their consequences on social welfare. We find that the ranking between policy regimes mainly depends on the public regulator’s expertise (for approval), the type of the risk which is under consideration and/or the potential impact of R&D on the degree of dangerousness.
K13|Do Doctors Prescribe Antibiotics Out of Fear of Malpractice?|This paper investigates whether doctors prescribe antibiotics to protect themselves against potential malpractice claims. Using data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey on more than half a million outpatient visits between 1993 and 2011, I find that doctors are 6% less likely to prescribe antibiotics after the introduction of a cap on noneconomic damages. Over 140 million discharge records from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample do not reveal a corresponding change in hospital stays for conditions that can potentially be avoided through antibiotic use in the outpatient setting. These findings, as well as a stylized model of antibiotic prescribing under the threat of malpractice, suggest that liability-reducing tort reforms can decrease the amount of antibiotics that are inappropriately prescribed for defensive reasons.
K13|Do Doctors Prescribe Antibiotics Out of Fear of Malpractice?|Doctors in the U.S. (and elsewhere) prescribe too many antibiotics. According to recent estimates, between 25 and 50% of all antibiotics prescribed in U.S. ambulatory care are inappropriate (CDC 2013, Shapiro et al. 2014). At the same time, there exist large differences in antibiotic usage across U.S. states, with some states prescribing twice as many antibiotics as others (Hicks et al. 2013). The abuse of antibiotics has severe consequences. Most importantly, it promotes the growth of antibiotic resistance, which is one of the most pressing public health issues that many developed countries face today. At least two million people become infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the U.S. every year, and more than 23,000 die as a direct consequence from these infections (CDC 2013). According to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the best way to control antibiotic resistance is to decrease the inappropriate use of antibiotics. To achieve this goal, one must first identify the factors that lead to inappropriate prescriptions, which are still largely misunderstood. One candidate explanation for the excessive use of antibiotics in the U.S. compared to other developed countries is the medical malpractice system. Doctors practicing medicine in the U.S. face considerable legal pressure: more than 7% of all doctors are sued every given year, and the lifetime risk of being sued is north of 75% (Jena et al. 2011). In response to this liability pressure, doctors have been found to resort to defensive medicine, i.e., to administer diagnostic tests, treatments, or medications with expected benefits below cost to protect themselves against legal proceedings (Kessler and McClellan 1996). The frequent use of antibiotics may constitute a form of defensive medicine: doctors may feel inclined to prescribe an antibiotic against their own clinical judgement because the antibiotic presents a safeguard against serious bacterial infections, which may trigger a malpractice claim if left untreated. Anecdotal evidence and physician surveys support this theory. For instance, of the 669 physicians who participated in a survey in Pennsylvania, 33% reported that they frequently prescribe more medication than medically indicated in response to liability pressure, and an additional 36% reported that they occasionally prescribe medication to avoid potential litigation (Studdert et al. 2005). However, to date, no attempt has been made to examine the influence of liability pressure on antibiotic prescribing in actual clinical decisions. This paper is the first to systematically examine the relationship between liability pressure and antibiotic prescriptions. Using a simple theoretical model of physician prescribing behavior, I link the effect that a tort reform has on the number of antibiotics prescribed with the clinical appropriateness of these prescriptions. The model can be used to test for whether antibiotics constitute a form of defensive medicine. Using 19 years of data from the National Ambulatory Care Survey (NAMCS), a nationally representative sample of visits to office-based physicians in the U.S., I estimate the causal effect of liability pressure on antibiotic prescription rates with a difference-in-differences model that exploits the variation in tort law reforms across U.S. states. I allow for heterogenous responses to the malpractice environment across doctors and patients, e.g. based on the patient’s type of health insurance. Throughout the analysis, I carefully consider the possibility of legislative endogeneity.
K13|Securing Property Rights|A central challenge in securing property rights is the subversion of justice through legal skill, bribery, or physical force by the strong?the state or its powerful citizens?against the weak. We present evidence that the less educated and poorer citizens in many countries feel their property rights are least secure. We then present a model of a farmer and a mine which can pollute his farm in a jurisdiction where the mine can subvert law enforcement. We show that, in this model, injunctions or other forms of property rules work better than compensation for damage or liability rules. The equivalences of the Coase Theorem break down in realistic ways. The case for injunctions is even stronger when parties can invest in power. Our approach sheds light on several controversies in law and economics, but also applies to practical problems in developing countries, such as low demand for formality, law enforcement under uncertain property rights, and unresolved conflicts between environmental damage and development.
K13|Optimal liability design under risk and ambiguity|This paper develops an original mean-variance model able to capture the disposition of the parties towards both standard risk and ambiguity. Ambiguity arises when the causal link between conduct and harm is not univocal, as is frequently the case with toxic torts. Risk aversion and ambiguity aversion tend to have a similar impact on optimal liability rules if greater care reduces the ambiguity perceived by the parties, i.e. if safety and predictability go hand in hand. Strict liability dominates negligence when the injurer has lower degrees of risk and ambiguity aversion than the victim and can formulate less ambiguous estimates of the probability of harm. The reverse result only holds under stronger conditions.
K13|Correlated Accidents|This article investigates cases in which harms are statistically correlated. When parties are risk averse, correlation plays an important role in the choice between liability rules. Specifically, positively correlated harms favor a liability rule that spreads the risk over a multitude of parties, as in the negligence rule. Negatively correlated harms favor a liability rule that pools risks together, as in strict liability. The same applies when parties can purchase costly insurance (first party or third party).This policy recommendation is in line with current products liability law, which places design defects and warning failures under a de facto negligence regime.
K13|Uncertainty Regarding Interpretation of the “Negligence Rule” and Its Implications for the Efficiency of Outcomes|There are two ways that the negligence rule is interpreted. Under one interpretation a negligent injurer is liable for the entire harm to the victim; and under the other interpretation a negligent injurer is liable only for that part of the harm which can be ascribed to his negligence. Both these versions are efficient. However, if there is uncertainty regarding whether the court will be employing the full liability version or the incremental liability version for determining the liability of a negligent injurer, notwithstanding the fact that both the versions are efficient, inefficiency is possible. It is shown in the paper that a necessary and sufficient condition for efficiency in all cases is that the subjective probability with which the injurer expects the standard version to be employed must be greater than or equal to the subjective probability with which the victim expects the standard version to be employed. For the subset of applications without complementarities in the cares of the two parties and which are such that the total social costs are minimized at a unique care-configuration, it is shown that efficiency obtains regardless of the subjective probabilities with which the parties expect the two versions. One very important conclusion that emerges from the analysis of this paper is that when courts employ more than one liability rule, even if all the employed rules are efficient, the efficiency of all outcomes cannot be taken for granted merely on the ground of the efficiency of the employed rules.
K13|Optimal Liability when Consumers Mispredict Product Usage|We contrast alternative liability rules for social control of product risks when heterogeneous consumers considering purchasing a durable good due to cognitive errors and biases mispredict future product benefits and, thus, the extent of future product usage. Since the expected consumer harm directly depends on the level of product usage, the consequences of consumers' mispredictions vary with the prevailing liability regime. We first characterize the consumers' purchasing decision and the equilibrium levels of safety and activity from the product's usage under no liability, strict liability, and negligence rule. We then compare the three legal regimes from the social welfare standpoint. We show that social welfare is highest under no liability when consumers substantially underestimate future product benefits; under strict liability when consumers substantially overestimate future product benefits; and under negligence whenever consumers' misprediction is moderate or nonexistent.
K13|Consumers' Costly Responses to Product Safety Threats|The main goal of this study is to determine how the different components of preferences condition consumers' reactions to safety threats in markets with no close substitutes for the unsafe product. Using data from an ideal setting related to the mad cow disease epidemic, we estimate a full demand model for meat and estimate consumers' preference parameters over nutrients, safety, and taste. We find that substituting away from the threatened product (beef and veal) is costly for consumers in terms of forgone nutrients, especially iron, and taste. Counterfactuals quantify the observed decrease in demand for beef and veal following the safety threat event, which is driven by consumers updating their perceptions of this meat category's safety. We also find that the consumer demand response is heterogeneous and limited by their tastes.
K13|Tort Reform and the Length of Physician Office Visits|By holding healthcare providers accountable for medical errors, the medical malpractice system should steer physicians towards providing adequate levels of care. This paper tests whether tort reforms induce physicians to be more or less careful when treating patients, using the length of office visits as a proxy for physician efforts. Analyzing data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey on more than half a million physician office visits between 1993 and 2011, I find that caps on noneconomic damages, caps on punitive damages, and reforms of the joint-and-several liability rule have no impact on the time physicians spend with patients. Reforms of the collateral-source rule decrease the length office visits in some specifications and act as a substitute for managed care.
K13|Assessing Risk Attitude: The Benefits of Pooling Measures|In Germany and many other countries, financial advisors are required by law to assess their clients’ risk preferences in order to help them make informed and appropriate investment decisions. Most institutions that provide financial advice - banks, for instance - carry out this assessment using just one type of risk measure. Financial advisors might ask clients to answer a question about their attitudes towards risk, for example, or to choose one option among several more or less risky alternatives. Our study finds, however, that employing only one type of risk measure may result in an inaccurate assessment of risk aversion - and if the underlying information is unreliable, the corresponding investment decision will also be flawed. Based on empirical data comprising an unusually broad set of seven different risk measures, we suggest a more robust risk assessment model that combines various methods. Since our results indicate that these multiple-item risk measures usually outperform single-item measures, we recommend combining two or even three items to obtain more reliable risk attitude profiles. A higher level of accuracy could in turn lead to better investment advice.
K13|Hospital-Level Policy Can Affect Physician Behavior and Reduce C-Section Rates|The past few decades have seen a considerable increase in caesarean section rates, which have now reached unprecedented levels. Concerns have been raised about the possibility of medically unnecessary procedures having negative consequences for mothers and infants (WHO, 2015). The aim of this report is to show that a properly implemented hospital-level policy may be a powerful tool for reducing the rates of unnecessary C-sections without inflicting harm on mothers or newborns. Reducing the rates of unnecessary procedures helps lower the excessive healthcare costs that present a major concern for public policy. This report analyzes the implications of a 2005 reform introduced in the Italian region of Piedmont that increased malpractice pressure and reduced C-section rates. Empirical evidence indicates that this reform led to a 2.3 percentage point (approximately seven percent at the mean of C-sections) reduction in the use of C-sections in treated hospitals. This suggests that physicians will also alter their behavior in response to hospital-level policies - even though such policies do not directly influence individual insurance liability. Presuming that C-section rates in Germany are partially influenced by economic and legal incentives, the Italian findings imply that increased malpractice pressure may also reduce the C-section rates in Germany, which currently exceed 30 percent - a share that is ten points higher than it was in the early 2000s. Should Germany implement a similar reform to the one introduced in Piedmont, one might expect positive effects in terms of reducing healthcare costs without affecting healthcare outcomes. This expectation presumes that there are a sufficient number of practitioners who can competently assist in a natural delivery.

Die Kaiserschnittrate ist in den vergangenen Jahrzehnten stark gestiegen: Heute werden weltweit mehr Kinder per Kaiserschnitt entbunden als je zuvor. Zunehmend werden Bedenken laut, dass sich medizinisch unnötige Eingriffe negativ auf die Gesundheit von Müttern und Kindern auswirken könnten (WHO, 2015). Der vorliegende Bericht zeigt, dass eine richtig implementierte Haftpflichtregelung auf Krankenhausebene ein wirksames Instrument sein kann, um die Rate unnötiger Kaiserschnitte zu senken, ohne dabei Müttern und Neugeborenen zu schaden. Wenn unnötige Eingriffe reduziert werden, senkt das die hohen Gesundheitskosten, was ein zentrales gesundheitspolitisches Ziel ist. In diesem Beitrag werden die Implikationen einer im Jahr 2005 im italienischen Piemont eingeführten Reform diskutiert, die den Haftungsdruck bei Behandlungsfehlern erhöhte und damit die Kaiserschnittrate senkte. Empirische Befunde zeigen, dass die Kaiserschnittrate durch diese Reform um 2,3 Prozentpunkte abnahm. Dies deutet darauf hin, dass Ärzte und Ärztinnen ihr Verhalten auch als Reaktion auf Regelungen auf Krankenhausebene ändern – selbst wenn sich diese nicht unmittelbar auf ihre persönliche Haftpflicht auswirken. Es ist davon auszugehen, dass auch die hohe Kaiserschnittrate in Deutschland teils durch ökonomische und rechtliche Anreize beeinflusst ist. Die Befunde aus Italien implizieren, dass ein erhöhter Haftungsdruck auch in Deutschland die Rate senken könnte, die aktuell bei über 30 Prozent und damit um zehn Punkte höher liegt als zu Beginn der 2000er Jahre. Sollte hiereine ähnliche Reform eingeführt werden wie in Italien, dürfte sich das positiv auf die hohen Gesundheitskosten auswirken, ohne negative gesundheitliche Folgen für die Betroffenen. Ein positiver Effekt setzt voraus, dass es ausreichend viele Geburtshelferinnen und -helfer gibt, die eine natürliche Entbindung kompetent begleiten können.
K13|Learning-by-doing in torts: Liability and information about accident technology|In the economic analysis of liability law, information about accident risk and how it can be influenced by precautions is commonly taken for granted. However, a profound understanding of the relationship between care and accident risk often requires learning-by-doing. In a two-period model, we examine the implications for the optimal level of care and behavior under strict liability and negligence, showing that liability law may not induce efficient incentives.
K13|Why product liability may lower product safety|This article shows that shifting accident losses from consumers to a monopolist may lower product safety when fully informed consumers differ in their level of harm. In determining product safety, the monopolist considers a linear combination of the average harm of all consumers served and the harm level of the marginal consumer. Shifting more losses to the monopolist allocates more of the firm’s attention to the average harm level, which is lower than the harm level of the marginal consumer. The fact that shifting losses to the firm may reduce product safety is robust to the consideration of insurance costs.
K13|Attack-prevention and damage-control investments in cybersecurity|This paper examines investments in cybersecurity made by users and software providers with a focus on the latter's concerning attack prevention and damage control. I show that full liability, whereby the provider is liable for all damage, is inefficient, owing namely to underinvestment in attack prevention and overinvestment in damage control. On the other hand, the joint use of an optimal standard, which establishes a minimum compliance framework, and partial liability can restore efficiency. Implications for cybersecurity regulation and software versioning are discussed.
K13|Efficient incentives from obligation law and the compensation principle|The compensation principle provides an analytical link between the requirement to compensate for deviations from legal or contractual obligations and the economic desideratum of rules providing efficient incentives. Quantifying damages suitably in line with the difference hypothesis, even relative to an inefficient obligation profile, would ensure the compensating goal being achieved as required for the compensation principle. The paper applies this insight to various settings from tort and contract law, leading to new results but also to a unifying perspective on findings from the existing literature.
K13|Double-edged torts|Many tort cases are characterized by two interrelated elements: “role uncertainty”, which occurs when individuals take precautions ignorant of their roles in future accidents and availability of “dual-effect precautions”, which reduce both the probability of an individual becoming an injurer and the probability that the same individual will become a victim of someone else's negligence. In this paper, we extend the traditional model to account for role-uncertainty and dual-effect precautions. We find that in these situations, the traditional formulation of Negligence fails to incentivize efficient precautions, inducing excessive role-specific precautions and insufficient dual-effect precautions. For such cases, we argue for a modification of the standard of due care that accounts for the full benefit of dual-effect precautions, in order to incentivize efficient precautionary efforts.
K13|The role of party politics in medical malpractice tort reforms|The U.S. tort system has experienced various reforms over the last three decades. While there is an extensive literature on the consequences of these reforms, very little is known about their determinants. In this study, we investigate the role of party politics in the reform process across U.S. states. In order to test whether any party effect goes beyond voter preferences, we apply the idea behind regression discontinuity studies based on close electoral outcomes to semi-parametric proportional hazards models. We find that in states with close election outcomes, a narrow Republican majority in the lower house is associated with a 50 to 150% higher risk of tort reform enactment compared to a narrow Democratic majority. Our results indicate that party politics plays a role in tort reforms over and above potential underlying preferences in the constituency.
K13|L’Unione bancaria e il suo impatto sul rapporto tra intermediari e consumatori|Nel diritto europeo, la vigilanza bancaria si sovrappone chiaramente a discipline giuridiche privatistiche, tanto più a seguito della progressiva realizzazione dell’Unione bancaria. Ciò si verifica anzitutto nella governance societaria della banca, ossia nella disciplina della sua auto-organizzazione, in particolare per quanto riguarda i poteri e le responsabilità dei singoli organi. Diritti e doveri di rilevanza privatistica derivano poi dalla disciplina del risanamento e della c.d. risoluzione delle banche, soprattutto per quanto riguarda il meccanismo del bail-in. Infine, si deve esaminare l’impatto della vigilanza bancaria sui diritti e gli obblighi contrattuali e pre-contrattuali tra le banche e i loro clienti. Un esempio paradigmatico di tale fenomeno si può rinvenire nella disciplina del credito ai consumatori. In particolare, gli standard di vigilanza inerenti alle pratiche di prestito responsabile (responsible lending) si traducono nell’obbligo della banca di prestare nella fase pre-contrattuale un vero e proprio servizio di consulenza finanziaria a favore del consumatore.
K13|Back to Fundamentals: Equilibrium in Abstract Economies|"We propose a new abstract definition of equilibrium in the spirit of competitive equilibrium: a profile of alternatives and a public ordering (expressing prestige, price, or a social norm) such that each agent prefers his assigned alternative to all lower-ranked ones. The equilibrium operates in an abstract setting built upon a concept of convexity borrowed from convex geometry. We apply the concept to a variety of convex economies and relate it to Pareto optimality. The ""magic"" of linear equilibrium prices is put into perspective by establishing an analogy between linear functions in the standard convexity and ""primitive orderings"" in the abstract convexity.

K13|Products Liability When Consumers Vary In Their Susceptibility To Harm And May Misperceive Risk|" type=""main"" xml:id=""coep12086-abs-0001""> This article examines products liability when consumers have private information about their susceptibilities to product-related harm. In this case, it is efficient for consumers to self-select their purchases, with those especially prone to harm refraining from purchase. Achieving this outcome requires consumers to bear their own harm, given that producers cannot observe consumer types. When consumers also misperceive risk, the problem becomes more complicated because accurate signaling of risk requires that firms bear liability. A trade-off therefore emerges between imposing liability on firms versus consumers. This article characterizes the choice among liability rules in the presence of this trade-off . ( JEL K13, L15)"
K13|Politico-economic determinants of tort reforms in medical malpractice|The U.S. tort system has experienced various reforms during the last three decades. While there is a broad literature on the consequences of these reforms, very little is known about their determinants. In this study, we investigate the politico-economic forces that were driving the reform process across U.S. states. We focus on five types of medical malpractice tort reform and apply semi-parametric proportional hazards models to assess the factors that are related to reform enactments. We find, first, that a higher fraction of Republicans in a state legislature as well as a Republican governor are the major drivers of medical malpractice tort reforms. Second, we find that a higher fraction of women in a state legislature is associated with reforms being deferred. This finding is corroborated by micro-evidence on female legislators’ voting behavior on medical malpractice tort reforms, and it is consistent with the notion that women are disproportionally aggrieved by such reforms.
K13|Law as Evolution, Evolution as Social Order: Common Law Method Reconsidered|Building on systems theory and the economics of law, this paper argues that evolutionary models can explain certain features of common law reasoning, in particular the way that the doctrine of precedent operates to combine stability with change. The common law can be modelled as an adaptive system which coevolves with its environment, which in this context consists of the political and economic systems of a given society. The common law responds to signals from the economy and from politics ('cognitive openness'), while retaining its distinct mode of operation ('operative closure'). A version of the variation, selection, retention algorithm operates at the level of legal decision-making. Theories of legal evolution which stress selection and variation at the expense of inheritance describe only part of the process of legal change and are prone to teleological accounts of evolution to efficiency. Focusing on inheritance or retention helps us to see that the common law can only be qualifiedly adaptive, at best, and that many inefficient rules will persist and survive even in the face of selective pressures. The relevance of this approach is illustrated by an examination of the leading decision in the English (and Scottish) law of tort (or delict), Donoghue v. Stevenson, and its implications for some influential accounts of legal evolution, including legal origin theory, are explored.
K13|Investigating Defensive Medicine: The Role of Access|Defensive medicine is the treatment decisions by physicians made primarily to limit malpractice liability risk, rather than for the medical benefit of patients. Despite widespread reports of defensive medicine in surveys of physicians, empirical investigations have produced conflicting evidence. This paper develops a model of the interactions in the health care market that shows that rises in medical malpractice pressure have non-monotonic effects on health care spending. The key element in the model is the endogenous determination of access to health care, which reacts to changes in medical malpractice pressure. This implication is tested using the Vital Statistics Natality Birth Data and data on tort reforms by state-month-year, and it is found that, in general, the non-monotonic relationship predicted by the model is supported.
K13|Does Experience Rating Improve Obstetric Practices? Evidence From Geographical Discontinuities in Italy|Using data from 2002 to 2009 inpatient discharge records on deliveries in the Italian region of Piedmont, we assess the impact of an increase in malpractice pressure on obstetric practices, as identified by the introduction of experience-rated malpractice liability insurance. Our identification strategy exploits the exogenous location of public hospitals in court districts with and without schedules for noneconomic damages. We perform difference-in-differences and difference-in-discontinuities analyses. We find that the increase in medical malpractice pressure is associated with a decrease in the probability of performing a C-section from 2.3 to 3.7 percentage points (7% to 11.6% at the mean value of C-section) with no consequences for a broadly defined measure of complications or neonatal outcomes. We show that these results are robust to the different methodologies and can be explained by a reduction in the discretion of obstetric decision making rather than by patient cream skimming.
K13|The influence of product liability on vertical product differentiation|This paper explores the impact of product liability on vertical product differentiation when product safety is perfectly observable. In a two-stage competition, duopolistic firms are subject to strict liability and segment the market such that a low-safety product is marketed at a low price to consumers with relatively small harm levels whereas the safer product is sold at a high price to consumers with high levels of harm. Firms' expected liability payments are critically influenced by how the market is segmented, creating a complex relationship between product liability and product differentiation. We vary the liability system's allocation of losses between firms and consumers. Shifting more losses to firms increases the safety levels of both products, but decreases the degree of product differentiation. Some shifting of losses is always socially beneficial, but the optimum may require that some compensable losses stay with the consumers.
K13|Attack-Deterring and Damage-Control Investments in Cybersecurity|This paper studies investment in cybersecurity, where both the software vendor and the consumers can invest in security. In addition, the vendor can undertake attack-deterring and damage-control investments. I show that full liability, under which the vendor is liable for all damages, does not achieve eciency and, in particular, the vendor underinvests in attack deterrence and overinvests in damage control. Instead, the joint use of an optimal standard, which establishes a minimum compliance framework, and partial liability can restore eciency. This suggests that policies that encourage not only firms, but also consumers to invest in security might be desirable.
K13|Biased Judges: Evidence from French Environmental Cases|Using an original database of 614 judgements in the French supreme courts from 1956 to 2010, we test for possible biases in judges' decisions in the field of environmental accidents, focusing on a difference in treatment between private parties and the government as litigant. Two separate institutions deal with environmental cases in France, namely the Conseil d'Etat (Supreme Administrative Tribunal) for public utilities and central and local government, and the Cour de cassation (Supreme Civil Court) for private firms. We run bivariate Probit regressions to explain pro-defendant decisions and reversals of decisions. Overall, courts treat plaintiffs and defendants differently. A pro-defendant decision and a reversal of decision are less likely to occur: (i) when the appeal is initiated by the defendant rather than by the plaintiff; (ii) in the Conseil d'Etat ´ rather than in the Cour de cassation. The Conseil d'Etat ´ is harsher with defendants than the Cour de cassation. These results could be indicative of a bias of the lower administrative tribunals in favor of public utilities and/or the government.
K13|Non-economic Damages in Medical Malpractice Appeals: Does the Jurisdiction Make a Difference?|This article assesses predictors of payouts and non-economic damages in medical malpractice cases decided by the Spanish Supreme Court from 2006 until 2010. Medical malpractice cases can be judged in administrative or civil courts, and this distinction heavily relies on the type of hospital where the medical accident took place (in general terms, administrative courts judge cases involving public hospitals and civil courts judge cases involving private hospitals). I find that cases decided by the Administrative Section of the Supreme Court are not more likely to receive damages than cases decided by the Civil Section. The probability of receiving compensation is significantly higher among cases involving permanent major/grave injuries. With respect to non-economic compensation amounts, there are no significant differences between Administrative and Civil cases. This result is confirmed by matching estimation and simulation exercises. There is evidence of vertical inequality according to the level of harm: cases involving permanent grave injuries are those receiving the highest non-economic damages, followed by permanent major, death, permanent minor and temporary /emotional cases. Differences in compensation awards between Administrative and Civil courts has been one argument widely used against the current separation of jurisdictions in many civil law tradition countries. The results found in this paper do not support this claim.
K13|The impact of non-economic damages caps on obstetrics: Incentives versus practice style|This paper uses 1989–2010 county-level data to reexamine the effect of non-economic damages caps on the field of obstetrics. Previous literature found that caps on damages lead to both changes in the number of physicians and changes in treatment patterns. This paper investigates whether the changes in procedures are attributable to changes in incentives or to selection when new entrants could have a different practice style than incumbents. First, I find that the relationship between non-economic damages caps and the number of physicians and procedures identified in previous literature is not robust to the inclusion of the newer policy changes. Second, over the period when such changes were observed, the impact on procedures is concentrated in areas with the greatest changes in the number of obstetricians/gynecologists per capita, suggesting that most of the effect on procedures is driven by differences in practice style between entrants and incumbents.
K13|Holding distribution utilities liable for outage costs|Storm-related service outages in electricity and telecommunications have created public controversies regarding the adequacy of ex ante efforts to prevent outages and ex post efforts to restore power. Product liability rules, used to promote quality of service throughout the economy, might seem to offer a solution to this problem in the utility context. Strict liability rules avoid the need for determining whether utilities were appropriately careful but increase ratepayer costs because of moral hazard and, in effect, force ratepayers to buy outage insurance from the utility. By leaving customers exposed to damage, negligence rules can avoid these shortcomings but force upon regulators and courts the need to make difficult decisions regarding efficient care levels. Profit regulation, risk aversion, regulatory commitment failures, and distributional considerations add further complications. Still, the consideration of liability rules may provide worthwhile reminders that increased reliability is neither free nor guaranteed by public provision of service.
K13|On the political economy of public safety investments|This paper explores the interaction of private precaution and public safety investments that are determined in a political process. We distinguish between a scenario in which the median-voter victim influences public safety and one in which the injurer lobbies the public agent, analyzing both negligence and strict liability with a defense of contributory negligence for each scenario. We establish that the levels of injurer and victim care are always socially optimal for the equilibrium level of public safety. However, the equilibrium level of public safety differs from its first-best level and drastically depends on both the specifics of the political process and the liability rule applied. This implies that, in contrast to results from the classic literature, the level of social costs is critically determined by the choice between liability rules (for a given political process).
K13|Tort reform and physician labor supply: A review of the evidence|There is a large empirical literature examining the relationship between medical liability reform and the supply of physician services. Despite the general consensus that malpractice reform leads to an increase in physician supply, usually targeted amongst a subset of physicians, debates rage at the state level over the effectiveness of any given reform. This paper reviews the evidence on the relationship between tort reform and physician supply and assess the implications for any given state. Although our difference in difference methodology prevents drawing conclusions about the impact of reforms on overall physician supply, we find that noneconomic damage caps increase the supply of physicians in high risk specialties. However, these effects, even for the high risk specialties, vary significantly across states. It is unclear whether these differences represent heterogeneous treatment effects across states, or simply random error in the estimates. New approaches are needed to estimating state-specific effects of tort reform to have the most impact on local policy debates.
K13|Compensating acquitted pre-trial detainees|Western legal systems are far from having provided the same solution to the problem of whether acquitted pre-trial detainees should be compensated for the harm suffered as a result of detention on remand. Various arguments have been formulated in order to justify or criticize this compensation, but the possible incentive effects of this compensation on criminal behavior has not yet been considered. This paper analyzes these effects, focusing on the case where detention was lawfully and diligently carried out by State agents, and not having been caused by negligence on the part of the detainee. The paper shows that such compensation can either deter crime or encourage it, depending inter alia on the standard of evidence used to decide whether to compensate or not. Finally, the paper analyzes which standards of evidence maximize both deterrence and social welfare, and discusses some possible extensions.
K13|The impact of counterfeit-purchase penalties on anti-counterfeiting under deceptive counterfeiting|This paper examines the price and welfare implications of demand-side penalties in the context of deceptive counterfeiting. I show that imposing such penalties reduces demand and hence profit of the legitimate producer under some situations. When the deviation of consumer estimation errors becomes sufficiently larger, the legitimate firm has incentives to raise its product's price. Various anti-counterfeiting policies have different impacts on the firm's pricing strategy. Under uniform distribution in product quality estimation, social welfare is reduced. Consequently, counterfeit-purchase penalties employed in some countries are not recommended.
K13|Interpreting pre-trends as anticipation: Impact on estimated treatment effects from tort reform|While conducting empirical work, researchers sometimes observe changes in outcomes before adoption of a new policy. The conventional diagnosis is that treatment is endogenous. This observation is also consistent, however, with anticipation effects that arise naturally out of many theoretical models. This paper illustrates that distinguishing endogeneity from anticipation matters greatly when estimating treatment effects. It provides a framework for comparing different methods for estimating anticipation effects and proposes a new set of instrumental variables to address the problem that subjects' expectations are unobservable. Finally, this paper examines a specific set of tort reforms that was not targeted at physicians but was likely anticipated by them. Interpreting pre-trends as evidence of anticipation increases the estimated effect of these reforms by a factor of two compared to a model that ignores anticipation.
K13|Medical Net Discount Rates: Updated and Re-examined|Schap, Guest and Kraynak (2013) examines time series properties of medical net discount rates (MNDRs) based on three different, short-term Treasury securities. The article finds attributes of stationarity in each of the series examined and notes greater support for total offset of interest rates and medical cost growth rates than does previously published research. The present study makes four adjustments to Schap, Guest and Kraynak (2013). First, the data set is updated by two years and four months. Second, the t-test applied in the original study and also used in earlier studies of total offset fails to account for autocorrelated error terms, so a substitute test is applied to both the original data set and the newly extended data set, with results reported. Third, Phillips-Perron testing is conducted in addition to Augmented Dickey-Fuller and Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin testing of stationarity of the various series analyzed, with results reported. Finally, Zivot-Andrews testing is applied diagnostically, to identify stationary sub-series of MNDRs, similar to an approach used successfully to identify stationary sub-series of wage net discount rates (Schap, Baumann and Guest, 2014). The data analysis suggests two options available to practicing forensic economists who endorse the use of Treasury securities of short duration in formulating MNDRs. One option is to use total offset (i.e., a zero MNDR), based on modestly favorable empirical support in the period 1981:01 to 2014:10. The alternative option would be to rely on a body of evidence amassed over a shorter time frame, from 2001:01 to 2014:10, but which has remarkably strong stationarity properties and yields MNDRs between minus 1.5 and minus 2.0&percnt; (i.e., an implicit forecast of medical cost growth exceeding the discount factor).

K13|Transitions Into and Out of Census Disability|This paper examines disability as measured and reported in three Census surveys: the American Community Survey (ACS), the Current Population Survey (CPS), and the Survey on Income Program Participation (SIPP). We focus on whether person-specific disability, as measured by the Census, is a permanent or a transitory condition. Survey data results regarding the incidence of Census-measured disability are shown both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. It is found from longitudinal CPS and SIPP responses that Census-measured disability is largely transitory. That finding empirically confirms the longstanding theoretical objections to the use of Census cross-section disability data along with a permanent disability assumption in worklife expectancy models; hence, any worklife expectancy model which assumes that Census disability measures are permanent conditions is misspecified and empirically invalid. Instead of using the permanent disability assumption, we use actual longitudinal disability transition probabilities and life table analysis to quantify the lifetime duration of disability as measured by the Census in total life years and working life years. We show that the realistic feature of disability transition dramatically lowers the effect of disability on worklife expectancy.
K13|A 2015 Survey of Forensic Economists: Their Methods, Estimates, and Perspectives|In January 2015, 590 e-mail invitations to complete an electronic survey were sent to NAFE (National Association of Forensic Economics) members. The response rate was approximately 33&percnt;, almost nine percentage points higher than the last paper survey administered in 2003. The survey covered many of the major topics included in earlier surveys, such as values of important economic variables (e.g., discount rates), trends in the practice of forensic economics (e.g., personal sources of earnings), and open-ended questions concerning ethics and reactions to the survey instrument. On the 2015 Survey instrument there were several new questions concerning such matters as how forensic economists perceive the role of vocational (rehabilitation) experts, the effects of the Affordable Care Act on loss estimates, how members charge for their services, and the size of respondents' practices.
K13|A Comment on “Employee Tenure and Economic Losses in Wrongful Termination Cases”|In the April 2013 issue of the Journal of Forensic Economics, Charles L. Baum II develops a model to estimate the annual probability of a worker remaining with a particular employer and applies his results to estimates of economic losses resulting from wrongful termination. Baum's adjustment for job survival is based only on forecast experience in the job held at the time of the termination. This method seems inconsistent with Baum's own findings that early years in any job are associated with much higher hazard rates. In this comment we apply Baum's survival coefficients in a model that incorporates the probability of termination and survival in both the original job and the replacement job.
K13|Employee Tenure and Economic Losses in Wrongful Termination Cases: A Reply to Nicholas Coleman|In this issue of the Journal of Forensic Economics, Nicolas Coleman provides a critique of the model I developed (and presented in a recent issue of this journal) to predict the annual probabilities a worker would have stayed with a terminating employer absent the termination and its subsequent application. He then proposes an alternative approach, referred to as the Job-Specific Survival Method, when calculating economic losses in employment termination cases. In this note, I respond on Coleman’s critique.
K13|Net Interest Rates: History and Measurement|Johnson and Gelles (1996) observed that starting in about 1980 the interest rates on U.S. Treasury securities rose sharply, and argued that because of the increase, forensic economists should not use low interest rates based on earlier experience for calculation of present values. Interest rates did indeed rise sharply. But by 1996 interest rates were already falling&semi; rates have continued to fall so that the status quo ante has been essentially restored. This bit of forensic economic history would be of little interest except that Johnson and Gelles are still cited to help justify net interest rates more appropriate to the 1980s than to 2015. This note updates their work, using their same sources and method&semi; it is intended in part to show that the high interest rates described in their paper are not now relevant. The note continues, to discuss how to measure net interest rates. There are two issues: (1) The net rate for an n-year note should use the n-year rate of wage increase&semi; alternatively it should compare the 1-year rate of return on the n-year note (with capital gains from resale) with the 1-year rate of wage increase. (2) Interest rates are measured daily, and wages monthly. Does the use of annual averages change the results&quest; Answer: the overall picture given by alternative definitions is not very sensitive to the definition of the net interest rate, except that when 3- or 10-year notes are held for just one year and re-sold to give a total annual return that includes interest and capital gains or losses, volatility of returns is considerably higher than when the securities are held to maturity&semi; the result suggests that the return on Treasury notes for one year with resale is not appropriate for discounting earnings losses to present value.
K13|Assessing Economic Damages in Personal Injury and Wrongful Death Litigation: The State of Washington|In contribution to the series on economic damages in personal injury and wrongful death cases by state, this article presents the legal framework for calculating economic damages in personal injury and wrongful death actions in the State of Washington. Topics covered include the Washington State court system, expert testimony and discovery, survival and wrongful death statutes, dependency, life expectancy, earning capacity, household services, taxes, consumption and present value. Also briefly discussed are investment income, lost inheritance, post-injury death, mitigation, collateral sources, and punitive damages.
K13|Civil Liability, Knight’s Uncertainty and Non-Dictatorial Regulator|This paper reviews the foundations of the unilateral standard accident model under Knightian uncertainty. It extends the Teitelbaum (2007)’s seminal article (who introduces radical uncertainty) by expanding it from producers to victims and from the probability distribution of accidents to the scale of damage. Mainly, it also considers a regulator who aggregates the agents’ preferences (Neghisi (1960) type). Under the condition that the troublemakers’ resources are sufficient to cover the damage, the article shows that uncertainty does not preclude, first, the determination of a socially optimal level of care, and second, whatever the civil liability regime (strict liability or negligence) it shows that they determine the same level of socially first-best care. The solution is inefficient only when the polluter’s wealth is insufficient to repair the victim’s losses.
K13|Biased Judges: Evidence from French Environmental Cases|Using an original database of 614 judgements in the French supreme courts from 1956 to 2010, we test for possible biases in judges’ decisions in the field of environmental accidents, focusing on a difference in treatment between private parties and the government as litigant. Two separate institutions deal with environmental cases in France, namely the Conseil d’E´tat (Supreme Administrative Tribunal) for public utilities and central and local government, and the Cour de cassation (Supreme Civil Court) for private firms. We run bivariate Probit regressions to explain pro-defendant decisions and reversals of decisions. Overall, courts treat plaintiffs and defendants differently. A pro-defendant decision and a reversal of decision are less likely to occur: (i) when the appeal is initiated by the defendant rather than by the plaintiff; (ii) in the Conseil d’Etat rather than in the Cour de cassation. The Conseil d’Etat is harsher with defendants than the Cour de cassation. These results could be indicative of a bias of the lower administrative tribunals in favor of public utilities and/or the government.
K13|The ‘‘Loss of Chance’’ Rule as a Special Category of Damages in Medical Malpractice: A State-by-State Analysis|The incremental ‘‘loss of chance’’ rule is a doctrine relevant to medical malpractice cases dictating a damage calculation proportional to the victim’s reduction in chance of medical recovery due to a medical professional’s negligence. Variations in the rule or its application exist across the various states, with some states denying recovery under the doctrine altogether. Using rule descriptions and a state categorization scheme applied previously in the literature, a state-by-state investigation yields a comprehensive table displaying the status of the rule in each state. Legal citations and case excerpts are provided. Chief among the summary findings are that 24 states have adopted some version of the ‘‘loss of chance’’ rule, 17 have rejected it, four have deferred ruling on the doctrine, and five have yet to address the matter. Detailed accounts are given for the three states (Michigan, New Hampshire, and South Dakota) in which the judiciary had created a ‘‘loss of chance’’ rule, only to see the legislature rescind it.
K13|Salience Theory of Judicial Decisions|We present a model of judicial decision making in which the judge overweights the salient facts of the case. The context of the judicial decision, which is comparative by nature, shapes which aspects of the case stand out and draw the judge's attention. By focusing judicial attention on such salient aspects of the case, legally irrelevant information can affect judicial decisions. Our model accounts for a range of recent experimental evidence that bears on the psychology of judicial decisions, including anchoring effects in the setting of damages, decoy effects in choice of legal remedies, and framing effects in the decision to litigate. The model also offers a new approach to positive analysis of damage awards in torts.
K13|The Role of Lawyer-Legislators in Shaping the Law: Evidence from Voting Behavior on Tort Reforms|Attorneys elected to the US House of Representatives and to US state legislatures are systematically less likely to vote in favor of tort reforms that restrict tort litigation, but more likely to support bills that extend tort law. This finding is based on the analysis of 54 votes at the federal and state level between 1995 and 2012. It holds when controlling for legislators ideology and is particularly strong for term-limited lawyer-legislators. The empirical regularity is consistent with the hypothesis that lawyer- legislators, at least in part, pursue their private interests when voting on tort issues. Our results highlight the relevance of legislators identities and individual professional interests for economic policy making.
K13|Negligence and two-sided causation|We extend the economic analysis of negligence and intervening causation to “two-sided causation” scenarios. In the two-sided causation scenario the effectiveness of the injurer’s care depends on some intervention, and the risk of harm generated by the injurer’s failure to take care depends on some other intervention. We find that the distortion from socially optimal care is more severe in the two-sided causation scenario than in the one-sided causation scenario, and generally in the direction of excessive care. The practical lesson is that the likelihood that injurers will have optimal care incentives under the negligence test in the presence of intervening causal factors is low.

K13|An attorney fee as a signal in pretrial negotiation|We consider the signaling role of attorney fees which have been usually assumed as exogenous in literature. We show that there exists an equilibrium in which the informed plaintiff uses both the attorney fee and the settlement demand as signals for his damage amount. If attorney service is not productive, this equilibrium yields higher social welfare than the equilibrium involving solely the settlement demand as a signal. If attorney service is productive, however, social welfare is lower in the former equilibrium. This has a policy implication that regulating attorney fees is socially desirable if the attorney service is productive. Copyright Springer-Verlag Wien 2015
K13|Do Physicians Respond to Liability Standards?|We explore the sensitivity of the clinical decisions of physicians to the standards of care expected of them under the law, drawing on the abandonment by states over time of rules holding physicians to standards determined by local customs and the contemporaneous adoption of national-standard rules. Using data on broad rates of surgical interventions at the county-by-year level from the Area Resource File, we find that local surgery rates converge towards national surgery rates upon the adoption of national-standard rules. Moreover, we find that these effects are more pronounced among rural counties.
K13|Status and Liability|We analyze liability law when the value of the good at risk has an influence on the consumer´s social status. It is first established that standard liability rules fail to induce efficient choices. We argue that standard negligence will tend to outperform standard strict liability. Next, we suggest welfare-improving adjustments to strict liability and negligence. An optimally adjusted strict liability rule will require that damages decrease in the level of harm, and thereby ensures first-best choices. Under negligence, the second-best due-care standard should be set below the level of care that minimizes the sum of care and expected harm.
K13|Innovation in Risky Industries under Liability Law: The Case of Double-Impact Innovations|Civil liability is widely recognized as providing incentives to control risks. We study civil liability as a means to also provide incentives to design safer technologies in risky industries. We compare two liability rules (strict liability and negligence) in situations in which double-impact innovations can be designed, i.e., when R&D has an impact both on the cost of care and on the level of risk. The two rules do not provide the same incentives. The way in which the regulator defines the standard of due care has an impact on the efficiency of the negligence rule, but this rule remains dominated by strict liability, especially when R&D mainly has an impact on the level of risk.
K13|Optimal Damages Multipliers in Oligopolistic Markets|This paper establishes that tort damages multipliers greater than one can be an instrument to induce imperfectly competitive producers to invest in product safety at socially optimal levels. In their selection of product safety levels, producers seek to maximize profits, neglecting the fact that higher investment in product safety increases consumer welfare; the discrepancy between private and social safety incentives can be remedied by setting damages multipliers to values greater than one. We show that the optimal damages multiplier depends on the characteristics of competition, such as the number of firms, the degree of substitutability or complementarity when products are heterogeneous, firms' cost structures, and the mode of competition.
K13|Do 'Cheeseburger Bills' Work? Effects of Tort Reform for Fast Food|After highly publicized lawsuits against McDonald’s in 2002, 26 states adopted Commonsense Consumption Acts (CCAs) – aka ‘Cheeseburger Bills’ – that greatly limit fast food companies’ liability for weight-related harms. We provide the first evidence of the effects of CCAs using plausibly exogenous variation in the timing of CCA adoption across states. In two-way fixed effects models, we find that CCAs significantly increased stated attempts to lose weight and consumption of fruits and vegetables among heavy individuals. We also find some evidence that CCAs increased employment in fast food. Finally, we find that CCAs significantly increased the number of company-owned McDonald’s restaurants and decreased the number of franchise-owned McDonald’s restaurants in a state. Overall our results provide novel evidence supporting a key prediction of tort reform – that it should induce individuals to take more care – and show that industry-specific tort reforms can have meaningful effects on market outcomes.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
K13|Tailoring Negligence Standards to Accident Records|Traditional economic models of accident law are static and assume homogeneous individuals under perfect information. This paper relaxes these assumptions and presents a dynamic unilateral accident model in which potential injurers differ in their probability of accident. Information about individual risk-type is hidden from the social planner and from each potential injurer. We ask how negligence standards should be optimally tailored to individual risk-type when this is imperfectly observable. We argue that information about past accident experiences helps to efficiently define negligence standards, narrowing the distance between first-best standards perfectly tailored to individual risk-type and third-best averaged standards. We finally show that negligence standards refined on the basis of past accident experiences and of individual risk-type do not undermine private incentives to undertake due care.
K13|Competition, Product Safety, and Product Liability|A firm’s incentive to invest in product safety is affected by both market environment and product liability. We investigate the relationship between competition and product liability in a spatial model of oligopoly, where reputation provides a market incentive for safety investment and higher liability may distort consumers’ incentive for product care. We find that partial liability, together with reputation concerns, can motivate firms to make safety investment. Increased competition due to less product differentiation diminishes a firm’s gain from maintaining reputation and raises the socially desired product liability. On the other hand, an increase in the number of competitors reduces the benefit from maintaining reputation, but has a non-monotonic effect on the potential gain from cutting back safety investment; consequently, the optimal liability may vary non-monotonically with the number of competitors. In general, therefore, the relationship between competition and product liability is subtle, depending on how competition is measured. (JEL L13, L15, K13)
K13|Are Pain and Suffering Awards (Un-)Predictable? Evidence from Germany|This paper assesses the widely held belief that damages for pain and suffering are random or arbitrary. We empirically analyze the differential impact of a plaintiff's personal characteristics, pain-specific circumstances and a lawsuit's procedural features on such payments. Relying on a dataset of about 2,200 pain and suffering verdicts from Germany between 1980 and 2006, we observe that final awards are systematically in uenced by the injury's conditions (most importantly the intensity and severity of damage), while individual characteristics such as gender and age turn out insignificant. Regarding the lawsuit, it appears to be relevant at which court level the case is brought in and whether the plaintiff hires a lawyer or not. On balance, our findings suggest that compensations are consistent with the legal framework of the German tort law, letting us conclude that damages for pain and suffering are widely predictable rather than random.
K13|Does Experience Rating Improve Obstetric Practices? Evidence From Geographical Discontinuities in Italy|Using data from 2002 to 2009 inpatient discharge records on deliveries in the Italian region of Piedmont, we assess the impact of an increase in malpractice pressure on obstetric practices, as identified by the introduction of experience-rated malpractice liability insurance. Our identification strategy exploits the exogenous location of public hospitals in court districts with and without schedules for noneconomic damages. We perform difference-in- differences and difference-in-discontinuities analyses. We find that the increase in medical malpractice pressure is associated with a decrease in the probability of performing a C-section from 2.3 to 3.7 percentage points (7% to 11.6% at the mean value of C-section) with no consequences for a broadly defined measure of complications or neonatal outcomes. We show that these results are robust to the different methodologies and can be explained by a reduction in the discretion of obstetric decision making rather than by patient cream skimming.
K13|Litigation and the Product Rule: A Rent Seeking Approach|This paper examines the suppression of the product rule in litigation from a rent seeking perspective. We show that there are some important arguments in favor of not applying the product rule. First, only when the product rule is suppressed is the plaintiff's equilibrium probability of winning equal to the product of the inherent quality of the several issues at stake. The probability of winning is always lower when the product rule is used, and this is especially so for relatively strong cases. Second, for many of the weakest cases, the expected value of the plaintiff is larger when the product rule is used. Third, for relatively strong cases, the litigation expenditures are typically larger when the product rule is used. This further decreases the plaintiff's expected value for strong cases.
K13|Minimizing errors, maximizing incentives: Optimal court decisions and the quality of evidence|We characterize the best mechanism for a Court to impose liability (and generate incentives) in a setting in which the injurer's behavior is imperfectly observed and Courts also care about judicial errors. First, we show that the optimal decision rule is an evidentiary standard. Then, we make three main contributions. i) We develop a new methodological approach to deal with this classic problem: rewrite the incentive compatibility constraint in terms of Court errors. This approach can be applied to more general incentive problems, and greatly simpli es the characterization of the optimal standard. ii)We state that the harshness of the optimal evidentiary standard decreases as the quality (informativeness) of the evidence increases. iii) When the informativeness of the evidence is determined by the injurer's choice of the care technology, the interests of Court and injurer are not aligned. The optimal Court policy is to penalize (even forbid) the use of the less informative care technology.
K13|The Influence of Product Liability on Vertical Product Differentiation|This paper explores the impact of product liability on vertical product differentiation when product safety is perfectly observable. In a two-stage competition, duopolistic firms are subject to strict liability and segment the market such that a low-safety product is marketed at a low price to consumers with relatively small harm levels whereas the safer product is sold at a high price to consumers with high levels of harm. Firms’ expected liability payments are critically influenced by how the market is segmented, creating a complex relationship between product liability and product differentiation. We vary the liability system’s allocation of losses between firms and consumers. Shifting more losses to firms increases the safety levels of both products, but decreases the degree of product differentiation. Some shifting of losses is always socially beneficial, but the optimum may require that some compensable losses stay with the consumers.
K13|Freier Warenverkehr und unverfälschter Wettbewerb in der Europäischen Union: Der Beitrag der europäischen Produkthaftung|Diese Arbeit beinhaltet eine Untersuchung der Effekte einer einheitlichen Anwendung der Gefährdungshaftung als Grundprinzip der Produkthaftung bei länderübergreifendem Handel. Der Schwerpunkt der Analyse basiert auf einem Rahmen unvollkommenen Wettbewerbs bei heterogenen Konsumenten und Produktdifferenzierung seitens der Unternehmen. Trotz vollkommener Information der Konsumenten zeigt sich, dass eine einzelstaatliche Einführung der Gefährdungshaftung zu Verzerrungen führen kann, die durch eine einheitliche Anwendung der Gefährdungshaftung vermieden werden können. Jedoch scheint die Bedeutung dieses Effektes begrenzt, wenn man die vereinfachenden Modellannahmen aufhebt.
K13|Case Law Concerning the Treatment of Federal Income Taxes in Personal Injury and Wrongful Death Litigation in the State Courts|According to the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 104(a)(2), certain tort damage awards are made on a tax-advantaged basis, with no federal income taxes owed on ‘‘the amount of any damages (other than punitive damages) received (whether by suit or agreement and whether as lump sums or as periodic payments) on account of personal physical injuries or physical sickness.’’ Federal income taxes are thus not owed on receipt of court awards of compensatory damages in personal (physical) injury type cases nor for awards to statutory beneficiaries or an estate in cases involving wrongful death. The interest that accrues over time on the subsequent investment of any such award, however, would be subject to federal taxation, per 26 U.S.C. § 61(a).
K13|Rationales Concerning the Treatment of Federal Income Taxes in Personal Injury and Wrongful Death Litigation in the State Courts|Federal personal income tax law specifies that awards for damages for physical injuries are exempt from federal income taxation. Federal courts (when not diverted by applicable state law) require that the exemption of awards from federal income taxation be taken into account when determining the magnitude of an award; awards for earnings losses in federal courts are thus calculated on an after-tax basis. In contrast, courts in the various states are far from uniform in how tax- advantaged awards for damages involving physical injury are determined. In most states (but not all), the courts make no adjustment to awards in consideration of their tax-advantaged character. Variation also can be observed across the states in the matter of instructing the jury concerning taxes, with the dominant position being one of no instruction. Even when in agreement concerning whether to account for taxes or how to instruct the jury, state courts have often differed substantially in the reasoning offered for their decisions. This article explores such diverse judicial reasoning, systematically summarizing by type of rationale the reasons that have been invoked in the various state courts concerning the treatment of taxes in setting awards and the instruction of juries on the matter of taxes in tort proceedings. Forensic economists can glean from the source material noted the disposition of the courts concerning treatment of taxes and related jury instruction in any venue(s) of interest. More substantially, the survey results make possible a keen understanding of judicial reasoning on the general subjects of tax treatment and jury instruction, and further enable a profound appreciation of the reasons at the fore in particular judicial rulings that have determined accepted practice in state courts.
K13|Wage Net Discount Rates: 1981–2012|The study explores time series properties of three wage net discount rate series derived using interest rates based on (alternatively) 1-year, 6-month and 3-month Treasury securities coupled with wage growth rates, initially for the period from 1981:01 to 2012:06, then subsequently through 2012:12. Stationarity tests are run on the full series and various sub-series to identify any portion of the series on which reliable forecasting can be based. Initially no support is found for the total offset hypothesis based on the full-time series (but support is subsequently found for total offset when exploring various data sub-series). Positive findings include that the three trended wage net growth rate series for the entire period under study are stationary, implying that reliable short-term forecasting of wage net discount rates is possible based on each of the trended series. Short-run forecasts based on the trended series are presented for 2012:07–2012:12 and compared to actual data in the period. Finally, the three trended wage net discount rate series are re-examined for 1981:01–2012:12, with short-term forecasting equations presented. Various sub-series of WNDRs are then explored in hopes of finding one or more that may be stationary about a constant term. Additional testing identifies three sub-series all ending 2012:12 with varying start dates that have desirable stationarity properties. The sub-series starting 2007:11 is highly stationary, but peculiar, with an associated constant WNDR that is negative and statistically different from zero; and the two sub-series beginning 1990:12 and 1994:05 have stationary attributes, yet possess constant terms that are slightly positive but not statistically different from zero, thus providing modest support for the total offset method.
K13|Supply chains, contractual governance and certification regimes|Contractual governance of the food supply chain is on the rise. In this paper we focus on a particular set of instruments for transnational governance of food supply chains: transnational contracts and agreements. Looking at transnational contracts as instruments for implementation of transnational private regulation, we compare different mechanisms for the enforcement of safety and sustainability standards in global food supply chains. We conclude that the regime of contractual remedies follows different logics from the ones of regulatory and certification regime. (1) The former aims at redressing the victim of the breach inducing compliance through a re-active approach; whereas the latter pro-actively tries to restore compliance with regulatory process in order to pursue regulatory objectives. (2) The former focuses mainly on products, the latter on process. (3) The former concentrates on individual transactions while the latter focuses on the interdependence of contractual relationships along the chain and creates collective governance mechanisms. This paper suggests that the combination of the two sets of remedies may reinforce coordination and cooperation along the chain, therefore improving the level of quality, safety or sustainability of certified production. A higher level of awareness about the impact of standards and certification on the contract rules on remedies can have other positive consequences: it may improve contract drafting, leading the parties to coordinate different remedial systems when addressing the consequences of the breach and the ones of certification remedies; it may help courts to better define the scope and preconditions of contractual remedies and their effects on transnational regulation; it may guide law makers and standard setting institutions, when providing principles, rules or guidance concerning the consequences of the breach within contracts and along the chain, particularly in the food sector. From this perspective, the current work conducted by Unidroit and Fao for the production of a Legal Guide on contract farming could represent an important opportunity to define the links between multiple remedial regimes in food chains.

K13|The reasonable person standard: trading off static and dynamic efficiency|This paper compares the performance of a due care standard which is tailored to individual precaution costs to that of the reasonable person standard. This is done in a framework in which injurers can reduce their precaution costs via investment in progressing care technology. We show that the reasonable person standard may invoke better investment incentives, pointing to a potential trade-off between static and dynamic efficiency.

K13|The color of law: an economic theory of legal boundaries|This paper presents an economic theory of property, tort, and contract law based on the goal of efficiently governing economic exchange relationships. In the theory, legal boundaries emerge endogenously in response to exogenous differences in the nature of the underlying transaction concerning the possible existence of unforeseen or non-contractible contingencies, and/or the desire of one of the parties to make non-salvageable investments prior to trade. The analysis asks whether, in this context, the transaction is best governed by property, tort, or contract principles. The conclusions are illustrated by a discussion of several cases that occupy the “boundaries” between the various areas. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014
K13|Tacit collusion and liability rules|This paper demonstrates that the likelihood of tacit collusion in a given oligopolistic industry may depend on the kind of liability rule applied to the industry. We study typical settings for the analysis of product liability and environmental liability. For the latter, it is established that tacit collusion is more likely under strict liability than under negligence. However, the two liability rules are equivalent with regard to their effects on tacit collusion in the model pertaining to product liability. This context-dependent impact on tacit collusion can be traced back to a difference in the shape of firms’ cost functions. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2014
K13|Judgment Proofness and the Choice between Monetary and Nonmonetary Care|This paper studies a unilateral accident model in which potentially judgment-proof agents (agents who may have insufficient assets to satisfy a judgment against them) choose levels of both monetary and nonmonetary care. We show that (i) monetary care may exceed its first-best level under both strict liability and negligence, (ii) social costs may be lowered by the incentive effects resulting from the monetary nature of care, (iii) an increase in the assets of potentially judgment-proof injurers may increase social costs, and (iv) one second-best due-care standard may be in excess of the efficient care level.
K13|Second-Best Liability Rules, Loss-Prevention Incentives, and Efficiency|The paper compares two liability rules, strict liability and the negligence rule, in terms of loss-prevention investment and social welfare when individuals are risk-averse and policymakers do not have lump-sum transfers at their disposal. If the damage payment made by the injurer to the victim fully compensates for the loss, loss prevention is higher under the negligence rule but social welfare is higher under strict liability. If the damage payment partially compensates for the loss, loss prevention and social welfare both tend to be higher under the negligence rule.
K13|Loss-Sharing between Nonnegligent Parties|Shavell (1980) established that tort regimes fail to incentivize optimal activity levels. The bearer of residual loss adopts a socially optimal activity level; however, the nonbearer of residual loss will adopt an excessive level. We explore alternative liability rules, which distribute the cost of accidents between nonnegligent parties, effectively rendering injurer and victim partial residual bearers of loss. We introduce a bilateral accident model with care and activity levels, assuming risk neutrality. We determine conditions where loss-sharing for nonnegligent torts may be an alternative for policymakers, and analyze the social cost of accidents under shared-liability regimes. We extend our analysis to account for role uncertainty of the parties and real-world implications for tort law.
K13|Does Medical Malpractice Law Improve Health Care Quality?|Despite the fundamental role of deterrence in justifying a system of medical malpractice law, surprisingly little evidence has been put forth to date bearing on the relationship between medical liability forces on the one hand and medical errors and health care quality on the other. In this paper, we estimate this relationship using clinically validated measures of health care treatment quality constructed with data from the 1979 to 2005 National Hospital Discharge Surveys and the 1987 to 2008 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System records. Drawing upon traditional, remedy-centric tort reforms--e.g., damage caps--we estimate that the current liability system plays at most a modest role in inducing higher levels of health care quality. We contend that this limited independent role for medical liability may be a reflection upon the structural nature of the present system of liability rules, which largely hold physicians to standards determined according to industry customs. We find evidence suggesting, however, that physician practices may respond more significantly upon a substantive alteration of this system altogether--i.e., upon a change in the clinical standards to which physicians are held in the first instance. The literature to date has largely failed to appreciate the substantive nature of liability rules and may thus be drawing limited inferences based solely on our experiences to date with damage-caps and related reforms.
K13|Unintended Consequences of Products Liability: Evidence from the Pharmaceutical Market|In a complex economy, production is vertical and crosses jurisdictional lines. Goods are often produced by a global or national firm upstream and improved or distributed by local firms downstream. In this context, heightened products liability may have unintended consequences for consumer safety. Conventional wisdom holds that an increase in tort liability on the upstream firm will encourage that firm to improve safety for consumers. However, in the real-world, policy actions in a single jurisdiction may not be significant enough to influence the behavior of an upstream firm that produces for many jurisdictions. Even worse, if liability is shared between upstream and downstream firms, higher upstream liability may decrease the liability of the downstream distributor and encourage it to behave more recklessly. In this manner, higher upstream liability may perversely increase the sales of a risky good. We demonstrate this phenomenon in the context of the pharmaceutical market. We show that higher products liability on upstream pharmaceutical manufacturers reduces the liability faced by downstream doctors, who respond by prescribing more drugs than before.
K13|Cumulative Harm and Resilient Liability Rules for Product Markets|"In the traditional unilateral care model of products liability, expected harm is proportional to usage. Thus, all standard liability regimes yield the efficient choice of care by the firm, independent of the level of usage. This implies that liability for harm can be considered independently of market structure and competition. We find that when expected harm is cumulative (i.e., increasing and convex in usage), then different liability regimes produce different outcomes and yield different implications for social efficiency. Since the responsibilities for product and market performance are divided among relevant agencies and institutions, this presents a challenge to the correct design of rules for agents in the market. We argue for selection among alternative liability regimes based upon what we refer to as ""resilience."" Strict liability is a resilient policy; no liability and negligence are not resilient. Thus, we provide a new argument for strict liability with respect to product-generated harms. (JEL K13, L13, L15)"
K13|Should Consumers be Permitted to Waive Products Liability? Product Safety, Private Contracts, and Adverse Selection|A potentially dangerous product is supplied by a competitive market. The likelihood of a product-related accident depends on the unobservable precautions taken by the manufacturer and on the risk type of the consumer. Contracts include the price to be paid by the consumer ex ante and stipulated damages to be paid by the firm ex post in the event of an accident. Although the stipulated damage payments are a potential solution to the moral hazard problem, firms have a private incentive to reduce the stipulated damages (and simultaneously lower the up front price) in order to attract the safer consumers who are less costly to serve. The competitive equilibrium—if an equilibrium exists at all—features suboptimally low stipulated damages and correspondingly suboptimal levels of product safety. Imposing some degree of tort liability on firms for uncovered accident losses—and prohibiting private parties from waiving that liability—can improve social welfare. (JEL K13, K12, L15, D82, D86).
K13|Precaution with endogenous litigation choices|A central question in tort liability is how to induce a socially optimal level of precaution. In most analysis it is common to assume that litigation is either costless or the costs are exogenously fixed. Yet, in reality, litigation costs are large and litigants have the ability to choose their own level of litigation expenditure. In this paper we advance the theory of tort liability by investigating the incentive to invest in precaution when litigation efforts are endogenously chosen by parties. We outline a two-stage game where, in stage one, the injurer invests in a level of precaution. In stage twoâ€”if harm has been realizedâ€”the victim can sue for damages and go to trial. Parties then choose their level of litigation effort in order to win the trial. We model the courtâ€™s decision over liability as a stochastic â€˜lotteryâ€™ contest, where the probability of being successful at trial depends on relative litigation efforts and inherent legal presumptions. We allow the level of precaution to compliment the injurerâ€™s generation of evidence at trial. We show how the equilibrium litigation efforts are chosen and how this determines the equilibrium level of precaution. We compare both strict liability and negligence rules and also solve for the optimal damages to minimize social losses.
K13|Liability as a complement to environmental regulation: an empirical study of the French legal system|Reasons for the joint use of ex ante regulation and ex pos t liability to cope with environmental accidents have been a longstanding issue in law and economics literature. This article, which includes the first empirical study of the French environmental legal system, analyzes courts’ decisions when injurers complied with regulatory standards. The results provide some evidence that liability may be a complement to regulation by encouraging aspects of care that cannot be regulated at reasonable costs, especially human behaviour and organization within dangerous entities. An unexpected effect of liability is observed: judges are more severe with the most regulated firms and public agents compared to smaller, private actors. This might be interpreted as complementing regulation when enforcement of regulatory standards is thought to be weak. Copyright Springer Japan 2014
K13|Comparing All-Or-Nothing and Proportionate Damages: A Rent Seeking Approach|This paper compares the all-or-nothing and proportionate damage rules for allocating damages in tort cases under evidentiary uncertainty. The focus is on how the two rules affect litigation expenditures by plaintiffs and defendants. The results of simulation experiments show that the expected judgment at trial is higher under the all-or-nothing rule for cases where the defendant did not take adequate care, but the judgment is higher under the proportionate rule when the defendant took more than adequate care. As for litigation expenditures, assuming equal costs of litigation, overall expenditures are higher under the all-or-nothing rule, except for very weak and very strong cases.
K13|Does Experience Rating Improve Obstetric Practices? Evidence From Geographical Discontinuities|We provide an assessment of the introduction of experience rating for medical malpractice insurance using 2002-2009 inpatient discharge records data on deliveries from the Italian Region of Piedmont. Considering experience rating as an increase in medical malpractice pressure, we show that such increase decreased the incidence of cesarean sections between 7 and 11.6% with no consequences on a broadly defined measure of complications. Our identification strategy exploits the territorial peculiarities of Piedmont: its 33 hospitals are distributed across 16 Courts' districts, 10 of which use schedules of non economic damages to set compensations for personal injuries and 6 do not. We use this ex-ante policy conditions to distinguish treated from control and implement first a difference in difference analysis, the robustness of which we test through a basic difference in discontinuities specification. We show that our results are robust to the different methodologies, and they can be explained in terms of a reduction in the discretion over obstetric decisions ratherthan a change in the risk profile of the patients.
K13|Considerations On The Importance Of Observing Human Rights Within European States|The detailed analysis of the institution of human rights and fundamental freedoms is necessary to know its role. The promotion of the human condition in the world leads to the innovative interpretation of this institution. The existence of so many international legal instruments aims towards a better protection of the human rights in contemporary society. The issue of human rights has occupied an important role within the states, human rights violations being a common concern, especially in the former communist states. The issue of human rights in Romania has emerged and developed very early. The changes made in Romania by the revolution of 22 December 1989 caused an intense process of amending the legislation in order to be correlated with the international standards. Within European states human rights observance has acquired great importance, a matter which will be emphasised in the future as well. The European Court of Human Rights ensures the guarantee of respecting human rights in Europe, having as legal instrument the European Convention on Human Rights.
K13|Autorisation à l'échange sur des externalités. De l'interdiction à l'obligation|Negotiation over externalities, as assumed by the “Coase theorem,” may be impeded by a moral or social ban on exchanging this type of property right. This article shows that the empirical tests of the “Coase theorem” bring to light three degrees on the spectrum of the moral or social authorization to legitimately exchange externalities : 1) a ban among rural neighbors observed by Ellickson [1986], 2) a permission between the beekeepers and orchard owners studied by Cheung [1973] and 3) a moral incentive in the lab experiments of Hoffman and Spitzer [1982]. This paper thus contributes to the analysis of the interaction between social norms and exchange contracts, by focusing on norms that allow or not contracts.

K13|Controlling Product Risks when Consumers are Heterogeneously Overconfident: Producer Liability vs. Minimum Quality Standard Regulation|Contributing to the literature on the consequences of behavioral biases for market outcomes and institutional design, we contrast producer liability and minimum quality standard regulation as alternative means of social control of product-related torts when consumers are heterogeneously overconfident about the risk of harm. We elucidate the role of factors shaping the relative desirability of strict liability vis-à-vis minimum quality standard regulation from a social welfare standpoint. We also clarify when and why joint use of strict liability and minimum quality standard regulation welfare dominates the exclusive use of either mode of social control of torts.
K13|Instrument financier dérivé et gestion du risque|From 1970s, the questioning of the monetary system of the fixed parities causes the appearance of new risks on markets, and leads financial players to look for new techniques to master the effects: the first derivative financial instruments arise from this will. However, at the time of recognizing legally these instruments, the legislator as for him plans no precise qualification and no definition and adopts the little decisive technique of the enumeration. What leads to predict that derivatives cannot base a unitarian legal notion but constitute simply the addition of heterogeneous financial models. From then on, the research for the legal nature of derivative owes demonstrate its specificity as instrument of transfer of the full financial risk and to characterize it with regard to the other families of named contracts. Besides, if the derivative operates a transfer of risk, it turns out itself generator of a specific risk, at the same time for the parties which conclude it and for thirds in connection with the latter: by its intrinsic attributes, it is fundamentally carrying risk to the whole financial system. The necessity of recognizing this risk and of controlling it closely settles then in compelling objective.
K13|Costly litigation and optimal damages|A basic principle of law is that damages paid by a liable party should equal the harm caused by that party. However, this principle is not correct when account is taken of litigation costs, because they too are part of the social costs associated with an injury. In this article we examine the influence of litigation costs on the optimal level of damages, assuming that litigation costs rise with the level of damages. Due to this consideration, we demonstrate that optimal damages can lie anywhere between zero and the harm plus the victim's litigation costs.
K13|“Piggyback” lawsuits and deterrence: Can frivolous litigation improve welfare?|Previous literature on frivolous lawsuits has focused on litigation costs and the optimal settlement-trial decision of defendants, but has not examined how they affect deterrence. This paper considers whether there are circumstances under which frivolous suits might actually increase deterrence, and thereby possibly improve welfare. The reason this is possible is that in a costly legal system, injurers will generally be underdeterred because they will ignore the litigation costs of plaintiffs. The fact that some uninjured plaintiffs will succeed in obtaining settlements may therefore affect the care and activity choices of injurers in a socially valuable way.
K13|Social preferences can make imperfect sanctions work: Evidence from a public good experiment|Sanctions are often so weak that a money maximizing individual would not be deterred. In this paper I test the hypothesis that imperfect sanctions may nonetheless serve a forward looking purpose if sufficiently many individuals are averse against advantageous inequity. Using a linear public good with centralized punishment, I find that participants increase contributions even if severity had been insufficient to deter a profit-maximizing individual. The more an individual is averse against exploiting others, the less it matters whether punishment was deterrent.
K13|The Impact of Medical Liability Standards on Regional Variations in Physician Behavior: Evidence from the Adoption of National-Standard Rules|I explore the association between regional variations in physician behavior and the geographical scope of malpractice standards of care. I estimate a 30-50 percent reduction in the gap between state and national utilization rates of various treatments and diagnostic procedures following the adoption of a rule requiring physicians to follow national, as opposed to local, standards. These findings suggest that standardization in malpractice law may lead to greater standardization in practices and, more generally, that physicians may indeed adhere to specific liability standards. In connection with the estimated convergence in practices, I observe no associated changes in patient health. (JEL I11, I18, J44, K13)
K13|Insurance In Agriculture| Damage in agricultural production can be crucial for the economy of a state, especially in countries where agricultural production prevails in the gross national income, as it is the case with Serbia. However, it is equally important that our agricultural producers manage incomes and expenditures in an efficient manner and optimize profit per surface unit, which is the basis of their business. Insurance plays an important part in the protection of the income statement of every agricultural producer as insurance costs are at the level of 1.5% to 2% on average of the production value, i.e. they are very low and saving on insurance could lead to the loss of the total yield and consequently total profit. However, agricultural insurance in Serbia is not developed enough. The state’s attempt to boost insurance development amounts to insurance subsidies, which, in the period of the implementation of this regulation, i.e. since 2006, has raised awareness of the need of such a type of protection of agricultural producers.
K13|The Determinants Of State-Level Caps On Punitive Damages: Theory And Evidence|Under the standard economic model of torts, punitive damages correct for imperfect detection. Incorporating litigation costs into the model provides a justification for punitive damage caps. At the optimum, caps balance deterrence against the cost of litigation. Empirical testing of the model is performed via Cox proportional and parametric hazard analyses, using a panel dataset from 1981 to 2007. The results reveal a positive relationship between judicial and legal expenditures (a proxy for legal costs) and cap enactment, and a negative relationship between state GSP (a proxy for damages) and cap enactment. Cap enactment is also influenced by political ideology.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
K13|Environmental Regulation and Civil Liability Under Causal Uncertainty: An Empirical Study of the French Legal System|The key question in this article is to determine whether regulation and regulator information can help to solve causal uncertainty problems in liability. A widely held view among Law and Economics scholars is that civil liability alone is not well-suited to cope with environmental accidents, especially where causation is uncertain or costly to establish. Instead of a simple civil liability rule, it is therefore advocated that a regulatory system be implemented combined with a public insurance scheme, or, alternatively, to institute a mix of regulation and civil liability. Such a mix of regulation and civil liability prevails in French law, and this article presents an original analysis of French court decisions concerning cases of environmental accidents for which causation was uncertain and in which regulators were not able to control for levels of organizational and human care. The dataset covers more than 50 years of trial outcomes from the highest civil and criminal court in France – Cour de Cassation. Our results seem to provide evidence that regulation provides a new way to address causal uncertainty at the liability stage. This may be due to a transfer of information from regulators to judges and to the adoption by judges of a probabilistic approach to causation.
K13|Certain Assessments Related To The Importance Of European Court Of Human Rights In The European Law System|Being so intensely debated in the contemporary world, the human rights issues is acquiring a well defined contour through the human rights protection systems. The role of these systems is to establish a series of fundamental rights and freedoms, so that they can no longer be violated. The main systems of promotion and protection of human rights are: the Inter-American system of human rights protection, the African system and the European system. Two years before the European Convention on Human Rights on 10 December 1948 the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was elaborated by the Constituent Assembly of the UN. It is not an international treaty. In the 30 articles the nobility of the human being was highlighted and man was praised. The text of the Declaration sets out a series of fundamental rights, “a common ideal to be fulfilled” for all people, regardless of race, sex, language, religion, political opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or material status. The provisions of the Declaration caused a worldwide explosion in international law. Thanks to its generous provisions, it has spread rapidly throughout the world and began to be observed as a treaty. Today, the Declaration is cited in the preamble of international treaties, even in some judicial reasons or in the preamble of Constitutions, for instance in the Romanian Constitution from 1991 under Title II, fundamental rights, freedoms and duties, article 20 reference is made to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
K13|Do Lawyer-Legislators Protect Their Business? Evidence from Voting Behavior on Tort Reforms|Attorneys elected to the US House of Representatives and to US state legislatures are systematically less likely to vote in favor of tort reforms that restrict tort litigation, but more likely to support bills that extend tort law. This finding is based on the analysis of 54 votes at the federal and state level between 1995 and 2012. It holds when controlling for legislators’ ideology and is particularly strong for term-limited lawyer-legislators. The empirical regularity is consistent with the hypothesis that lawyer-legislators, at least in part, pursue their business interests when voting on tort issues. Our results highlight the relevance of legislators’ identities and individual professional interests for economic policy making.
K13|La théorie de la performance juridique : une application aux stock-options et aux attributions gratuites d’actions|Today’s unstable and unpredictable world, from a financial and a legal point of view, creates a new requirement, the performance. In this context, the company’s legal performance refers to its ability of develop legal resources and to connect it to other resources to reach its goals, especially strategic aims. Through our work, we attempt to extend this theory to individuals and to illustrate its contributions through an application to the stock-options and the free share awards legal schemes. Based on the assumption that the Law constitutes a tool for performance, we see the legal performance as the expression of the companies and individuals’ ability to secure and optimize their legal resources, capabilities and opportunities, in order to satisfy their strategic goals. Then, we convey the idea of a legal performance throughout two cumulative criteria: the legal certainty and the legal optimization.
K13|Le statut juridique des établissements de microfinance (EMF) en zone CEMAC (Communauté Economique et Monétaire de l'Afrique Centrale)|The enactment of a legal status for microfinance institutions (MFIs) in the Economic and Monetary Community of Central African States (CEMAC) was an urgent need for it ought to monitor the activities of microfinance and its actors. This initiative resulted in the Rules of April 13, 2002 through two ways. On the one hand, securing the microfinance sector which has led to the regulation of access to microfinance activity and regulation of the exercise of that activity. On the other hand, the legislator has made the specialization of MFIs, assigning two types of basic tasks, which distinguish them from traditional credit institutions. Microfinance institutions come to the rescue of those who are excluded from the classical banking sector and they equally finance petty economic activities.The legal status enacted by the sub-Regional legislator of CEMAC is an important advancement in the management of the business microfinance. Nevertheless, this work can be improved upon.One of the ways of improving the status and is prepared to make a better differentiation of various legal forms that microfinance institutions may take. They may indeed have, either company forms (capitalist or mutual), is charitable or profit associative forms. This variety of legal forms appears to contradict the statutory unit highlighted by the legislator.Another axis of development status of microfinance institutions is the improvement of their legal status. To get there, we must refine the institutional and operational framework for microfinance institutions. At the institutional level, it makes sense to redefine the role of institutions involved in the microfinance sector, consolidating their assets. At the operational level, the specificity of the activity of microfinance invited to better assimilate the contours of contractual relationships that develop between the various actors in the microfinance sector. The ideal is to normalize the original collateral and atypical of enforcement used in microfinance.To achieve the laudable goal of viability and sustainability of MFIs as important players in the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the regulations must be a reality.
K13|Impact of alternative information requirements on the coexistence of genetically modified (GM) and non-GM oilseed rape in the EU|We use spatial simulation techniques to estimate both cross pollination damages and net producer benefit from genetically modified (GM) oilseed rape under alternative information requirements about individual farmers' cropping plans. Simulations were carried out for two study regions in Germany. The results suggest that, especially in landscapes with small plots, information requirements implemented in most EU Member States may result in inefficient coexistence to the extent that GM farmers lack important information to adjust their cropping plans to non-GM rape farmers' crop choices. We conclude that, in such fragmented landscapes, more comprehensive information requirements which oblige both GM and non-GM farmers to announce their cropping plans can: (1) substantially increase producer benefits, (2) reduce cross pollination damages and dispute and thus (3) contribute to the local diffusion of GM varieties.
K13|Tarasoff, duty to warn laws, and suicide|Confidentiality has long been considered a necessary provision of effective mental health treatment. State mandated breaches of confidentiality required of psychologists when a patient makes a credible threat to the life of another have, many argue, compromised the entire administration of mental health services. In this context, there are two possible effects through which these laws could affect mental health services. The first is an effect that directly changes how mental health professionals and patients interact spawning from a credible threat of reporting. The second is an indirect effect that could arise in the general delivery of mental health services. Using teen suicides as a measure of the direct effect, and adult suicides as the indirect effect, I estimate the impact of these laws on mental health services and find that states with these laws experience an increase in teen suicides of about 9% but that no such effect exists among adult suicides.
K13|Negligence, causation, and incentives for care|We present a new model of negligence and causation and examine the influence of the negligence test, in the presence of intervening causation, on the level of care. In this model, the injurer's decision to take care reduces the likelihood of an accident only in the event that some nondeterministic intervention occurs. The effects of the negligence test depend on the information available to the court, and the manner in which the test is implemented. The key effect of the negligence test, in the presence of intervening causation, is to induce actors to take into account the distribution of the intervention probability as well as its expected value. In the most plausible scenario – where courts have limited information – the test generally leads to socially excessive care.
K13|CEO compensation and corporate risk: Evidence from a natural experiment|This paper examines the two-way relationship between managerial compensation and corporate risk by exploiting an unanticipated change in firms' business risks. The natural experiment provides an opportunity to examine two classic questions related to incentives and risk—how boards adjust incentives in response to firms' risk and how these incentives affect managers' risk-taking. We find that, after left-tail risk increases, boards reduce managers' exposure to stock price movements and that less convexity from options-based pay leads to greater risk-reducing activities. Specifically, managers with less convex payoffs tend to cut leverage and R&D, stockpile cash, and engage in more diversifying acquisitions.
K13|The impact of medical errors on physician behavior: Evidence from malpractice litigation|How do medical errors affect physician behavior? Despite the importance of this question empirical evidence about it remains limited. This paper studies the impact of obstetricians’ medical errors that resulted in malpractice litigation on their subsequent choice of whether to perform a C-section, a common procedure that is thought to be sensitive to physician incentives. The main result is that C-section rates jumped discontinuously by 4% after a medical error, establishing an association between medical errors and treatment patterns. C-section rates continued to increase afterwards, bringing the cumulative increase 2.5 years after a medical error to 8%.
K13|How to share joint liability: A cooperative game approach|Sharing damage that has been caused jointly by several tortfeasors is analyzed from a normative point of view. We show how damage can be apportioned on two distinct bases: causation and degree of misconduct. Our analysis uses the concept of potential damage on the basis of which we define a transferable utility game. Its core defines acceptable judgments as allocations of the total damage against which no group of tortfeasors can object. We show that weighted Shapley values define acceptable judgments and, vice versa, acceptable judgments reveal weights. Our paper illustrates how the cooperative approach may bring useful insights into legal questions. In particular, the Shapley value appears of special interest, being founded on axioms that are in line with fundamental principles of tort law.
K13|Economic analysis of products liability: Theory|This pioneering Handbook contains specially-commissioned chapters on tort law from leading experts in the field. This volume evaluates issues of vital importance to those seeking to understand and reform the tort law and the litigation process, taking a multi-disciplinary approach, including theoretical economic analysis, empirical analysis, socio-economic analysis, and behavioral analysis. Topics discussed include products liability, medical malpractice, causation, proximate cause, joint and several liability, class actions, mass torts, vicarious liability, settlement, damage rules, juries, tort reform, and potential alternatives to the tort system. Scholars, students, legal practitioners, regulators, and judges with an interest in tort law, litigation, damages, and reform will find this seminal Handbook an invaluable addition to their libraries.

K13|Total Offset and Medical Net Discount Rates: 1981–2012|Medical net discount rates (MNDRs) are calculated using monthly data for the period 1981:01–2012:06 based on the medical consumer price index and annual percentage yields based on 3-month, 6-month and 1-year U.S. Treasury Securities. Stationarity is tested for each series and the results of time-series analytics through 2000:05 are compared to previously published results (Ewing, Payne and Piette, 2001) that omitted Treasury Securities of shortest duration. The various series are extended to 2012:06 and the time series properties are examined. Although the results are mixed, they are more supportive of total offset (i.e., a zero MNDR) than previously published research findings have been.
K13|Employment Protection and Parental Child Care|I examine if employment protection affects parental childcare. I find that a softer employment protection has a substantial effect on how parents use and divide paid childcare between them. The identification relies on a reform that made it easier for employers in Sweden to dismiss workers in small firms. I estimate that a softer employment protection reduces the total days of parental childcare in targeted firms, measured as total days of parental leave or temporary parental leave. Both a sorting effect and a behavioral effect can explain the reduced childcare. I also find evidence of a redistribution effect of paid parental childcare within households if only one partner was affected by the reform. I interpret the redistribution effect as a way of evading an external cost on the child.

K13|An Activity-Generating Theory of Regulation|We propose an activity-generating theory of regulation. When courts make errors, tort litigation becomes unpredictable and as such imposes risk on firms, thereby discouraging entry, innovation, and other socially desirable activity. When social returns to activity are higher than private returns, it may pay the society to generate some information ex ante about how risky firms are and to impose safety standards based on that information. In some situations, compliance with such standards should entirely preempt tort liability; in others, it should merely reduce penalties. By reducing litigation risk, this type of regulation can raise welfare.
K13|Negligence and Two-Sided Causation|"We extend the economic analysis of negligence and intervening causation to ""two-sided causation"" scenarios. In the two-sided causation scenario the effectiveness of the injurer's care depends on some intervention, and the risk of harm generated by the injurer's failure to take care depends on some other intervention. We find that the distortion from socially optimal care is more severe in the two-sided causation scenario than in the one-sided causation scenario, and generally in the direction of excessive care. The practical lesson is that the likelihood that injurers will have optimal care incentives under the negligence test in the presence of intervening causal factors is low."
K13|Negligence standards and care levels when damages depend on sales prices|In standard models on negligence rules, due care levels can be used for fine-tuning the care levels of potential injurers, and there are good arguments why care levels should vary among different fields. We extend the analysis of the impact of due care on care actually chosen to situations where damages depend on sales prices. This is the case for many contractual relationships, but also for damages on capital markets which are usually calculated as the difference between share prices paid and share prices after the adverse information becomes public. In a model with errors in court, we show that tighter negligence standards may even reduce care levels chosen by potential injurers under reasonable circumstances. Due to this counter-intuitive effect, negligence standards can hardly be applied for fine-tuning the care levels of potential injurers when damages depend on prices.

K13|A bizonyítási teher megfordításának hatása kártérítési ügyekben<BR>[Reverse burden of proof in tort law]|A magyar kártérítési jog egyik specialitása a fordított bizonyítási teher, azaz nem a károsultnak kell bizonyítania, hogy a károkozó nem az elvárható gondossággal járt el, hanem a károkozónak, hogy igen. Más országok jogrendszerében sem ismeretlen ez a szabály, de inkább csak kivételesen alkalmazzák. Talán ezért sem kapott eddig megfelelő figyelmet a joggazdaságtani (law and economics) elemzésekben. E probléma figyelmen kívül hagyása a magyar jogi környezetben megkérdőjelezhetővé teheti a kártérítési jog magyar nyelven elérhető közgazdaságtani elemzéseinek megállapításait is. Modellünk arra tesz kísérletet, hogy áttekintse ennek hatását elsősorban a potenciális károkozók elővigyázatosságára, ami a kártérítés közgazdaságtani elemzésének kiinduló kérdése. Látni fogjuk, hogy a bizonyítási teher megfordításának hatása nem egyértelmű: nem biztos, hogy a károkozók mindig elővigyázatosabbak lesznek. Megvizsgáljuk, hogy mely körülmények befolyásolják ezt a hatást: 1. mennyire türelmes a bíróság a bizonyítási eljárás során és 2. mekkora a bizonyítékszerzés relatív költsége a felek számára.* Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) kód: K13, K41, C72.
K13|Revisiting the Learned Hand Formula and Economic Analysis of Negligence|The Learned Hand formula is enshrined in the law-and-economics literature as the centerpiece of the courts´ way of determining negligence. The orthodox interpretation of it is the conditional application of the Hand formula contingent on the other party´s assumed efficient behavior. Reviewing four tort cases, I show that more consistent explanation for the realized court decisions is the conditional application of the Hand formula contingent on the other party´s actual behavior. The games defined by the alternative approach show that social efficiency is achieved under negligence-based rules only in the case of discrete and joint care.
K13|Damages Regimes, Precaution Incentives, and the Intensity Principle|This paper revisits the accident model at its roots and shows that the intensity principle provides a powerful analytical tool to handle a variety of issues in a unifying frame and based on common intuition. If courts impose inefficient standards, if a cap on liability exists, or if the principal must pay an information rent to induce precaution, the exact method of quantifying damages matters. The intensity principle allows comparing the intensity of precaution incentives under different damages regimes, such as strict liability, proportional liability, and the negligence rule. Moreover, it requires less restrictive assumptions than the more traditional approach.
K13|Innovation, Tort Law, and Competition|We examine the link between innovative activity on the part of firms, the competitive pressure to introduce innovations, and optimal damages awards. While innovative activity brings forth valuable new products for consumers, competitive pressure in the ensuing innovation race induces firms to launch innovations too early, thereby raising the likelihood of severe product risks above the optimal failure rate. Introducing innovations too early may call for the application of punitive damages instead of mere compensation of harm caused, in order to decelerate such welfare-reducing innovation races.
K13|Deterrence by Imperfect Sanctions – A Public Good Experiment|Sanctions are often so weak that a money maximizing individual would not be deterred. In this paper I show that they may nonetheless serve a forward looking purpose if sufficiently many individuals are averse against advantageous inequity. Using the Fehr/Schmidt model (QJE 1999) I define three alternative channels: (a) identical preferences are common knowledge, but inequity is not pronounced enough to sustain cooperation; (b) heterogeneous preferences are common knowledge; (c) there is preference uncertainty. In a linear public good with punishment meted out by a disinterested participant, I test two implications of the model: (a) participants increase contributions in reaction to imperfect punishment; (b) imperfect punishment helps sustain cooperation if participants experience free-riding
K13|How Tort Reform Affects Insurance Markets| The impact of a statute that is currently in effect depends on expectations about its future constitutionality. We investigate the effect of tort reform by segmenting reforms into those that are eventually declared unconstitutional (temporary) and those that are unchallenged or upheld (permanent). We find permanent tort reforms lower medical malpractice insurance losses and premiums and increase insurer profitability. In contrast, the effects of temporary reforms are never statistically significant. Measures that combine temporary and permanent reforms, the norm in the literature, significantly misestimate the impact of tort reform. Our results suggest that examining the effect of a current law without accounting for its future treatment produces misleading results. (JEL K13, K4, H7, G22) The Author 2012.

K13|State Liability For Medical Faults In Greece|The state liability in the Greek legal order is objective. That means that it does not depend on the fault of the state organ. Nevertheless, in the field of medical fault, in order to seek compensation, you have to prove that the doctor has acted improperly, that he has violated the standards of medical science and deontology. In other words you have to prove the medical fault. That means that the state liability in the specific field of medical law is not objective.
