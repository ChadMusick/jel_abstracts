H62|Analyse de la soutenabilité de la dette publique au Luxembourg|Cette étude vise à évaluer les risques portant sur la soutenabilité de la dette publique au Luxembourg. Elle repose sur l’utilisation d’un outil DSA (« Debt Sustainability Analysis ») développé par l’Eurosystème, dont la méthodologie est adaptée et appliquée au cas du Luxembourg. Les résultats obtenus suggèrent que, en l’absence de chocs négatifs et en considérant que le Luxembourg respecte les critères du Pacte de Stabilité et de Croissance, les risques pesant sur la soutenabilité de la dette semblent être faibles dans l’horizon considéré. Néanmoins, bien que le niveau de dette publique soit relativement bas, les résultats permettent d’identifier certains risques susceptibles d’exercer une pression à la hausse sur la trajectoire de la dette et ainsi menacer sa soutenabilité.
H62|Límite de la Deuda Pública y Espacio Fiscal: Análisis para Colombia y Otros Mercados Emergentes|En este documento se analiza el límite de la deuda pública y el espacio fiscal para Colombia y otras economías emergentes, bajo el enfoque de la fatiga fiscal (Ghosh et. al., 2013). El estado de fatiga se presenta en situaciones de incrementos continuos de la deuda y del pago de los intereses, que llevan a que los esfuerzos del gobierno para generar superávits primarios se deterioren. El trabajo utiliza la técnica de los splines para estimar la reacción del gobierno a la dinámica de deuda y plantea una prima de riesgo endógena a su evolución. Las estimaciones se realizan con un panel desbalanceado de trece economías, seis de la región, para el periodo 1985–2016. Los resultados sugieren que el límite de la deuda pública de país se situaría en 56% del PIB y el espacio fiscal ascendería a 7 p.p. del producto, el cual luce estrecho especialmente por la sensibilidad de la deuda a los choques externos. Frente a otros países de la región, Chile cuenta con el mayor espacio fiscal, al tiempo que México y Ecuador, con endeudamientos cercanos al colombiano, disponen de menor espacio. **** ABSTRACT: This paper assess the public debt limit and fiscal space for Colombia and some emerging economies, under the fiscal fatigue approach (Ghosh et. al., 2013). The fatigue phenomenon occurs under situations of continuous increases of both debt and interest payments, which lead to government´s efforts to obtain primary surpluses to deteriorate. The paper uses the spline technique to estimate the government's reaction function to debt dynamics and proposes a sovereign risk premium endogenous to the level of indebtedness. Estimates carry out with an unbalanced panel of thirteen economies, six of them from Latin America, for the period 1985-2016. Results suggest that the limit of Colombian public debt would be 56% of GDP and that fiscal space would amount to 7 points of GDP, which looks so narrow due to the debt sensitivity to external shocks. In front to other countries, Chile has the largest fiscal space, while Mexico and Ecuador, with comparable indebtedness to the Colombian, have lower spaces.
H62|El Sistema Pensional en Colombia|En el documento se describe el sistema pensional colombiano. Luego de la reforma de la Ley 100 mejoraron las afiliaciones, lo cual implica un aumento también de las cotizaciones y la cobertura de los pensionados en el futuro. En la actualidad la cobertura de las pensiones es apenas 23% y menos de 1,5 millones de personas. Esto se debe, en parte, a la existencia de un mercado laboral con un sector informal amplio (47,3%). Las mayores tasas de reemplazo del sistema público con respecto al privado ocasionan traslados del segundo al primero, lo que pone más presión en las finanzas públicas. Por lo anterior, se propone establecer un sistema de 3 pilares vigente en otros países como Chile. Actualmente, por nivel de ingreso, cerca de 80% de los cotizantes corresponde a personas con menos de 2 SMMLV; sin embargo, un alto monto de los subsidios del RPM se destina a la población con mayores ingresos. El gasto en transferencias con cargo a la Nación fue de 3,4% del PIB y el pasivo pensional fue cercano al 130% del PIB. Teniendo en cuenta las anteriores consideraciones, en este documento se plantea la necesidad de una reforma pensional que mejore la cobertura, aumente las transferencias a la población más pobre y no incremente los requerimientos de presupuesto de la Nación. **** ABSTRACT: The document describes the Colombian pension system. After the reforms of the Law 100, affiliations improved which also implies an increase of the contributions and the coverage of the pensioners in the future. At present, the coverage of pensions is only 23% and less than 1,5 million people. This is partly due to the existence of a labor market with a broad informal sector (47,3%). The public system has higher replacement rates than the private one causing transfers from the second to the first, which puts more pressure on public finances. Therefore, this document proposes to establish a 3 pillars scheme that exists in other countries like Chile. Currently, by level of income, about 80% of contributors correspond to people who earn less than 2 SMMLV, but substantial RPM subsidies goes to the population with the highest income. Pension transfers in charge of the Nation were 3,4% of GDP and pension liabilities were close to 130% of GDP. Taking into account the above considerations, this document raises the need for a pension reform that improves coverage, increases transfers to the poorest population and does not increase the Nation's budget requirements.
H62|The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2019 to 2029|In CBOâ€™s projections, the federal budget deficit is about $900 billion in 2019 and exceeds $1 trillion each year beginning in 2022. Because of persistently large deficits, federal debt held by the public is projected to grow steadily, reaching 93 percent of GDP in 2029. Real GDP is projected to grow by 2.3 percent in 2019â€”down from 3.1 percent in 2018â€”as the effects of the 2017 tax act on the growth of business investment wane and federal purchases decline sharply in the fourth quarter of 2019.
H62|Updated Budget Projections: 2019 to 2029|CBO estimates that the deficit for fiscal year 2019 will be $896 billion, which is $1 billion less than the agency estimated in January. If current laws generally remained unchanged, deficits would average 4.3 percent of gross domestic product over the 2020â€“2029 period. Other than the period immediately after World War II, the only other time the average deficit has been so large over so many years was after the 2007â€“2009 recession.
H62|An Analysis of the Presidentâ€™s 2020 Budget|By CBOâ€™s estimates, the federal deficit under the Presidentâ€™s budget would increase from $896 billion in 2019 to $966 billion (equal to 4.4 percent of gross domestic product, or GDP) in 2020. The cumulative deficit under the Presidentâ€™s policies would total $9.9 trillion over the 2020â€“2029 period, $1.5 trillion less than in CBOâ€™s baseline. (The Administration projects smaller deficits, totaling $7.3 trillion over that period.) Measured relative to the size of the economy, deficits would average 3.8 percent of GDP over the 10-year period, CBO estimates.
H62|The 2019 Long-Term Budget Outlook|If current laws generally remained unchanged, CBO projects, large budget deficits over the next 30 years would drive federal debt held by the public to unprecedented levelsâ€”from 78 percent of gross domestic product in 2019 to 144 percent by 2049. That level of debt would be the highest in the nationâ€™s history by far, and it would be on track to increase even more.
H62|An Update to the Budget and Economic Outlook: 2019 to 2029|CBO estimates that the federal budget deficit for 2019 will be $960 billion. Under current law, budget deficits are projected to average $1.2 trillion a year between 2020 and 2029, boosting debt held by the public to 95 percent of GDP in that yearâ€”its highest level since just after World War II. Economic output is projected to grow by 2.3 percent in 2019, supporting strong labor market conditions that feature low unemployment and rising wages. After 2019, in CBOâ€™s projections, economic growth averages 1.8 percent per year, which is less than the historical average.
H62|The Fiscal Theory of the Price Level in Overlapping Generations Models|We demonstrate that the Fiscal Theory of the Price Level (FTPL) cannot be used to determine the price level uniquely in the overlapping generations (OLG) model. We provide two examples of OLG models, one with 3-period lives and one with 62-period lives. Both examples are calibrated to an income profile chosen to match the life-cycle earnings process in U.S. data estimated by Guvenen et al. (2015). In both examples, there exist multiple steady-state equilibria. Our findings challenge established views about what constitutes a good combination of fiscal and monetary policies. As long as the primary deficit or the primary surplus is not too large, the fiscal authority can conduct policies that are unresponsive to endogenous changes in the level of its outstanding debt. Monetary and fiscal policy can both be active at the same time.
H62|When Governments Promise to Prioritize Public Debt: Do Markets Care?|During the European sovereign debt crisis of 2011-13, some nations faced with rising borrowing costs adopted commitments to treat bondholders as priority claimants. That is, if there was a shortage of funds, bondholders would be paid first. In this article, we analyze the prevalence and variety of these types of commitments and ask whether they impact borrowing costs. We examine a widely-touted reform at the height of the Euro sovereign debt crisis in 2011, in which Spain enshrined in its constitution a strong commitment to give absolute priority to public debt claimants. We find no evidence that this reform had any impact on Spanish sovereign bond yields. By contrast, our examination of the U.S. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico suggests that constitutional priority promises can have an impact, at least where the borrower government is subject to supervening law and legal institutions.
H62|The Motives to Borrow|Governments issue debt for good and bad reasons. While the good reasons—intertemporal tax-smoothing, fiscal stimulus, and asset management—can explain some of the increases in public debt in recent years, they cannot account for all of the observed changes. Bad reasons for borrowing are driven by political failures associated with intergenerational transfers, strategic manipulation, and common pool problems. These political failures are a major cause of overborrowing though budgetary institutions and fiscal rules can play a role in mitigating governments’ tendencies to overborrow. While it is difficult to establish a clear causal link from high public debt to low output growth, it is likely that some countries pay a price—in terms of lower growth and greater output volatility—for excessive debt accumulation.
H62|Public Debt Sustainability|Why can Japan sustain debts above 200 percent of GDP, while Ukraine defaulted on its debt when it was 30 percent of GDP? Answering that question is challenging. First, debt sustainability does not easily translate into operational concepts and indicators. Second, servicing the debt is a strategic decision, the result of a cost-benefit analysis. Thus markets can always, for good or bad reasons, question governments' commitment to face their financial obligations. Third, uncertainty around public debt developments is large and difficult to model. Fourth, not all debts are born equal, as the currency composition, maturity structure, type of creditor and ownership of the debt affect exposure to rollover and liquidity risks. The paper surveys the knowns and unknowns of debt sustainability, including the tools helping us to understand vulnerabilities and to inform our judgment. Instead of embarking on the impossible mission to build a holistic, consistent and broadly-accepted debt-sustainability framework for practitioners, we take the more modest approach to review some of the key economic principles and statistical methods that form today's leading practice in debt sustainability assessments.
H62|U.S. Infrastructure: 1929-2017|This paper examines the history of U.S. infrastructure since 1929 and in the process reports an interesting fact about the U.S. economy. Infrastructure as a percent of GDP began a steady decline around 1970, and the government budget deficit became positive and large at roughly the same time. The infrastructure pattern in other countries does not mirror that in the United States, so the United States appears to be a special case. The overall results suggest that the United States became less future oriented beginning around 1970. This change has persisted. This is the interesting fact. Whether it can be explained is doubtful.
H62|Bayesian Structural VAR models: a new approach for prior beliefs on impulse responses| Structural VAR models are frequently identified using sign restrictions on impulse responses. Moving beyond the popular but restrictive Normal-inverse-Wishart-Uniform prior, we develop a methodology that can handle almost any prior distribution on contemporaneous responses. We then propose a new sampler that explores the posterior just as efficiently as done by the existing algorithm for the Normal-inverse-Wishart-Uniform case. We use this exible and tractable framework to combine sign restrictions with information on the volatility of the data, giving less prior mass to impulse effects that are inconsistent with the data from a training sample. This approach sharpens posterior bands and makes sign restrictions more informative. We apply the methodology to the oil market and show that oil supply shocks have a non-negligible effect on oil price dynamics.
H62|Do fiscal rules constrain political budget cycles?|We examine whether fiscal rules constrain incumbent governments to use fiscal policy for re-election purposes. Using data on fiscal rules provided by the IMF for a sample of 77 (advanced and developing) countries over the 1984-2015 period, we find that after the Global Financial Crisis political budget cycles occur only in countries with weak fiscal rules. This conclusion is robust for the inclusion of other conditioning factors for political budget cycles identified in the literature (such as media freedom, the presence of checks and balances, and the maturity of democracy) and for controlling for the potential endogeneity of fiscal rules.
H62|The Semi-Elasticities Underlying the Cyclically-Adjusted Budget Balance: An Update and Further Analysis|We update the semi-elasticities of the budget balance to output for the 28 EU Member States using new weights based on ESA2010 data (with unchanged elasticities for individual fiscal items). The revisions of the semi-elasticities are fairly small across Member States and leave the assessment of fiscal developments in the EU broadly unchanged. The revision of the Cyclically Adjusted Balance (CAB) is mainly driven by that in the headline balance and the estimated output gap, not by the update of the fiscal semi-elasticities. A sensitivity analysis shows that revenue and expenditure weights, if allowed to vary over time, can have a larger impact on the semi-elasticities than the present update would suggest, although this would affect the CAB only marginally. Based on the existing four vintages of the estimated semi-elasticities, exploratory panel data analysis confirms that semi-elasticities are country-specific structural parameters, mostly of fiscal nature: they are linked to the size of government, the share of unemployment-related spending, the share of non-tax revenue and tax progressivity. They can also be influenced by the belonging to specific country groupings and an emulation effect between neighbours.
H62|Budget 2019 : du pouvoir d'achat mais du déficit|L'objectif de cette étude est de fournir un panorama exhaustif des mesures fiscales et sociales prises depuis le début du quinquennat d'Emmanuel Macron. Nous analysons les mesures votées, leur montée en charge et les conséquences sur la trajectoire budgétaire ainsi que la répartition des prélèvements entre les ménages et les entreprises. Dans un deuxième temps, nous évaluons l'impact sur la croissance du PIB et sur le pouvoir d'achat des ménages. Enfin, nous analysons l'impact redistributif des mesures socio-fiscales. Les principaux enseignements de l'étude sont : En 2019, un rééquilibrage rapide et massif en faveur des ménages moins aisés sera opéré, sous l'effet notamment des mesures pour répondre à la crise des « gilets jaunes ». Du côté des entreprises, l'année 2019 sera marquée par la transformation du CICE en baisse de cotisations sociales. Cette transformation occasionnera en 2019 un surcoût ponctuel pour les finances publiques de l'ordre de 20 milliards d'euros. A contrario, de nouvelles mesures sont apparues, comme la hausse du dernier acompte d'IS pour les grandes entreprises et la taxe GAFA nationale. Afin de financer, partiellement, la baisse des prélèvements obligatoires, un effort significatif d'économies structurelles sur la dépense publique sera maintenu en 2019. Cet effort ciblera en priorité la masse salariale non marchande (incluant les contrats aidés) et la politique du logement. À cela s'ajoute la non indexation sur l'inflation des pensions de retraite et de la plupart des prestations sociales. En revanche, le budget alloué à la prime d'activité devrait fortement augmenter. Dans ce contexte, la baisse du déficit ininterrompue depuis 2010 marquera une pause, il devrait repasser au-dessus du seuil des 3 %. Malgré tout, la dette publique au sens de Maastricht resterait quasiment stable, en points de PIB. En 2019, la politique budgétaire nationale aurait un impact élevé sur la croissance du PIB, de 0,5 point, grâce en particulier aux mesures issues de la crise des « gilets jaunes » qui à elles seules améliorent le taux de croissance du PIB de 0,3 point en 2019. Les mesures budgétaires soutiendraient le pouvoir d'achat des ménages à hauteur de 11,7 milliards d'euros en 2019. Plus de 88 % dumontant global, soit 10,3 milliards, provient des décisions prises en décembre. Selon nos calculs, ces mesures représentent un gain moyen de 440 euros par ménage. Les ménages du milieu de la distribution seront particulièrement ciblés. Ils bénéficieront de la baisse de la taxe d'habitation, des cotisations salariées, de la défiscalisation des heures supplémentaires et de la baisse de CSG pour certains retraités. Une partie des ménages modestes verront en moyenne leur niveau de vie soutenu par la forte revalorisation de la prime d'activité, la mise en place du zéro reste à charge et l'augmentation du chèque énergie. Les ménages parmi les 5 % les plus aisés, grands gagnants de la réforme de la fiscalité du capital de 2018, verront également leur revenu soutenu par certaines mesures socio-fiscales de 2019. Au final, trois ménages sur quatre bénéficieraient d’un gain de pouvoir d’achat. Près d'un quart des ménages subirait tout de même un impact négatif sur leur revenu disponible en lien avec les nouvelles mesures. C'estle cas notamment des inactifs. Près de la moitié des retraités serait perdante avec l'entrée en vigueur des nouvelles mesures en 2019. Si le budget 2019 opère un rééquilibrage certain, l'effet cumulé des mesures socio-fiscales de l'année passée et de l'année en cours reste marqué par la réforme de la fiscalité du patrimoine. Fin 2019, les 5 % des ménages les plus aisés enregistreront encore en moyenne un gain de pouvoir d'achat supérieur en euros à celui du milieu de la distribution des revenus

H62|The Monetary and Fiscal History of Brazil, 1960-2016|Brazil has had a long period of high inflation. It peaked around 100 percent per year in 1964, decreased until the first oil shock (1973), but accelerated again afterward, reaching levels above 100 percent on average between 1980 and 1994. This last period coincided with severe balance of payments problems and economic stagnation that followed the external debt crisis in the early 1980s. We show that the high-inflation period (1960–1994) was characterized by a combination of fiscal deficits, passive monetary policy, and constraints on debt financing. The transition to the low-inflation period (1995–2016) was characterized by improvements in all of these features, but it did not lead to significant improvements in economic growth. In addition, we document a strong positive correlation between inflation rates and seigniorage revenues, although inflation rates are relatively high for modest levels of seigniorage revenues. Finally, we discuss the role of the weak institutional framework surrounding the fiscal and monetary authorities and the role of monetary passiveness and inflation indexation in accounting for the unique features of inflation dynamics in Brazil.

H62|Sraffa, saggio di interesse, sistema fiscale|This paper covers three closely interrelated stages. The first regards Sraffa’s theory. It is argued in particular that: a) Sraffa’s 1925 and 1926 articles are closely linked to Production of Commodities by means of Commodities, inasmuch they state the minimal cost, which informs indirectly the 1960 book; b) minimum costs are linear and parallel to the x axis in competition, so they are independent of the quantity produced; c) any deviation from this situation entails rents; d) rents can derive from decreasing returns (agriculture, mines) or from increasing returns (oligopoly, monopoly). Sraffa’s system solutions are discussed in depth. Particular attention is attached to the determination of the rate of interest. This leads to interconnections with the Keynesian system, which are developed in the second stage. Here the necessity emerges of rendering structural what it now conjunctural, pushing the rate of interest towards zero. This target can be reached by a fiscal instrument, i.e. by levying a tax on gross interest, close to 100%. Thus public debt ceases to be a risk, and the public deficit may increase, as happens in the majority of countries worldwide. The third stage regards the fiscal system. To obtain a similar treatment of interest, and also to try to hit oligopolies effectively, we need to render the fiscal system global. The problem arises with the remaining fiscal structure, now dominated by the principle of a worldwide basis. It is shown that this circumstance has to cease, and that internal revenue must be collected on bases which are exclusively internal. Therefore primarily the direct taxation, and then the indirect, must be reshaped. It is most interesting that a consonance is found with the taxation in vigour up the Seventies, and with De Viti theory of fiscal systems, which is national and based on the benefit principle.
H62|On the Cyclicality of Social Expenditure: New Time-Varying evidence from Developing Economies|This paper provides a novel dataset of time-varying measures of social spending cyclicality for an unbalanced panel of 45 developing economies from 1982 to 2012. More specifically, we focus on four categories of government social expenditure: health, social protection, pensions and education. We find that social spending has generally been acyclical over time in developing countries, with the exception of spending on pensions.However, sample averages high marked heterogeneity across countries with the majority showing procyclical behaviour in different social spending categories. In addition,by means of weighted least squares panel regressions with country and time effects, we find that the degree of social spending [pro]cyclicality is generally negatively associated with financial deepening, the level of economic development, trade openness, government size as well as political constraints on the executive.
H62|Desperate times call for desperate measures: government spending multipliers in hard times|We investigate state-dependent effects of fiscal multipliers and allow for endogenous sample splitting to determine whether the US economy is in a slack state. When the endogenized slack state is estimated as the period of the unemployment rate higher than about 12 percent, the estimated cumulative multipliers are significantly larger during slack periods than non-slack periods and are above unity. We also examine the possibility of time-varying regimes of slackness and find that our empirical results are robust under a more flexible framework. Our estimation results points out the importance of the heterogenous effects of fiscal policy.
H62|A Requiem for the Fiscal Theory of the Price Level|The Fiscal Theory of the Price Level (FTPL) is the claim that, in a popular class of theoretical models, the price level is sometimes determined by fiscal policy rather than monetary policy. The models where this claim has been established assume that all decisions are made by an infinitely-lived representative agent. We present an alternative, arguably more realistic model, populated by sixty-two generations of people. We calibrate our model to an income profile from U.S. data and we show that the FTPL breaks down. In our model, the price level and the real interest rate are indeterminate, even when monetary and fiscal policy are both active. Our findings challenge established views about what constitutes a good combination of fiscal and monetary policies.
H62|The Political Economy of Social Security Reform|We identify which types of Social Security reforms are supported when people vote in their financial self-interest, under alternative economic and demographic projections and voting proclivity assumptions. While 40% of voters have negative lifetime net transfers, less than 10% have negative future transfers under the un- sustainable status quo. Framing the problem as a choice between reforms is necessary for any to receive majority support. Delayed reforms are often preferred, but immediate tax hikes or slower benefit growth win in some circumstances. Inter-generational AND intragenerational heterogeneity of economic interests combine to affect which reforms are blocked and which are feasible.
H62|Fiscal Deficit Forecasts by International Institutions: Evidence for a Double Standard?|Fiscal forecasts produced by international financial institutions came under strong criticism after the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis due to overly optimistic estimates for heavily indebted countries like Spain, Italy, and Portugal. Presently, in the face of strong divisions within the European political landscape, international organizations have also been accused of applying a double standard. Opponents often claim those organizations depict a more negative picture for governments described as populist in the mainstream media. The aim of this paper is to evaluate fiscal forecasts provided by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), European Commission (EC), and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Our analysis is based on a panel of European Union economies, other OECD members, and large non-OECD economies (e.g., China). Five years after the Sovereign debt crisis, we still find negative phenomenon reported earlier in the literature. In Europe, all organizations systematically present overly optimistic deficit forecasts for Portugal, Spain, and, to a lower extent, for Italy. Moreover, the EC and OECD are being indulgent to countries under the excessive deficit procedure. There is also an evidence for strong autocorrelation of ex-post fiscal forecast errors. On the other hand, we find no strong evidence suggesting that fiscal forecasts stigmatize the governments accused of populism or violating the rule of law. Finally, in the case of European emerging economies, some kind of wishful thinking is present. For example, the EC overestimates governmentsâ€™ propensity to tighten fiscal policy during the expansion period of a business cycle and forecasts an overly pessimistic picture during a slowdown.

H62|Fiscal reaction functions for the advanced economies revisited|We revisit the evidence on the relationship between the Primary Balances/GDP and Debt/GDP ratios (Fiscal Reaction Function, FRF), in the advanced economies, showing that taking carefully into account the stochastic properties of the data leads to question the validity of the current consensus. More precisely, we find that before the 2008 financial crisis long-run FRF's existed only in a small number of advanced economies, and that they were more likely in countries characterized by higher sovereign spreads. Finally, we also find limited evidence of non-linearities leading to fiscal fatigue.
H62|The Economic and Monetary Union: Past, Present and Future|Twenty years of euro history confirms the euro’s stability and position as the second global currency. It also enjoys the support of majority of the euro area population and is seen as a good thing for the European Union. The European Central Bank has been successful in keeping inflation at a low level. However, the European debt and financial crisis in the 2010s created a need for deep institutional reform and this task remains unfinished.

Plus de 88 % du montant global, soit 10,3 milliards, provient des décisions prises en décembre. Selon nos calculs, ces mesures représentent un gain moyen de 440 euros par ménage. Les ménages du milieu de la distribution seront particulièrement ciblés. Ils bénéficieront de la baisse de la taxe d'habitation, des cotisations salariées, de la défiscalisation des heures supplémentaires et de la baisse de CSG pour certains retraités. Une partie des ménages modestes verront en moyenne leur niveau de vie soutenu par la forte revalorisation de la prime d'activité, la mise en place du zéro reste à charge et l'augmentation du chèque énergie. Les ménages parmi les 5 % les plus aisés, grands gagnants de la réforme de la fiscalité du capital de 2018, verront également leur revenu soutenu par certaines mesures socio-fiscales de 2019. Au final, trois ménages sur quatre bénéficieraient d’un gain de pouvoir d’achat. Près d'un quart des ménages subirait tout de même un impact négatif sur leur revenu disponible en lien avec les nouvelles mesures. C'est le cas notamment des inactifs. Près de la moitié des retraités serait perdante avec l'entrée en vigueur des nouvelles mesures en 2019. Si le budget 2019 opère un rééquilibrage certain, l'effet cumulé des mesures socio-fiscales de l'année passée et de l'année en cours reste marqué par la réforme de la fiscalité du patrimoine. Fin 2019, les 5 % des ménages les plus aisés enregistreront encore en moyenne un gain de pouvoir d'achat supérieur en euros à celui du milieu de la distribution des revenus
H62|Political Budget Cycles: Evidence from Swiss Cantons|Models of political budget cycles assume that politicians use fiscal policy to increase their chances of re-election. However, empirical results for advanced economies provide ambiguous support for the existence of such electoral cycles. Also, studies focusing on the regional or local level of advanced economies have found a variety of different results. In this paper, we use data at the sub-federal level of Switzerland from 1978 through 2015 to test for the presence of political budget cycles. Swiss regions called cantons are highly autonomous with regard to budgetary policy and have established direct democratic systems with frequent referendums that often affect budgetary issues. In most cantons, there are fiscal policy rules that restrict the budgetary leeway of governments. Overall, the system of government is designed to foster consensus seeking and gradual adjustment. These features should make the short-run opportunistic or partisan use of fiscal policy less likely in Swiss cantons. Rather surprisingly, however, we find at least some evidence for an electoral cycle in government spending. For government revenue or the overall budget, our empirical results do not point to an electoral cycle.
H62|Does fiscal consolidation hurt economic growth? Empirical evidence from Spanish regions|This article provides empirical evidence on the effect of fiscal consolidation in decentralized countries. The focus on Spain is justified for three reasons. First, it is one of the OECD countries that has been the most affected by the Great Recession in terms of both GDP and public deficit. Second, it is one of the most decentralized countries in the world. Third, the compliance with fiscal consolidation targets has been very diverse across regions. Using both time series econometrics and the synthetic control method approach (SCM), the authors show that compliance with fiscal targets at the regional level has not involved lower GDP growth rates in the short run.
H62|How sustainable are fiscal budgets in the Kingdom of Swaziland?|The recently experienced Swazi fiscal crisis of 2011 has facilitated the need for an academic probe into the sustainability of fiscal budgets in the Kingdom. Against the absence of empirical evidence evaluating the sustainability of Swazi fiscal budget, our study fills the hiatus by econometrically evaluating the sustainability of the fiscal budget of the Swazi economy between 1999 and 2016. Our empirical study depends on a combination of linear and asymmetric unit root and cointegration empirical procedures to attain this objective. In reviewing the obtained results, the evidence obtained from the linear econometric frameworks is inconclusive whereas the results from the more vigorous asymmetric models point to the unsustainability of Swazi fiscal budget over both the short and long-run. Important policy implications for Swazi fiscal policymakers are drawn from the analysis.
H62|Government expenditure-revenue nexus reconsidered for Nigeria: Does structural break matter?|This paper re-examines the government expenditure-revenue nexus in Nigeria from 1970 to 2015. It utilizes the Lee and Strazicich (2003 and 2004) unit root tests that endogenously determines two/one structural breaks in intercept and slope to ascertain the stationarity of the data. The Toda-Yomamoto modified Wald (MWALD)-based causality test that arbitrage between the results with and without structural breaks was conducted to determine the direction of causality between the government expenditure and revenue. The results for the causality test without break suggest that bi-directional causality exists between government expenditure and revenue suggesting the existence of the fiscal synchronization hypothesis. However, the causality test with break reveals a unidirectional causality running from government expenditure to revenue indicating that the spend-revenue hypothesis holds. This finding is a clear departure from other studies on oil-rich countries; thus indicating that accounting for structural break is vital when determining the relationship between government expenditure and revenue for resource countries. This study, therefore, suggests that government should embark on the diversification of the economy away from oil in order to promote reliable and sustained sources of revenue for the nation.
H62|Der Wohlfahrtstaat als Grundbestandteil des modernen demokratischen Staatsgefüges<BR>[The welfare state as a basic component of the modern democratic state structure]|Defining the welfare state is not a simpleminded task. Actually, there are numerous definitions which try to reflect at least some of the basic characteristics of the welfare state or its objectives and its functions. For some, there is primarily an institutional parameter, for others there are functional issues which have to be firstly indicated and for others, the ideological and political factors determine the definition and the attitude towards the welfare state. Apart from all these crucial ascertainments, there are some basic fundamental characteristics and values of the welfare state which render it as a precondition of the existence of the modern state. Unquestionably, it reflects a distinct part of the state but most importantly, it comprises a prerequisite for its existence. This is the exact aim of this paper; to surpass the theoretical diversifications and to find the fundamental common ground which forms the indispensability for the existence of the welfare state.
H62|A Modest Proposal For Augmenting The Gross Domestic Product Of Italy, Allowing Greater Public Spending, Employment, And Graft|Italy’s economy is stagnating, but a fiscal stimulus is ruled out by the Maastricht-limited deficit/GDP ratio. This paper presents a modest proposal for loosening the constraint on public spending by augmenting Italy’s female labor-force participation rate and therewith Italy’s GDP. Additional public spending would be popular, as it would increase employment; it would also be politically viable, as Italy’s elected and appointed officials would welcome the opportunity for increased graft.
H62|An integrated financial amplifier: the role of defaulted loans and occasionally binding constraints in output fluctuations|"We present a DSGE model for a small euro area economy comprising a banking sector empowered with regulatory capital requirements, defaulted loans and occasionally binding endogenous credit restrictions. Under non-financial shocks no important amplifications arise due to balancing forces: while banks' equity acts as a shock absorber, the observance of regulatory capital requirements acts as a shock amplifier. Under moderately-sized ""bad"" financial-based shocks defaulted loans increase and banks' value drop. As a result, credit becomes supply constraint for some time, severely amplifying and protracting output downfalls. Endogenous inertia implies a slow recovery in banks' capital and thus an enduring fragility of the banking system. Defaulted loans and credit restrictions are strongly intertwined, since the former severely impact banks' value, hence leveraging the amplification size."
H62|Is a Fiscal Policy Council needed in Poland?|Unsustainability and procyclicality of fiscal policy are problems that many developed countries face. The public debt crisis revealed that fiscal rules are a useful but insufficient instrument for mitigating them. A large and growing group of economists are calling for the creation of ‘fiscal policy councils’ – independent collegial bodies made up of experts whose role is to act as independent reviewers of government policy and advise the government and parliament on fiscal policy. Such councils currently exist in at least 40 countries. Poland is the only EU country that does not have a fiscal policy council. The aim of this paper is to address the issue of whether a fiscal policy council is needed in Poland and what kind of additional contribution such a council might make to the public debate on fiscal policy.
H62|Fiscal consolidation in Croatia and other post-transition countries|Recent global economic crisis and the concerns about sustainability of public finances have resulted in stronger implementation of fiscal consolidation measures. The literature does not offer a consensus on the impact of these measures. Empirical research offers a rationale for both contractionary and expansionary effect of fiscal consolidation on economic activity. Studies that examine the macroeconomic and fiscal effects of consolidation in developed countries are not frequent either have a long history, while the same effects in the post-transition countries are un-investigated. This paper tries to shed some light on this relationship. Additional contribution of this paper relates to the usage of the narrative approach introduced by Romer and Romer (2010). The research results do not support the expansionary fiscal consolidation hypothesis. Therefore, analysis suggests that fiscal consolidation in the Republic of Croatia and other post-transition countries was not successful in achieving macroeconomic goals such as economic growth.* This paper was supported by Croatian Scientific Foundation under the project ?Public Finance Sustainability on the Path to the Monetary Union? (IP-2016-06-4609).
H62|Zur strukturellen Finanzlage der Laender: eine aktuelle Auswertung und Methodenkritik|Seit Einfuehrung der neuen Schuldenregel hat sich die Finanzlage der deutschen Bundeslaender deutlich verbessert. Nach unseren Berechnungen mit dem Aggregierten Quotierungsverfahren konnten die meisten Laender ihre strukturellen Budgetdefizite abbauen und im Jahr 2017 schon 14 Laender strukturelle Budgetueberschuesse erzielen; lediglich das Saarland und Nordrhein-Westfalen wiesen strukturelle Defizite auf. Die „strukturelle“ Besserung überzeichnet indes die Konsolidierungsfortschritte, denn sie ist zum grossen Teil dem historisch niedrigen Zinsniveau zu verdanken, das zu erheblichen Einsparungen beim Schuldendienst fuehrte. Da die Finanzierungskonditionen aber nicht dauerhaft so guenstig bleiben wie in den vergangenen Jahren, verdecken die Zinsersparnisse den bei vielen Laendern noch bestehenden Konsolidierungsbedarf. Wir plaedieren daher dafuer, nur nachhaltige Einsparungen bei den Zinslasten als strukturelle Besserung zu klassifizieren und entwickeln ein Bereinigungsverfahren, das neben den Konjunktureinfluessen auch die Verzerrung durch das aeusserst niedrige Zinsniveau beachtet. Unsere Simulationen zeigen, dass nach einer Bereinigung um die nicht nachhaltigen Einsparungen beim Schuldendienst nicht mehr 14, sondern nur neun Laender im Jahr 2017 einen strukturell mindestens ausgeglichenen Haushalt erzielt haben. Bei den verbleibenden sieben Laendern besteht teilweise noch erheblicher Konsolidierungsbedarf. Wir zeigen darueber hinaus, dass die zur quantitativen Vergleichbarkeit der Laenderfinanzen in der Regel verwandten Einwohner-Indikatoren wesentliche Strukturunterschiede zwischen den Laendern unberuecksichtigt lassen und damit zu irrefuehrenden Schlussfolgerungen fuehren koennen. Wir empfehlen daher, bei Laendervergleichen Kennzahlen zu verwenden, die strukturelle Unterschiede zwischen den Laendern bei Erwerbstaetigkeit und Produktivitaet beachten.
H62|Budget 2018 : pas d'austerité mais des inégalités|L'objectif de cette étude est de fournir un panorama exhaustif du budget 2018, tant en analysant le détail des mesures votées, leur montée en charge et leur impact macroéconomique sur la croissance et le pouvoir d'achat des ménages en 2018 et 2019 qu'en évaluant leurs effets redistributifs selon le niveau de vie des ménages. Les principaux enseignements qui en résultent sont les suivants : ■ Le budget 2018 se caractérise par un faible ajustement budgétaire structurel sur la période 2018-2019. Il contient cependant des mesures fiscales et budgétaires générant de multiples transferts au sein de l'économie. Ces transferts sont marqués par le choix de la réduction de la fiscalité du capital, de la poursuite de la baisse de la fiscalité des entreprises et de la hausse de la fiscalité indirecte. ■ Les baisses de prélèvements obligatoires seront financées par des économies structurelles sur la dépense publique. Les principaux postes concernés seront la masse salariale non marchande, la politique du logement, la politique familiale, les dépenses de santé et les dépenses de fonctionnement des collectivités locales. ■ Le déficit public resterait stable en 2018 à 2,9 % de PIB et augmenterait ponctuellement de 0,1 point en 2019 (à 3,0 %) en raison du double impact comptable de la transformation du CICE en baisse de cotisations sociales. La perspective d'un passage durable sous le seuil des 3 % permettrait à la France de mettre un terme à la procédure de déficit excessif en cours. ■ Au total, la politique budgétaire nationale conduirait à accroître le PIB de 0,1 point en 2018 et de 0,3 point en 2019 (par rapport à 2017), par la combinaison de deux effets. D'une part, l'ensemble des mesures du budget réduirait le PIB de 0,2 point en 2018 et de 0,1 point en 2019 (par rapport à 2017). D'autre part, en raison des effets décalés de certaines mesures passées, l'économie française bénéficierait d'un surplus de croissance. ■ Les mesures du budget seraient quasiment neutres sur le pouvoir d'achat global des ménages en moyenne en 2018 (+0,2 milliard dont -0,8 milliard liés aux prélèvements). En 2019, la montée en charge des mesures fiscales et les nouvelles revalorisations de prestations permettraient d'accroître le pouvoir d'achat de plus de 6 milliards d'euros. ■ Les mesures nouvelles pour les ménages seraient en 2018 largement au bénéfice des 2 % de ménages du haut de la distribution des revenus, détenant l'essentiel du capital mobilier. Pour les ménages du bas de la distribution, les revalorisations en fin d'année des minima sociaux ne compensent pas les hausses de la fiscalité indirecte pour les ménages qui les subissent. Pour les « classes moyennes », ces mesures devraient avoir un impact net nul. Enfin, Les ménages situés au-dessus des « classes moyennes » mais en-dessous des 2 % les plus aisés verraient eux leur niveau de vie se réduire sous l'effet des mesures nouvelles. ■ En fin d'année 2018, contrairement à l'effet moyen sur l'année, le diagnostic évolue en faveur des « classes moyennes » du fait notamment de la baisse complète des cotisations salariés. ■ En 2019, les mesures supplémentaires pour les ménages se traduiront par une augmentation générale des niveaux de vie. Les gains enregistrés par les centiles les plus élevés de niveau de vie resteront, à la fin de l'année 2019, plus importants que les gains enregistrés par les autres ménages.
H62|Budget 2018 : pas d'austérité mais des inégalités|Si le budget 2018 se caractérise par un très faible ajustement budgétaire structurel sur la période 2018-2019, il contient de nombreuses mesures fiscales et budgétaires générant de multiples transferts au sein de l'économie. Les mesures contemporaines issues de la politique fiscale et budgétaire nationale conduiraient à réduire le PIB, toutes choses égales par ailleurs, de -0,2 point de PIB en 2018 et -0,1 point en 2019 (par rapport à 2017). En revanche, les mesures mises en place les années antérieures apporteraient un gain de croissance significatif en 2018 et 2019, permettant d'avoir au final une contribution positive de la politique budgétaire nationale au PIB (+0,1 point de PIB en 2018 et +0,2 point de PIB en 2019, par rapport à 2017). En moyenne sur 2018, les mesures fiscales et budgétaires auraient un effet quasi-nul sur le pouvoir d'achat global. En revanche, en ce qui concerne l'impact redistributif des mesures nouvelles pour les ménages, celles-ci devraient être en 2018 largement au bénéfice des 2 % de ménages du haut de la distribution des revenus qui sont ceux qui détiennent l'essentiel du capital mobilier. A contrario, pour les ménages du bas de la distribution, les revalorisations tardives des minima sociaux ne sauraient compenser les fortes hausses de la fiscalité indirecte. Globalement, pour les « classes moyennes », les mesures nouvelles devraient avoir un impact net nul. Les ménages situés au-dessus des « classes moyennes » mais en-dessous des 2 % les plus aisés verraient eux leur niveau de vie se réduire sous l'effet des mesures nouvelles. En fin d'année, et non en moyenne sur 2018, le diagnostic évolue en faveur des « classes moyennes » du fait notamment de la baisse complète des cotisations salariés. En 2019, les gestes supplémentaires adressés aux ménages se traduiront par une augmentation générale des niveaux de vie mais les gains enregistrés par les centiles les plus élevés de niveau de vie resteront, à la fin de l'année 2019, bien plus importants, tant en euros qu'en pourcentage de niveau de vie, que les gains enregistrés par les ménages du reste de la distribution.
H62|Country-specific fiscal reaction functions: what lessons for EMU ?|This paper deals with heterogeneous fiscal behaviors of euro area countries. We estimate EMU Members States fiscal reaction function using time series approach covering the period 1990 :Q1-2017 :Q2. Among the major lessons from this analysis, three general and striking results are worth highlighting : (1) factors explaining national fiscal reaction function in the short run differ from those in the long run, (2) some explanatory variables seem common to all countries while others only concern a small number of countries and (3) the sign of the impact of these explanatory variables can also differ between the countries. Finally, this paper raises the implications of heterogeneous fiscal policies on the functioning of monetary union and asks the question of fiscal convergence in the euro area.
H62|Fiscal Deficits as a Source of Boom and Bust under a Common Currency|We investigate in depth, using predominantly analytical, rather than numerical, methods, the mechanisms which operate following a one-period, debt-financed, fiscal deficit in a small open economy operating under a common currency. The economy incorporates the New Keynesian features of staggered price setting and overlapping generations. Unsurprisingly, these features cause the impact effect to be a boom, in the sense of a positive output gap. However we also find that the boom must later turn into a bust, or negative output gap. Moreover inflation also follows a boom-bust pattern and on average there is deflation rather than inflation.
H62|Karakter fiskalne politike i politička ekonomija fiskalne konsolidacije u Hrvatskoj u post-kriznom razdoblju|U ovom radu se na temelju podataka o ciklički prilagođenom primarnom proračunskom saldu (CAPB) analizira karakter fiskalne politike te snaga fiskalne konsolidacije u post-kriznom razdoblju. Dodatno, analiziraju se temeljna obilježja fiskalne konsolidacije, s posebnim naglaskom na rashode proračuna, budući da u polit-ekonomskom smislu oko ovih kategorija postoji najveći sukob između nositelja fiskalne politike i različitih interesnih skupina. Rezultati analize pokazuju da su sve vlade, osim vlade Jadranke Kosor, vodile restriktivnu procikličku fiskalnu politiku te da je najveća fiskalna konsolidacija provedena u vrijeme socijaldemokratske vlade Zorana Milanovića, kada je CAPB poboljšan za 5,7 postotnih bodova BDP-a, što otvara i pitanje je li ova činjenica jedan od temeljnih razloga za gubitak parlamentarnih izbora 2015. godine. Također, analiza je pokazala da je veliki dio fiskalne konsolidacije proveden kroz smanjenje kapitalnih investicija, iako se radi o produktivnoj kategoriji rashoda koja je mogla imati važnu ulogu u ispunjavanju stabilizacijske funkcije fiskalne politike. Analiza ekonomske politike vlade pokazala je kako nestabilne vlade, koje ovise o nizu manjih parlamentarnih aktera koji joj održavaju većinu, teško uspijevaju biti uspješne u fiskalnoj konsolidaciji. One vlade koje su najviše pozornosti pridavale fiskalnoj politici, bile su i najuspješnije u fiskalnoj konsolidaciji. Analiza akata Vlade i Sabora pokazala je kako su sve vlade bile sklone korištenju učestalih izmjena poreznog zakonodavstva kao instrumenta fiskalne politike.
H62|Modeling Fiscal Sustainability in Dynamic Macro-Panels with Heterogeneous Effects: Evidence from German Federal States|In this paper, we extend Henning Bohn’s (2008) fiscal sustainability test by allowing for slope heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence (CD). In particular, our econometric approach is the first that allows fiscal reaction functions (FRF) to capture unobserved heterogeneous effects from business and fiscal policy cycles. We apply this econometric approach to sub-national public finance data of the German Laender between 1950 and 2015 and find that their fiscal policy only partly meets fiscal sustainability criteria. According to our results, politicians have significantly reacted to increasing debt levels by increasing budget surpluses since 1991. However, time-series evidence for longer periods does not indicate a significant and positive reaction to increasing debt levels in the West German Laender panel.
H62|Is the debt brake behind Germany's successful fiscal consolidation?|"Both the German federal as well as the general government recorded a surplus for the fourth time in a row in 2017. The fast consolidation after the Great Recession coincided with the transition period for the full introduction of the federal debt brake, which is sometimes interpreted as causality. At the same time Germany's economic performance is better than that of many other countries. For this reason it is nearly impossible to overrate the symbolic power of the debt brake as a seeming success story. In this paper we scrutinise the seeming success story of the debt brake. We carry out a comparative analysis of the ""structural"" consolidation of public finances in Germany for the period from 1991 until 2017 showing that the German debt brake is not the cause of the successful budget consolidation in Germany since 2010. The improvement of the general government finances since 2010 was smaller than in previous consolidation phases and was strongly supported by a favourable macroeconomic environment, and one-off effects. Finally, neither the general government sector nor the federal government would be in such a good fiscal shape, had the economy evolved less favourably since 2010. Without the blessing of a strong upswing Germany would hardly have become the fiscal role model for Europe and the German debt brake would not have become the blueprint for the European Fiscal Compact."
H62|Wofür der Bund seinen zusätzlichen Haushaltsspielraum einsetzt|In den vergangenen Jahren zeigte sich beim Bundeshaushalt stets das gleiche Bild: Die tatsächlichen Zinsausgaben fielen geringer aus als geplant und die Steuereinnahmen stiegen stärker als von der Bundesregierung angenommen. Beide Entwicklungen verschafften dem Bund neue Handlungsspielräume. In den Jahren 2013 bis 2018 summierten sich diese auf rund 82 Milliarden Euro, wovon zwei Drittel den geringer ausgefallenen Zinsausgaben und ein Drittel den höheren Steuereinnahmen zuzurechnen sind. Hinzu kommen in diesem Zeitraum höhere sonstige Einnahmen, wie zum Beispiel Gebühren, in Höhe von kumuliert 9 Milliarden Euro. Zum einen nutzte die Bundesregierung den zusätzlichen Spielraum für neue laufende Ausgaben, zum anderen baute sie eine Rücklage auf. Im Zeitraum von 2013 bis 2018 fielen die Ausgaben (ohne Zinsen) um insgesamt 67 Milliarden Euro höher aus als die Finanzplanung es vorsah - als Vergleich dient dabei stets der Mittelwert der zwei, drei und vier Jahre vor dem Ist-Jahr erschienenen Finanzpläne des Bundes. Die Rücklage beläuft sich auf mittlerweile 24 Milliarden Euro. Allerdings soll diese nicht ihrer eigentlichen Funktion als Risikopuffer gerecht werden, vielmehr will die Bundesregierung damit Vorhaben aus dem Koalitionsvertrag finanzieren. Damit handelt es sich letztlich auch um eine Ausgabensteigerung. Auf alternative Verwendungsmöglichkeiten dieses unverhofften Haushaltsspielraums - Steuerentlastung oder Schuldentilgung - verzichtet die Bundesregierung. Die Steuerquote des Bundes ist jüngst sogar gestiegen.
H62|Tax Cuts Starve the Beast! Evidence from Germany|This paper empirically evaluates how fiscal policy reacts to changes in the government's fiscal situation. Utilizing panel data from the German states covering the period from 1992 to 2011, we assess to what extent exogenous changes in tax revenues affect total public revenues, aggregate public expenditure as well as specific sub-categories of government spending. Applying the narrative approach pioneered by Romer and Romer (2010), we construct a measure of exogenous tax shocks, allowing us to identify the causal effect of tax changes on fiscal policy. Our findings indicate that tax changes trigger expenditure adjustments into the same direction after 2 to 3 years, specifically with respect to spending on governmental administration, health expenditures and spending on infrastructure.
H62|A multi-country analysis of austerity policies in the European Union|In this paper, we analyse the global effects, i.e., the effects on the world economy, from the austerity policies implemented in the European Union (EU) over the last years. Specifically, we simulate the effects of three alternative policies aimed to get a fall of one percentage point in the EU’s government deficit to GDP ratio, through a decrease in the level of public spending, and increases in consumption and in labour taxes. We examine their effects on the main macroeconomic variables of seven regions of the world economy, i.e., the EU, the US, Japan, China, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and Rest of the World. The empirical methodology makes use of a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, through an extension of the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model. The three policy measures led to contractionary effects on the EU’s levels of activity, which were accompanied with changes in income distribution, always detrimental to labour. The effects on the rest of the world, however, were mostly negligible.
H62|Inflation Dynamics under Fiscal Deficit Regime Switching in Mexico|We explore the dynamics of inflation, inflation expectations, and seigniorage-financed fiscal deficits in Mexico. To do so, we estimate the model in Sargent, Williams, and Zha (2009) using Mexican CPI inflation data. This model features dual expected inflation equilibriums and regime switching in the mean and variance of the fiscal deficit probability density function. We examine the dynamics of inflation and mean fiscal deficit regimes. In addition, we comment on the extent to which our results match to key economic events. Mexico has successfully stabilized inflation expectations for the past decades, an achievement for which fiscal policy has been fundamental. Nevertheless, this does not preclude the possibility of an increase in the expected price level or a switch to a regime in which inflation and its expectations become unstable.
H62|Fiscal adjustment and debt sustainability: Greece 2010-2016 and beyond|This paper reviews the fiscal developments that led Greece from a successful con-vergence process and the adoption of the Euro to an unprecedented prolonged re-cession. Analysis of all fiscal aggregates reveals the policies behind the sovereign crisis, both on the expenditure and the revenue side. We employ a simple macrostatic model to identify the impact of fiscal policies on the economy through the fiscal multipliers, especially during the adjustment programmes. We attempt to explore the extent to which fiscal adjustment may have been self-defeating by developing ex post adjustment scenarios. Following this, we turn to testing debt sustainability in the long run in an interest rate sensitive environment. This is done based on a set of several varying assumptions regarding growth, fiscal performance and debt reprofiling. Analysis of the resulting scenarios points out the risks surrounding debt sustainability and draws the broad lines of future fiscal policies.
H62|The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2018 to 2028|If current laws governing taxes and spending generally remained unchanged, the federal budget deficit would grow substantially over the next few years, CBO projects, with accumulating deficits driving debt held by the public to nearly 100 percent of GDP by 2028. That amount would be far greater than the debt in any year since just after World War II. In CBOâ€™s projections, real GDP growth is relatively strong this year and next, as recent changes in fiscal policy add to existing momentum.
H62|An Analysis of the Presidentâ€™s 2019 Budget|The cumulative deficit under the Presidentâ€™s policies would total $9.5 trillion over the 2019â€“2028 period, $2.9 trillion less than in CBO's baseline. Over that period, the deficit would range from 3.2 percent to 4.5 percent of GDP, averaging 3.7 percent. As a result, federal debt held by the public would increase from 78 percent of GDP this year to 86 percent in 2028.
H62|The 2018 Long-Term Budget Outlook|In CBOâ€™s projections, federal budget deficits grow substantially over the next several years in relation to the size of the economy, stabilize for a few years, and then grow again over the rest of the 30-year period. If current laws generally remained unchanged, the growing deficits would raise federal debt held by the public from 78 percent of gross domestic product this year to nearly 100 percent by the end of the next decade and 152 percent by 2048.
H62|The Deficit Reductions Necessary to Meet Various Targets for Federal Debt|CBO has examined various illustrative scenarios in which the federal government makes debt held by the public smaller than it would be if current laws remained generally unchanged. In those scenarios, the primary deficitâ€”that is, the deficit excluding net outlays for interestâ€”is reduced to make debt equal 41 percent, 78 percent, or 100 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) over the next 15 to 30 years. Two broad strategies are used: reducing the primary deficit by a constant share of GDP over time and reducing the primary deficit by an increasing share of GDP.
H62|The Long-Term Budget Outlook Under Alternative Scenarios for Fiscal Policy|In CBOâ€™s most recent extended baseline projections, federal debt held by the public rises from an amount equal to 78 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2018 to 118 percent of GDP in 2038. This report expands on those projections by showing how the federal budget and the nationâ€™s economy would evolve under three alternative scenarios. In those scenarios, laws would be changed to continue certain policies now in place, leading to even higher debt.
H62|Options for Reducing the Deficit: 2019 to 2028|Since 2007, federal debt held by the public has more than doubled in relation to the size of the economy. The Congress faces an array of policy choices as it confronts the challenges posed by such large and growing debt. To help inform lawmakers, CBO periodically issues a volume of optionsâ€”this yearâ€™s installment presents 121â€”that would decrease federal spending or increase federal revenues over the next decade.

In particular, our econometric approach is the first that allows fiscal reaction functions (FRF) to capture unobserved heterogeneous effects from business and fiscal policy cycles. We apply this econometric approach to sub-national public finance data of the German Laender between 1950 and 2015 and find that their fiscal policy only partly meets fiscal sustainability criteria.

However, time-series evidence for longer periods does not indicate a significant and positive reaction to increasing debt levels in the West German Laender panel.
H62|How Much Binding Is the Bill?|We study whether and how much the interest bill conditions the size and composition of public expenditures. The group of EU 15 countries over the 1995-2016 period is the object of analysis. We study both total public expenditures and public expenditures by function of government in order to unveil which sectors are more responsive to an interest bill variation.
H62|The Effects of Immigration in Developed Countries: Insights from Recent Economic Research|The rise in international migration over the past decades and particularly the recent influx of refugees to the European Union has given more audience to the economic and political consequences of immigration. A major concern in the public debate is that immigrants could take jobs from natives, reduce their wages and negatively contribute to public finances. At the same time, the rise of right-wing populist movements has brought to light that the skepticism towards immigrants and refugees may not only be based only on economic but also on cultural considerations. This report is devoted to investigating these considerations by carefully relying on the existing evidence. We thus study the vast literature on the effects of immigration on the labor market and welfare system in host societies, as well as the more recent literature on the attitudinal and political consequences of immigration. The literature on the labor market impact of immigration indicates that immigration has a negligible average impact on the wages and employment of native workers. However, because adjustments take time, particularly when immigration is unexpected, the initial and longer run impacts of immigration can differ. The average impact of immigration on public finance is also negligible, sometimes slightly positive or slightly negative. We also document that immigration can have distributional consequences. In particular, the age and educational structure of immigrants plays an important role in determining their impact on the labor market and public finances. The fact that immigration is sometimes perceived as a factor depressing economic outcomes in host countries tends to affect native attitudes and electoral outcomes. In this regard, the literature first suggests that cultural concerns is the main driving force behind the skepticism towards immigration and that fiscal or labor market concerns only play a secondary role. Second, immigration tends to reduce the support for redistribution among native workers. Third, the effect of local level exposure to immigrants and refugees on native attitudes towards immigrants and extreme voting has been found to vary by context and can be positive or negative.
H62|The Monetary and Fiscal History of Brazil, 1960-2016|Brazil has had a long period of high inflation. It peaked around 100 percent per year in 1964, decreased until the first oil shock (1973), but accelerated again afterward, reaching levels above 100 percent on average between 1980 and 1994. This last period coincided with severe balance of payments problems and economic stagnation that followed the external debt crisis in the early 1980s. We show that the high-inflation period (1960-1994) was characterized by a combination of fiscal deficits, passive monetary policy, and constraints on debt financing. The transition to the low-inflation period (1995-2016) was characterized by improvements in all of these features, but it did not lead to significant improvements in economic growth. In addition, we document a strong positive correlation between inflation rates and seigniorage revenues, although inflation rates are relatively high for modest levels of seigniorage revenues. Finally, we discuss the role of the weak institutional framework surrounding the fiscal and monetary authorities and the role of monetary passiveness and inflation indexation in accounting for the unique features of inflation dynamics in Brazil.
H62|L'impact budgétaire de 30 ans d'immigration en France : (I) une approche comptable|Cet article e´value la contribution nette de l’immigration aux finances publiques en France depuis la fin des anne´es 70. Nous de´veloppons une me´thode comptable qui de´sagre`ge le de´ficit public primaire entre la contribution propre a` la population des immigre´s et celle des natifs. Cette contribution nette est calcule´e comme la diffe´rence entre les taxes, cotisations et impo^ts divers qu’ils versent aux finances publiques et l’ensemble des be´ne´fices qu’ils en retirent. Un des apports de cet article est de calculer cette contribution nette sur une pe´riode de temps relativement longue (1979-2011). Nous montrons que la contribution nette des immigre´s a ge´ne´ralement e´te´ ne´gative sur l’ensemble de la pe´riode, mais qu’elle n’a jamais e´te´ a` l’origine du de´ficit primaire de la France. Leur contribution est toujours reste´e contenue en dec¸a` de ±0, 5% du PIB (re´duit a` ±0, 2%, si on fait exception de l’anne´e 2011). Cette relative neutralite´ de la population immigre´e sur les comptes publics s’explique par une structure de´mographique favorable, qui compense leur moindre contribution nette individuelle. La crise de 2008, compare´e a` la re´cession des anne´es 90, a eu des effets plus marque´s. Alors que les immigre´s expliquent 8,3% du de´ficit primaire par habitant en France en 1995 (comparable a` leur poids dans la population totale), cette part est de plus de 17% en 2011. Cette diffe´rence s’explique en grande partie par le fait que les actifs immigre´s ont e´te´ beaucoup plus touche´s que les actifs natifs durant la crise de 2008, en particulier les moyennement et hautement qualifie´s. Les anne´es 2000 ont e´galement vue la contribution nette par te^te des immigre´s originaires de l’Union Europe´enne se de´grader sensiblement et rejoindre celle des immigre´s originaires de pays tiers.
H62|The Effects of Immigration in Developed Countries: Insights from Recent Economic Research|Immigrants currently account for 3.3% of the world’s population. We know that migration is demographically important, but what are its implications for the labour market, public finance and political landscape? To answer these questions, this report draws on recent literature on the economic and cultural effects of immigration on host societies, with a focus on evidence for European countries. Although the average effects of immigration on labour markets and public finance are marginal, immigration can create winners and losers in the native workforce. By affecting the skill composition of receiving economies, an immigration-induced increase in the labour supply can impact wage dispersion in host countries. It is cultural concerns, however, that tend to fuel scepticism towards immigration, with fiscal or labour market playing only a secondary role. A deeper understanding of these concerns is a precondition for designing policies that foster a positive atmosphere and combat negative attitudes towards immigrants and extreme voting.
H62|Sostenibilidad de la deuda pública en Colombia|Este artículo presenta un análisis sobre la sostenibilidad de la deuda pública en Colombia para el periodo 2012-2016. Se procede en dos partes: la primera corresponde al estado del arte en esta materia, se incluye una serie de definiciones y distinciones clave, así como los elementos relevantes de la teoría económica —siendo el criterio de sostenibilidad de Blanchard (1990) el indicador más importante—. Al mismo tiempo, se presentan las disposiciones jurídicas que enmarcan el manejo de la deuda por parte del Estado. Adicionalmente, se muestra que la trayectoria de la deuda impacta no sólo las finanzas públicas, sino que también afecta la desigualdad y los objetivos de crecimiento y desarrollo del país. La segunda parte expone la evidencia empírica. Se centra en la discusión de los elementos macroeconómicos y sociopolíticos que han incidido en la dinámica de la deuda durante este periodo. Para ello, se incorpora una simulación de largo plazo del organismo de control y se plantea que la sostenibilidad requiere, más allá del cumplimiento de los criterios de teoría económica —particularmente el de Blanchard— de una serie de decisiones políticas en torno a la estructura tributaria y productiva del país, en relación con los objetivos de crecimiento y desarrollo económico. Para finalizar, se introduce una serie de conclusiones que permiten sintetizar los hallazgos presentados y servir de insumo para las discusiones de política económica que se requieren en torno al manejo responsable y sostenible de la deuda.
H62|The household fallacy|We refer to the idea that government must ‘tighten its belt’ as a necessary policy response to higher indebtedness as the household fallacy. We provide a reason to be skeptical of this claim that holds even if the economy always operates at full employment and all markets clear. Our argument rests on the fact that, in an overlapping-generations (OLG) model, changes in government debt cause changes in the real interest rate that redistribute the burden of repayment across generations. We do not rely on the assumption that the equilibrium is dynamically inefficient, and our argument holds in a version of the OLG model where the real interest rate is always positive.
H62|Independent fiscal councils: Recent trends and performance|Countries increasingly rely on independent fiscal councils to constrain policymakers’ discretion and curb the bias towards excessive deficits and pro-cyclical policies. Since fiscal councils are often recent and heterogeneous across countries, assessing their impact is challenging. Using the latest (2016) vintage of the IMF Fiscal Council Dataset, we focus on two tasks expected to strengthen fiscal performance: the preparation or assessment of forecasts, and the monitoring of compliance with fiscal rules. Tentative econometric evidence suggests that the presence of a fiscal council is associated with more accurate and possibly less optimistic fiscal forecasts, as well as greater compliance with fiscal rules.
H62|The effect of fiscal announcements on interest spreads: Evidence from the Netherlands|We estimate the effect of consolidation efforts on investors' perception of government's solvency. To this end, we analyze announcements by Dutch government officials between September 2008 and December 2014 and select those messages that contain relevant new information on the likelihood and substance of consolidation packages. We then scrutinize whether announcements affect the yield spread of Dutch ten year government bonds vis-à-vis German bonds. Our findings indicate that announcements hinting at improvements in the budget balance significantly lowered yield spreads. As most announcements involve events during the negotiation process on consolidation packages rather than the official date of agreement or implementation of these packages, our results illustrate the importance of accurately assessing the news content of messages.
H62|The fiscal impact of 30 years of immigration in France: an accounting approach|This article aims to evaluate the net contribution of immigration to the public finances of France between the late 1970s and the early 2010s. We developed an accounting method that disaggregates the primary deficit into the specific contributions of immigrant population and native population. We show that the net contribution of immigrants is generally negative over a relatively long period, but remains at an extremely low level (+/-0:5% of the french GDP, reduced to +/-0:2%, with the exception of 2011). The relatively negligible effect of immigrants on the public accounts is explained by a favourable demographic structure offsetting their lower net individual contribution. However, the 2008 financial crisis has significantly degraded the economic condition of immigrants. The net per capita contribution of EU immigrants has significantly declined since 2000 and is now similar to values from third country immigrants.
H62|Deficit-debt adjustment (DDA) analysis: an analytical tool to assess the consistency of government finance statistics|This statistical paper describes and explains a specific tool enabling statisticians to gain additional insights and assess the consistency of government finance statistics (GFS): analysis of the deficit-debt adjustment (DDA), or stock-flow adjustment (SFA). The DDA reconciles two key government indicators – the government deficit/surplus and government debt. DDA analysis helps to establish whether these statistics are plausible and reliable by exploring the consistency between governments’ non-financial accounts (measuring the government deficit/surplus) and financial accounts (measuring government debt at market value). It also takes into account valuation differences between the financial accounts and government debt measured at face value (Maastricht debt). Recent years’ GFS for the euro area aggregate and the individual euro area countries (and, where useful, other EU Member States’ data) are used to illustrate DDA analysis. The dataset bridging the government deficit and the change in government debt reveals many aspects of a government’s economic policies. For instance, the components of the DDA shed light on its equity investments or privatisations, its use of investment in financial reserves, some aspects of its debt management and the accumulation of fiscal or social arrears.

H62|Ignorance isn’t bliss: Uninformed voters drive budget cycles|The paper shows that blissful ignorance does not apply to fiscal policy. In countries with insufficiently informed voters, politicians attempt to ‘buy’ votes by substantially increasing government expenditures in election years and tightening the belt post election. This generates costly budget cycles and unnecessary macroeconomic fluctuations. Unlike much of the earlier literature that found this effect only in low income countries or new democracies, we demonstrate that it has occurred in many prosperous countries with an established political system. In particular, constructing an Informed-voter (INFOVOT) index, we show that only the top third of OECD countries with well-informed voters does not experience political budget cycles. In contrast, the bottom third of OECD countries with poorly-informed voters see a deterioration of the budget balance by 1% of GDP on average in election years, which represents an increase of more than 25% relative to their usual budget deficits. Interestingly, for the intermediate group of countries with moderately-informed voters, for example Austria, France, Germany, Japan, Luxembourg, the U.K. and the U.S., election deficit hikes (of 0.75% of GDP) are observed during the 1995-2008 period only, but not since. We discuss why their budget cycles may have disappeared after the Global financial crisis, unlike in countries with poorly-informed voters, drawing on the ‘rational inattention’ literature. We also offer some policy recommendations that could improve the voters’ incentives to acquire and process fiscal policy information, and thus avoid an ‘ignorance trap’.
H62|Budget 2018 : pas d'austérité mais des inégalités|Si le budget 2018 se caractérise par un très faible ajustement budgétaire structurel sur la période 2018-2019, il contient denombreuses mesures fiscales et budgétaires générant de multiples transferts au sein de l'économie. Les mesures contemporaines issues de la politique fiscale et budgétaire nationale conduiraient à réduire le PIB, toutes choses égales par ailleurs, de -0,2 point de PIB en 2018 et -0,1 point en 2019 (par rapport à 2017). En revanche, les mesures mises en place les années antérieures apporteraient un gain de croissance significatif en 2018 et 2019, permettant d'avoir au finalune contribution positive de la politique budgétaire nationale au PIB (+0,1 point de PIB en 2018 et +0,2 point de PIB en 2019, par rapport à 2017). En moyenne sur 2018, les mesures fiscales et budgétaires auraient un effet quasi-nul sur le pouvoir d'achat global. En revanche, en ce qui concerne l'impact redistributif des mesures nouvelles pour les ménages, celles-ci devraient être en2018 largement au bénéfice des 2 % de ménages du haut de la distribution des revenus qui sont ceux qui détiennent l'essentiel du capital mobilier. A contrario, pour les ménages du bas de la distribution, les revalorisations tardives des minimasociaux ne sauraient compenser les fortes hausses de la fiscalité indirecte. Globalement, pour les « classes moyennes »,les mesures nouvelles devraient avoir un impact net nul. Les ménages situés au-dessus des « classes moyennes » maisen-dessous des 2 % les plus aisés verraient eux leur niveau de vie se réduire sous l'effet des mesures nouvelles. En fin d'année, et non en moyenne sur 2018, le diagnostic évolue en faveur des « classes moyennes » du fait notamment de la baisse complète des cotisations salariés. En 2019, les gestes supplémentaires adressés aux ménages se traduiront par une augmentation générale des niveaux de vie mais les gains enregistrés par les centiles les plus élevés de niveau de vie resteront, à la fin de l'année 2019, bien plus importants, tant en euros qu'en pourcentage de niveau de vie, que les gainsenregistrés par les ménages du reste de la distribution Classification-JEL: H2, H3, H62, H68
H62|Decentralization and Football|Objectives We show that decentralization of economic and political power makes a substantial difference in football. Decentralization increases the competitive balance of domestic football leagues and creates an advantage for clubs from decentralized countries in international competitions. Methods We run pooled cross‐sectional time‐series analyses using data from 35 European countries over the period 1950–2010 and logistic regressions with data from the first 18 editions of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Champions League. Results We find that regional autonomy boosts the competition among clubs from different regions and results in a greater competitive balance of domestic football leagues. Clubs from decentralized countries have a greater chance of winning, or at least playing in the final, than those from centralized countries. Conclusions The degree of countries’ political and economic decentralization positively increases the likelihood of winning football international trophies.
H62|Deficit, monetization, and economic growth: a case for multiplicity and indeterminacy|Abstract This paper develops an original analysis of deficit monetization in a growth model with transaction costs, in which economic growth interacts with productive public expenditures. This interaction generates two positive balanced growth paths (BGP) in the long run: a high BGP and a low BGP. The transitional dynamics show that multiplicity cannot be rejected if transaction costs affect both consumption and investment expenditures, with possible indeterminacy of the high BGP. Importantly, deficit monetization is shown to reduce the parameter space producing indeterminacy.
H62|L’impact sur les finances publiques de 30 ans d’immigration en France|La question migratoire s’est retrouvée au centre des débats politiques de ces dernières années, qu’il s’agisse du vote anglais en faveur du Brexit en juin 2016, de l’élection de Donald Trump aux États-Unis en novembre 2016 ou encore des élections législatives fédérales en Allemagne en septembre 2017. À chaque fois, le débat politique s’est polarisé sur le nombre de migrants que l’économie du pays pouvait « raisonnablement » accueillir et surtout sur le coût qui en résulterait pour la collectivité. Si cette question a été relativement peu abordée durant la dernière élection présidentielle en France, elle n’en demeure pas moins un sujet de préoccupation des Français. Cette Lettre apporte des éléments d’évaluation de la contribution nette des immigrés aux finances publiques françaises sur une période de plus de 30 ans (1979 à 2011), en la calculant comme la différence entre les taxes, cotisations et impôts divers versés et l’ensemble des bénéfices obtenus du secteur public. Les estimations réalisées montrent que, sur l’ensemble de la période étudiée, la contribution des immigrés en pourcentage du PIB est relativement faible (entre - 0,5 % et + 0,05 %). À aucun moment l’immigration n’a déterminé l’ampleur et l’évolution du solde budgétaire primaire.
H62|Fiscal Multipliers in the Eurozone: A SVAR Analysis|We compute the value of fiscal multipliers (for government primary expenditure, Income and wealth taxes and for Production and import ones) in the Eurozone countries since the creation of the currency union (2001Q1-2016Q4), and to understand how the values may vary according to the public debt level, the rhythm of economic growth and the output gap. Imposing quarterly fiscal shocks in the period 2000-2016, the results shown that the government expenditure had a positive effect on output, with an annual accumulated multiplier of 0.64 while the tax multipliers presented negative signs - the Income and wealth and the Production and import taxes stood at -0.10 and -0.32, respectively. Furthermore, the multipliers shown higher values for countries with higher levels of public debt (to small levels, the expenditure multiplier is close to zero and the tax multipliers seem to have positive signs),during recessions, and in countries with positive output gaps.
H62|The Relationship between Fiscal and Current Account Imbalances in OECD Economies|This study re-examines the nexus between the fiscal balance and the current account balance for 18 OECD countries for the period 1995Q1 to 2018 Q1 using panel cointegration, and panel vector autoregressive (VAR) methods. Our results indicate that a strengthening in the fiscal balance by one percentage point of GDP leads to an improvement in the current account balance of about 0.1-0.3 percentage point of GDP. On the other hand, an increase in real government consumption generally leads to a deterioration in the current account balance. The impact of the real effective exchange rate is not statistically significant. The findings also confirm that there is a long-run relationship between the fiscal balance and the current account balance.
H62|Evolución de la deuda pública en los países de la Zona Euro. Determinantes y sostenibilidad de la misma|The purpose of this paper is to analyze the evolution and sustainability of the public debt in the Eurozone and in the most important Eurozone countries (Spain, Italy, Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Finland) during the period between 2001 and 2018 through the traditional accounting approach of accumulation of the debt/GDP ratio. This approach, in addition to quantify the effect of those determinants that have influence over the debt performance, will make possible the assess of the debt sustainability in terms of a State's ability to achieve primary surpluses, if necessary, according to changes in the interest-growth differential.The financial crisis that began in 2008 finished with the global bearish trend of the ratio of debt. Primary deficits began to manifest, there was a major recession in the countries of the European Union and the funding costs increased, what caused important increases in the levels of the debt ratio up to the point of putting in risk its own sustainability. El presente trabajo tiene por objeto analizar la evolución y la sostenibilidad de la deuda pública en la Eurozona y en los países más relevantes de la misma (España, Italia, Grecia, Portugal, Irlanda, Alemania, Francia, Holanda y Finlandia) durante el periodo 2001-2018 a través del enfoque tradicional contable de acumulación de la ratio de deuda/PIB. Este enfoque, además de permitir cuantificar el efecto de los determinantes que inciden en el comportamiento de la deuda, permitirá evaluar la sostenibilidad de la misma, en términos de la capacidad de un Estado para conseguir superávits primarios, en caso de que fuera necesario, acordes a los cambios acontecidos en el diferencial interés-crecimiento. La crisis financiera que comenzó en 2008 acabó con la tendencia global bajista de la ratio de deuda. Los déficits primarios comenzaron a manifestarse, se produjo una gran recesión en los países de la Unión Europea y los costes de financiación aumentaron, lo que desembocó en importantes aumentos de los niveles de la ratio de deuda hasta el punto de poner en riesgo su propia sostenibilidad.
H62|Functional Finance: A Comparison of the Evolution of the Positions of Hyman Minsky and Abba Lerner|"This paper examines the views of Hyman Minsky and Abba Lerner on the functional finance approach to fiscal policy. It argues that the main principles of functional finance were relatively widely held in the immediate postwar period. However, with the rise of the Phillips curve, the return of the Quantity Theory, the development of the notion of a government budget constraint, and accelerating inflation at the end of the 1960s, functional finance fell out of favor. The paper compares and contrasts the evolution of the views of Minsky and Lerner over the postwar period, arguing that Lerner's transition went further, as he embraced a version of Monetarism that emphasized the use of monetary policy over fiscal policy. Minsky's views of functional finance became more nuanced, in line with his Institutionalist approach to the economy. However, Minsky never rejected his early beliefs that countercyclical government budgets must play a significant role in stabilizing the economy. Thus, in spite of some claims that Minsky should not be counted as one of the ""forefathers"" of Modern Money Theory (MMT), this paper argues that it is Minsky, not Lerner, whose work remains essential for the further development of MMT."
H62|Zur strukturellen Finanzlage der Länder: eine aktuelle Auswertung und Methodenkritik|Seit Einfuehrung der neuen Schuldenregel hat sich die Finanzlage der deutschen Bundeslaender deutlich verbessert. Nach unseren Berechnungen mit dem Aggregierten Quotierungsverfahren konnten die meisten Laender ihre strukturellen Budgetdefizite abbauen und im Jahr 2017 schon 14 Laender strukturelle Budgetueberschuesse erzielen; lediglich das Saarland und Nordrhein-Westfalen wiesen strukturelle Defizite auf. Die „strukturelle“ Besserung überzeichnet indes die Konsolidierungsfortschritte, denn sie ist zum grossen Teil dem historisch niedrigen Zinsniveau zu verdanken, das zu erheblichen Einsparungen beim Schuldendienst fuehrte. Da die Finanzierungskonditionen aber nicht dauerhaft so guenstig bleiben wie in den vergangenen Jahren, verdecken die Zinsersparnisse den bei vielen Laendern noch bestehenden Konsolidierungsbedarf. Wir plaedieren daher dafuer, nur nachhaltige Einsparungen bei den Zinslasten als strukturelle Besserung zu klassifizieren und entwickeln ein Bereinigungsverfahren, das neben den Konjunktureinfluessen auch die Verzerrung durch das aeusserst niedrige Zinsniveau beachtet. Unsere Simulationen zeigen, dass nach einer Bereinigung um die nicht nachhaltigen Einsparungen beim Schuldendienst nicht mehr 14, sondern nur neun Laender im Jahr 2017 einen strukturell mindestens ausgeglichenen Haushalt erzielt haben. Bei den verbleibenden sieben Laendern besteht teilweise noch erheblicher Konsolidierungsbedarf. Wir zeigen darueber hinaus, dass die zur quantitativen Vergleichbarkeit der Laenderfinanzen in der Regel verwandten Einwohner-Indikatoren wesentliche Strukturunterschiede zwischen den Laendern unberuecksichtigt lassen und damit zu irrefuehrenden Schlussfolgerungen fuehren koennen. Wir empfehlen daher, bei Laendervergleichen Kennzahlen zu verwenden, die strukturelle Unterschiede zwischen den Laendern bei Erwerbstaetigkeit und Produktivitaet beachten.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H62|Returning to the Golden Rule of Balanced Budgets: The Institutional and Political Economy of Restricting Public Deficits and Debt|In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, both politicians and public finance economists focused their attention on ways to control public budget deficits and debt. Around the world, detailed and precise regulations affected how governments could deal with public deficit and debt. The â€œgolden ruleâ€ of public finance states that governments should borrow only to invest and not to fund current spending, and that the current budget must always balance or show a surplus. Yet implementing the â€œgolden ruleâ€ is not a simple question of setting limits to deficits and debt. Using the case of Switzerland, this paper presents the political and institutional economics of budget constraints and develops recommendations for budget management at the subnational government level. How do we balance the needs of current expenditures with intergenerational equity? Does fiscal control over deficit or debt require top-down policies from higher levels of government, or is self-imposed control reasonable?
H62|How sustainable are fiscal budgets in the Kingdom of Swaziland?|The recently experienced Swazi fiscal crisis of 2011 has facilitated the need for an academic probe into the sustainability of fiscal budgets in the Kingdom. Against the absence of empirical evidence evaluating the sustainability of Swazi fiscal budget, our study fills the hiatus by econometrically evaluating the sustainability of the fiscal budget of the Swazi economy between 1999 and 2016. Our empirical study depends on a combination of linear and asymmetric unit root and cointegration empirical procedures to attain this objective. In reviewing the obtained results, the evidence obtained from the linear econometric frameworks is inconclusive whereas the results from the more vigorous asymmetric models point to the unsustainability of Swazi fiscal budget over both the short and long-run. Important policy implications for Swazi fiscal policymakers are drawn from the analysis.
H62|Sustainable finance for inclusive growth in Thailand|The Partnerships pillar of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development cuts across all the goals focusing on the mobilisation of resources needed to implement the agenda. Thailand’s “sufficiency economy philosophy” encourages the prioritisation of long-term sustainability over short-term benefits. As such, Thailand has a long history of fiscal prudence that has served the country well in times of economic and political instability. However, relying on current fiscal buffers to finance foreseeable expenditure pressures is not sufficient or sustainable. A rapidly ageing population and shrinking workforce will weigh on future public finances and on the ability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. To ensure that Thailand is well placed over the medium term to meet growing social, environmental and infrastructure requirements, the government should: (i) increase tax revenues by broadening the tax base and enhancing collection efficiency; (ii) facilitate greater private sector investment in productive infrastructure; and (iii) reform the healthcare and pension systems to increase their efficiency and effectiveness. This Working Paper relates to the Initial Assessment report of the Multi-dimensional Country Review of Thailand. (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/multi-dimensional-review-thailand.htm)
H62|Costa Rica: Restoring fiscal sustainability and setting the basis for a more growth-friendly and inclusive fiscal policy|Consecutive years of primary deficits have led to mounting public debt of almost 50% of GDP, one of the fastest increases in Latin America over the last decade. Government attempts to restore fiscal health have been undermined by a gridlocked Congress. While only minor reforms have been enacted to contain spending, efforts to curb tax evasion and increase the efficiency of the tax administration are commendable. However, increases in tax revenue have been unable to match mandated increases in spending. As a consequence, sovereign debt ratings have declined to below investment level, and the negative outlook on Costa Rica’s debt signals increasing financing costs. Against this backdrop, the risk of a fiscal crisis is increasing, particularly as global financial conditions become less favourable and debt structure has shifted towards increased reliance on floating rates and dollar-denominated bonds. Enacting a three year fiscal consolidation programme of one percentage point of GDP each year, will enable debt to stabilise at current levels by 2032. The current draft bill to strengthen public finances – Ley de Fortalecimiento de las Finanzas Públicas – proposes a comprehensive fiscal reform package, with measures on both the revenue and the spending side, as well as a fiscal rule. It needs to be complemented with additional measures to contain revenue earmarking. In addition, reducing excessive fragmentation of the public sector would allow the Ministry of Finance to regain control of the budget. There is also room to reduce expenditure on remuneration of public sector workers, one of the fastest growing expenditure items and a source of income inequality. The proposed fiscal rule should be strengthened, including introducing a multi-year expenditure framework and a fiscal council. Debt management should be modernised by stepping up communication with markets and reducing the number of benchmark securities. Over time, improving social spending efficiency and quality as well as modifying the tax structure away from social security contributions and enlarging the tax base would allow for a much stronger contribution of fiscal policy to growth and equity.
H62|The effect of oil shocks and cyclicality in hiding Indian twin deficits|Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to estimate the relationship between the current account (CA) and fiscal deficit (FD), and the real exchange rate for India, for the managed float period 1996 Q2 to 2015 Q4, after controlling for output growth and oil shocks. It also examines the cyclicality of the CA, the size of each shock, and assesses whether aggregate demand, forward-looking smoothing, or supply shocks dominate outcomes. Design/methodology/approach - The authors use several variants of structural vector autoregression (SVAR), implemented with quarterly Indian data, to control for effects of oil prices, and the output cycle, and then see how FD shocks affect the current account deficit (CAD) and the real exchange rate. For robustness, the authors tried different identifications, changed variable definitions, added new variables, or substituted with other variables. The cyclicality issue is addressed by examining the effect of growth shocks. The relative size of each shock is assessed through co-movement decompositions of the forecast errors. Responses to shocks help identify dominant influences on India’s CAD. Findings - The CAD is found to be countercyclical. A FD shock raises the CAD, but high impact growth shocks and large variance oil shocks lead to overall divergence of the deficits. There is some support for the aggregate demand channel, but it is moderated by supply shocks and compositional effects. Consumption is sticky rather than forward-looking. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the literature by including supply shocks, compositional effects, cyclicality, real interest and exchange rate in a theoretically and empirically consistent way for the analysis of twin deficits. The large empirical literature on twin deficits in EMs has not yet done this. There is no study using quarterly data in an SVAR allowing the dynamic relationship between the variables to be explored. The extensions bring in the supply side and compositional effects qualify the working of both the channels, with empirical exercises supporting theoretical predictions.
H62|The Government Dependence on Financial Sources of Outside It's Influence|The Brexit will reduce the amounts that the European Union will be able to redirect for Structural and Cohesion Funds to reduce gaps in favor of less developed countries. If we have any external support, we will be able to achieve the revenue enumerated in the state budget law. The main sources of growth, which would increase revenues, are strictly the funds that would come from the European Union (five times more this year than last year). By providing this year's budget, for the good budget execution as it was initiated, it would be ideal to get these absolutely necessary funds.
H62|A Complementary Tool to Monitor Fiscal Stress in European Economies|This paper presents an indicator of fiscal distress for European economies based on a multivariate regression analysis (logit modelling, the L1 indicator) and on a recently updated dataset of fiscal stress episodes. This indicator presents some interesting features: relying on a parsimonious set of variables that have been tested for their conditional statistical significance, it exhibits an overall satisfactory insample performance. In line with Berti et al. (2012), this indicator confirms the importance of monitoring macro-financial variables to assess countries' vulnerabilities to fiscal distress. It also provides some evidence that the change in the public debt ratio is an important predictor of fiscal distress events, while the level of public debt would particularly matter when combined with macrocompetitiveness imbalances. Our analysis suggests that the L1 indicator could be used as a complementary tool to the Commission S0 indicator to monitor prospective fiscal risks, building on the respective strengths of the two approaches, while compensating for their limitations.
H62|Fiscal policy and aggregate demand in the USA before, during, and following the Great Recession|Abstract We examine the direct effect of federal and subnational fiscal policy on aggregate demand in the USA by introducing the Fiscal Effect (FE) measure. FE can be decomposed into three components. Discretionary FE quantifies the effect of discretionary or legislated policy changes on aggregate demand. Cyclical FE captures the effect of the automatic stabilizers—changes in government taxes and spending arising from the business cycle. Residual FE measures the effect of all changes in government revenues and outlays which cannot be categorized as either discretionary or cyclical; for example, it captures the effect of the secular increase in entitlement program spending due to the aging of the population. Unlike other approaches, FE is a bottom-up approach that allows for differential effects on aggregate demand depending on the type and length of the policy change. Thus, FE is arguably the most detailed and comprehensive measure available of the stance of US fiscal policy in relation to aggregate demand. We use our new metric to examine the contribution of fiscal policy to growth in real GDP over the course of the Great Recession and current expansion. We compare this contribution to the contributions to growth in aggregate demand made by fiscal policy over past business cycles. In doing so, we highlight that the relatively strong support of government policy to GDP growth during the Great Recession was followed by a historically weak contribution over the course of the current expansion.

Some lessons on the conduct of fiscal policy in a reference framework in structural terms can be learned from the simulations provided for illustrative purposes. These simulations show in particular that – under certain conditions relating to the degree to which the budgetary adjustments have a permanent effect on the economic activity and thus on potential GDP – when the feedback effects of adjustments on the underlying macroeconomic environment are left out of consideration, this can be detrimental to the credibility of the considered structural paths.

H62|Russia’s Budgetary System|In 2016, fiscal revenues of the enlarged government surpassed 2015 volumes both in absolute terms (by RUB 1,253bn) and in relative terms by 0.5 percentage point of GDP (see Table 6). Expenditures of the enlarged government went up by 0.8 percentage point of GDP and by RUB 1,581bn in absolute terms. The fiscal deficit of the enlarged government in 2016 was up compared to the level of the previous year (3.7% of GDP in 2016 against 3.4% of GDP in 2015). It should be noted that the fiscal deficit reported in 2015–2016 surpassed manifold its 2013-2014 volumes both in absolute and in relative terms.
H62|The characteristic features of the federal budget|In 2016, certain amendments were made to RF legislation, whereby the specific features of the budgeting process at the federal level were determined. In particular, the alterations introduced by Federal Law No 71-FZ dated May 30, 2016 'On Suspending Paragraph Four of Item 2 of Article 179 of the Budget Code of the Russian Federation' are designed to optimize the procedures for adjusting government (municipal) programs. With due regard for the complicated economic situation, the provision of the Budget Code of the Russian Federation (hereinafter to be referred to as RF BC) whereby all government (municipal) programs were to be brought in conformity with the budget law (or budget decision) by April 1, 2016 was suspended for one more year (until January 1, 2017).
H62|Cyclical sensitivity of public finances in former Yugoslavian countries (2001–2014)|The aim of this paper is to analyse fiscal policy in former Yugoslavian countries over the period 2001–2014. The contribution of the paper is threefold. First, we build a homogenous database to describe the evolution of main fiscal aggregates in each country, using the same analytical structure. Second, we analyse national tax structures to find if common patterns are still present, or if they have evolved in different ways over time. Third, we pool data to analyse and compute the cyclical sensitivity of budget balance, taxes and expenditure to the output gap. Our results show that tax structures are still similar and that economic cycle is very relevant to explain the dynamics of deficit and expenditure, but not revenues.
H62|The strong increase of Austrian government debt in the Kreisky era: Austro-Keynesianism or just stubborn forecast errors?| In the Kreisky era (1970–1983), Austrian government debts increased strongly. Historically, the attitude of Kreisky and the Social Democrats towards Keynesian fiscal policy measures to fight unemployment during the oil crises has been held to be responsible for the successive budget deficits. Kreisky’s ideological debt policy has become a narrative that has strongly influenced Austrian fiscal policy until today. While this explanation for the strong increase in public debt during the Kreisky era is widely accepted, it is not necessarily true. In this paper, we assess a different explanation: the deficits might simply have resulted from forecast errors of GDP growth in those turbulent times. We find that about one-third of the increase in the debt-over-GDP ratio is directly explained by short-run forecast errors, i.e., the difference between the approved and the realized budget, and an additional one-fifth is the lower bound of forecast error regarding the long-run growth rate.
H62|Legislative Cycles in a Semipresidential System|The political-legislation-cycle theory predicts a peak of legislative production in the pre-electoral period, when the legislator focuses on voters' welfare in order to be reelected. This paper tests the theory on the French semipresidential system, characterized by direct election of both the executive and the legislative branch. We use a data set that encompasses all the legislation passed in France from 1959 to 2012 at a monthly rate, and find a dual cycle of the production of laws, connected to both the presidential and the legislative elections.
H62|Opportunities and limits of rebalancing the Eurozone via wage policies|In this paper we discuss the relationship between the current account rebalancing in the Eu-rozone, income distribution and wage policies with a focus on the main surplus economy, Germany. We will illustrate how and to which extent German wage policies could be able to contribute to a more balanced development of the Eurozone and to overcome the export-led mercantilist German model. Our analysis and our scenarios will be based on stylized econo-metric results for Germany, as they have recently been obtained in the empirical literature estimating the German demand and growth regime based on post-Kaleckian models. We will focus in particular on the relationship between nominal wages and functional income distribu-tion, on the one hand, and between functional income distribution and domestic demand, on the other hand. We show that more expansionary wage policy can contribute to reducing the excessive German current account surplus, mainly through the domestic income-imports channel. However, wage policy alone will be overburdened with the task of rebalancing. For this, in particular more expansionary fiscal policies are required.
H62|Fiscal Activism and Price Volatility: Evidence from Advanced and Emerging Economies|Using a panel of 54 countries between 1980 and 2013, we find empirical support for the view that changes in the fiscal policy stance (year-on-year change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance) have a significant positive correlation with inflation volatility. An increase in the volatility of discretionary fiscal policies by one standard deviation raises inflation volatility between 5 and 6 percent. Moreover, results using alternatively different inflation volatility proxies confirm that an expansionary fiscal stance increases price volatility. Another relevant outcome is that in a context of economic expansions (recessions) the harmful impact of fiscal activism on price volatility is soften (heightened), while the negative impact of fiscal activism on price stability is higher when fiscal policy is expansionary. Finally, fiscal activism fuels inflation volatility much more pronouncedly in emerging market economies vis-a-vis advanced economies. Key Words : volatility, fiscal policy, inflation, GARCH, Consensus Forecasts
H62|Fiscal Sustainability Analysis: The Case of PALOP Economies|The Global Financial Crisis has typically led to a significant widening of fiscal positions (i.e., higher budget deficits and public debt). We address the sustainability of public finances in Portuguese-speaking African countries (PALOP), through adequate econometric testing. Our findings for the period 1975-2015 suggest that most of the PALOP have compromised the sustainability of their corresponding fiscal positions, leading these economies to be set on unsustainable public finance trajectories. Key Words: Debt Sustainability, Global Financial Crisis, Fiscal Policy, PALOP
H62|Fiscal Reaction Functions Across the World: A Battle of Statistical (In-) Significance|We estimate fiscal reaction functions for a panel of 173 countries using data between 1970-2014. Most notably, we assess the existence of non-Ricardian regimes, as postulated in the Fiscal Theory of the Price Level (FTPL), or, contrarily, the possibility of Ricardian regimes. By means of several, well established and state-of-the-art, panel data techniques, we find that: governments have on average increased the primary balance as a response to higher previous government indebtedness, implying a Ricardian fiscal regime, contradicting the FTPL. In addition, the Ricardian results are confirmed for the advanced countries and for the euro area group, but are less clear for the other country groups, lacking statistical significance. A more Ricardian fiscal regime emerged essentially after 1995 and notably in the sub-period 2008-2014, after the Global Financial Crisis (before that statistical insignificance is the norm) From a P-VAR analysis, we find that increases in government indebtedness increase primary balances, supporting overall the existence of an average Ricardian fiscal regime.
H62|The Sustainability of Italian Public Debt and Deficit|Abstract In this paper, we analyse the sustainability of Italian public debt using a unique database, reconstructed by Forte (2011), which covers the years 1862–2013. The study focuses on empirical tests for the sustainability and solvency of Italian public finance. The results of unit root and stationarity tests show that public debt and deficit variables are non-stationary at levels, but stationary in first-differences form, or I(1). However, some breaks in the series emerge, given internal and external crises (wars, oil shocks, regime changes, institutional reforms). Therefore, the empirical analysis is conducted for the entire period, as well as two sub-periods (1862–1913 and 1947–2013). In essence, the paper’s results reveal that Italy has sustainability problems in the Republican age (1947-2013). Our Markov-switching dynamic regression model indicates the existence of two distinct states, both for public debt and deficit, with means and standard deviations rather different. Both states are extremely persistent.
H62|A cross-country database of fiscal space|This paper presents a comprehensive cross-country database of fiscal space, broadly defined as the availability of budgetary resources for a government to service its financial obligations. The database covers up to 200 countries over the period 1990-2016, and includes 28 indicators of fiscal space grouped into four categories: debt sustainability, balance sheet vulnerability, external and private sector debt related risks as potential causes of contingent liabilities, and market access. The authors illustrate potential applications of the database by analyzing developments in fiscal space across three time frames: over the past quarter century; during financial crises; and during oil price plunges. The main results are as follows. First, fiscal space had improved in many countries before the global financial crisis. In advanced economies, following severe deteriorations during the crisis, many indicators of fiscal space have virtually returned to levels in the mid-2000s. In contrast, fiscal space has shrunk in many emerging market and developing economies since the crisis. Second, financial crises tend to coincide with deterioration in multiple indicators of fiscal space, but they are often followed by reduced reliance on short-term borrowing. Finally, fiscal space narrows in energy-exporting emerging market and developing economies during oil price plunges but later expands, often because of procyclical fiscal tightening and, in some episodes, a recovery in oil prices.
H62|Fiscal Sustainability of the German Länder: Time-Series Evidence|We analyze the sustainability of public finances in the 16 states (Länder ) of the Federal Republic of Germany, using an unprecedentedly comprehensive fiscal data set covering the period from 1950 to 2011 for West German Länder and from 1991 to 2011 for East German Länder . We extend the existing literature in that we apply unit-root and stationarity tests not only to debt but also to expenditure and revenue and explore their long-run relation in cointegration analyses for each Land . The results provide evidence against strict fiscal sustainability in a majority of German Länder . A notable exception to this finding is Bavaria.
H62|Developments in Government Interest Expenditure for Hungary, 2000–2015|In this study, we examine the changes in interest expenditure between 2000 and 2015, and in this context, focus particularly on analysing the impact of decreasing yields on the government securities market observed over the past three years. The annual change in interest expenditure can be categorised into several factors based on a methodology similar to the decomposition of government debt, and the summary discloses the details of the trends characterising the four periods which can be distinguished over the past 15 years. From among these factors, we gave precedence to the analysis of the changes in yields as this factor exerts a stronger influence on the developments in interest expenditure than any other factor. Based on a regional comparison, in addition to a supportive international environment, domestic factors have also strongly affected the favourable developments of the government securities market in recent years. From the Hungarian developments, we should highlight the fact that interest rate cuts together with the Self-financing Programme, which mitigated Hungary’s external vulnerability, has had a tangible impact on the developments in Hungarian government securities’ yields, and as such, due to the substantial contraction in interest expenditure, exerted a favourable effect on the balance of the general government. Finally, we also present the imputed interest expenditure entailed by the reorganisation of the pension system, and the study argues that these should be managed separately from actual interest expenditure.
H62|Borda Count Method for Fiscal Policy- A Political Economic Analysis -|Survey data reveals that government budgets tend to go into the red. Public Choice economists as well as public finance economists have been interested in this phenomenon. This paper presents a new explanation for this tendency from the political economic point of view; the current voting system might have a tendency to bring about a budget deficit. If policy choices only deal with the current tax rate and do not take into account the intertemporal tax rate, budget-balanced choice is difficult to be chosen. Even if voting choices take into account intertemporal aspects, we show that a budget-balanced choice is difficult to be chosen under relative majority rule. We further demonstrate that the Borda count method might overcome this issue.
H62|On the estimation of panel fiscal reaction functions: Heterogeneity or fiscal fatigue?|This paper investigates whether fiscal fatigue is a robust characteristic of the fiscal reaction function in a panel of OECD countries over the period 1970–2014 or merely an artifact of ignoring important aspects of the panel dimension of the data. More specifically, we test whether the quadratic and cubic debt-to-GDP terms remain significant once a country-specific reaction of the primary balance to lagged debt is allowed for. The results show a significant heterogeneous reaction of the primary balance to lagged debt with fiscal fatigue not being a general characteristic of the fiscal reaction function shared by all countries in our panel. In line with the literature, we further find that fiscal balances tend to deteriorate in contractions without correspondingly improving during expansions.
H62|Fiscal Stimulus and Fiscal Sustainability|The Great Recession and the Global Financial Crisis have left many developed countries with low interest rates and high levels of public debt, thus limiting the ability of policymakers to fight the next recession. Whether new fiscal stimulus programs would be jeopardized by these already heavy public debt burdens is a central question. For a sample of developed countries, we find that government spending shocks do not lead to persistent increases in debt-to-GDP ratios or costs of borrowing, especially during periods of economic weakness. Indeed, fiscal stimulus in a weak economy can improve fiscal sustainability along the metrics we study. Even in countries with high public debt, the penalty for activist discretionary fiscal policy appears to be small.
H62|The Rise, the Fall, and the Resurrection of Iceland|This paper documents how the Icelandic banking system grew from 100 percent of GDP in 1998 to 9 times GDP in 2008 when it failed. We base the analysis on data from the banks that was made public when the Icelandic parliament lifted among others bank secrecy laws to investigate the run up to the financial crisis. We document how the banks were funded, and where the money went with a comprehensive analysis of their lending. We also analyze policies implemented after the crash, including emergency legislation, capital control, alleviation of balance of payment risks and preservation of the financial stability. We estimate the output costs of the crisis, which was about average relative to the 147 banking crisis documented Laeven and Valencia (2012) and the 100 banking crisis documented by Reinhart and Rogoff (2014). Our computation of the governments direct costs, reveals that the recently concluded negotiation with foreign creditors may leave the Icelandic government in net surplus as a consequence of the crisis, although there is still some uncertainty about the ultimate cost and our benchmark estimate is a cost corresponding to 5 percent of GDP. We summarize several lessons from the episode.
H62|Political Opportunism and Countercyclical Fiscal Policy in Election-year Recessions|Political budget cycles (PBCs) have been well documented in the literature, albeit not for all circumstances. However, no work has been done on the impact of economic growth on the magnitude of PBCs. The theoretical model argues that a government has an incentive to increase fiscal manipulations when a recession is expected to hit and curtail re-election chances; this amounts to countercyclical policy for opportunistic rather than Keynesian motives. Very robust evidence for this behaviour is found in Portuguese municipalities; in election years, budget deficits go up even more and significantly so, when a recession is expected.
H62|Government borrowing cost and budget deficits: is investment spending different?| Abstract The reasons for and underlying composition of government budget deficits are often disregarded both by the academic literature about the links between fiscal policy and interest rates and by the policy debate about fiscal sustainability. However, we show that, from the perspective of financial markets, not all budget deficits are created equal: bond markets do discriminate between deficits that are the result of higher government current spending and those that stem from higher government investment, penalising the former significantly more than the latter. To do so, we apply a reduced-form regression approach to a panel of 31 OECD economies from 1960 to 2014 with data from the European Commission on the decomposition of the government budget deficit into its current spending, investment spending and revenue components. Quantitatively, based on our preferred specifications, a higher deficit solely due to higher government investment would in fact decrease long-term government bond yields. These findings suggest that austerity policies should focus more on current spending than investment spending and that fiscal rules in individual countries and monetary unions should distinguish budget deficits that are the result of investment from those that are not.
H62|Abolishing privately created money would increase GDP|In an economy where privately created money is banned, i.e. where the only form of money is state issued money, there is no obvious reason why interest rates would not settle down to some sort of genuine free market level. On the assumption normally made in economics, namely that GDP is maximised where market forces prevail unless market failure can be demonstrated, and given that there is no obvious reason to suspect market failure under the latter ban, that means that GDP is maximised where privately issued money is banned. One reason for thinking a state money only system (SMO) is more of a genuine free market than the existing system is that in free markets, producers normally bear the full costs of production and pass those costs on to customers. However, under the existing bank system, private banks can obtain money for free (administration costs apart) because those banks can effectively print money. Other corporations do not have that privilege. I.e. under SMO, banks and non-bank corporations are on an equal footing. It might seem odd to claim that SMO is closer to a free market than the alternatives, given that free markets are normally associated with scenarios where the private sector dominates, or (same thing), associated with the state playing little or no role. However the latter generalisation does not apply to money. A hint as to why is contained in the well-known phrase “money is a creature of the state”. That is, governments inevitably play an important role when it comes to a country’s currency, thus the only question is: what should that role be? While interest rates are higher and debts are lower under SMO, any deflationary effect of those higher rates is easily countered by creating and spending more base money and/or cutting taxes. If SMO in fact maximises GDP, and that system is implemented, states (or more specifically central banks’) ability to adjust interest rates is curtailed. Given that it is widely accepted that interest rate adjustments are a good way of adjusting demand, that might appear to be a weakness in the argument here. In fact there are glaring flaws in artificial interest rate adjustments. Thus the latter apparent weakness is not a weakness at all.
H62|Wealth Effects and Macroeconomic Dynamics – Evidence from Indian Economy|The wealth effects on consumption are a subject of continuing interest to economists. The conventional wisdom states that fluctuations in household wealth have caused major fluctuations in economic activity. This study analyses the macroeconomic dynamics of wealth effects in India and examines the nexus between the changes in housing wealth, financial wealth, and consumer spending. Using the quarterly data for the period 2005:1–2016:1, I estimate vector autoregression models and vector error-correction models, relating consumption to income and wealth measures. I find a statistically significant and rather large effect of housing wealth upon household consumption. The results show that (i) wealth effects are statistically significant and comparatively substantial in magnitude (ii) housing wealth effects tend to be greater while stock market wealth effects are considerable (iii) private consumption responses to the shocks to housing market wealth are relatively stronger than to the shocks in stock market wealth. There is a bidirectional causality running from private consumption to the two wealth forms and vice versa. Overall, the private consumption expenditure response to the changes in different wealth forms is observed to be substantial and significant.
H62|Public debt, corruption and tax evasion: Nash and Stackelberg equilibria|Public debt accumulation results to disutility with the problem addressed as whether time path of the public debt is sustainable. In this study the infinite time differential game modeling is used as appropriate tool for the economic analysis that follows. The dynamic game is simple and assumes that the starting point of the public debt model is the well known accounting identity interrelating public debt, interest rate and real government surplus exclusive of interest payments on public debt. In the setting, we consider as stock the public debt and the stress of the regulator is to raise nation’s primary surplus. Any surplus increase is not only dependent on government measures, but is also dependent on the known “culture of corruption” and on tax evasion. Thus the process of surpluses’ augmentation should be a function of these two factors. Nash and Stackelberg differential game approaches are used to explore strategic interactions. In the Nash equilibrium establishment of cyclical strategies during the game between the group of people involved in illegal activities of corruption and tax evasion in one hand and the government in the other, requires that the discount rate of the group of people involved in illegal actions must be greater than government’s discount rate. That is the group of corrupt officials and evaders must be more impatient than government. In the case of hierarchical setting analytical expressions of the strategies and the steady state value of public debt stock are provided. Furthermore a number of propositions are stated.
H62|Growth of Public Debt in Haryana – Dynamism or Misplaced Priorities|The paper made a comprehensive analysis of public debt and outstanding liabilities on Haryana with a view to understand whether public debt is used for accelerating growth and development or it is result of misplaced spending priorities by the incumbent governments mainly by opportunistic pre-electoral manipulations. The paper analysed trends in various dimensions of public debt in Haryana such as deficit indicators, decomposition of gross fiscal deficit, financing pattern of gross fiscal deficit, composition of outstanding liabilities, uses of borrowed funds etc. for the period 1980-81 to 2015-16 using yearly data from studies of state finances report of RBI. To understand current situation of debt sustainability and trends in debt sustainability the paper used indicator based approach and econometric estimation of fiscal response function. The paper highlighted that level of debt in relation to repaying capacity of the state is not high but the uses of borrowed funds need to be directed for the productive purposes. Besides testing our main hypothesis of debt sustainability, the paper also made a comparative analysis for the pre-FRBM and post-FRBM period and also for the election cycle years and normal years.
H62|Staatsverschuldung und Verschuldungsmentalität<BR>[Public Debt and Debt Mentality]|In search for determinants of public debt, traditional economic approaches use macroeconomic and public choice models. More recent research explains public debt by debt preferences of voters and politicians. When it comes to empirical testing, however, the latter approach often suffers from the lack of suitable proxies for debt preferences. The present paper finds a remedy by using private debt as a proxy for voters’ debt mentality. The empirical analysis employs a panel data set for the German Laender and reveals that both private debt and private over-indebtedness have a significantly positive impact on public debt.
H62|Public debt, pollution and environmental taxes: Nash and Stackelberg equilibria|Public debt accumulation and pollution result to disutility while time path must be sustainable. Policy weapons available to the government with regard to public debt is the generation of primary surpluses to sustain public debt while concerning pollution environmental taxation is expected to reduce emissions. In this paper, we address these factors in a simple dynamic game in order to find ways at which the notions of public debt, pollution, and taxation are interrelated. The starting point of the model is the identity of current account as the equation of motion of public debt, while public debt is considering as a stock and the stress of the regulator is to raise the nation’s primary surplus. Nash and Stackelberg differential game solutions are used to explore the strategic interactions. In the Nash equilibrium establishment of cyclical strategies, during the game between the polluters in one hand and the government on the other, requires that the discount rate of the polluters must be greater than government’s discount rate. That is the polluters must be more impatient than the government. In the case of hierarchical setting, the analytical expressions of the strategic variables and the steady state value of public debt stock are provided. Furthermore, we found the analytical expressions of the value functions, making, therefore, the policy implications an easy task. Finally, we found the conditions under which the conflict is more intensive, in the two cases of equilibrium, according to the shadow price of the environmental damages.
H62|延迟退休的制约因素、政策效果与动态研究方法评价<BR>[Restriction, Policy Effect and Dynamic Research Method to Delay Retirement]|本文以人口老龄化和就业环境的不确定性为背景，探讨延迟退休的预算平衡作用、就业挤出效应以及动态研究方法。研究发现，中国政府考虑延迟退休，既是为了应对养老金亏空，又是为了缓解经济非均衡发展过程中的局部用工荒。在养老金亏空问题上，延迟退休可能短期有效、长期无效，也可能短期和长期都无效。在就业影响上，一些文献认为延迟退休存在就业挤出效应，一些则认为不存在，还有部分学者甚至认为还有利于促进就业。而个体人力资本异质性以及行业职业发展差异则是影响延迟退休可行性、有效性和合理性的关键因素，个体在健康状况、教育经历、技能水平、工作经验上的分化，以及同行业就业环境的匹配性所造成的个体社会地位、工作成就感和薪酬水平的差异化演变，直接影响延迟退休的政策效果及其经济影响，应当成为延迟退休方案设计及其选择的重要关注点。所以，将个体就业和政府预算置于统一的动态一般均衡分析框架之下，构建包含个体和行业异质性的OLG模型，有利于拟合延迟退休的政策效果和经济影响。
H62|Budget deficit-money demand nexus in Nigeria: A myth or reality?|Budget deficit has an implication for monetary policy formulation and thus aggregate macroeconomic performance. An important question often asked is whether an increase in budget deficit is able to change the money market equilibrium. In order to answer this question, this paper investigates empirically the sensitivity and validity of the Keynesian and Neoclassical propositions and the Ricardian equivalence hypothesis. The study utilized cointegration analysis and ECM methodology to ascertain the short and long-run effect of budget deficit on money demand. The results of the cointegration test confirmed the existence of a strong and stable long-term relationship among the variables in the money demand model. Also, the estimates of the ECM model indicate the existence of a short- and long-term, positive and significant relationship between money demand and budget deficit suggesting that the Keynesian and Neoclassical views hold for Nigeria. Therefore the study suggests that there should be increased emphasis on productivity and efficiency of government expenditure since it impacts positively on aggregate money demand via increase in aggregate demand.
H62|Estimating a fiscal reaction function for the South East European countries|The global economic crisis caused a deterioration in the public finances of the South East European countries. Hence, the issue of fiscal sustainability became important not only for the developed EU countries (considering the European debt crisis), but also for the SEE region. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the existing literature on fiscal sustainability in the South East Europe by estimating a panel fiscal reaction function. The paper analyses how primary government balances adjust to increasing government debt and to the economic cycle. The main goal is to test whether fiscal policy in these countries tends to react to a sufficient extent to increasing public debt in order to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability. The results of the empirical analysis imply a pro-cyclical fiscal policy in the SEE countries. Regarding fiscal sustainability, the results show that initially a rise in the debt level is followed by a deterioration of the primary balance, which is not consistent with sustainability of public finances. However, in the medium run primary balance seems to adjust to rising debt.
H62|Does the design of a fiscal rule matter for welfare?|This study uses Monte Carlo methods to examine the impact on welfare of several types of commonly used fiscal rules. The simulations employ an expected intertemporal welfare function and the parameters from a three-variable structural VAR estimated using data for sixteen European countries. The VAR captures the potential interaction effects between output, government spending and revenue. We find welfare gains from many, but not all, of the fiscal rules. The best rules target a zero structural deficit and cause government spending volatility to fall by about one third. However, a simple rule, where government expenditure is set equal to a one-period ahead forecast of revenue, performs almost as well. In particular, this simple rule yields a welfare gain and a reduction in volatility similar to that of the more complicated zero structural deficit rule adopted by Switzerland and several other countries. Balanced budget rules perform less well than rules that target the structural deficit. A rule that keeps real per capita government spending equal to a constant—a type of rule adopted by some U.S. states—yields relatively low welfare and often leads to significant debt accumulation. These results highlight the importance of the appropriate design of a fiscal rule.
H62|Testing Fiscal Sustainability In The Transition Economies Of Eastern Europe: The Case Of Poland (1999-2015)|This paper reassesses the sustainability of public finances in Poland during the last two decades, characterized by the end of the macroeconomic stabilization phase and the implementation of several structural reforms. Cointegration tests allowing for regime-shifts reveal that fiscal policy is “weakly” sustainable, due to a significant divergence between revenues and expenditures in more recent years. Moreover, different from earlier research, I find strong support for bi-directional causality between revenues and expenditures. The main policy implication is that, in order to qualify for EMU membership, Poland should pursue further fiscal consolidation in the years ahead, implementing a more balanced fiscal-mix between revenue enhancement and expenditure reduction measures. La sostenibilità della politica fiscale nelle economie post-comuniste dell’Est Europa: il caso della Polonia (1999-2015) L’articolo analizza la sostenibilità delle finanze pubbliche in Polonia nel corso degli ultimi due decenni, caratterizzati dalla fine della fase di stabilizzazione macroeconomica e dalla realizzazione di numerose riforme strutturali. L’applicazione di test di cointegrazione che incorporano la possibilità di breaks strutturali evidenzia che la politica fiscale è “debolmente” sostenibile, a causa di una significativa divergenza tra entrate e spese negli anni piú recenti. Inoltre, diversamente dalla letteratura precedente, si riscontra l’esistenza di una significativa relazione di causalità bi-direzionale tra entrate e spese. La principale implicazione di politica economica è che, al fine di rispettare i criteri per l’ingresso nell’Unione Monetaria Europea, la Polonia dovrebbe proseguire il processo di consolidamento fiscale nei prossimi anni, nel contesto di una politica fiscale piú equilibrata tra misure di aumento delle entrate e provvedimenti di riduzione della spesa pubblica.
H62|Leviathan – Zum Gewaltmonopol des Staates – Wider den Protektionismus|Der neue Protektionismus speist sich nicht zuletzt aus der Kalamität, die sich aus dem Überschuss der privaten Spartätigkeit über der privaten Investitionstätigkeit selbst bei Prosperität und bei Realzinsen von Null ergibt (Sparschwemme). Ich rufe zu einem neuen Denkmodell auf, das ein richtig dosiertes staatliches Entsparen als Antwort auf diese Kalamität enthält. Nur wegen seines Gewaltmonopols (Leviathan) kann der Staat ein dauerhaftes und glaubwürdiges Entsparen veranstalten, sodass auch bei niedrigen Realzinsen das von den Bürgern geplante private Reinvermögen das volkswirtschaftlich produktive private Realvermögen weit übertreffen kann. Die Befreiung vom Zwang der Schuldenbremse und ein Übergang im Euro‐Gebiet zu einer Leistungsbilanzbremse kann eine handels‐strategische Antwort auf die weltweiten protektionistischen Tendenzen sein. Diese gewinnen ihre gefährliche Stärke aus der Tatsache, dass das staatliche Gewaltmonopol bis auf weiteres nationalstaatlich organisiert ist. Das neue Denken mag zur Rettung des Euro und des Gemeinsamen Marktes sogar notwendig sein. Zudem erlaubt es bessere Antworten auf die akuten Probleme der Dritten Welt, in der vielfach kein staatliches Gewaltmonopol durchgesetzt ist und daher Bürgerkriege große Flüchtlingsströme verursachen.

H62|Debt Stocks Meet Gross Financing Needs: A Flow Perspective into Sustainability|It is well known that no single metric can provide reliable cross-country risk assessments of debt sustainability. While approaches to understanding sustainability have traditionally relied heavily on stock metrics, a consensus is emerging that debt sustainability should be linked to both stock and flow features of underlying public debt. This paper informs this debate by analysing the ability of gross financing needs, the preferred flow metric in current debt sustainability analyses by official institutions, to provide additional information to that provided by standard stock metrics of a sovereign’s likelihood of distress. Our main contribution is to document a significant negative effect from changes in gross financing needs when debt stocks are high. These results support the intuition that countries can sustain very large debt stocks if these do not generate unmanageable flow needs. Additionally, we show that sovereign roll-over needs are a critical element driving this effect. Given the role of official lending in taming the dynamics of this component, our findings also inform the literature on the role of official lending in crises resolution.
H62|A Cross-Country Database of Fiscal Space|This paper presents a comprehensive cross-country database of fiscal space, broadly defined as the availability of budgetary resources for a government to service its financial obligations. The database covers up to 200 countries over the period 1990-2016, and includes 28 indicators of fiscal space grouped into four categories: debt sustainability, balance sheet vulnerability, external and private sector debt related risks as potential causes of contingent liabilities, and market access. We illustrate potential applications of the database by analyzing developments in fiscal space across three time frames: over the past quarter century; during financial crises; and during oil price plunges. The main results are as follows. First, fiscal space had improved in many countries before the global financial crisis. In advanced economies, following severe deteriorations during the crisis, many indicators of fiscal space have virtually returned to levels in the mid-2000s. In contrast, fiscal space has shrunk in many emerging market and developing economies since the crisis. Second, financial crises tend to coincide with deterioration in multiple indicators of fiscal space, but they are often followed by reduced reliance on short-term borrowing. Finally, fiscal space narrows in energy-exporting emerging market and developing economies during oil price plunges but later expands, often because of procyclical fiscal tightening and, in some episodes, a recovery in oil prices.
H62|From Fiscal Austerity towards Growth-Enhancing Fiscal Policy in Ukraine|The study analyses the dynamics and the structure of Ukraine’s public finances. It assesses the medium-term impact of fiscal austerity 2014-2016, examines fiscal sustainability and estimates further fiscal adjustment efforts. It evaluates the economic and social implications of current fiscal policies especially on education, health and other social indicators. It examines the benefits and costs of the medium-term budget for 2017‑2019 with an emphasis on evolving challenges and puts forward policy recommendations aimed at a successful implementation of growth-enhancing economic reforms.
H62|Fiskalna konsolidacija: teorijski okvir i slučaj Republike Hrvatske|Fiskalna konsolidacija ili fiskalna prilagodba pojmovi su kojima se u makroekonomiji označava proces usklađivanja javnih prihoda i javnih rashoda, putem smanjenja rashoda i/ili povećanja prihoda. Istraživanja koja proučavaju makroekonomske i fiskalne efekte konsolidacije u razvijenim zemljama nisu česta niti imaju dugu povijest, dok su isti efekti u Republici Hrvatskoj nedovoljno istraženi. Ovaj rad mali je korak u pravcu rasvjetljavanja te veze. U radu se statistički analiziraju makroekonomske i fiskalne varijable prije, za vrijeme i nakon razdoblja konsolidacije. Rezultati istraživanja ne idu u prilog tezi o ekspanzivnom djelovanju fiskalne konsolidacije. Stoga, deskriptivna analiza upućuje na zaključak da fiskalna konsolidacija u Republici Hrvatskoj nije ostvarila makroekonomske ciljeve kao što su ekonomski rast i smanjenje nezaposlenosti.
H62|The fallacy of the fiscal theory of the price level - one last time|"There have been attempts to resurrect the fiscal theory of the price revel (FTPL). The original FTPL rests on a fundamental compounded fallacy: confusing the intertemporal budget constraint (IBC) of the State, holding with equality and with sovereign bonds priced at their contractual values, with a misspecified equilibrium nominal bond pricing equation, and the ""double use"" of this IBC. This fallacy generates a number of internal inconsistencies and anomalies. The issue is not an empirical one. Neither does it concern the realism of the assumptions. It is about flawed internal logic. The issue is not just of academic interest. If fiscal policy authorities were to take the FTPL seriously, costly policy accidents, including sovereign default and hyperinflation, could be the outcome. Interpreting the FTPL as an equilibrium selection mechanism in models with multiple equilibria does not help. Attempts by Sims to extend the FTPL to models with nominal price rigidities fail. The attempted resurrection of the FTPL fails. It is time to bury it again - for the last time."

H62|The Political Economy of Fiscal Supervision and Budget Deficits: Evidence from Germany|In many federal countries, local governments run large deficits, even when fiscal supervision by state authorities is tight. I investigate to which extent party alignment of governments and fiscal supervisors influences budget deficits. The dataset includes 427 German local governments for the period 2000-2004. I exploit a period after a far-reaching institutional reform that entirely re-distributed political powers on both the government level and the fiscal supervisor level. Results do not show that party alignments of governments and supervisors (co-partisanship) drive short-term deficits. Instead, I find that the ideology of partisan governments and supervisors matters: left-wing local governments run higher deficits than their right-wing counterparts; left-wing supervisors tolerate higher deficits than right-wing supervisors. These findings imply that political independence for fiscal supervisors is recommended.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H62|Determinants of the Public Budget Balance: The Role of Official Capital Flows|Central banks invest their foreign exchange reserves predominantly in government securities. By means of a panel data analysis we examine the relationship between reserve currency status and public budget balance during different constellations of the international monetary system: the sterling period (1890-1935) and the dollar dominance (since World War II). We show for both periods that reserve currency status significantly lowers the public budget balance of the center countries.

H62|Budgetary stability and structural reforms in Spain|We analyse the fiscal policy lessons from the recent recession in the Spanish economy and the options for the future. Our results indicate that budget balance and public debt trends showed clear signs of unsustainability between 2009 and 2011, with few alternatives available other than reducing the fiscal deficit.
H62|Markups and fiscal policy: analytical framework and an empirical investigation|The paper focuses on the effects of fiscal policy on the industry-specific profit margin of a sector of an economy. This is a deviation from the existing literature, which focuses mainly on the effects of fiscal policy on the profit margin of the economy as a whole. In this work the price cost margin at the industry level is expressed as a function of the fiscal balance and other market variables such as industry share and price which are usually absent in a macro-analysis environment. Using a panel of ten European Union member countries for the period 1988-2005 we obtain the statistical results that support the existence of a non trivial relationship between price cost margin and fiscal policy, as it is expressed by the fiscal balance of a country. There are differences, however, between countries as well as industries reflecting different production and labor market conditions.
H62|The 2017 Long-Term Budget Outlook|CBOâ€™s projections show a substantial imbalance looming in the federal budget over the next 30 years, with spending outpacing revenues by steadily increasing amounts. As a result, if current laws generally remained unchanged, federal debt would reach an unprecedented share of GDP, intensifying pressures on the federal budget, dampening economic growth, limiting the nationâ€™s ability to respond to unforeseen events, and increasing the likelihood of a fiscal crisis.
H62|An Update to the Budget and Economic Outlook: 2017 to 2027|In CBOâ€™s baseline projections, the deficit in 2017 totals $693 billion, $134 billion more than CBO projected in January. If current law generally remained unchanged, the deficit would be on a path to rise over the next decade, with growth in revenues outpaced by growth in spending for large federal benefit programs and for interest payments on the debt.
H62|An Analysis of the Presidentâ€™s 2018 Budget|Under the Presidentâ€™s proposals, federal budget deficits would shrink relative to the size of the economy over the coming decade, ranging between 2.6 percent and 3.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) over that period. The cumulative federal deficit would be nearly one-third smaller than in CBOâ€™s baseline projections, but debt held by the public would end up slightly higher, as a percentage of GDP, than the ratio anticipated for the end of this year.
H62|The determinants of IMF fiscal conditionalities: economics or politics?|Conditionalites, measures that a borrowing country should adopt to obtain loans from the IMF, are pervasive in IMF programs. This paper estimates the effects of political and economic factors on the number of conditionalities and on the fiscal adjustment requested by the IMF. As found in the literature, political proximity of the borrowing country to the Fund’s major shareholders has an important effect on the number of conditions in an agreement. However, the fiscal adjusment requested by the IMF is strongly affected by the size of a country’s fiscal deficit but not by political proximity. We also find a very small correlation between the number of conditions and the fiscal adjustment requested by the IMF
H62|Trump and the Dollar in the Refection of History|Fears of disruption in international relationships, raised by Trump’s access to power, have been confirmed by his first half-year in office. Uncertainty has spread in international relationships. Surprisingly few in-depth studies in political economy have been made to define “Trumponomics” and to analyze the economic consequences of implementing his intentions for the US and the world. Since the question pertains to radical uncertainty, the usual quantitative methods and indicators go astray. Financial markets are not at ease with political uncertainty. In this environment, the financial community takes refuge in denying that business as usual might be derailed. However, it may be useful to raise a lively debate in political economy to figure out the rising forces of change that might trigger the unraveling of the financial globalization founded with Reaganomics in the 1980s that spread all over the world with the Washington Consensus. We will first question the consistency of Trump’s revealed intents. Do they amount to a coherent doctrine? What might be the economic consequences? What type of dilemma will he face? To deepen the analysis, we will resort to history. Can Trumponomics be compared to Reaganomics? Both have claimed to overhaul social relationships in emphasizing supply-side economics. Revisiting the consequences of Reaganomics gives clues for assessing the pitfalls that can undermine Trumponomics, since the initial economic and financial conditions are opposite to those that prevailed when Reagan took office. Finally, the third part of the paper will try to assess the consequences for the world and for Europe if Trump’s policy triggers a dual rise in US interest rates and in the dollar.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H62|La hipótesis de déficits gemelos en Colombia, 2000 – 2016|Este documento examina las relaciones causales entre el déficit fiscal y el déficit en cuenta corriente para Colombia desde 2000:Q2 hasta 2016:Q4. En concreto, se quiere corroborar la validez de la “hipótesis de déficits gemelos” en el caso colombiano. Por lo cual, se sigue un análisis descriptivo de cada uno de los balances y un ejercicio econométrico, con ayuda de un modelo estructural de vectores autorregresivos aumentado con una variable exógena (SVAR-X), para determinar la existencia o no de causalidad. Los resultados obtenidos, de acuerdo con el enfoque utilizado, indican que no existe causalidad estadística entre los balances y que el reciente deterioro simultáneo se debe al efecto del choque externo en los precios de materias primas.
H62|Unsustainable Public Debt in a European Fiscal Union?|Some EU members faced years of crisis in the first half of the 2010s with an excessive initial public debt, but several others had broad room for fiscal stimulus. However, the prolonged duration of the European economic depression expended public budgets, while exhausting stimulus policies and sovereign solvency. Meanwhile, one of the ways out of depression is a proposed centralization of the EU through fiscal union. Are the eurozone countries ready to participate in a risk pool in public finances? The study seeks to answer this question. The article presents the hypothesis that the sustainability of public finances deteriorated during the global and euro crisis in the majority of the eurozone member countries and in the EU, and this phenomenon is discouraging the core countries from seeking the fiscal union. The analysis uses the Blanchard indicators of fiscal sustainability and the sovereign risk rating of the EURO-18 and EU-28 countries. The analysis presents as results a theoretical summary of fiscal sustainability, the development of fiscal sustainability in the EU member states, indicators of convergence or divergence of fiscal sustainability in the Community, and conclusions based on the indicators of the likelihood of a fiscal union.******Algunos miembros de la UE enfrentaron años de crisis en la primera mitad de la década de 2010 con una excesiva deuda pública inicial, pero varios otros tenían amplio margen para estímulos fiscales. Sin embargo, la prolongada duración de la depresión económica europea agotó los presupuestos públicos, debilitando las políticas de estímulo y la solvencia soberana. Mientras tanto, una de las formas de salir de la depresión es una centralización propuesta de la UE mediante una unión fiscal. ¿Están los países de la eurozona dispuestos a participar en un fondo de riesgo en las finanzas públicas? El estudio busca responder a esta pregunta. El artículo presenta la hipótesis de que la sostenibilidad de las finanzas públicas se deterioró durante la crisis global y la crisis del euro en la mayoría de los países miembros de la eurozona y en la UE, lo cual desalienta a los países centrales de buscar la unión fiscal. El análisis utiliza los indicadores de sostenibilidad fiscal de Blanchard y la calificación de riesgo soberano de los países de EURO-18 y UE-28. El análisis presenta como resultados un resumen teórico de la sostenibilidad fiscal, el desarrollo de la sostenibilidad fiscal en los Estados miembros de la UE, los indicadores de convergencia o divergencia de sostenibilidad fiscal en la Comunidad y conclusiones basadas en los indicadores de la probabilidad de una unión fiscal.
H62|The Fallacy of the Fiscal Theory of the Price Level - Once More|Necessary conditions for valid dynamic general equilibrium analysis include: (1) the number of equations equals the number of unknowns; (2) the number of state variables equals the number of boundary conditions; (3) if (1) and (2) hold, the resulting solution(s) make sense. The fiscal theory of the price level fails on all three counts, both away from and at the ELB. The underlying fallacy is the confusion of the intertemporal budget constraint of the State with a misspecified government bond pricing equilibrium equation. This means overdetermined systems unless (a) the price level is flexible, (b) the interest rate is the monetary policy instrument and (c) there is a non-zero stock of nominal government bonds. Thus, a sticky price level or a nominal money stock rule imply inconsistency. When all three conditions are satisfied, unacceptable anomalies occur: negative price levels; the FTPL can price money when money does not exist; the logic of the FTPL applies equally to the intertemporal budget constraint of any household; when the bond pricing equation is specified correctly, there is no FTPL. The FTPL has nothing to do with monetary vs. fiscal dominance or active v. passive fiscal policy. The FTPL implies government debt is never a problem; the price level takes care of it, and not through unanticipated inflation or financial repression. If acted upon by fiscal authorities, the consequences could be severe. There is a correct fiscal theory of seigniorage. The issuance of return-dominated and/or irredeemable central bank money creates fiscal space and ensures that a combined monetary-fiscal stimulus always boosts nominal aggregate demand.
H62|The Good and the Bad Fiscal Theory of the Price Level|Necessary conditions for valid dynamic general equilibrium analysis include: (1) the number of equations equals the number of unknowns; (2) the number of state variables equals the number of boundary conditions; (3), if (1) and (2) hold, the model has one or more solutions and these solutions make economic sense. The fiscal theory of the price level â€“ in any of its variants - fails these conditions, both away from and at the effective lower bound. The fundamental fallacy at the root of the FTPL is not requiring the intertemporal budget constraint (IBC) of the State to hold identically but only in equilibrium, and treating the IBC of the State (holding with equality and with sovereign debt priced at its contractual value) as a (misspecified) government bond pricing equilibrium condition. Arbitrary (non-Ricardian) policies governing public spending, taxation, interest rates and monetary issuance are asserted to satisfy the intertemporal budget constraint of the State in equilibrium because either the price level (in the original FTPL) or the level of real economic activity (in the Keynesian version of the FTPL developed by Sims) will adjust to make the real contractual value of the outstanding stock of nominal public debt equal to the present discounted value of current and future primary surpluses plus seigniorage. In reality this means overdetermined or inconsistent systems unless (a) the price level is flexible, (b) the interest rate is the monetary policy instrument and (c) there is a non-zero stock of nominal government bonds. Thus, a sticky price level implies overdeterminacy or another inconsistency, and a nominal money stock rule implies overdeterminacy. When all three conditions are satisfied, unacceptable anomalies occur: the possibility of negative price levels; the FTPL can price money when money does not exist; the logic of the FTPL applies equally to the intertemporal budget constraint of an individual household; when the bond pricing equation is specified correctly, there is no FTPL. The FTPL has nothing to do with monetary vs. fiscal dominance or active v. passive fiscal policy. The FTPL implies government debt is never a problem; the price level or the level of real economic activity take care of it, and not through unanticipated inflation or financial repression. If acted upon by fiscal authorities, the consequences could be severe. There is a correct fiscal theory of seigniorage. The issuance of return-dominated and/or irredeemable central bank money creates fiscal space and ensures that a combined monetary-fiscal stimulus always boosts nominal aggregate demand.
H62|What Drives Pension Reform Measures in the OECD? Evidence based on a New Comprehensive Dataset and Theory|Using a narrative approach we construct a unique dataset of pension reform measures for a broad sample of OECD countries over the period since 1970 and explore the determinants of those reforms based on information available at the time of legislation. We distinguish three potential reform regimes: expansion of pension arrangements through increased coverage, eligibility or higher benefits; contraction aimed at enhancing financial and fiscal sustainability or stimulating work incentives; and a regime that combines expansionary and contractionary reform measures occurring in the same year. Over time the expansionary regime has become less prevalent. The incidence of the other two regimes has increased over time. None of the three regimes are affected by current or projected future demographic changes. This finding is remarkable, as we would a priori expect reform measures to be closely linked to long-run financial sustainability considerations. By contrast, business cycle indicators play a substantially larger role. A worsening of the business cycle enhances the likelihood of the contractionary and combination regimes, and reduces that of the expansionary regime during the second part of the sample period. We present a simple theoretical model with an adjustment cost of changing the pension arrangement that can account for the responsiveness to the business cycle and the non-responsiveness to demographic forecasts.
H62|Is fiscal policy in the euro area Ricardian?|According to the so-called 'fiscal theory of the price level' (FTPL), under a non-Ricardian regime the price level has to adjust to fulfil the government's budget constraint. In contrast, under a Ricardian regime, government balances adjust in order to preserve government solvency. We empirically determine whether a Ricardian or a non-Ricardian regime is more plausible for the euro area, following the research strategy of Canzoneri, Cumby, and Diba (2001). A Vector AutoRegressive (VAR) model for the primary government balance and the government debt is estimated for the period 1980q2-2013q4. Our model uses dummy interaction terms to account for the breaks due to the introduction of the Euro Convergence Criteria (ECC) and the start of the global financial crisis, respectively. No evidence is found in favour of either regime for the pre-ECC period. In the post-ECC period, a Ricardian regime is more plausible. Some evidence points in the direction of a non-Ricardian regime for the period after the start of the financial crisis.
H62|Debt sustainability analysis for euro area sovereigns: a methodological framework|The euro area sovereign debt crisis has highlighted the importance of reducing public debt levels and building up sufficient fiscal buffers during normal and good times. It has also reaffirmed the need for a thorough debt sustainability analysis (DSA) to act as a warning system for national policies. This paper introduces a comprehensive DSA framework for euro area sovereigns that could be used for analysis of fiscal risks and vulnerabilities. Specifically, this framework consists of three main building blocks: (i) a deterministic DSA, which embeds debt simulations under a benchmark and various narrative shock scenarios; (ii) a stochastic DSA, providing for a probabilistic approach to debt sustainability; and (iii) other relevant indicators capturing liquidity and solvency risks. The information embedded in the three main DSA blocks can be summarised in a heat map, which can provide guidance on the overall assessment of risks to debt sustainability. This method reflects the need to have a broad-based assessment, cross-checking information and perspectives from various sources with a view to deriving a robust debt sustainability assessment.

H62|Balance Sheet Approach for Fiscal Sustainability in Indonesia|This paper models fiscal sustainability in Indonesia using the measure of liabilities-to-asset ratio (LAR), a simple measure of a country’s balanced-sheet. It uses the approach of conditional value-at-risk (VaR), assuming normal or t distributions, to define the risky level. The conditional standard deviation in the conditional VaR is modeled using a univariate generalized autoregressive heteroscedasticity (GARCH) family model. The conditional mean equation is modeled using a simple autoregressive equation. Using quarterly data from 1990 to 2014, the paper finds that the autoregressive term significantly influences the conditional mean of LAR. It also finds that both ARCH and GARCH terms significantly influence the conditional variance. Applying the conditional variance to calculate conditional VaR with 95% confidence level, and comparing the result with the actual LAR, it finds that there are no violations occurred during the period of estimation. This means that the fiscal sustainability in Indonesia is deemed safe. The violation occurs using the confidence level of 90% only.
H62|Fiscal policy in Europe: The importance of making it predictable|This paper provides evidence in support of the hypothesis that fiscal policy is largely anticipated and its effects depend on the extent to which policy is able to affect expectations. Based on a set of 2-country Bayesian VAR models between major European economies, we find that a surprise stimulus triggers expectations of deficit reversals that may crowd out private expenditure. An anticipated stimulus, on the contrary, is found to boost domestic activity in all samples. Moreover, it has positive cross-border effects in 50 percent of the cases. Overall, our findings suggest that fiscal policy is effective when it is not “crowded out” by expectations of reversals. We document such crowding out effects in Italy and France. Finally, we argue that predictability has important consequences for the design of discretionary policy.
H62|Dealing with Long-Term Deficits|The United States faces a rising future ratio of debt to GDP that, if allowed to continue, would have serious adverse consequences for the American economy. Fortunately, policy changes can increase the size of the future GDP and shrink the future budget deficits. Relatively small reductions in future annual deficits could reverse the increasing ratio of national debt to GDP. Those annual deficit reductions could be best achieved by slowing the growth of Social Security and Medicare and by raising revenue by limiting tax expenditures or increasing the tax on gasoline.
H62|The Effect of External Debt on Real Economic Sector in Selected CESEE Countries|Previous studies indicated different results regarding the impact of external debt on economic growth in various countries. These different results may be due to the non-linear impact of external debt on real economic sector. The investigation of a non-linear and dynamic relationship can help governments make appropriate policies versus external debt. In this regard, this paper investigates the impact of external debt on real economic sector in selected countries from central, eastern and south-eastern Europe countries during the period 2000-2014. Investigation in this paper contributes to the literature by covering the non-linear and dynamic relationship to know whether external debt affects the real economic sector of selected CESEE countries. The results of the Generalized Method of Moments based on a dynamic panel data indicate that the impact of external debt on gross domestic product was negative and significant in mentioned countries. Therefore, external debt should be properly applied in which increase the investments with high rate of return. Our empirical findings send a warning about the need to keep the external debts under control.
H62|Disoccupazione strutturale in Italia e regole europee di bilancio|Lo studio muove dalla definizione di pareggio di bilancio pubblico in termini strutturali, previsto dal Fiscal Compact nell’ambito delle recenti regole fiscali europee. Tali regole subordinano l’obiettivo di bilancio di ogni Stato membro alla determinazione della componente ciclica del saldo di bilancio su cui gioca un ruolo di primaria importanza l’output gap (scostamento tra prodotto effettivo e potenziale) e, di conseguenza, le varie componenti e ipotesi che vanno a determinare il prodotto potenziale, in particolare il fattore lavoro. Lo studio analizza, quindi, il ruolo del tasso di disoccupazione che non genera spinte inflazionistiche (NAIRU, non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment) nel contesto delle valutazioni di bilancio nel caso italiano, proponendone una stima derivante dai parametri di un modello macroeconometrico e confrontandola coi valori della Commissione Europea. Si verifica che i dati forniti dalla Commissione sovrastimano il NAIRU e, quindi, sottostimano il prodotto potenziale, lasciando minor “spazio fiscale” ad eventuali politiche anticicliche oppure obbligando il paese ad eccessive correzioni procicliche di bilancio.
H62|The Arab and Post-Communist Transitions: Similarities, Differences, and Common Lessons|At the onset of the mass protests in 2010–2011, many politicians and experts suggested that Arab countries could learn from the experiences of the post-communist transition of the early 1990s. However, the geopolitical, historical, and socio-economic context of the Arab transition was different in many respects from that of the former Soviet bloc countries 20 years earlier. These differences became even more obvious five years later, in early 2016, when most Arab transition attempts ended either in a new wave of authoritarianism, or protracted bloody conflicts. Nonetheless, there are some common lessons to be learnt from the history of both transitions. They concern interrelations between the political and economic transition, the role of institutional checks and balances and the rule of law, the speed of reforms, the dangers of ethnic and sectarian conflicts, and the role of external support.
H62|Effects of Fiscal Rules on Budgetary Outcomes: The Case of the European Union Member States|The aim of this paper is to investigate the influence of fiscal rules on the budgetary outcomes in 27 European Union countries. In particular, the paper focuses on assessing whether the impact of fiscal rules is statistically significant and numerically meaningful. In order to assess the influence, we use a dynamic panel data model. In our baseline model, we introduce the fiscal rule index as an explanatory variable. Our estimation rests on the fiscal reaction function. The analysis shows that the fiscal rule index positively affects the cyclically-adjusted primary balance and the cyclically-adjusted balance.
H62|"A ""litmus test"" of Deficit Sustainability: The Case of the Greek Budget Deficit"|The paper applies three sustainability tests to the Greek budget deficit, which is known to be unsustainable, and can therefore be used to check the reliability of the three tests. Using three deficit definitions, i.e., in levels, in per capita terms, and in percent of GDP, I find the following results: (1) the unit-root test rejects sustainability only for the last definition; (2) the Hakkio-Rush test does not reject sustainability for any definition; and (3) the Hatzinikolaou-Simos test, which is applicable only for the first two definitions, strongly rejects sustainability, and so it proves to be more reliable, as expected.
H62|Beyond the austerity dispute: new priorities for fiscal policy|The workshop aimed at moving forward the fiscal policy debate, which in the crisis years was unavoidably focused on how to regain fiscal credibility and to implement sizable and fast consolidation plans. Four main themes have been proposed for the debate during the workshop. First, the two-way link between fiscal consolidation and inequality, with the idea that consolidation efforts cannot be successful in the long run if they entail a socially unsustainable increase in inequality. Second, the importance of preserving, even in contexts in which the fiscal policy stance is necessarily restrictive, growth-enhancing public investments. Third, the challenges posed to fiscal management by a low inflation context, taking into account that a subdued price dynamics not only makes the real burden of debt heavier, but it also has subtle effects, at least in the short term, on several budgetary items. Finally, the need for a simpler and more appropriate set of rules for the governance of the EMU. The latter topic was also the object of the high-level panel at the end of the workshop. While differences in emphasis emerged among the panellists, they agreed that the current framework could be streamlined, and – more importantly – that no set of rules can work if trust and a sense of sharing a common objective is not rebuilt among the Member States.
H62|Long-Term Fiscal Sustainability in Advanced Economies| With the Great Recession leaving nearly all advanced economies with substantially higher debt–gross domestic product ratios, this paper re-evaluates the long-term fiscal sustainability of these economies based on current estimates of their current-policy fiscal trajectories. Through measuring fiscal imbalance, we find that for many countries, short-term fiscal measures such as the debt–gross domestic product ratio and current budget deficits as a share of gross domestic product bear little relationship to the sustainability of policy. The longer-term challenges these countries face are related much more to the future fiscal challenge of growing primary deficits, associated with the cost of providing pensions and health care in the face of growing old-age dependency ratios. While focusing on managing the short-term debt burden may help avoid crises like the one being played out in Greece, attention and policy actions must eventually turn to the longer-term fiscal problem.
H62|Political Leaders' Socioeconomic Background and Public Budget Deficits: Evidence from OECD Countries|This paper empirically analyses the relationship between political leaders socioeconomic backgrounds and public budget deficits utilising panel data on 21 OECD countries from 1980 to 2008. Building on sociological, as well as economic, research, we argue that the socioeconomic status of political decision-makers, i.e., presidents or prime ministers, is an important determinant of fiscal budget decisions. Our theory-consistent findings show that the tenures of lower-class leaders i.e., leaders of low socioeconomic status are associated with a deficit-to-GDP ratio which is 1.6 percentage points higher than that during tenures of upperclass leaders.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H62|The Political Color of Fiscal Responsibility|We propose a dynamic general equilibrium model that yields testable implications about the fiscal policy run by governments of different political color. Successive generations of voters choose taxation, expenditure, and government debt through repeated elections. Voters are heterogeneous by age and by the intensity of their preferences for public good provision. The political equilibrium switches stochastically between left- (pro-public goods) and right-leaning (pro-private consumption) governments. A shift to the left (right) is associated with a fall (increase) in government debt, an increase (fall) in taxation, and an increase (fall) in government expenditures. However, left-leaning governments engage in more debt accumulation during recessions. These predictions are shown to be consistent with the time-series evidence for the United States in the postwar period, and also with the evidence for a panel of OECD countries.

A shift to the left (right) is associated with a fall (increase) in government debt, an increase (fall) in taxation, and an increase (fall) in government expenditures. However, left-leaning governments engage in more debt accumulation during recessions. These predictions are shown to be consistent with the time-series evidence for the United States in the postwar period, and also with the evidence for a panel of OECD countries.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H62|A Political Economy Theory of Fiscal Policy and Unemployment|This paper presents a political economy theory of fiscal policy and unemployment. The underlying economy is one in which unemployment can arise but can be mitigated by tax cuts and increases in public production. Such policies are fiscally costly, but can be financed by issuing government debt. Policy decisions are made by a legislature consisting of representatives from different political districts. With the available policies, it is possible for the government to completely eliminate unemployment in the long run. However, with political decision making, the economy always has unemployment. Unemployment is higher when the private sector experiences negative shocks. When these shocks occur, the government employs debt-financed fiscal stimulus plans which involve both tax cuts and public production increases. When the private sector is healthy, the government contracts debt until it reaches a floor level. Unemployment levels are weakly increasing in the economy's debt level, strictly so when the private sector experiences negative shocks. Conditional on the level of workers employed, the mix of public and private output is distorted.

H62|Are the twin or triple deficits hypotheses applicable to post-communist countries?|​This study empirically examines the validity of the twin and triple deficits hypotheses using bootstrap panel Granger causality analysis and an annual panel data set of six post-communist countries (Russia, Poland, Ukraine, Romania, the Czech Republic, and Hungary) from 1994 to 2012. Our findings, based on panel data analysis under cross-sectional dependence and country-specific heterogeneity, support neither the twin deficits hypothesis nor its extended version, the triple deficits hypothesis, for any of the countries considered. In other words, we find no Granger-causal relationship between budget deficits and trade (or current account) deficits or among budget deficits, private savings-investment deficits, and trade deficits.
H62|Albánska Fiškálna Politika: Dobrý Príklad Pre Perspektívu Eú (Albania’S Fiscal Governance: A Good Example In Eu Perspective)|Štúdia sa venuje preskúmaniu dynamiky rozpočtovej bilancie a verejného dlhu v Albánsku pre obdobie 2005-2014. Dynamika oboch veličín je predpovedaná a nastavená až do roku 2020. Dané albánske hodnoty týchto premenných sú taktiež popísané v porovnaní s priemernými hodnotami pre EÚ-28. Pozornosť je venovaná prepojeniu medzi rozpočtovými deficitmi a deficitmi bežného účtu. Pomery rozpočtového deficitu a verejného dlhu sú v rámci zdravého intervalo sledovaného obdobia. Štatistické prognózy naznačujú udržanie postupného nárastu oboch veličín, ale v rámci zdravých a udržateľných hraníc. Toto je dobré svedectvo o verejných financiách Albánska v tomto ranom štádiu na ceste členstva v EÚ (The paper is intended to explore the dynamics of budgetary balance and public debt in Albania for the period 2005-2014. The dynamics of both variables are forecasted up to 2020. The place of the Albanian values of those variables will also be described in comparison with the mean values for the EU-28. Attention is paid on the link between budgetary deficits and current account deficits. The ratios of budgetary deficit and public debt are within healthy intervals in the studied period. The statistical forecasts suggest maintaining a gradual increase of both variables but not exceeding the healthy bounders. This is a good testimonial for the public finance of Albania at this early stage of the road to EU membership.)
H62|Brésil : faut-il avoir peur de la dette publique ?|Brazil needs to fix its fiscal situation. The new administration has made progress with the adoption of a dark but realistic fiscal target. The federal spending cap proposal and discussion on social security reform go in the right direction but tax hikes will be probably required. The road to rebalance fiscal accounts will not be easy given the necessity to adopt unpopular measures without growth by a government that was not elected. While Brazilian assets registered an impressive performance in 2016, Michel Temer?s government has narrow window to prove it can stabilize the trajectory of public debt. We explore in this article the new fiscal policy, public debt drivers and contingent liabilities. Classification JEL: H62, H63, H68, O54.
H62|Le système de retraite par répartition argentin survivra-t-il à la réforme de 2016 ?|This paper recounts Argentina?s pay-as-you-go pension system evolutions from 1993 to the eve of 2016?s reform, which introduces a ?National historic reparation program for retirees and pensioners?. We show that even though social security system?s budget was balanced and provisioned by a buffer fund (the FGS) equal to 13% of GDP, the federal government maintained disputes with retirees whose pensions were incorrectly adjusted to inflation between 2002 and 2006. This balanced budget was also attained to the detriment of the provinces, which were deprived of some of their fiscal resources. This reform offers a compensation payment to wronged retirees and gradually gives the provinces back the aforementioned fiscal resources. Its financing relies however on the higher transfers from the Treasury and the FGS that will probably be emptied to fund this reform. Since on top of that a structural reform is meant to take place three years from now, Argentina?s pay-as-you-go pension scheme?s future is today uncertain. Classification JEL: J26, H55, H62, O54.
H62|Options for Reducing the Deficit: 2017 to 2026|CBO projects steadily increasing federal budget deficits and debt in coming years if current laws remain generally unchanged. By 2026, debt held by the public, measured as a percentage of gross domestic product, would be more than twice the average over the past five decadesâ€”and growing. To assist the Congress in addressing the budgetary challenges facing the nation, CBO periodically issues a volume of optionsâ€”115 in this yearâ€™s installmentâ€”that would decrease federal spending or increase federal revenues over the next decade.
H62|Secular Stagnation: Insights from a New Keynesian Model with Hysteresis Effects|To analyse the most important aspects of the Secular Stagnation hypothesis, this paper considers the effects of hysteresis in potential output in a New-Keynesian model that is extended with endogenous potential output. To do so, a number of simulations of relevant scenarios is undertaken. It is demonstrated that extending the New-Keynesian model with hysteresis has a number of crucial implications for macro-economic adjustment and macro-economic management. It is indicated how the model can contribute to a better understanding of a number of important elements of the Secular Stagnation hypothesis.

Ursächlich hierfür sind das Auslaufen der Transfers von Bund und EU sowie die nachteilige Bevölkerungsentwicklung im Zuge des demographischen Wandels. Basierend auf aktuellen Daten muss auch nach Ausdehnung des Betrachtungshorizonts damit gerechnet werden, dass die Bereinigten Einnahmen bis zum Projektionsende um rd. 6 % sinken werden.

En fait, il apparaît que la région est exposée à un risque de choc externe de pays développés et la Chine à un risque politique. Dans ces conditions, la politique fiscale a un rôle important à jouer pour gérer ces risques en se centrant sur ses fonctions de stabilisation et de distribution. En outre, nous proposons un système de plusieurs mesures pour chaque fonction. Enfin, nous démontrons que les pays latino-américains ne souffrent pas de contrainte du financement pour appliquer nos recommandations. ***** El propósito de este artículo es estudiar las respuestas ofrecidas por la política fiscal en América Latina en la situación actual del “aterrizaje suave”. De hecho, aparece que la región está expuesta a un riesgo de choque externo de países desarrollados y China a un riesgo político. En estas condiciones, la política fiscal tiene un papel significativo a desempeñar para manejar estos riesgos centrándose en sus funciones de estabilización y distributivas. Por otra parte, proponemos un sistema de diversas medidas para cada función. Finalmente, demostramos que los países latinoamericanos no sufren de constreñimiento del financiamiento para aplicar nuestras recomendaciones.
H62|Determinantes del tamaño del Estado. El caso colombiano|A partir de los años noventa, se ha hecho evidente el crecimiento del tamaño del estado colombiano, al pasar del 13% del Producto Interno Bruto (PIB), antes de 1990, hasta alcanzar el 31% del tamaño de la economía en 2008. Esta investigación busca contribuir al debate de los determinantes del tamaño del Estado en Colombia. Propone como hipótesis, el vínculo entre el crecimiento del tamaño del Estado con dos acontecimientos políticos de gran importancia en la vida democrática: la Constitución Política de Colombia de 1991 y la elección popular de alcaldes. Además de otro factor económico: el ingreso per cápita. Los resultados empíricos obtenidos, para el período comprendido entre 1950 y 2008, parecen confirmar dicha suposición. El fundamento de esta conjetura es el cambio de las preferencias políticas por redistribución recogidas en la Constitución Política de 1991, las cuales le asignaron funciones diferentes al Gobierno y ello se materializó en un mayor gasto.
H62|Are fiscal rules an effective instrument in consolidating public finances? Conclusions from the economic crisis|The paper aims to assess the role of fiscal rules in the process of consolidating public finances and maintaining macroeconomic stability in the EU Member States in the period of the economic crisis. The paper puts forward the thesis that fiscal rules were not an effective instrument for ensuring fiscal discipline in times of crisis. It will present the most important issues of the process of evolution of the rules during the crisis. A review and an analysis of legislation and literature on reforms implemented in the area of fiscal rules, confirms this thesis. The paper points to the need to create such fiscal rules that could contribute not only to fiscal stability but also to macroeconomic stability of the economy and concludes with recommendations for the creation of effective fiscal rules and their desirable features. The rules should be based on the structural balance or the over the cycle balance (but, in order for such rules to be effective, the structural deficit should be relatively low). Effective enforcement of the rules is necessary as well as a strong legal basis for the rules. However, one may remember that the efficiency of the rules is also determined by causes and the scope of fiscal problems in individual countries. The rules alone are not sufficient to overcome the strong systemic and structural burdens placed on economies. In such a situation, a better solution is to develop a long-term strategy for reducing deficit and debt levels, incorporating fiscal rules as one of its elements.
H62|Fiscal Councils; Rationale and Effectiveness|The paper discusses the effectiveness of independent fiscal institutions—or fiscal councils—in taming the deficit bias that emerged in the 1970s. After a review of the main theoretical arguments and recent trends about fiscal councils, we develop a stylized model showing how a fiscal council can effectively mitigate the deficit bias even though it has no direct lever on the conduct of fiscal policy. We show that the capacity of the fiscal council to improve the public’s understanding of the quality of fiscal policy contributes to better align voters and policymakers’ incentives and to tame the deficit bias affecting well-intended governments. After mapping the model’s key features into a broad set of criteria likely to contribute to the effectiveness of a fiscal council, we use the 2014 vintage of the IMF dataset on independent fiscal institutions to assess whether existing institutions have been built to work.
H62|A comparison of nominal and indexed debt under fiscal constraints|This paper makes a welfare comparison between the issuance of price-indexed and nominal public debt in the presence of fiscal constraints, viz. a debt constraint, a deficit constraint and a combination of both. Distortionary taxes or public consumption are regulated to avoid the violation of the relevant fiscal constraint(s). Under a debt constraint indexed debt is generally preferred, while under a deficit constraint the results are more mixed. Introducing inflation persistence and raising the maturity of the debt tend to increase the magnitude of the welfare differences between the two types of debt. Welfare differences are further affected by the degree to which public consumption and tax revenues are indexed to actual versus structural nominal GDP.
H62|Republicans, Democrats and Budget Deficits: Fiscal Dynamics in Political Perspective|We use an asymmetric cointegration framework to explore politically motivated fiscal asymmetries in the US, from Eisenhower to Obama. We analyze fiscal dynamics in response to deficits as an asymmetric process, sensitive to partisan and electoral motivations, characterizing the response of Republican and Democratic administrations to budget disequilibria. In a novel approach to empirical fiscal policy, we incorporate narrative data in our partisan framework, in order to to distinguish between responses to automatic and discretionary fiscal changes. We conclude that partisanship is a key factor in the fiscal response to budget disequlibria, with Democrats and Republicans exhibiting distinct corrective behavior. On the other hand, the timing of elections does not seem to be a key determinant of the fiscal response to unsustainable budget deviations.
H62|the Basic Determinants of Foreign Direct Investment Inflows in Turkey (1988-2012)|Foreign direct investment (FDI) -which is the investment of foreign assets into domestic structures, equipment, and organization- is a type of durable investment unlike foreign investment into the stock markets that leaves suddenly when the economy faces any challenge. FDI is also considered to be a significant source of economic development by increasing employment, productivity, and constituting a bridge for skill and technology transfers. Developing countries differ from each other in benefiting from and attracting FDI. Despite its potential, Turkey is not one of them that crucially succeed in inflows of FDI. The objective of this study is to figure out the determinants of foreign direct investment in Turkey. In order to undertake it, we performed an econometric model based in time series data analysis for the period of 1988-2012.
H62|Mecanismos de transmisión del riesgo de impago y coordinación de la política macroeconómica|El objetivo de este artículo es analizar la coordinación entre las políticas monetaria y fiscal en una economía emergente con un régimen monetario de metas de inflación, en un contexto en el que los choques en el riesgo de impago (default) pueden dar lugar a desequilibrios macroeconómicos. Se desarrolla un modelo macrodinámico con la finalidad de captar los mecanismos mediante los cuales se transmite el riesgo de cesación de pagos y sus efectos en la definición de funciones de reacción para las autoridades monetaria y fiscal. Los principales resultados del modelo indican la existencia de nuevos mecanismos de transmisión del riesgo de impago relacionados con la estabilidad fiscal y de los precios.

In this paper it is presented the dependence between the Romanian public debt and its budget deficit, the dependence between the Romanian public debt and its GDP, in tandem with the ARX model time variation, rending evident the residuum.
H62|Fiscal sustainability in EMU countries: A continued fiscal commitment?|The aim of this paper is to study the sustainability of public finances in the Eurozone particularly after the 2007 financial crisis. This paper goes beyond the standard analysis of the univariate properties of the fiscal variables through the estimation of a time-varying fiscal reaction function on a 11-country panel for a period spanning from 1970 to 2014. Even if panel unit root or stationary tests may provide a rough first insight on the sustainability of the public finances, they fail to highlight the adjustment mechanisms to debt overhang in recent years. The main advantage of our empirical approach is that it clearly captures the government’s dynamic response to debt accumulation, which signals its commitment to readjust public debt towards a sustainable path. Time-varying estimates of the fiscal reaction function shed new light on this respect and reveal certain heterogeneity among EMU countries on the way they manage their public finances. This paper helps ascertain whether the public resources destined to bail out troubled countries triggered effective fiscal responses.
