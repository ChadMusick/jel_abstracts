H77|A Theory of Economic Unions|After decades of successful growth, economic unions have recently become the focus of heightened political controversy. We argue that this is partly due to the growth of trade between countries that are increasingly dissimilar. We develop a theoretical framework to study the effects on trade, income distribution and welfare of economic unions that differ in size ad scope. Our model shows that political support for international unions can grow with their breadth and depth as long as member countries are sufficiently similar. However, differences in economic size and factor endowments can trigger disagreement over the value of unions between and within countries. The model is consistent with same salient features of the process of European integration and statistical evidence from survey data.
H77|Sharing Government|This paper develops a simple theoretical framework to study a set of regions, each with its own regional government, who share a union or central government. These governments must decide whether to implement or discard a large number of projects that produce local benefits for the region that implements them, and externalities for the rest of the regions. Conflict or disagreement arises since different regions value projects differently. The classic assignment problem consists of deciding who decides these projects, either the union or the regional governments. It is well known that regional governments are insensitive to externalities. The key observation here is that the union government is insensitive to local benefits. Thus, each government maximizes only a piece of the value of projects, and disregards the other one. This observations leads to simple and clear rules for solving the assignment problem.
H77|Decentralization with porous borders: Public production in a federation with tax competition and spillovers|We analyze the strategic interaction of regional and federal governments using a model that includes fiscal externalities in the form of inter-regional capital tax competition and technical externalities in the form of inter-regional spillovers. The federal government aims to correct for these inefficiencies using a transfer system. If the regional governments are policy leaders (such that federal policy is set conditional on regional choices), they will internalize both fiscal and technical externalities but free-ride on the transfer system. Efficiency can be achieved by introducing a second transfer scheme that is independent of regional public production. If the federal government sets its policy first and can commit itself to it, the outcome is efficient only if matching grants are used that are financed outside of the transfer system.
H77|Asymmetric Yardstick Competition: Traditional Procurement versus Public-Private Partnerships|We investigate yardstick competition between local jurisdictions in which pure rent-seeking incumbents undertake an identical infrastructure project choosing be- tween two contractual arrangements with different financing profiles, namely traditional procurement (TP) and public-private partnership (PPP). We show that a mixed regime, in which TP is used in one jurisdiction and PPP in the other, is likely to arise when projects are mildly lucrative, and/or jurisdictions have a moderate fiscal capacity. We find that, in the mixed equilibrium, incumbents provide different levels of public services, face different probabilities of re-election, and obtain different rents. The adoption of different forms of project governance permits incumbents to disguise themselves and undermine voters' ability to assess their performances. Therefore, yardstick competition is hindered, even if jurisdictions display identical revenue capacities.
H77|Tax Decentralization Notwithstanding Regional Disparities|In assessing the desirability for tax decentralization reforms, a dilemma between efficiency and redistribution emerges. By limiting the ability of the central government to redistribute resources towards regions in financial needs, decentralization curbs incentives for excessive subnational spending and enhances fiscal discipline, but may also widen interregional disparities by triggering tax competition for mobile tax bases. We provide a formal treatment of this trade-off, and shed light on the optimal degree of fiscal decentralization. We find that tax decentralization can be optimal even under Rawlsian social preferences which only weight the welfare of the poorest region in the federation.
H77|How Do Subnational Governments React to Shocks to Revenue Sources? Evidence from Argentina|Using the exogenous variability in intergovernmental transfers and hydrocarbon royalties, based on the fiscal regime that prevailed in Argentina from 1988 to 2003, we jointly estimate the effects that changes in these public revenues had on provincial public consumption and debt. When receiving a one-peso increase in intergovernmental transfers, provinces spent 32 centavos of each peso on public consumption and 43 on debt repayment. But when hydrocarbon-producing provinces received a one-peso increase in royalties, they used 75 centavos for debt repayment. These dissimilar reactions to revenue increases are robust to different specifications of the basic regressions. Finally, we provide two alternative explanations for them: the higher volatility of hydrocarbon royalties (relative to intergovernmental transfers) and the exhaustible nature of these revenues.
H77|China and the World Bank - How Contrasting Development Approaches Affect the Stability of African States|China’s development model challenges the approaches of traditional Western donors like the World Bank. We argue that both aim at stability, but differ in the norms propagated to achieve that. Using fixed effects and IV estimations, we analyze a broad range of subnational stability measures in Africa. Aid by both the WB and China does not increase outright conflict nor any type of citizen protest, on average. Both even reduce outright conflict by governments against civilians. Still, Chinese aid is associated with more government repression and an increased acceptance of authoritarian norms, while WB projects strengthen democratic values.
H77|Revisiting the Economic Case for Fiscal Union in the Euro Area|Abstract After significant progress as an immediate result of the euro crisis, the drive to complete Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) has decelerated. While there is a broad consensus in Europe that EMU needs further development, the exact nature and timing of the reform agenda remains controversial. This paper makes an analytical contribution to the ongoing discussion about the euro area’s institutional setup. An in-depth look at the remaining gaps in the euro’s architecture, and the trade-offs that repairing them would present, suggests the need for long-run progress along three mutually supportive tracks. The first is more fiscal risk sharing, which will help enhance the credibility of the sovereign “no-bailout” rule. The second is complementary financial sector reforms to delink sovereigns and banks. And the third is more effective rules to discourage moral hazard. Helpfully, this evolution would ensure that financial markets provide more incentives for fiscal discipline than they do now. Introducing more fiscal union comes with myriad legal, technical, operational, and political problems, however, raising questions well beyond the domain of economics. These difficulties notwithstanding, without decisive progress to foster fiscal risk sharing, EMU will continue to face existential risks.

H77|The Political Economy of Gender Budgeting: Empirical Evidence from India|Gender budgeting is a public policy innovation to transform the gender commit-ments into budgetary commitments. The political economy process of gender budget-ing in India has encompassed four distinct phases - innovative knowledge networking, building institutional structures, reinforcing state capacity and strengthening the ac-countability mechanisms. Against these policy processes, we have estimated the sec-tor-wise quantum of gender budgeting in India emphasising the statistical invisibility of care economy. The State-wise equally distributed equavalent (Xede) estimates of gen-der development showed that Kerala tops the scale 0-1 scoring 0.72. Though the link between gender budgeting and these Xede scores is beyond the scope of the paper, the fiscal marksmanship of gender budgeting showed a mixed scenario across sectors. The fiscal marksmanship of gender budgeting showed an upward bias in the errors in the projections relate to education, social justice empowerment and health, and down-ward bias in agriculture, petroleum and natural gas. These deviations between BE and RE in gender budgeting has significant policy implications for better state capacity and governance.
H77|Heterogeneous Capital Tax Competition in a Federation with Tax Evasion|In a federal country with two regions, consumers can decide not only the region where to invest, but also the type of capital investment. We analyse how such decision is affected by two sources of asymmetry: a first type of capital is taxed at a regional level while a second one is taxed at a federal level, and for the latter a different degree of tax evasion may arise across regions. We show how tax evasion arising at a federal level affects not only the federal tax policy but also the regional tax policies both directly and indirectly because of vertical tax competition. In particular, we show under which conditions a decrease in the level of tax compliance on the second type of capital can lead to a reduction in its federal tax rate, and simultaneously to an increase in the regional tax rate on the other type of capital investment.
H77|Russia’s Fiscal Policy in 2018|In 2018, fiscal revenues of the enlarged government (hereinafter BEG) according to the preliminary data released by the Federal Treasury2 exceeded the volumes seen in the previous year by 1.9 percentage points of GDP, or by RUB 5,870 billion in absolute terms (Table 7). At the same time, 75 percent of the income increment of BEG was secured by the federal budget including oil revenues to RUB 3,046 billion, or by 2.2 percentage points of GDP. Non-oil and gas receipts to the consolidated budget of the Russian Federation in 2018 compared to 2017 rose by RUB 2,824 billion in absolute terms but dropped in shares of GDP by 0.3 percentage points. Expenditures of Russia’s budgetary system contracted in 2018 compared to January-December 2017 by 2.6 percentage points of GDP growing in absolute terms by RUB 1,485 billion. In 2018, fiscal revenues of the budgetary system of Russia hit maximum for the five- year period which was mainly due to the favorable price environment on the natural resources. Budget expenditures of the enlarged government in shares of GDP in 2018 on the contrary reached minimum for the five-year period, which was possible due to budgetary rule in force, which significantly limited spending of the federal budget.
H77|North Caucasus in 2018: factors of changes|This article deals with a brief evaluation of developments in the regions of North Caucasus in 2018 as they can be regarded as indicators of significant changes in that part of the country. Such developments include personnel changes in the government of Dagestan where for the first time in the post-Soviet period key positions in the region were taken by officials who never worked in that republic, as well as large-scale public activities in Ingushetia over the issue of the region’s borders.
H77|2019/01 Merging city and suburban governments: A public choice perspective on the Norwegian local government reform|The administrative boundaries of the central city almost universally cover a smaller area than its functional boundaries. As mobility patterns go mainly into the central city, local governments in central cities supply public goods beyond their own residents. They should want to extend their boundaries in order to internalize more of these externalities, while suburban municipalities should oppose this. This implication is clear from a theoretical perspective, but can rarely be tested given that local government reform is infrequent and typically top-down. However, the 2014-2017 Norwegian municipal reform offers a rare opportunity for empirical evidence to test this proposition. The paper examines the merger decisions made by municipalities in all city regions in Norway. The analysis provides support for the proposition that central cities want to internalize more of the externalities from their public goods production, while suburban municipalities oppose this: First, central cities tend to have higher property tax rates and to provide more public goods compared to suburban municipalities. Second, central cities were much more interested in merging than suburban municipalities: while the central cities wanted to merge with a total of 75 suburban municipalities, only 15 of the latter were positive to merging with the central city.
H77|The Political Economy of Gender Budgeting: Empirical Evidence from India|Gender budgeting is a public policy innovation to transform the gender commitments into budgetary commitments. The political economy process of gender budgeting in India has encompassed four distinct phases - innovative knowledge networking, building institutional structures, reinforcing state capacity and strengthening the accountability mechanisms.

Though the link between gender budgeting and these Xede scores is beyond the scope of the paper, the fiscal marksmanship of gender budgeting showed a mixed scenario across sectors.
H77|Indian Fiscal Federalism at the Crossroads: Some reflections|There is a growing recognition that something “fundamental” is happening in Indian fiscal federalism ex-post to the institutional changes like the abolition of the Planning Commission; creation of the NITI Aayog; the Constitutional amendment to introduce GST and the establishment of GST Council; and the historic high tax devolution to the States based on the recommendations of the Fourteenth Finance Commission. Recently the policy makers and experts have raised a few issues, which are (i) to make Finance Commissions permanent or to abolish the Finance Commissions by making the tax devolution share constant through Constitutional Amendment, (ii) the need for an institution to redress spatial inequalities, to fill in the vacuum created by abolishing the Planning Commission, and (iii) arguing the case for Article 282 of the Constitution to be circumscribed. The debates are also focused on whether there is a need establish a link between GST Council and Finance Commissions and should India devise a mechanism of transfer which is predominantly based on sharing of grants for equalization of services rather than tax sharing. What could be a plausible framework for debt-deficit dynamics keeping intact the fiscal autonomy of States and to ensure “output gap” reduction and public investment at the subnational level, without creating bad equilibrium was also another matter of concern. These debates attain significance, especially when for the first time ever a group of States came together to question the Terms of Reference (TOR) of the 15th Finance Commission and there is a growing tension in the Centre-State relations in India.
H77|Living under Fiscal Rules: Fiscal Management Response and Resource Allocation Choices for State of Odisha|The paper assesses the remarkable success story of State of Odisha in making fiscal correction after adopting the fiscal rules and the policy responses. The degree of correction was one of the highest among the Indian States. The tradeoff between fiscal restraint and the development priorities assumes significance as a relatively economically weak State like Odisha maintained a very low-deficit regime by limiting the public spending for a long time. The paper highlights that while fiscal discipline improves the ability of the Government to prioritize among policy choices and improve operational management, strict imposition of self-restraint and large adjustments may lead to distortions. After a decade of controlled fiscal management, as the State has started opening up by expanding the public spending, the shrinking fiscal space, slow growth of internal revenue, and high dependence on Central funds present new challenges. The paper examines the institutional reforms in this context to address emerging fiscal architecture.
H77|State of Public Finance and Fiscal Management in India during 2001-16|During 2001-16, State Finances in India have undergone significant changes in both revenue mobilization and controlling expenditures which helped states to contain deficits (revenue as well as fiscal). Introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) helped states to augment revenue mobilization whereas adoption of Fiscal Responsibility Budget Management (FRBM) Act helped states in prudential fiscal management. During the period, the improvement in union finances was not as good as state finances. There were two significant shocks to Indian public finances during 2001-16 - firstly, introduction of pay revision for the union as well as majority state government employees, in response to recommendations of the Sixth Central Pay Commission and secondly, global financial crisis (2008-09). States experienced revenue shocks mostly through fall in states' share in central taxes and a mild fall in own tax revenue mobilization during 2008-10. Higher pressure on revenue expenditure due to implementation of the pay commission recommendations (including revision of pensions and payment of arrears) and falling share in central taxes resulted in rise in revenue deficits for states during 2008-10. As a strategy to combat fiscal shocks, different states adopted different measures and some of the measures have inter-temporal implications. The objective of the present paper is to assess the impact of the shocks in Indian public finances and identify challenges for the times to come. Though increasing revenue (`front loading') and reducing expenditure (`back loading') are common responses to any fiscal shock, understanding inter-temporal implications of those responses with specific to changing structure of inter-governmental fiscal transfers could be an interesting exercise.
H77|The spending power of sub-national decision makers across five policy sectors|The paper develops new measures of spending power and performance across five key sectors of sub-national government service delivery –- education, long-term care, transport services, social housing and health care. The new indicators reveal unique insights about how responsibilities are assigned across levels of government, which enable the analysis of different arrangements on outcomes. Differences in characteristics across sectors and types of countries may have important consequences for intergovernmental fiscal relations.
H77|Realising regional potentials through better market integration in China|China’s regions have been experiencing impressive growth over the past decades, but their potentials could be better exploited by creating a single product and labour market. Local protectionism increases transaction costs and hinders competition, thereby taking a toll on productivity. Administrative monopolies have long thrived and are hard to dismantle. Restrictions on the hukou and the fragmented pension system limit labour mobility. Local regulations aim at, among other things, securing the collection of local taxes, without which cities could not afford to offer the same public services to migrants as to urbanites. Hence, dismantling local regulations and creating a single product and labour market needs to go hand-in-hand with the reform of inter-governmental finances. Recent measures on both the product and labour market front appear to aim at making up for the slow progress over the past decade or so. There are signs that these efforts are helping China’s regions at various levels to converge toward each other. Disparities are shrinking faster across provinces, compared to within provinces. Integration of product and labour markets will boost productivity over the medium-to long term by reducing transaction costs, but could potentially widen regional disparities, which are already relatively high. This will necessitate enhanced transfers and re-centralisation of the financing of spending in some key categories such as education and health. Policies to help catching up of laggard regions by better connectivity through infrastructure investment are bearing fruit, but such investments should be subject to rigorous cost-benefit criteria to enhance capital allocation efficiency and should take into account externalities. Notwithstanding significant disparities along multiple dimensions across provinces, inequalities, be it in terms of income, wealth or education, are actually most striking along the rural-urban dimension. The rural revitalisation strategy, a novel element of the 19th Party Congress outcomes, is expected to address this issue. The other recent strategy of nurturing the formation of city groups will also likely benefit rural areas in-between those cities.This Working Paper relates to the 2019 OECD Economic Survey of China (http://www.oecd.org/economy/china-economic-snapshot/).
H77|Municipal Merger and Debt Issuance in South African Municipality|Employing South African data and Difference-In-Difference (DID) method, this paper investigates whether the free-ride behaviour was taken by municipalities which faced their mergers before the municipal demarcation changes are executed. With several developed countries' data, many research show that there are opportunistic free-ride behaviours of municipalities such as over-issuance of debt before their mergers since the burden of them will be shared by newly constructed municipalities. In spite of these fruits of research, few solution is suggested in the literature. Considering this, we focus on the South African municipal mergers, where the upper government of municipalities implemented the policy for pre-merged municipalities to suspend new contracts involving the borrowing contract before the mergers. As a result of DID analysis, we show that South African municipalities did decrease the amount of borrowings before their mergers. This result is an opposite result considering the previous empirical researches and means that the proper policy for municipal mergers can prevent the fiscal common pool problem caused by free-ride behavior. In addition, this paper shed the light to utilize the data of developing countries and is the first paper to show there were reductions of borrowings before municipal mergers.
H77|Delegation of Taxation Authority and Multipolicy Commitment in a Decentralized Leadership Model|This paper examines to what extent taxation authority should be delegated to local or lower-level government. Delegation of taxation authority can be regarded as a commitment to the local tax rate ex ante in a decentralized leadership model, in which local governments set policies ex ante and the central government decides transfer policies ex post. Previous papers point out that the ex post interregional transfers of the central government distort the ex ante regional policies of local governments. However, Silva (2014, 2015) clarify the case where efficient expenditure by local governments is achieved. This paper examines the delegation of taxation authority by extending Silva's model to include commitment to taxation and generally derives the conditions when efficient public expenditure by local governments can be achieved in relation to the delegation of taxation authority. The model adopted in this paper allows various levels of spillovers of local public goods and various types of multipolicy commitments of taxation and/or expenditure.
H77|Partial decentralisation and inter-governmental electoral competition in local public good provision|Over the last few years, the literature on partial decentralisation has largely grown, pointing out that one of its effects is a reduction in accountability because voters are imperfectly informed about each government contribution. However, the possibility for politicians to directly manipulate this asymmetry in information has not been addressed yet. This paper provides a simple model in which two levels of government are involved in the provision of a local public good with the local government that can decide to spend its budget either on the provision of the public good or in spending that influences the information of the voters in its favour. A central result is that the conflict of interest that arises among the levels of government reduces the spending in the public good at both levels, while it generates a wasteful spending to pander to voters.
H77|Municipal infrastructure spending capacity in South Africa: a panel smooth transition regression (PSTR) approach|This paper assesses the factors that contribute to underspending of the capital budget at the local government level by making use of a nonlinear model based on the panel smooth transition regression (PSTR) model. South Africa is used as a case study. Capital transfer is identified as an important threshold variable in that the degree to which municipalities spend their capital budget depends on a threshold determined by capital transfer. The results of the empirical analysis show that large amounts of capital transfers to local government contribute to underspending by municipalities in South Africa. Moreover, the results indicate that capital budget spending could be improved by ensuring that the trade-off between the current budget and capital budget is reduced, increasing the fiscal capacity of municipalities, which gives them financial autonomy to raise their own revenues.
H77|Patronage Appointments between Politics and Public Governance: a Review|The present work reviews how scholars of different disciplines have examined political appointments in recent years, in particular, those regarding public and semi-public organizations. First of all, I show how political economy research has shed light on several reform processes, arguing how economic and managerial policies have been implemented also considering political rationales, such as, for instance,the preservation of parties' control of privatized firms. This enduring power of political parties primarily results from their preserved appointment authority over semi-public firms (beyond public agencies), one of the tools by which the political class continues to govern the enterprises in question. In particular, this appointment authority has been exploited by parties in order to reward their members and control bureaucracies, among other purposes. The phenomenon naturally resulted in a widespread surviving politicization of the state, which presents several consequences, especially in terms of public- private politically connected firms' performance. In the conclusions, I suggest some further research trajectories which could enhance the literature.
H77|The Deepening of the Economic and Monetary Union|This article seeks to guide the reader through the developments in the process of EMU deepening, clarifying the economic arguments and identifying the choices made by the decision makers, which led to the current institutional design. In addition, a critical analysis of the different proposals under discussion is made, aiming at identifying the most efficient way, in a long-term perspective, to ensure the proper functioning of the monetary union.
H77|Improving Subnational Government Development Finance in Emerging and Developing Economies: Toward a Strategic Approach|Considerable attention has been given to enhancing subnational development finance in response to the 2008 global financial crisis and recent global development agendas, including the Sustainable Development Goals, Financing for Development, and Habitat III/New Urban Agenda. Much work on this topic is fragmented, focusing on specific elements of development finance: fiscal transfers, capital market access, public-sector lending agencies, or public–private partnerships. Most countries, however, have a range of subnational governments with varying needs and capacities that require different and evolving mixes of development finance mechanisms. Enabling greater subnational borrowing is often desirable but requires adoption of other reform policies to improve the fiscal capacity and creditworthiness of subnational governments over time. We review the rationale and potential for improving subnational development finance, outline the overall landscape of institutional arrangements available for this purpose, and consider broad challenges involved. Based on a review of global practice and experience in selected Asian developing countries with a range of special entities and innovations to enhance subnational investment, we propose a more integrated, strategic approach to building subnational development finance.
H77|Different approaches and measures of fiscal decentralisation|Once the phenomenon of fiscal decentralisation was appropriately operationalised and measured, it has become evident that not many countries had absolutely self-financing sub-national governments. The evidence shows that, in many developed countries, fiscal decentralisation has occurred almost exclusively through devolution of expenditure activities, while a large part of the regional and local government expenditures is funded primarily by intergovernmental grants, revenue-sharing programs, or other centrally controlled funds. Measurement-wise, this suggests that taxes should be refined in terms of the degree of autonomy they provide to sub-national governments. In the relevant empirical studies, it is a common practice to use accounting measures of either revenue or spending shares for sub-national relative to general government as a proxy for fiscal decentralisation. However, those two accounting measures may not capture accurately the phenomenon of fiscal decentralisation. The two standard sources of data for fiscal decentralisation have been the IMF?s Government Finance Statistics (GFS) where the intergovernmental fiscal structure of countries is not captured properly and OECD?s measure of revenue decentralisation where taxes are classified in terms of the degree of autonomy they provide to sub-national governments. As an improved measure of revenue decentralisation, Stegarescu (2005) constructs an appropriate measure of fiscal decentralisation; namely, ?purified? sub-national own-source revenues as a share of total government revenues. The main aim of this paper is to compare in details the above mentioned measures of fiscal decentralisation, and evaluate the bias in the accounting measures compared to a ?purified? measure that accounts for the real fiscal autonomy of sub-national governments by comparing the results gained through estimation of the government sector size model using the pooled mean group (PMG) estimation approach.
H77|Role of the Distribution Structure in Responsible Trade|Aware of the high importance of consumers' private information concerning their willingness-to-buy fair trade goods and taking into account the superior price they are willing to pay for this kind of goods with respect to conventional ones, we choose to feed the debate relative to the appropriateness of the different potential retailing channels. We use a common agency game framework to analyze the changes in the price level according various forms or distribution organization : direct competition between upstream producers or manufacturers (or cooperatives of producers / manufacturers), creation of a cooperative at the downstream stage, delivery of the final good to classical retailing networks. It appears that the private information parameter as well as the nature of the relationship between suppliers on the one hand and the retailer on the other hand are the key variables that determine the price paid by consumers. The conventional retailing channel brings excessively high prices with respect to a distribution made by an entity likely to be assimilated to a cooperative because of a double margin effect that is lessened in the cooperative case since the latter objective function involves additional elements such as providing services to upstream actors.
H77|Relevance of Potential Supply Structures in Frameworks involving Consumer's private Information: the Case of Fair Trade|Fair trade actors have to deal with a signicant degree of information asymmetry as regard their willingness-to-buy such goods and their willingness-to-pay for them. Many debates and controversies have paved the way for the development of fair trade, in particular concerning the distribution channel that had to be preferred. We use a common agency game framework to analyze the changes in the price level according various schemes of upstream-downstream organization and relationships. Both the private information parameter and the nature of the relationship between suppliers are the key variables that determine the price paid by consumers. If the choice of a dedicated structure does not appear relevant when costs or the number of competing producers are high, the framework of a sequential contracting process always results sub-optimal. What really matters is the nature of the firms involved and the convergence of interests. An equilibrium close to the socially optimal issue may emerge.
H77|The Assignment of a CSR Level of Action: Rule vs Discretion|Socially responsible behaviors represent a growing concern for consumers, employees, investors. Beyond their economic impact, companies are made accountable and responsible for the social, the environmental incidence of their activities. Their governance, their processes, the security of their products and the working conditions they offer are more and more carefully examined (as, for instance, the increasing importance of the duty of vigilance for multinational enterprises). Public policies, especially through regulation, seek to avoid - or at least limit some of the negative impacts that can be related to firms' activity and choices. Yet, many drawbacks may prevent regulation from succeeding : lack of information or of expertise, capture by interest groups... In some cases, companies can even turn more efficient in making the decisions that better suit stakeholders' expectations, essentially as they may have better information about their preferences, which is an essential piece. As a by-product it is worth examining whether some decisions must be taken by regulators or should rather be delegated to firms. Through a mechanism without transfer approach in a setting involving information asymmetries, we study under which conditions the decision is best assigned to the regulator. We show that for relatively low values of the private parameter, a binding rule will be preferred, and it is even stronger when asymmetry of information is introduced w.r.t. the knowledge the firm will get from the representative stakeholder. The divergence between the decision-maker and the firm strengthens and less communication takes place, which corresponds to a lower degree of delegation granted to companies. Thus, the optimal scheme is made of a combination of a rigid policy and a more flexible one over signicant values of the private parameter.
H77|Riflessioni sullâ€™autonomia finanziaria dei comuni italiani|Italian local governmentsâ€™ fiscal authonomy since the early 1990s heavily relied on the local tax on immovable property (ICI â€“ imposta comunale sugli immobili). Local governmentsâ€™ fiscal authonomy in the last 25 years however has not developed linearily, but has suffered from various pressures and reforms often prompted by other and different concerns and priorities. Hence local governmentsâ€™ fiscal authonomy has been affected by three main processes. First the wider development of the process of fiscal decentralisation in Italy, second political concerns for the reduction of fiscal pressure, and finally the wider economic developments, in particular the economic and financial crisis of 2008 and the related problems of public budget balance and growht of the Italian public debt. The purpose of this paper is to anayse the pillars of local governmentsâ€™ fiscal authonomy, starting with local governmentsâ€™ tax on immovable property, and then analysing other sources of financing such as special contributions, ear-marked taxes and urban development charges (oneri di urbanizzazione) with reference also to the tool of partecipatory budgeting.
H77|Effetti finanziari delle richieste di autonomia regionale: prime simulazioni|Il 15 febbraio 2019 sono state rese disponibili le bozze di intesa tra il Governo e le Regioni Emilia-Romagna, Veneto e Lombardia, in seguito alla pressante richiesta di maggiore autonomia da parte di queste tre regioni. Basandoci su questi testi e sulla spesa statale regionalizzata, ricostruiamo i flussi di risorse necessari a soddisfare le richieste di decentramento delle funzioni. Eâ€™ possibile individuare uno schema di compartecipazioni che finanzino le spese devolute. Nellâ€™ipotesi in cui non siano approvati i fabbisogni standard entro tre anni dallâ€™emanazione dei decreti che avviano le autonomie regionali simuliamo, come previsto nelle intese, lâ€™adozione della spesa media nazionale pro capite per tutte le regioni. CiÃ² implica un trasferimento di risorse da alcune regioni con spesa pro-capite superiore alla spesa media nazionale ad altre regioni con spesa pro-capite inferiore alla spesa media nazionale. Esaminiamo anche il caso in cui lâ€™istruzione non venga riconosciuta tra le materie devolute. In entrambi i casi le regioni che chiedono autonomia riceverebbero risorse aggiuntive. Nel caso in cui tutte le funzioni di spesa siano considerate ad Emilia Romagna, Veneto Lombardia spetterebbero 2,7 miliardi in piÃ¹ rispetto alla spesa storica, il 17% in piÃ¹. Nel caso in cui lâ€™istruzione venga esclusa dalla funzioni di spesa devolute vi sarebbe un incremento di risorse di 1,3 miliardi, 21% in piÃ¹. Infine ipotizzando una crescita dei gettiti asimmetrica tra Nord e Sud Italia, che riprende la previsione di crescita dei consumi per il 2019 di Prometeia, otteniamo un incremento di gettito nelle tre regioni che chiedono lâ€™autonomia pari al 45% dellâ€™incremento di gettito totale.
H77|Subnational government finances and capabilities for regional economic development in Uruguay: 1990-2016|The purpose of this work is to reflect on the relationship between subnational finance and the capabilities for regional economic development in Uruguay. It presents rigorous evidence of recent work on the relationships between fiscal decentralization, intergovernmental transfers and regional disparities in Uruguay. This is analyzed together with new available information on the evolution of subnational finances and a critical analysis of the productive policies developed in the country. It seeks to contribute to the current debate on the relationships between territorial development, decentralization and the role of public policy to reduce regional disparities. In this regard, it is concluded that these challenges require a better financing scheme for local development, with greater management capacity for decision-making at the local level. For this, as a prerequisite, it is urgent to improve the technical and management capacities of subnational governments.
H77|Sharing a government|This paper develops a simple theoretical framework to study a set of regions, each with its own regional government, who share a union or central government. These governments must decide whether to implement or discard a large number of projects that produce local beneÖts for the region that implements them, and externalities for the rest of the regions. Conáict or disagreement arises since di§erent regions value projects di§erently. The classic assignment problem consists of deciding who decides these projects, either the union or the regional governments. It is well known that regional governments are insensitive to externalities. The key observation here is that the union government is insensitive to local benefits. Thus, each government maximizes only a piece of the value of projects, and disregards the other one. This observations leads to simple and clear rules for solving the assignment problem.
H77|A theory of economic unions|After decades of successful growth, economic unions have recently become the focus of heightened political controversy. We argue that this is partly due to the growth of trade between countries that are increasingly dissimilar. We develop a theoretical framework to study the e§ects on trade, income distribution and welfare of economic unions that di§er in size ad scope. Our model shows that political support for international unions can grow with their breadth and depth as long as member countries are su¢ ciently similar. However, di§erences in economic size and factor endowments can trigger disagreement over the value of unions between and within countries. The model is consistent with same salient features of the process of European integration and statistical evidence from survey data.
H77|Laboratory Federalism with Public Funds Sharing|The theory of laboratory federalism hypothesizes that, in a decentralized multi-jurisdictional system, policies follow an evolutionary learning process with innova-tion and imitation. This paper studies the role of public funds sharing in such a setting. As a guiding framework we consider a model of decentralized, rich-to-poor redistribution with labor mobility. Uncorrected learning dynamics here lead to a drastic erosion of the welfare state. Suitably designed public funds sharing can correct this failure and may even restore e?ciency. Surprisingly, the necessary properties of the sharing scheme for e?ciency in the learning model are the same as those that make decentralized Nash play e?cient (and vice versa).Public funds sharing, thus, is a powerful corrective device in ?scally decentralizedsettings for a variety of behavioral modes of government interaction.
H77|Winning a district election in a clientelistic society: Evidence from decentralized Indonesia|Lower-level officials often engage in clientelistic relations with the upper-level government. The nature of these relations might be determined by institutional factors such as how the lower-level officials come into their position. This paper specifically highlights the different political incentives that elected versus appointed lower-level officials have for becoming political intermediaries for the upper-level government, and it investigates empirically how these differing incentives bring electoral consequences. Upon exploiting a natural experiment in Indonesia, the study found that the elected village headmen have stronger incentives to support the incumbent mayor than the appointed village headmen do. The results suggest that while civil service reforms might weaken the bureaucratic clientelism, the pre-existing patronclient relations that are deeply embedded in the society are immersed in local political competitions; thus, this practice challenges political consolidation in the young democracy.
H77|The Growing Divergence in U.S. Employee Relations: Individualism, Democracy, and Conflict|The growing divergence in U.S. employee relations is described through a review of national and state-level changes to employment protection laws. Major employment laws are reviewed, as are the significant exceptions to the laws, and exemptions to the exceptions. Major regulatory actions, as well as reversals of the regulations, and reversals of the reversals are also described. An analysis of changes to state employment policies since 2000 shows an increasing ideologically driven divergence within the country between left-leaning “equity and voice” states and right-leaning “individual rights and efficiency” states. Instability and divergence are major features of the U.S. system of employee relations that require additional scrutiny.
H77|Should unemployment insurance be centralized in a state union?|Our study compares the efficiency of centralized and decentralized unemployment insurance programs in a state union. We use a model of two countries with collective bargaining for regional gross wages. The labor force and the firms are partially mobile across the member states of the state union, which gives rise to distortive migration incentives. If unemployment insurance is organized centrally, trade unions negotiate inefficiently high wages due to a vertical fiscal externality. The central government generally cannot provide the second-best unemployment insurance as long as migration is costly. In contrast, decentralized unemployment insurance in the member states is second-best irrespective of the degree of mobility and regional asymmetries. Furthermore, efficiency depends on the federal context. If the wage bargaining process on the labor markets is decentralized, then decisions about unemployment insurance made at the state level are superior to centralized public insurance. For the efficiency of a centralized unemployment insurance, it matters whether decisions in related institutions like cooperative wage bargaining are also centralized.
H77|Revenue vs Expenditure Based Fiscal Consolidation: The Pass-Trough from Federal Cuts to Local Taxes|A growing literature emphasizes that the output effect of fiscal consolidation hinges on its composition, as the choice of increasing revenues vs cutting expenditure is not neutral. Existing studies, however, underscore the role of local governments in a federal setting. Indeed, transfer cuts at the central level might translate into higher local taxes, changing the effective composition of the fiscal adjustment. We evaluate this transmission mechanism in Italy, where municipalities below the threshold of 5,000 inhabitants were exempted from (large) transfer cuts in 2012. This allows us to implement a difference-in-discontinuities design in order to estimate the causal impact of transfer cuts on the composition of fiscal adjustment, also because tight fiscal rules impose a balanced budget on Italian municipalities. We disclose a pass-through mechanism by which local governments react to the contraction of intergovernmental grants by mainly increasing taxes rather than reducing spending. From a political economy perspective, this revenue based fiscal consolidation is driven by municipalities with low electoral competition and low party fragmentation. Keywords: fiscal consolidation, intergovernmental grants, difference-in-discontinuities. JEL classification codes: H2, H77, H87, D7.
H77|Intertemporal Evidence on the Strategy of Populism|Do candidates use populism to maximize the impact of political campaigns? Is the supply of populism strategic? We apply automated text analysis to all available 2016 US Presidential campaign speeches and 2018 midterm campaign programs using a continuous index of populism. This novel dataset shows that the use of populist rhetoric is responsive to the level of expected demand for populism in the local audience. In particular, we provide evidence that current U.S. President Donald Trump uses more populist rhetoric in swing states and in locations where economic insecurity is prevalent. These findings were confirmed when the analysis was extended to recent legislative campaigns wherein candidates tended towards populism when campaigning in stiffly competitive districts where constituents are experiencing high levels of economic insecurity. We also show that pandering is more common for candidates who can credibly sustain anti-elite positions, such as those with shorter political careers. Finally, our results suggest that a populist strategy is rewarded by voters since higher levels of populism are associated with higher shares of the vote, precisely in competitive districts where voters are experiencing economic insecurity.

H77|What Explains the Volatility of India's Catch-up Growth?|Indian post reform growth rates have been higher but more volatile compared to transition periods forother comparable countries. The reasons are aggravation of shocks due to unaddressed criticalbottlenecks together with pro-cyclical macroeconomic policy that compressed aggregate demand.Reform is required to relieve constraints, but traditional reforms may be neither appropriate norachievable. Feasible reforms are discussed. Since diversity and resilience has increased and someconstraints have eased, the paper argues sustained high growth is reachable with the relevant policy support.
H77|Tax decentralization notwithstanding regional disparities|In assessing the desirability for tax decentralization reforms, a dilemma between efficiency and redistribution emerges. By limiting the ability of the central government to redistribute resources towards regions in financial needs, decentralization curbs incentives for excessive subnational spending and enhances fiscal discipline, but may also widen interregional disparities by triggering tax competition for mobile tax bases. We provide a formal treatment of this trade-off, and shed light on the optimal degree of fiscal decentralization. We find that tax decentralization can be optimal even under Rawlsian social preferences which only weight the welfare of the poorest region in the federation.
H77|How do subnational governments react to shocks to revenue sources? Evidence from Argentina|Using the exogenous variability in intergovernmental transfers and hydrocarbon royalties, based on the fiscal regime that prevailed in Argentina from 1988 to 2003, we jointly estimate the effects that changes in these public revenues had on provincial public consumption and debt. When receiving a one-peso increase in intergovernmental transfers, provinces spent 32 centavos of each peso on public consumption and 43 on debt repayment. But when hydrocarbon-producing provinces received a one-peso increase in royalties, they used 75 centavos for debt repayment. These dissimilar reactions to revenue increases are robust to different specifications of the basic regressions. Finally, we provide two alternative explanations for them: the higher volatility of hydrocarbon royalties (relative to intergovernmental transfers) and the exhaustible nature of these revenues.
H77|Effetti finanziari delle richieste di autonomia regionale: prime simulazioni|Il 15 febbraio 2019 sono state rese disponibili le bozze di intesa tra il Governo e le Regioni Emilia- Romagna, Veneto e Lombardia, in seguito alla pressante richiesta di maggiore autonomia da parte di queste tre regioni. Basandoci su questi testi e sulla spesa statale regionalizzata, ricostruiamo i flussi di risorse necessari a soddisfare le richieste di decentramento delle funzioni. E’ possibile individuare uno schema di compartecipazioni che finanzino le spese devolute. Nell’ipotesi in cui non siano approvati i fabbisogni standard entro tre anni dall’emanazione dei decreti che avviano le autonomie regionali simuliamo, come previsto nelle intese, l’adozione della spesa media nazionale pro capite per tutte le regioni. Ciò implica un trasferimento di risorse da alcune regioni con spesa pro-capite superiore alla spesa media nazionale ad altre regioni con spesa pro-capite inferiore alla spesa media nazionale. Esaminiamo anche il caso in cui l’istruzione non venga riconosciuta tra le materie devolute. In entrambi i casi le regioni che chiedono autonomia riceverebbero risorse aggiuntive. Nel caso in cui tutte le funzioni di spesa siano considerate ad Emilia Romagna, Veneto Lombardia spetterebbero 2,7 miliardi in più rispetto alla spesa storica, il 17% in più. Nel caso in cui l’istruzione venga esclusa dalla funzioni di spesa devolute vi sarebbe un incremento di risorse di 1,3 miliardi, 21% in più. Infine ipotizzando una crescita dei gettiti asimmetrica tra Nord e Sud Italia, che riprende la previsione di crescita dei consumi per il 2019 di Prometeia, otteniamo un incremento di gettito nelle tre regioni che chiedono l’autonomia pari al 45% dell’incremento di gettito totale.
H77|Rethinking China's Local Government Debt in the Frame of Modern Money Theory|Local government debt in China is increasing and presents a great threat to China's financial stability. In China's fiscal system, the central government often prioritizes reducing its fiscal deficit and can determine to a great extent the distribution of revenue and expenditure between itself and local governments. There is therefore a tendency for the fiscal burden to be shifted from the central government to the local governments. Resolving China's local government debt problem requires not only strengthening regulation, but also abandoning the central government's fiscal balance target, because this target may make regulation hard to sustain in times of economic downturn. This paper discusses central-local fiscal relations in the framework of Modern Money Theory, suggesting that, because a government with currency sovereignty can always afford any spending denominated in its own currency, China's central government should bear a greater fiscal burden.
H77|Inter-municipal cooperation in administrative tasks– the role of population dynamics and elections|We analyze the factors driving the emergence of inter-municipal cooperation (IMC) in tasks of internal administration in West-Germany between 2001 and 2014. In line with the Institutional Collective Action Approach, we find similarities in political ideology to foster cooperation. Cost pressure drives IMC. Given substantial cost hysteresis in administrative tasks, we expect IMC to be more frequent among shrinking municipalities. Our results supports this notion. However, there is no evidence that municipalities make use of complementarities from divergent population dynamics. We apply a hazard model that allows us to analyze the timing of IMC arrangements. We find state subsidies for IMC are an important driving force behind IMC. IMC agreements are less likely to emerge in election years when municipalities face low cost pressure while the opposite is true for municipalities with high cost pressure.
H77|Does tax competition drive cooperation in local economic development policies? Evidence on inter-local business parks in Germany|An increasing number of municipalities cooperates in the field of economic development. In this paper, we focus on a specific instrument in this field, namely the development of joint business parks. We apply a hazard model to data from West-German municipalities between 2000 and 2015. We find inter-local business parks to be more frequent among small municipalities and in constellations where suitable land is scarce. Our main focus rests on the role of tax competition. An analogy building on the literature on international tax coordination supports the hypothesis that inter-local business parks are more likely in regions where tax competition is intense. The evidence is affirmative: We find that the likelihood of inter-local business park formation to increase in the intensity of local tax competition.
H77|Inter-municipal cooperation as a solution for public services delivery? The case of Unioni di Comuni in Emilia-Romagna Region|Inter municipal cooperation (IMC) represents a solution adopted all around the world in order to jointly provide services considering the complexity of contemporary socio-economic contexts. However, empirical evidence on IMC solutions is still week. The purpose of this paper is to analyse associations of municipalities (Unioni di Comuni, UC), the prevalent kind of IMC established in Italy, as a possible solution for sustainable public services delivery. Our research questions refer to the main features of Unioni di Comuni as an IMC for public services delivery in Emilia-Romagna Region (Italy), to the explanation of those characteristics, and to the evaluation of UCs and their features in terms of autonomy, resilience and sustainability. In order to meet our objectives, we accomplished a cluster analysis, considering administrative and socio-economic data; in addition, we examined specific characteristics within each cluster to proceed with a comparison between clusters in terms of revenues from transfers from other governments layers, own revenues, current expenses and financial autonomy index in the last years. Our results suggest a general tendency: to provide services through UC in E-R; and to enhance their development in terms of public service special-ization. But at the same time, UCs generally decreased their own financial autonomy, relying on transfers from other public institutions. In line with Resource-Dependence Theory (RDT), our empirical analysis finds different clusters of UCs which act as new centres for public service delivery in Emilia-Romagna Region in order to reduce uncertainty over resources through the creation of new inter-institutional balances. However, the statement that strong UCs com-pensate weak starting territorial features of municipalities is not self-evident.
H77|The Political Economy of Immigration Enforcement: Conflict and Cooperation under Federalism|We study how the shared responsibilities over immigration enforcement by local and federal levels in the US shape immigration enforcement outcomes, using detailed data on the Secure Communities program (2008-2014). Tracking the movement of arrested unlawfully present immigrants along the several steps of the immigration enforcement pipeline, and exploiting a large shift in federal enforcement priorities in mid 2011, we disentangle the three key components of the variation in deportation rates: federal enforcement efforts, local enforcement efforts, and the composition of the pool of arrestees. This decomposition allows us to recover the local (county) level response to changes in federal enforcement intensity. Among urban counties, 80 percent, mostly Democratic but with small shares of Hispanics, exhibit strategic substitutabilities. The inverse relationship between federal and local efforts allowed most counties to reduce opposition to the policy, and was accompanied by an increased alignment of local and federal preferences. The federal level was very effective in directing its enforcement efforts towards counties where it expected local collaboration, but conflict was mostly driven by a change in the types of unlawfully present immigrants it prioritized for removal.
H77|Federalizing Benefits: The Introduction of Supplemental Security Income and the Size of the Safety Net|In 1974, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) federalized cash welfare programs for the aged, blind, and disabled, imposing a national minimum benefit. Because of pre-existing variation in generosity, SSI differentially raised payment levels in states below its benefit floor, but had no effect in states that paid above it. We show that SSI increased disability participation in states with the lowest pre-SSI benefits, but shrank non-disability cash transfer programs. For every four new SSI recipients, three came from other welfare programs. Each dollar of per capita SSI income increased total per capita transfer income by just over 50 cents.
H77|Sharing a Government|This paper develops a simple theoretical framework to study a set of regions, each with its own regional government, who share a union or central government. These governments must decide whether to implement or discard a large number of projects that produce local benefits for the region that implements them, and externalities for the rest of the regions. Conflict or disagreement arises since different regions value projects differently. The classic assignment problem consists of deciding who decides these projects, either the union or the regional governments. It is well known that regional governments are insensitive to externalities. The key observation here is that the union government is insensitive to local benefits. Thus, each government maximizes only a piece of the value of projects, and disregards the other one. This observations leads to simple and clear rules for solving the assignment problem.
H77|Abandon Ship? Party Brands and Politicians' Responses to a Political Scandal|"In this article, we study politicians' - rather than voters' - responses to the main political scandal in Italian recent history (Tangentopoli), and overcome endogeneity concerns by analysing the local implications of this national corruption scandal. We find that local politicians withdraw support for incumbents in parties hit by Tangentopoli - inducing increased political instability in such municipalities. Moreover, politicians in parties hit by the scandal exhibit higher rates of party switching and lower re-running rates. Scandals thus appear to decrease the value of the party ""brand"", and become transmitted across politicians and levels of government via partisan cues."
H77|Revisiting yardstick competition and spillover effects in in the new era of spatial econometrics: evidence from Italian cities|This paper exploits political features of Italian local governments to identify the presence of spatial interactions in spending decisions over the period 2001-2011. In particular, I take advantage of the political cycle to isolate the effect of spending decisions of one municipality on neighbors’ municipalities. The results of this analysis point to the presence of strategic interaction between neighboring municipalities, and indicate that such a fiscal behavior is more pronounced during electoral years, that is municipalities are engaged in yardstick competition. Moreover, to isolate any other source of spatial interactions from yardstick competition, I rely on a sample of municipalities experiencing a council dismissal, for which the political process is expected to be less marked - as they are led by a commissioner, who does not have any political concern. In this case, I build a measure of intensity of commissioner to induce variation in the spending decisions, finding, however, no evidence of spatial dependencies. Taken together these results suggest that the observed spatial dependence in spending decisions is unlikely to be driven by spillover e?ects, rather, it seems to be consent with the yardstick competition hypothesis.
H77|The Unintended Composition Effect of the Subnational Government Fiscal Rules: The Case of Italian Municipalities|Although numerical fiscal rules may be introduced to achieve several objectives, to date the maintenance of fiscal sustainability is their predominant goal. This is particularly true at subnational level; maintaining fiscal discipline in a decentralized setting is challenging and subnational government fiscal rules are considered one of the most valid solutions to the problem. While theoretical and empirical literature has mainly focused on their effectiveness in containing subnational deficit and/or debt, little attention has been paid to the possible trade–offs and side effects of the rules on the composition of subnational expenditure. The aim of this paper is to fill this gap by exploiting the case of Italian municipalities, which have been subject for fifteen years (1999–2015) to a set of rules called Domestic Stability Pact. The Italian DSP framework – imposing rules only on municipalities above a population threshold (5,000 inhabitants) – allows us to implement a quasi– experimental technique to investigate the unintended composition effects of the rules. A difference–in–discontinuities design permits to find rigorous empirical evidence that the switching in 2007 to rules which are more binding in terms of fiscal discipline leads to a recomposition of municipal expenditure against investment spending. The analysis is then integrated by evaluating the impact of the rules on six categories of investment expenditure. Investment in human capital and infrastructure seems to be the most affected.
H77|The dark side of fiscal federalism:evidence from hospital care in Italy|We use 2009-14 data from patients hospital discharges to assess the effects of fiscal federalism on the quality of care provided to regional and extraregional patients in Lombardy. Empirical results suggest that even after controlling for hospital fixed effects, patients demographic and health characteristics, extraregional patients wait less compared to regional ones, stay longer in hospital and are associated with higher reimbursement costs. However, private and public hospitals with higher proportion of extraregional patients show a lower mortality and lower reimbursement costs. This result suggest that competition works because of the spillovers effects that the market for extraregional patients produces.
H77|“Does inter-municipal cooperation really reduce delivery costs? An empirical evaluation of the role of scale economies, transaction costs, and governance arrangements”|Inter-municipal cooperation in public service delivery has attracted the interest of local authorities seeking to reform public service provision in recent years. Cost saving has been among the most important drivers of such cooperation. However, the empirical results from the literature on inter-municipal cooperation and its associated costs offer contradictory outcomes in this regard. The boom in empirical studies addressing this question over the last decade offers insights into the factors that might explain the discrepancy in reported outcomes. With this objective in mind, we conduct a meta-regression analysis that considers all existing multivariate empirical studies of this matter. We formulate several hypotheses regarding scale economies, transaction costs, and governance of cooperation, based on the prior theoretical literature. While we find no clear indications of the role played by transaction costs in the relationship between cooperation and service delivery costs, we find strong evidence that population size and governance are significant in explaining the relationship. Specifically, small populations and delegation to a higher tier of government seem to offer cost advantages to municipalities when opting to cooperate. Furthermore, we build an extension of our model by disentangling service-related transaction costs based on asset specificity and ease of measurability of the service.
H77|Who Sent You? Strategic Voting, Transfers and Bailouts in a Federation|Lower-level governments often receive federal support through transfers or bailouts. We study how the regional or local ties of federal politicians can steer this process. We build a two-tier model of government, where regionally elected federal legislators bargain over federal support aimed at their own constituency. This leads to strategic voting on the regional level. Federal legislators are strategically elected to watch over the interests of their own region, cushioning shocks to local consumption and driving down borrowing costs. Lower-level legislators anticipate this, which sets the stage for regional over-borrowing both if they receive annual grants, or when a bailout scheme is introduced during periods of crisis. Voters strategically select federal representatives with more extreme positions than the median voter, as long as federal co-funding schemes imply some degree of interregional redistribution. These theoretical predictions are confirmed by our empirical analysis, where we compare the political extremism of representatives elected to the EU Parliament with that of representatives elected to national Parliaments.
H77|Does decentralization of decisions increase the stability of large groups?|Abstract Using a laboratory experiment with nested local and global public goods, we analyze the stability of global groups when individuals have the option to separate, according to the degree of decentralization of decision-making. We show that increasing the number of decisions made at the local level within a smaller group reduces the likelihood that individuals vote in favor of a configuration that includes no global good for interacting only within their local group. Voting for such a configuration is more likely when global group members are less cooperative and local group members are more cooperative. Reinforcing local group identity has no impact on votes.
H77|Grants-in-aid and the prospect of re-election: The impact of EU funds on mayoral elections in Poland|We investigate whether grants-in-aid help the recipient government to get re-elected. We take Poland as our testing ground and analyze the impact of EU funds spent within a municipality on mayoral elections in 2010 and 2014. We employ an instrumental variables approach to account for the endogeneity of EU funds. Our results show that EU funds do not generally increase the mayors’ chance of reelection. We test whether the impact of EU funds is moderated by municipal characteristics. We find no moderating effect for the fiscal situation of municipalities but positive effects for human capital endowment and for the share of pro-European citizens. These results suggest that the political incentives inherent do not help to concentrate EU funds in regions where there is a particular need to foster economic development, nor do they help to direct funds to municipalities where the potential to reconcile EU sceptics is high.
H77|The Political Boundaries of Ethnic Divisions|Policymakers in diverse countries face the persistent challenge of managing ethnic divisions. We argue that redrawing subnational political boundaries can fundamentally reshape these divisions. We use a natural policy experiment in Indonesia to show that changes in the political relevance of ethnic divisions have significant effects on conflict in the short- to medium-run. While redistricting along group lines can increase social stability, these gains are undone and even reversed in newly polarized units. Electoral democracy further amplifies these effects given the large returns to initial control of newly created local governments in settings with ethnic favoritism. Overall, our findings show that the ethnic divisions underlying widely-used diversity measures are neither fixed nor exogenous and instead depend on the political boundaries within which groups are organized. These results illustrate the promise and pitfalls of redistricting policy in diverse countries where it is not feasible for each group to have its own administrative unit.
H77|Would UDAY brighten up Rajasthan Finances?|Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY) required number of State governments to take over debt of power distribution companies in their books of accounts. Though this one time inter-vention made both debt and deficit measures more comprehensive, this has raised many chal-lenges including comparability of deficit across States and long run fiscal implications of po-wer sector debt on State finances.
H77|Federalism, Fiscal Asymmetries and Economic Convergence: Evidence from Indian States|This paper tests economic convergence across States in India by incorporating federal fiscal asymmetries and differentials in gross fixed capital formation at the state level. Using dynamic panel models, it is observed that there is no unconditional convergence of economic growth. Controlling for state-wise asymmetries in fiscal policy variables, financial parameters, capital formation and human development outcomes using Arenallo and Bond (1991) panel data methodology, no strong evidence for conditional convergence is observed. It is observed from the GMM estimations that public capital spending has positive and significant relationship with economic growth. It is also observed that the quality of human capital formation is a pre-requisite for economic growth, both for club and (aggregate) conditional convergence.
H77|Decentralisation in a Globalised World: Consequences and Opportunities|Globalisation accompanied by the growing importance of information technology and knowledge-based production pose challenging problems for federations. We summarise the difficulties that traditional decentralised federations face in addressing problems of competitiveness, innovation and inequality brought on by globalisation. Adapting to these challenges involves rethinking the roles of various levels of government and rebalancing them appropriately. On the one hand, responding to inequality enhances the policy role of the federal government. On the other hand, state and local governments must respond to the imperative of providing education and business services to equip citizens and firms to compete in the knowledge economy. Perhaps most important, large urban governments are best placed to provide the physical and social capital to support innovation hubs. A key challenge for fiscal federalism is to facilitate the decentralisation of responsibilities to urban governments. This entails new thinking about revenue decentralisation, policy harmonisation and the structure of intergovernmental transfers so that cities can implement their policies effectively and accountably.
H77|Improving the Performance of Sub-national Governments through Benchmarking and Performance Reporting|Performance systems are one tool available to central governments to improve the performance of sub-national service delivery. This paper provides a preliminary review of suitable metrics and mechanisms to reliably measure and monitor the efficiency and quality of public services that are provided by sub-national governments. This review aims to conceptualise the challenges associated with measuring public sector inputs, outputs and outcomes and implementing effective performance systems. Robust performance systems aim to measure both the efficiency and effectiveness of public services, as well measure cost efficiency, to better understand and remedy cost discrepancies across regions. Implementing qualitative mechanisms such as external inspections and user surveys are also useful in providing insights into consumer experience and well-being.
H77|Optimal fiscal equalisation and its application to Australia: updated|The first part of this paper develops a theoretical model of fiscal equalisation to derive an optimal equalisation formula that has general applicability for federations. If vertical equity is achieved by the central government and horizontal equity by interstate migration, the welfare-maximising role of fiscal equalisation is to support an efficient distribution of different labour types across states. The theoretical model further develops work by Boadway and Flatters and by Albouy with some Australian-oriented extensions. Under optimal equalisation, full equalisation is applied when a state government achieves a fiscal advantage by using source-based taxes to raise revenue from non-residents (e.g. mining royalties) or from spreading its fixed costs over a large population. However, efficiency also dictates that equalisation is limited to fiscal advantages arising from differences in state population composition when applied to revenue raised from residents (e.g. via labour or consumption taxes) or to the variable costs of government. Simplifying assumptions are discussed. The second part of this paper applies the optimal equalisation approach to Australia using, as a base, the Commonwealth Grants Commission (CGC) assessments for 2017/18 and 2018/19. 2016 Census data is used to measure the impact of each state’s population composition on its ability to raise revenue from residence-based taxes for use in applying limited equalisation. The gain in consumer welfare of moving from the current Australian full equalisation system to optimal equalisation is estimated. Policy alternatives that are found to be inferior to the current full equalisation system include no equalisation, half-equalisation and the donor relief equalisation schemes recently recommended by the Australian Productivity Commission.
H77|Policy failure and educational attainment in Indonesia|By the late 1980s, child completion of primary education was near universal in Indonesia. The country has since turned its attention to increasing access to secondary school. We examine the causal impact of two classic education policies on secondary school participation in Indonesia: compulsory schooling and spending mandates. We find that the country’s 1994 nine-year compulsory schooling initiative had no impact on child educational attainment. We also determine that Indonesia’s 2002 constitutionally-imposed education spending mandate has been ineffective in influencing secondary school enrolments. Both policies suffer from weak enforcement. Improved enforcement would be beneficial in the case of compulsory schooling. However, the major risk in the case of spending mandates is that government begins to enforce them more rigorously, as they are applied to additional sectors, thereby constraining the efficient delivery of education and other local public services.
H77|A fire department for the Euro area: reflections on a fiscal risk-sharing capacity|This essay investigates the necessity of and options for a central fiscal risk-sharing capacity in the Euro area. How can these aims be reconciled with the member countries’ responsibility for sound fiscal policy that also considers constitutional sovereignty, institutional efficiency and economic effectiveness? As a result, such a capacity can be created as an overlay over the existing fiscal framework without treaty changes and can complement it according to the distinct features of the monetary union. A stabilization fund dedicated to investment appears to be the best solution in light of the applied criteria.
H77|Fiscal Policy, as the “Employer of Last Resort”: Impact of Direct fiscal transfer (MGNREGA) on Labour Force Participation Rates in India|We examine the impact of conditional fiscal transfers on public employment across gender in India taking the case of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). The MGNREGS, as an “employer of last resort” fiscal policy, is a direct employment transfer, which guarantees to provide 100 days of paid work opportunities at a predetermined wage for public works in India through a self-selection criterion. Using unit record data of the latest 68th round of NSS Employment-Unemployment survey, we examined gender differential impacts of MGNREGS on labour force participation rates across States in India. The unit of analysis in our paper is not ‘household’, but is one step ahead to capture the intra-household level of participating behaviour in the economic activity. The results, based on the survey enumerating 2,80,763 individuals in rural areas, revealed that there is a striking heterogeneity in the gender impacts of job guarantee programme across States of India. The probit estimates showed that MGNREGS job card holder’s labour force participation rates were higher than the non-card holders and the result was more pronounced for women. The analysis of the time-use patterns and the unpaid care economy statistics of job guarantee card holders obtained from the unit records also shows that augmenting public investment in care economy infrastructure is significant for the job guarantee programme to function at its full potential in India.
H77|Voting in the Goods and Service Tax Council of India|In 2017, India enacted a new taxation law called the Goods and Services Tax (GST). This law created a GST Council with representatives of the Union government and the Provincial governments. The decision making procedure in the GST Council is specified to be by weighted voting. This work performs a detailed study of such a mechanism using the framework of formal voting games. On a theoretical note, we introduce several new notions regarding blocking dynamics of voting games. These are then applied to the study of voting in the GST context. We identify a set of basic desiderata and propose some modifications to the voting rule in the GST Act.
H77|Lightweight Suggestion from the Commission to Reform the Financing of the EU Budget|Abstract EU budget is currently financed almost fully by Own Resources, which are based on customs, Gross National Income, and statistically corrected VAT bases of the Member States. Marginal income is provided by activities of the EU, such as fines. Furthermore, rebates received by the large net payers influence markedly the actual amount of contributions paid. The reform proposal published in May 2018 by the European Commission on the new system of Own Resources does not markedly improve the financing structure of the EU budget. The proposal simplifies the calculation of the VAT-based Own Resource. In addition, it introduces three new Own Resources based on CCCTB, ETS allowances and the amount of non-recycled plastic packaging waste. The largest contributions continue to come from the GNI-based Own Resources, Traditional Own Resources, and the VAT-based Own Resources. Environmental effects would be modest. The implementation of CCCTB would improve the conditions in Internal Markets and increase tax revenues, but independently of the use of the proceeds as Own Resource in the EU budget. Strongest resistance is expected to be generated by the suggestion of removing gradually all the rebates of the large net payers.
H77|An assessment of local fiscal autonomy: facts and myths|"The presentation deals with the problem of shaping the decentralized system of public finance and interpretation of fiscal autonomy indicators. The analysis is theoretical and empirical. In the theory we can discuss two extreme scenarios: decentralised (60% own revenue, 40 % external revenue) and centralised system of public finance (40% own revenue, 60 % external revenue). If we assume only 40% share of own revenue, taxes, in the structure of financing sources for local government units, the consequence of this is low budget resilience to unfavourable external and internal factors and high probability of occurrence of broadly understood negative income shocks. The aim of the discussion is to analyse the trends in the practice of local government finances in Poland and selected countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The literature of the subject, studies by international institutions as well as data from Eurostat and EC are used in the deliberations. The discussed countries differ significantly in the scope of fiscal decentralisation. Latvia, the Czech Republic and Poland seem to be most advanced in the process. However the example of Poland shows limits and difficulties with interpretation of statistical measures. It is necessary to look at the categories of revenues which belong to the so-called ""own revenues"". It is questionable that in Poland we treat in the statistics the shares in Personal Income Tax and Corporate Income Tax as own revenues. Local government units do not exert any influence on the structure and amount of PIT and CIT (category of shared taxes). The autonomy in expenditure without real fiscal autonomy and responsibility leads to fiscal illusions and undermine the local democracy."
H77|The mainstream economics interpretation of the local state and central-local relations in Post-Mao China: a critical review|Decentralization and the role of local governments have long been touted as key factors in the Chinese economic miracle. This paper intends to critically assess the chief theories advanced by mainstream economics in its attempt to make sense of these aspects of ChinaÃ­s growth story. Firstly the theoretical underpinnings of fiscal federalism, new institutional economics, and market-preserving federalism approaches will be presented, as these theories offer the bedrock for most of the applied insights in which China is framed through the lenses of the central-local relations debate. Secondly, the idea of Ã«market-preserving federalism, Chinese-styleÃ­ will be critically appraised, highlighting its shortcomings. Thirdly, the paper proceeds by bringing in the mainstream response to these problems, relying on the notion of political incentives and career concerns faced by local cadres. It will be argued that the continual adherence to some core tenets dear to the new institutional economics literature in all previous explanations prevents this broad camp of knowledge to properly grasp the complex dynamics of ChinaÃ­s decentralization drive and the role of local governments in the process. Finally, and in closing, an alternative approach will be offered.
H77|Politicians at higher levels of government are perceived as more corrupt|Using an original survey where French citizens were asked to assess corruption at all levels of government, we observe that institutional distance increases perceived corruption. Specifically, municipal governments are perceived as the least corrupt, followed by local governments, senators, deputies, and the national cabinet. The president of the Republic is perceived as slightly less corrupt than the national cabinet, but more corrupt than any other level of government. The relation is robust to alternative specifications, controlling for a series of individual and regional characteristics, and to alternative definitions of the dependent variable. It is not reducible to geographical distance. We observe similar results in other countries.
H77|The global crisis and intergovernmental relations: Revisiting the centralisation-decentralisation debate ten years on|There is a growing empirical literature on the effects of the global financial and economic crisis on intergovernmental relations. This paper contributes to this literature by focusing on conventional budgetary aggregates and institutional indicators of subnational authority in policymaking and fiscal-financial management. The empirical analysis is carried out for a large set of advanced and emerging-market/developing economies between 1990 and 2015 and shows that the crisis has been associated with an increase in the subnational shares of general government spending and revenue. The findings for subnational authority over policy and fiscal-financial management are more nuanced and suggest that increases in government indebtedness (spending) since the crisis have been associated with greater (weaker) subnational authority. It is possible that the need to deliver debt reductions through medium-term fiscal consolidation calls for greater intergovernmental coordination, which enhances the bargaining power of the subnational jurisdictions to broaden their prerogatives in fiscal matters and influence national policymaking.
H77|Fiscal stability during the great recesion: Putting decentralization design to the test|There is a longstanding debate in the economics literature on whether fiscally decentralized countries are inherently more fiscally unstable. The Great Recession provides a fertile testing ground for analyzing how the degree of decentralization does actually affect countries’ ability to implement fiscal stabilization policies in response to macroeconomic shocks. We provide an empirical analysis aiming at disentangling the roles played by decentralization design itself and several recently introduced budgetary institutions such as subnational borrowing rules and fiscal responsibility laws on country’s fiscal stability. We use OECD countries’ data since 1995, which includes both a boom period of worldwide economic growth and the Great Recession. Our main finding is that well-designed decentralized systems are not destabilizing. But, in addition, sub-national fiscal and borrowing rules should be at work to improve the overall fiscal stability performance of decentralized countries.
H77|Is there an optimal size for local governments? A spatial panel data model approach|The paper presents a framework for determining the optimal size of local jurisdictions. To that aim, we first develop a theoretical model of cost eficiency that takes into account spatial interactions and spillover effects among neighbouring jurisdictions. The model solution leads to a Spatial Durbin panel data specification of local spending as a non-linear function of population size. The model is tested using local data over the 2003-2011 period for two aggregate (total and current) and four disaggregate measures of spending. The empirical findings suggest a U-shaped relationship between population size and the costs of providing public services that varies depending on (i) the public service provided and (ii) the geographical heterogeneity of the territory.
H77|Decentralization and intra-country transfers in the great recession: the case of EU|The classic arguments of Musgrave (1959) and Oates (1972) are that the redistribution and stabilization functions should be assigned to the federal level of government. The argument is that redistribution is difficult to achieve at lower levels because the public good nature of redistribution and the mobility of individuals and firms. Likewise, stabilization is difficult to achieve because fiscal stimulus of lower levels of government is likely to be underused due to spillover effects and a limited ability to service debt obligations. These arguments suggest that under-provision of redistributive spending should accompany greater decentralization. They also suggest that subnational policies aimed at macroeconomic stabilization are likely to be less effective than national ones, an important issue in an economic crisis. In this paper I examine data on intra-country social protection transfers in the EU before and after the crisis. The results support the classic federalism assignment. For both reasons of redistribution and stabilization, social protection expenditures are best assigned to the central level of government. Regression results indicate that greater decentralization lowers social protection expenditures and a greater vertical fiscal imbalance and greater subnational deficits result in more spending on things other than social protection.
H77|La evolución de la financiación de las comunidades autónomas de régimen común, 2002-2016|En este trabajo se construyen series homogeneizadas de financiación regional a competencias homogéneas e igual esfuerzo fiscal desde 2002 hasta 2016, así como series complementarias de financiación por caja y financiación destinada a competencias singulares. También se recopilan otros agregados de interés que pueden servir para relativizar la financiación autonómica, incluyendo la población ajustada regional. Estas series se utilizan para ilustrar algunos rasgos de interés de la evolución de la financiación agregada regional y de la posición relativa de las distintas comunidades autónomas en términos de financiación por unidad de necesidad. En la presente edición del informe se incorporan estimaciones de las subvenciones recibidas por las CCAA a través de la bonificación de los intereses de los préstamos estatales canalizados a través de los llamados mecanismos adicionales de financiación y del aplazamiento de la devolución de los saldos favorables al Estado de las liquidaciones del SFA correspondientes a los años 2008 y 2009. También se revisan las series de recaudación homogénea para las tasas afectas a los servicios traspasados y el impuesto sobre sucesiones y donaciones utilizando una nueva metodología.
H77|Impact Assessment of Scenarios of Interregional Transfers in Colombia|En este trabajo se evalúan los efectos económicos de diferentes escenarios de asignación regional empleados en el esquema actual de transferencias interregionales en Colombia, destacando los posibles compromisos entre la eficiencia y la equidad regional. Las simulaciones realizadas en el trabajo, utilizando un modelo de equilibrio general computable interregional, contribuyen al análisis del impacto del crecimiento relacionado con algunos de los objetivos generales que persiguen los gobiernos centrales al asignar transferencias subnacionales a los gobiernos locales. En este sentido, se simulan escenarios contra factuales en los que las políticas redistributivas están diseñadas para evaluar los posibles resultados del Producto Bruto Regional. Los resultados muestran que cuando la distribución se lleva a cabo sobre la base del tamaño de la población regional, hay ganancias potenciales en el crecimiento nacional junto con un aumento en las disparidades regionales. Sin embargo, cuando la distribución se lleva a cabo de acuerdo con otros criterios redistributivos, como el número de personas en condición de pobreza o las brechas horizontales de equidad fiscal, existen mejoras potenciales en la desigualdad regional, a pesar de estar acompañadas de efectos negativos del crecimiento. En este sentido, si se prioriza el criterio redistributivo para compensar la reducción del crecimiento, las regiones que enfrentan un aumento neto en las transferencias deben asignar los recursos adicionales para mejorar en términos de Productividad Total de los Factores (PTF), específicamente, priorizando en inversiones que mejoran la PTF en el largo plazo, tales como aquellas en capital humano enfocadas a la educación y la salud. **** ABSTRACT: We assess the economic effects of different scenarios of regional allocation of the current interregional transfers’ scheme in Colombia, highlighting potential tradeoffs between regional equity and efficiency. The simulations conducted in this work, using an interregional computable general equilibrium model, contribute to the analysis of the growth impact related to some of the broad objectives that central governments pursue when allocating subnational transfers to local governments. We simulate counterfactual scenarios in which redistributive policies are designed to assess potential Gross Regional Product (GRP) outcomes had they been applied to the Colombian economy. The results show that when the distribution is carried out based on regional population shares, there are potential gains in national growth together with an increase in regional disparities. However, when the distribution is carried out according to other redistributive criteria, such as the number of people impoverished or the horizontal equity gaps, there is a potential improvement in regional inequality despite negative growth effects. In this sense, if we prioritize the redistributive criterion in order to offset the reduction of growth, regions that face a net increase in transfers should allocate the additional resources to improve in terms of Total Factor Productivity (TFP), specifically, in long-term TFP-enhancing investments, such as human capital in the form of education and health outcomes.
H77|Fiscal incentives, competition, and investment in China|This paper explores how fiscal incentives offered to local governments in China affect investment rates in their jurisdictions. Theoretically, we build a simple fiscal competition model to establish the linkage between local fiscal incentives and expenditure policy and consequently, capital movement. The key prediction of the model, borne out by data from Chinese provinces spanning 2004–2013, is that an increase in the local corporate income tax-sharing ratio, which proxies fiscal incentives offered to local governments, motivates local governments to compete for capital investment through increased public expenditures. Our results contribute to the fiscal federalism literature by showing that local fiscal incentives significantly shape policy choices and local economic performance. In addition, by exploring fiscal incentives offered to local governments, we offer a novel explanation for the unusually high investment rate in China that has been sustained over a prolonged period of time.
H77|The Welfare Costs of Tiebout Sorting with True Public Goods|We develop a model of Tiebout sorting based on decentralized income taxation, which allows for spillovers and imperfect rivalry in consumption of the publicly provided good. We identify three sources of welfare loss from decentralization: Imperfect redistribution, inter-jurisdictional free-riding, and inecient residential choice. Whereas the welfare loss from imperfect redistribution decreases and that from free-riding rises unambiguously as the publicly provided good becomes more pure, the welfare loss from the inecient residential choice depends non-monotonically on spillovers and rivalry. The equilibrium can be characterized by relative crowding of either the rich or the poor municipality. Our results imply that the characteristics of the publicly provided good are an important determinant for the welfare costs of decentralization.
H77|Federal Support for Financing State and Local Transportation and Water Infrastructure|State and local governments own much of the nationâ€™s transportation and water infrastructure, such as highways, mass transit systems, airports, and water treatment systems. The federal government helps states and localities finance investments in such infrastructure through tax-exempt bonds, tax credit bonds, state revolving funds and infrastructure banks, and direct federal credit programs.
H77|Fiscal Substitution of Investment for Highway Infrastructure: Working Paper 2018-08|The federal government provides grants to state and local governments for their transportation infrastructure. State and local governments use some of those funds to replace funds that they would have provided for such investment.
H77|Should Unemployment Insurance be Centralized in a State Union?|This paper compares the decentral organization of unemployment insurance in member states of a state union with the central organization at the upper union’ level. In a model of two countries the labor force and the firm owners can migrate between the states. Labor markets exhibit unemployment due to trade union’s bargaining about the wage rate. In a decentral scenario the states organize independently unemployment insurance and decide about the rate on wages contributed to the insurance budget. Due to open borders they have to take account of migration effects. However, with perfect mobility between the states each government chooses a socially optimal contribution rate such that workers are fully insured against unemployment. In the central scenario the governments overestimate the costs of insurance when bargaining about the contribution rate and observing the common insurance budget of both countries. This leads to a less than socially optimal contribution rate.
H77|Modeling fiscal sustainability in dynamic macro-panels with heterogeneous effects: Evidence from German federal states|In this paper, we extend Henning Bohn's (2008) fiscal sustainability test by allowing for slope heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence (CD). In particular, our econometric approach is the first that allows fiscal reaction functions (FRF) to capture unobserved heterogeneous effects from business and fiscal policy cycles. We apply this econometric approach to sub-national public finance data of the German Laender between 1950 and 2015 and find that their fiscal policy only partly meets fiscal sustainability criteria. According to our results, politicians have significantly reacted to increasing debt levels by increasing budget surpluses since 1991. However, time-series evidence for longer periods does not indicate a significant and positive reaction to increasing debt levels in the West German Laender panel.
H77|Size, Determinants, and Consequences of Corruption in China's Provinces: The MIMIC Approach|This paper uses a multiple indicators and multiple causes (MIMIC) model and estimates the extent of corruption in 30 Chinese provinces from 1995 to 2015. Treating corruption as an unobserved latent variable, the MIMIC results show that both government size and public investment have significant positive effects on corruption, while fiscal decentralization, citizen education level, average public sector wages, intensity of law enforcement, media supervision, political control and FDI all have significant negative effects on corruption. Among them, education level, size of public investment, intensity of law enforcement and political control are the most important determinants of China’s corruption. Additionally, we find that corruption decreases GDP and residents’ income significantly. In the 30 provinces the corruption index shows a negative trend from 1995 to 2015. Comparing the extent of corruption in the eastern, central and western provinces, we also find that the more developed the region, the lower the extent of corruption.
H77|Heterogeneity, Vetoes, and Exit Clauses in Federal Systems|The vast majority of federations lack exit clauses. Existing theoretical explanations of this stylized fact focus on issues of credible commitment, signaling, and the risk of strategic exploitation. However, such accounts are unable to explain the adoption by the European Union (EU) of Article 50, which allows withdrawal. I contend and demonstrate empirically that in the case of the EU, an exit-voice logic lies at the basis of Article 50. More generally, in heterogeneous (quasi-)federations formed through voluntary accession, prospective members may require an exit right in order to join, especially if they will not have a veto against policy changes. This hypothesis is borne out empirically by a probit regression on the positions of 94 delegates at the European Convention, which shows that heterogeneity drove support for an exit right.
H77|Citizen preferences and the architecture of government|"We consider a country whose government provides a bundle of goods and services through a multi-tier administrative organization. We compare the optimal architectures of public governance (i.e. the division of the state into several tiers, the distribution of services among them, their number of jurisdictions and the performance ability of their administrations) of two governments, one centralized and the other decentralized. Under a decentralized government, national and subnational decision-makers only consider the impact of their decisions on the welfare of their constituents, neglecting other tiers' policy. The resulting architecture is generally different from the (first-best) centralized one, and depends on how citizens weight the performance ability of the administrations and the range of goods they provide. If the relative weight on the performance ability is large, the decentralized architecture entails more tiers, less jurisdictions per tier with reduced scope of services than the centralized one, and the reverse if this relative weight is small. We use our results to estimate this weight on U.S. data. We find that the country exhibits two zones (""Northeast & West"" and ""Midwest & South"") where the estimated values are statistically different."
H77|Fiscal Federalism and Economic Performance - New Evidence from Switzerland|The link between federalism and economic performance is still ambiguous. Aiming at clarification, we improve on a widespread shortcoming by measuring federalism not just by one variable but by various institutions that constitute it. To this end, Switzerland provides for a laboratory as its 26 cantons share a common framework, while the extent of federalism varies between the cantons and across time. By exploiting this setting, the paper provides evidence for the expected heterogeneity: The impact of federalism on economic performance differs conditional on the federal instrument considered. Overall, instruments of competitive federalism appear to improve economic performance of the cantons, while adverse effects are reported for cooperative elements.
H77|Fiscal Equalization as a Driver of Tax Increases: Empirical Evidence from Germany|This paper exploits a recent devolution of tax setting powers in the German federation to study the effects of fiscal equalization on subnational governments’ tax policy. Based on an analysis of the system of fiscal equalization transfers, we argue that the redistribution of revenues provides incentives for states to raise rather than to lower their tax rates. The empirical analysis exploits differences in fiscal redistribution among the states and over time. Using a comprehensive simulation model, the paper computes the tax-policy incentives faced by each state over the years and explores their empirical effects on tax policy. The results support significant and substantial effects. Facing full equalization a state is predicted to set the tax rate from the real estate transfer tax about 1.3 percentage points higher than without. Our analysis also shows that the incentive to raise tax rates is proliferated by the equalization system because the states’ decisions to raise their tax rates have intensified fiscal redistribution over time.
H77|The Better Route to Global Tax Coordination: Gradualism or Multilateralism?|In the context of international tax coordination incomplete information is one of the well-known frictions that can lead to bargaining failure and might explain a lack of observed coordination. We consider international negotiations about tax coordination under complete and incomplete information. We identify the conditions for multilateral negotiations to be more likely to be successful than gradual/sequential negotiation approaches and compare different routes of sequential bargaining. Under plausible conditions, full-scale global coordination is least likely to emerge if the negotiations take place sequentially, and if the negotiations with the most unpredictable country take place last.
H77|Regional Resources and Democratic Secessionism|Although regional resources have been shown to influence secessionist conflicts in developing countries, their effect in established democracies has largely been neglected. We integrate regional resource value and inter-regional transfers in a model on the optimal size of nations, and show that regional wealth correlates positively with secessionist party success in a large panel of regions. To establish causality, our difference-in-differences and triple-differences designs exploit that Scotland and Wales both feature separatist parties, but only an independent Scotland would profit from oil discoveries off its coast. We document an economically and statistically significant positive effect of regional resources and rule out plausible alternative explanations.
H77|Land Use and Decentralized Government: A Strategic Approach for Playing a Short-Sighted Equilibrium|This paper presents a simple strategic model (defined as a shortsighted game) to highlight the incentives for local governments to allow the exploitation of land in areas not suitable for such exploitation due to environmental or other risks. Municipal discretionary policy inevitably produces strategic complementarities and guides individuals to use the land (to choose the most beneficial “shortsighted” Nash equilibrium). In light of these results, it seems possible to state that the definition of non-exploitable territory and the decisions concerning it should not be left to local governments.
H77|Will destination-based taxes be fully exploited when available? An application to the U.S. commodity tax system|We develop a tax competition model that allows for the setting of both an origin-based and a destination-based commodity tax rate in the presence of avoidance and evasion. In the presence of evasion, jurisdictions will give cross-border shoppers tax preferential treatment, thus not fully exploiting the potential of destination-based taxation. Moreover, the divergence between origin-based and destination-based taxes is stronger when the incentives for consumers' tax-arbitrage opportunities increase. The United States is one example of many such systems. While sales taxes are due at the point of sale, use taxes are due on goods purchased out-of-state. We document that when able to set both rates, a majority of jurisdictions levy destination-based use taxes at a lower rate than origin-based sales taxes. In response to changes in state-level policies that increase tax avoidance opportunities, the results of the empirical model broadly confirm our theory.
H77|Fiscal Federalism and Income Inequality: An Empirical Analysis for Switzerland|This paper analyzes the impact of fiscal federalism on income inequality and redistribution. Theoretically contradicting arguments ask for empirical evidence to obtain a better knowledge of this relationship. We rely on the institutional setting in Switzerland to study the issue empirically. According to our findings tax decentralization tends to reduce concentration in pre- and after-tax income without additional redistribution via progressive taxes. It is, however, crucial to consider the interdependence of decentralization and fragmentation as inequality decreasing effects of decentralization are counteracted by its interaction with fragmentation.

The simulations conducted in this work, using an interregional computable general equilibrium model, contribute to the analysis of the growth impact related to some of the broad objectives that central governments pursue when allocating subnational transfers to local governments. We simulate counterfactual scenarios in which redistributive policies are designed to assess potential Gross Regional Product (GRP) outcomes had they been applied to the Colombian economy.

In this sense, if we prioritize the redistributive criterion in order to offset the reduction of growth, regions that face a net increase in transfers should allocate the additional resources to improve in terms of Total Factor Productivity (TFP), specifically, in long-term TFP-enhancing investments, such as human capital in the form of education and health outcomes.
H77|Fiscal equalization and the tax structure|Sub-national governments often finance substantial parts of their budgets via taxes on capital or other mobile factors – despite having access to alternative, less distortionary, revenue sources. This paper develops three hypotheses to explain this pattern and tests them in a natural experiment from Germany. The first hypothesis is that fiscal redistribution between jurisdictions lowers the perceived excess burden of distortionary taxation and thereby raises its attractiveness from the perspective of local governments; the second is that a desire for redistribution within jurisdictions induces a shift away from less distortionary tax instruments, despite their superior efficiency properties; the third is that distortionary taxation serves as a Pigouvian intervention to correct externalities. The empirical analysis supports redistribution between jurisdictions as important, but insufficient, to fully explain the observed reliance on distortionary taxation. Among the remaining two hypotheses, the data favour Pigouvian over distributional motives as a further rationale for the local taxation of mobile factors. JEL Classification: H23, H25, H71, H77
H77|Wait-and-See or Step in? Dynamics of Interventions|We study when and how intervention to stop a project is optimally used in a repeated relationship between a principal and a policymaker. The policymaker is privately informed about his ability, where a higher ability policymaker has a lower cost of producing a good project. He also privately chooses how much effort to supply on the project. Before the project is completed, the principal receives a signal about its outcome and can intervene to stop it from taking effect. Intervention may prevent a bad outcome, but no intervention leads to better learning about the policymakerâ€™s ability. In the benchmark with observable effort, it is optimal to intervene only when the policymakerâ€™s reputation is sufficiently low. If effort is not observable, the optimal response features switching between intervention and no intervention on the equilibrium path. The model rationalizes intervention technologies implemented in practice by supranational agreements and governing coalitions.
H77|Korean Unification: Economic Adjustments under German Assumptions|This paper explores the impact of unification on North and South Korea under the hypothetical scenario that German‐type reunification occurs in the Korean peninsula. Simulation results using a global dynamic general equilibrium model show that with comprehensive market‐oriented reform and opening, the North Korean economy could capitalize on its growth potentials. Unification can reduce the growth rate in South Korea for a certain period following the unification shock due to the transfer of resources out of the South into the North and an increase in risk on the Korea peninsula. Due to the relative sizes in population and per capita gross domestic product of the two Koreas, unification can be more disruptive on North and South Korea, compared to the experience of Germany. The critical factors determining the economic effects of unification are the nature of wage‐adjustment, the size of resource transfers from the South to North, and exchange rate policy.

H77|“Love thy neighbour”? The effect of income and language differences on votes for municipal secessions|This paper studies voters’ preferences on municipal borders in a setting with cohabiting linguistic communities. It takes advantage of unique data from referendum results in the Canadian province of Quebec in 2004, which allow a direct investigation of voter preferences. I find that differences in income and language affect the likelihood of secession. Notably, I also find that these effects are interdependent, suggesting that the support for a local secession is affected to some degree by out-group aversion. Finally, I find that voters are willing to pay additional taxes to live in their jurisdiction of choice.
H77|State disinvestment in higher education: the impact on public research universities' patent applications|While state appropriations are the largest revenue source of the U.S. public university systems, they have declined significantly over the past several decades. Surprisingly, there is little empirical work on the effect of state appropriation cuts on the research productivity of public universities. Helping fill that gap, this paper is the first to examine the role that state appropriations play in public universities’ patent production. The results suggest that state appropriation cuts have a negative impact on the number of approved patent applications from public research universities. Lower state appropriations are shown to lead to a reduction in research expenditures, especially wages and salaries paid to research staff.
H77|Illegal immigration, unemployment, and multiple destinations|We develop a multicountry model of illegal immigration with equilibrium unemployment. Two geographic cases are considered. One has two destinations adjacent to the source country while the other has just one destination country adjacent to it. In both cases, the equilibrium border control proves insufficient compared with the joint optimum, calling for enforcement by federal authorities. Absent such authorities, delegating border control to the country with a larger native labor force can improve each destination country’s welfare. In contrast, the equilibrium internal enforcement policy is efficient, obviating enforcement by supranational authorities.
H77|To the ones in need or the ones you need? The Political Economy of Central Discretionary Grants − Empirical Evidence from Indonesia|We analyze the allocation of discretionary grants from the central government to local governments in Indonesia. Using OLS and Fixed Effects models on an unbalanced panel data set for more than 400 Indonesian districts covering the period 2005-2013, we investigate whether the allocation of the grants is determined by the need of a district, by political alignment of the central government with the local district heads, or by reelection motives of the incumbent president. We find that grant allocations are not determined by need characteristics and that political considerations matter significantly. Districts with low support for the president received significantly more than the core supporting districts, especially in the year of national elections. This effect is limited to the first term of the president. In the second term, after which reelection is impossible, political considerations were largely absent. This pattern is consistent with the view that the incumbent president considers discretionary grants as an instrument to increase reelection probabilities. Unlike the evidence for most countries, we find no effect for political party alignment with local district heads. Our results are robust to the inclusion of a number of other variables capturing competing motives.
H77|The North Caucasus in 2017: major development trends|In 2017, the social and economic development of the North Caucasian regions was proceeding amid introduction by the federal center of some new forms of regional economic support. A change in economic policy priorities in the North Caucasus was taking place amid sluggishness of the health resort sector, growing debt accruals for gas- and power supply and prevailing land-related conflicts.
H77|Russia’s Fiscal Policy in 2017|The year 2017 saw some notable changes in the main parameters of the execution of the general government budget of the Russian Federation: the budgetary system’s revenue gained nearly 1 percentage point of GDP, while expenditure, on the contrary, lost 1.2 percentage points of GDP. Thus, the revenue volume amounted to 32.6 percent of GDP, and that of expenditure – to 34.1 percent of GDP. As a result, the budgetary system’s deficit shrank by 2.2 percentage points of GDP, to 1.5 percent of GDP.
H77|The Global Crisis and Intergovernmental Relations: Revisiting the Centralisation-Decentralisation Debate Ten Years On|There is a growing empirical literature on the effects of the global financial and economic crisis on intergovernmental relations. This paper contributes to this literature by focusing on conventional budgetary aggregates and institutional indicators of subnational authority in policymaking and fiscal-financial management. The empirical analysis is carried out for a large set of advanced and emerging-market/developing economies between 1990 and 2015 and shows that the crisis has been associated with an increase in the subnational shares of general government spending and revenue. The findings for subnational authority over policy and fiscal-financial management are more nuanced and suggest that increases in government indebtedness (spending) since the crisis have been associated with greater (weaker) subnational authority. It is possible that the need to deliver debt reductions through medium-term fiscal consolidation calls for greater intergovernmental coordination, which enhances the bargaining power of the subnational jurisdictions to broaden their prerogatives in fiscal matters and influence national policymaking.
H77|Growth, inequality, and party support: Valence and positional economic voting|Economic growth helps governments get reelected. But does growth, as a valence issue, exhaust the possibilities for the economic vote? What about the impact of inequality, as as a positional economic issue? Can rising economic inequality make or break a government, independent of the country’s growth trajectory? We show, via an examination of 310 elections in established democracies, across time and space, that growth and inequality both matter for incumbent government support. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that both left-wing and right-wing incumbents are held accountable for changes in inequality. While these effects appear unaltered by structural factors such as federalism or the electoral system, their impact seems to depend, to some extent, on whether the country is going through economic hard times.
H77|Decentralization and electoral swings|We explore how the uniformity of electoral swings in the district vote within countries is affected by the level of economic and political decentralization. We rely on district-level data from OECD countries in two consecutive elections before and after the Great Recession to show that as regional governments exert more influence over the central government, districts deviate less from the overall pattern of change in support of the national incumbent party. The causal mechanism accounting for the effect of decentralization on dynamic nationalization is examined with individual panel data from national elections in Canada and Spain.
H77|Fiscal Stability during the Great Recession: Putting Decentralization Design to the Test|There is a longstanding debate in the economics literature on whether fiscally decentralized countries are inherently more fiscally unstable. The Great Recession provides a fertile testing ground for analyzing how the degree of decentralization does actually affect countries’ ability to implement fiscal stabilization policies in response to macroeconomic shocks. We provide an empirical analysis aiming at disentangling the roles played by decentralization design itself and several recently introduced budgetary institutions such as subnational borrowing rules and fiscal responsibility laws on country’s fiscal stability. We use OECD countries’ data since 1995, which includes both a boom period of worldwide economic growth and the Great Recession. Our main finding is that well-designed decentralized systems are not destabilizing. But, in addition, sub-national fiscal and borrowing rules should be at work to improve the overall fiscal stability performance of decentralized countries.Length: 29 pages
H77|Decentralization and Intra-Country Transfers in the Great Recession: The Case of the EU|The classic arguments of Musgrave (1959) and Oates (1972) are that the redistribution and stabilization functions should be assigned to the federal level of government. The argument is that redistribution is difficult to achieve at lower levels because the public good nature of redistribution and the mobility of individuals and firms. Likewise, stabilization is difficult to achieve because fiscal stimulus of lower levels of government is likely to be underused due to spillover effects and a limited ability to service debt obligations. These arguments suggest that under-provision of redistributive spending should accompany greater decentralization. They also suggest that subnational policies aimed at macroeconomic stabilization are likely to be less effective than national ones, an important issue in an economic crisis. In this paper I examine data on intra-country social protection transfers in the EU before and after the crisis. The results support the classic federalism assignment. For both reasons of redistribution and stabilization, social protection expenditures are best assigned to the central level of government. Regression results indicate that greater decentralization lowers social protection expenditures and a greater vertical fiscal imbalance and greater subnational deficits result in more spending on things other than social protection.
H77|Is there an Optimal Size for Local Governments? A Spatial Panel Data Model Approach|The paper presents a framework for determining the optimal size of local jurisdictions. To that aim, we first develop a theoretical model of cost efficiency that takes into account spatial interactions and spillover effects among neighbouring jurisdictions. The model solution leads to a Spatial Durbin panel data specification of local spending as a non-linear function of population size. The model is tested using local data over the 2003-2011 period for two aggregate (total and current) and four disaggregate measures of spending. The empirical findings suggest a U-shaped relationship between population size and the costs of providing public services that varies depending on (i) the public service provided and (ii) the geographical heterogeneity of the territory.
H77|Fiscal decentralisation and the distributive incidence of the great recession|We argue that fiscal decentralisation is one important explanation for variation in distributive outcomes following the Great Recession. Using a difference in differences approach, we examine how fiscal decentralisation mediated the link between spatial distribution, redistributive effort, and interpersonal inequality in 21 OECD cases in the years following the Great Recession. We find that fiscally decentralised nations saw increased interpersonal inequality and lower redistribution, but lower inter-regional inequality. We attribute these results to the weaker redistributive mechanisms in fiscally decentralized nations, which increased interpersonal inequality while preserving market-driven productivity declines in high productivity areas that temporary increased regional convergence.
H77|Fiscal decentralization in the EU: Common patterns through a club convergence analysis|We study the degree of convergence in fiscal decentralization in the European Union in the period 1995–2015 analysing non-central expenditure and revenue as percentages of GDP and of the total expenditure or revenue. The sigma convergence analysis shows only a smooth convergence in the non-central revenue with regard to GDP, with significant divergences in the other indicators, especially after the beginning of the Great Recession. However, the club convergence approach indicates some clustering, with three clubs in the GDP perspective and four to five in the total approach. We also analyse the gap between the expenditure and the revenue as a proxy of fiscal responsibility, with sigma divergence for the entire sample, and now with three and two clubs respectively, with Denmark as the divergent country. These results show how European countries are quite heterogeneous in their views of fiscal federalism and decentralization.
H77|Fiscal consolidation by intergovernmental transfers cuts? The unpleasant effect on expenditure arrears|For the period 2003–2014, we investigate unexplored effects of fiscal consolidation in decentralized public finance on a large dataset of Italian municipalities. Based on a simple, realistic theoretical model, we show that municipalities increase arrears on committed investment expenditure as a response to intergovernmental transfer cuts. Then, we test our predictions controlling for potential sources of endogeneity, and find that a reduction in intergovernmental transfers causes a significant increase in arrears, in addition to other common adjustments to local fiscal policies (e.g., tax revenues). Our results highlight a perverse effect of fiscal consolidation packages implemented by centrally imposed fiscal restraints.
H77|Citizen Preferences and the Architecture of Government|We consider a country whose government provides a bundle of goods and services through a multi-tier administrative organization. We compare the optimal architectures of public governance (i.e. the division of the state into several tiers, the distribution of services among them, their number of jurisdictions and the performance ability of their administrations) of two governments, one centralized and the other decentralized. Under a decentralized government, national and subnational decision-makers only consider the impact of their decisions on the welfare of their constituents, neglecting other tiers' policy. The resulting architecture is generally different from the (first-best) centralized one, and depends on how citizens weight the performance ability of the administrations and the range of goods they provide. If the relative weight on the performance ability is large, the decentralized architecture entails more tiers, less jurisdictions per tier with reduced scope of services than the centralized one, and the reverse if this relative weight is small. We use our results to estimate this weight on U.S. data. We find that the country exhibits two zones (“Northeast & West” and “Midwest & South”) where the estimated values are statistically different.
H77|Ein Vorschlag zur Grundsteuerreform|The German property tax is probably unconstitutional. Since this tax violates the ability-to-pay principle anyway, the author proposes a simpler design that preserves municipal and state revenues and also avoids increases in housing costs.
H77|Fiscal Federalism, Interjurisdictional Externalities and Overlapping Policies|In this paper, we analyze the effects of the interaction between national and local policies designed to reduce an environmental externality that causes environmental damages both nationally and locally. We formulate a theoretical model to develop hypotheses regarding the combined effects of such policies on the stringency of the local policies and on firms’ emissions reductions. To test our hypotheses, we use actual data for Sweden, where emissions of nitrogen oxides from combustion plants are subject to a heavy national tax and to individual emissions standards set by county authorities. Our analytical findings suggest that it is unlikely that local regulators will impose emissions standards stringent enough to achieve further reductions than those induced by the national tax. This is confirmed in our data, where most emissions reductions can be attributed to the national tax and the effects of the emissions standards are not significant.
H77|Grunnvassforvaltning. Om Elinor Ostrom si tilnærming til forvaltning av grunnvatn|The paper discusses the challenges present in the management of groundwater. The theoretical approach of Elinor Ostrom is presented and her study of the management of groundwater in Southern California in the 1960ies is used illuminate how the bottom up process for developing a sustainable system of governance works in California. The most general challenge for a management system is to establish reasonably accurate knowledge about the extent of the groundwater reservoir, a list of the holders of rights to access or pump the groundwater, and the amount taken by those who exercise their rights. If the rights holders are to govern themselves, they need an institutional framework that allows them to create a legally valid constitution for these who have rights in the groundwater. The system of Home-rule that governs local management of public affairs in California provides such framework. This has been studied as polycentric governance.
H77|Dynamic Tax Externalities and the U.S. Fiscal Transformation in the 1930s|We propose a theory of tax centralization in politico-economic equilibrium. Taxation has dynamic general equilibrium implications which are rationally internalized at the federal, but not at the regional level. The political support for taxation therefore differs across levels of government. Complementarities on the spending side decouple the equilibrium composition of spending and taxation and create a role for inter governmental grants. The model provides an explanation for the centralization of revenue, introduction of grants, and expansion of federal income taxation in the U.S. around the time of the New Deal. Quantitatively, it accounts for between 30% and 100% of the federal revenue share’s doubling in the 1930s, and for the long-term increase in federal grants.
H77|Lo stock di capitale comunale: indicazioni per le politiche di intervento infrastrutturale di Regione Lombardia|Partendo dalle spese per investimento dei comuni lombardi nel periodo 2000-2015 e utilizzando il metodo dellâ€™inventario permanente si Ã¨ ricostruito lo stock di capitale pubblico a livello comunale per la regione Lombardia. Si mostra come alcune variabili come la popolazione e lâ€™altitudine influiscano sullo stock di infrastrutture esistente. Per meglio comprendere le determinanti dello stock di infrastrutture pro-capite comunale, si Ã¨ quindi provveduto ad effettuare una stima di questâ€™ultimo utilizzando la tecnica di regressione ai minimi quadrati. Utilizzando i coefficienti di questa regressione si Ã¨ giunti alla definizione di una formula che permette di distribuire trasferimenti in conto capitale, tenendo conto dello stock di infrastrutture in essere. Infine si Ã¨ confrontata lâ€™effettiva distribuzione degli spazi finanziari, concessi da Regione Lombardia ai sensi della legge n. 243/2012, con una distribuzione teorica derivante dallâ€™applicazione del modello delle infrastrutture standard.
H77|Modeling Fiscal Sustainability in Dynamic Macro-Panels with Heterogeneous Effects: Evidence from German Federal States|In this paper, we extend Henning Bohn’s (2008) fiscal sustainability test by allowing for slope heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence (CD). In particular, our econometric approach is the first that allows fiscal reaction functions (FRF) to capture unobserved heterogeneous effects from business and fiscal policy cycles. We apply this econometric approach to sub-national public finance data of the German Laender between 1950 and 2015 and find that their fiscal policy only partly meets fiscal sustainability criteria. According to our results, politicians have significantly reacted to increasing debt levels by increasing budget surpluses since 1991. However, time-series evidence for longer periods does not indicate a significant and positive reaction to increasing debt levels in the West German Laender panel.
H77|Fiscal disparity, institutions and asymmetric yardstick competition|Fiscal disparity leads to a yardstick bias, in that incumbents in fiscally-rich jurisdictions can provide more public goods, extract more rents and yet have a higher probability to be reelected. This study further emphasizes disparity among jurisdictions, not only in terms of fiscal resources but also of costs of rent appropriation. In a setting in which jurisdictions with a higher fiscal capacity have lower costs of rent appropriation whilst those with a lower fiscal capacity have higher costs of rent appropriation, the difference in costs of rent appropriation might moderate the bias caused by the fiscal disparity.
H77|Taxes, Wage Capitalization and the Ability of States to Redistribute Income|Local and state governments attempt to lessen after-tax income inequality via progressive taxation. Migration responses of capital and labor undermine such attempts. Location theory predicts that cross-state migration will continue until the redistributive effects from taxation are fully capitalized into gross wages leaving after-tax wages unchanged. Empirical evidence has not reached a consensus on this issue. At one extreme, Feldstein and Wrobel (1998) report evidence of full tax capitalization for US states. At the other extreme, Leigh (2008) reports very little to no wage capitalization. We revisit this question by creating a pseudo panel from CPS data spanning years 1997 to 2015. Our “best” estimate is that pre-tax wages adjust in response to redistributive state and local taxes, negating roughly 50 percent of effect compared to counterfactual with no behavioral responses.
H77|Reform der Einheitlichen Ansprechpartner (EA): Anregungen von europäischen Good-Practice-Beispielen|Ausgangspunkt der Studie ist der Rückstand Deutschlands gegenüber anderen EU-Ländern bei der Implementierung des Einheitlichen Ansprechpartners. Basierend auf leitfadengestütz-ten Experteninterviews stellt die Studie die stärker digitalisierten EA-Systeme in Österreich und Dänemark vor und leitet daraus Handlungsempfehlungen für Deutschland ab. Neben notwendigen Fortschritten im Bereich des E-Government sollten die wirtschaftspolitischen Akteure - u.a. mit Hilfe einer Koordinierungsgruppe - den Aufbau weitgehend einheitlicher, modular konzipierter Strukturen für die Weiterentwicklung der EA-Landesportale anstreben und dabei auch relevante externe Stakeholder einbeziehen. Die Konsolidierung von beste-henden Parallelangeboten sollte im Wege eines speziellen Beirates erfolgen. Weitere Empfehlungen betreffen u.a. den inhaltlich-thematischen Aufbau der EA-Portale, die (indirekte) Verfahrensabwicklung sowie die stärkere Automatisierung der Helpdesk-Funktion des EA.
H77|Impact of the German real estate transfer: Tax on the commercial real estate market|The tax burden of real estate transactions in Germany increased considerably since the constitutional reform in 2006. We examine the impact of the real estate transfer tax (RETT) on transactions and (net-of-tax) prices of commercial buildings and vacant commercial lots by means of a fixed-effects panel regression. The empirical analysis shows an association of a rise of the RETT by 1% with a decrease of office transactions by up to 0.41% and reduced prices by up to 0.22%. On the market for other commercial properties, transactions and prices decline by 0.17% and 0.19% respectively following a RETT increase. The negative price effects on the commercial real estate market tentatively indicate tax incidence with the seller. In the case of vacant commercial lots, a RETT increase seems to induce an increase of average prices by 0.36%, denoting tax incidence with the buyer. We find no significant effect on transactions of vacant lots in the data. In addition, we analyze possible neighborhood effects among the states. The empirical evidence for these effects implies that with an average of a 1% RETT increase in the bordering states of one state, the prices for other commercial properties and for vacant lots rise by 0.51% and 0.71% respectively. Hence, the border effect seems to surpass the direct price effect and suggests spatial structural changes in the investment behavior.
H77|Equalization transfers and the pattern of municipal spending: An investigation of the flypaper effect in Germany|"We investigate how lump-sum equalization transfers affect expenditures and taxes in the municipalities of the largest German state North Rhine-Westphalia. In general, those general-purpose transfers cannot be treated as exogenous variables. Thus, for the identification of causal effects, two exogenous adjustments in the transfer allocation formula are used as instrumental variables. Findings suggest the existence of the ""flypaper effect"" - municipalities use transfers to increase expenditures but do not reduce tax rates. Extra money from transfers is mainly used to finance social expenditures and public facilities. A set of robustness checks, including a spatial dependence model, confirm the results."
H77|Optimal Public Investment in Economic Centers and the Periphery|We analyze productivity enhancing public expenditure in a spatial economic model with labor mobility, firm-specific increasing returns to scale, and transport costs. Building on Krugman (1991), Fujita, Krugman and Venables (1999) and Redding (2016), we compare optimal investment and tax policies of fiscally autonomous regions to those of a benevolent central planer. We find transport costs and the size of scale effects to influence optimal tax and spending rates under both regimes. For sufficiently low transport costs and low substitutability between manufactured goods, regional fiscal autonomy leads to underinvestment: The lower the transport costs, the lower the local investment, and the higher the potential welfare gain through centralized policies. Our results challenge the view that local public goods should be financed entirely by local governments. They also help explain the recent decline of public investment at the municipal level in fiscally decentralized countries like Germany.
H77|Subnational border reforms and economic development in Africa|Arbitrarily designed borders have been identified by a recent literature as an important reason why sub-Saharan Africa remains one of the poorest regions on the globe. Accordingly, border changes may be a way to promote growth on the African continent. In this paper, we study the effect of subnational border reforms on local economic development (proxied by nighttime luminosity) by tracking provincial-level border changes in Africa during 1992-2013 with GIS techniques. Difference-in-difference regressions suggest that mergers have strong positive effects on economic development. Splits, too, have positive effects, but they are substantially smaller on average. To understand why the economic impact of splits and mergers differs in magnitude, we investigate transmission channels. We link border changes to geocoded conflict data and survey evidence on political attitudes. We find that the differences between splits and mergers are possibly due to different underlying motives for these two types of border reforms. Splits seem to affect development through higher political stability, i.e. a lower incidence of conflicts and more benign political attitudes of citizens, while mergers presumably work through an improvement in administrative efficiency.
H77|'Till Debt Do Us Part': Financial Implications of the Divorce of the Irish Free State from the UK, 1922-6|In this paper, we discuss the unresolved apportionment of national debt when Ireland exited the UK in 1922. Using archival sources and contemporary accounts, we estimate that the British claim on Ireland in 1925 amounted to between 80 and 100 per cent of GNP at a time when the political stability of Ireland was already fragile. We describe the process of how this contingent liability, arising from the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, was ultimately waived in a Financial Agreement in 1925 at the expense of an unchanged border with Northern Ireland. The Irish government also sought, but failed, to secure protection against discrimination for Catholics in Northern Ireland as part of the agreement. While for the Irish Government, this settlement may have represented a political failure, the economic outcome of the agreement transformed the economic position of the new Irish State from one of potential insolvency into one of viability.
H77|Endogenizing government’s objectives in tax competition with capital ownership|Abstract In this study, we extend the standard approach of horizontal tax competition by endogenizing the policy objectives that governments pursue. Following the literature on strategic delegation games, we consider a pre-play stage, where jurisdictions commit themselves to act as Leviathan or as benevolent agents. We show that the symmetric sub-game perfect equilibria correspond to three cases of tax competition among the Leviathan governments, moderate Leviathans, and benevolent governments, depending on the form of capital ownership. Further analysis reveals that asymmetric tax competition generates competition between the benevolent government and the (moderate) Leviathan government. The results provide grounds for benevolent or Leviathan objectives and explain why some governments act as one, while others aim toward a different objective.
H77|The Troika’s variations on a trio: Why the loan programmes worked so differently in Greece, Ireland, and Portugal|Portugal and Ireland exited Troika loan programmes; Greece did not. The conventional narrative is that different outcomes are best explained by differences in national competences in implementing programme requirements. This paper argues that three factors distinguish the Greek experience from that of Ireland and Portugal: different economic, political, and institutional starting conditions; the ad hoc nature of the European institutions’ approach to crisis resolution; and the very different conditionalities built into each of the loan programmes as a result. Ireland and Portugal show some signs of recovery despite austerity measures, but Greece has been burdened beyond all capacity to recover convincingly.
H77|Comment: Betting on Secession: Quantifying Political Events Surrounding Slavery and the Civil War|Abstract: This paper argues that falling slave prices in the earliest months of the American Civil War in April 1861 indicates lack of confidence in the durability of the Confederacy. The key to this understanding is use of an asset pricing model that distinguishes between the expected outcomes of the war, whether the war was thought to be over quickly or otherwise, and whether any compensation for emancipation would be paid. This view concurs with other investigators who have examined falling gold bond and cotton bond prices and, in the very early months, rising Confederate dollar prices of gold, as well as difficulties in selling Confederate bonds to finance its war effort.
H77|Disparidades fiscales regionales en Uruguay|This article discusses the role of intergovernmental transfers by using an empirical analysis applied to a panel of regions (departments) of Uruguay during the period 2006 Â– 2014. First, we discuss the structure and evolution of the regional fiscal disparities and the equalizers effects of the current transfer system in Uruguay. Then, we propose a new methodology that allows us to simulate the effects of the implementation of a new system of equalizer transfers. The main result suggests that the implementation of this new system of intergovernmental fiscal transfers contributes to consolidating a territory with a higher level of fiscal homogeneity.
H77|The Dog that Didn’t Bark: On the Effect of the Great Recession on the Surge of Secessionism|This paper explores the relationship between the economic turmoil generated by the Great Recession and the increase of secessionism in different regions of Western countries. Some authors have stressed that the Great Recession triggered profound changes in political attitudes and preferences and, in the context of a conflict between the centre and the periphery, fuelled secessionism as a radical shift of the institutional setup. Nevertheless, other researchers have remarked that a deep recession may make voters more accommodating with the status quo and more reluctant to take radical stances. Our paper aims at contributing to this debate by analyzing the case of Catalonia. We use the variation of economic variables and data from surveys and electoral outcomes at the level of municipalities to explore the relationship between the deterioration of the economic situation (that is, the local variation in the intensity of the crisis) and the increase of preferences for secession among the Catalan population. The findings from the analysis of our empirical models do not support the hypothesis that the heterogeneous effects of the Great Recession had any significant impact on political preferences at the level of municipality in Catalonia. These findings contribute to our understanding of the effects of hard economic times on people’s attitudes and behaviour.
H77|Strength in diversity? Fiscal federalism among the fifty US states|Abstract Fiscal federalism in the USA has a distinctive structure that contrasts sharply with that in most other industrialized nations. Our purpose in this paper is to describe and explore the US “brand” of fiscal federalism. We demonstrate that there is a striking amount of variety in the 50 state fiscal systems and that these differences have prevailed in the face of potentially disruptive forces. The variety we find stems in large part from states having meaningful fiscal autonomy, in particular, the authority to levy taxes. The result is likely higher societal welfare than would ensue without this autonomy.
H77|Spotlight on the beneficiaries of EU regional funds: A new firm-level dataset|This study introduces a new firm-level dataset containing over two million projects co-funded by the European Union's (EU) structural and Cohesion funds in 25 EU member states in the multi-annual financial framework 2007-2013. Information on individual beneficiary firms and institutions published by regional authorities is linked with business data from Bureau van Dijk's ORBIS database. Moreover, we show how modern text mining techniques can be used to categorise EU funded projects into fifteen thematic categories proposed by the European Commission. A first analysis of the dataset reveals substantial heterogeneity of beneficiaries and projects across and within countries. While in the majority of lagging regions the largest project expenditure is dedicated to transportation and energy infrastructure, in most other regions the major part is assigned to innovation and technological development as well as business (including SME) support. In an econometric analysis we control for project and firm characteristics and find that the highest single project values are associated with older beneficiary firms that are larger in size. Furthermore, the projects with topmost expenditure are carried out in Dutch and British regions.

H77|Tax competition and the political economy of public employment: a model for Austria|Abstract In this work, we simulate the effects of the tax autonomy of the Austrian states on the levels of public employment in each state. We show that depending on the strength of the public sector lobby, tax autonomy would require a reduction of employment in the public sector of between 25 and 35% of the current level. We also show that tax autonomy increases welfare levels by 1–1.5%; that is, the positive change in the disposable income of the workers more than offsets the welfare loss resulting from the lower provision of public goods. Finally, we show that the reduction of public employment is superior in terms of welfare to an alternative scenario in which employment levels are held constant but the wage levels in the public sector are adjusted.
H77|Depressing dependence? Transfers and economic growth in the German states, 1975–2005| Depressing dependence? Transfers and economic growth in the German states, 1975–2005. Regional Studies. Most countries pay substantial intergovernmental transfers to poor regions with the aim of achieving regional convergence. Consequently, transfers should have a positive effect on economic growth. However, it is equally possible that transfers perpetuate underdevelopment. This paper studies empirically the effect of intergovernmental transfers on economic growth with a panel of West German states over the period 1975–2005. The findings suggest that transfers do not foster economic growth, presumably because the recipients use them to subsidize declining industries.
H77|A Situational Theory of Pork Barrel Politics: The Shifting Logic of Discretionary Allocations in India|A rich panel dataset on Indian states is used to propose a situational theory of distributive politics which states that incentives for exclusive targeting of affiliated states in dominant party systems drive national ruling parties towards particularism, while the shrinking opportunity to indulge in such a policy in multiparty coalition systems creates a universalisation effect. Additionally, the disaggregated analysis of discretionary grants brings to the fore the fact that the shift from particularism to universalism occurs for schematic grants, which provide an opportunity for credit claiming. The ad hoc grants, which are like side payments, remain subject to par ticularism. [GIGA Working paper No. 298].
H77|Federalism and Foreign Direct Investment: How Political Affiliation Determines the Spatial Distribution of FDI – Evidence from India|This paper links the foreign economic engagement of India's states with the literature on federalism, thereby contributing to an understanding of the political economy of FDI inflows in a parliamentary federal system. More specifically, it studies subnational governments' international engagements to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) and investigates whether the political affiliations of states' chief ministers and parliamentarians determine the spatial distribution of FDI across the Indian states, correcting for the influence of per capita income, population density, urbanisation, infrastructure, policy regime, and human development. Although the central government plays no direct role in determining the state to which FDI goes, the centre-state relations in a federal structure play a role in creating perceptions about the relative political risk involved in different investment destinations. Employing multiple linear regressions to analyse time-series (2000-2013) cross-sectional (12 states) data using the panel procedure, the study finds that affiliated states attract relatively more FDI per capita in comparison to states ruled by opposition parties or coalition partners. However, some exceptions do result, primarily due to two phenomena: first, the presence of a strong state leadership and, second, the presence of a significant share of members of parliament belonging to the prime minister's party in the non-affiliated states. Further, states ruled by outside supporters have been most successful in attracting FDI inflows during the coalition period.
H77|Local secessions, homophily, and growth. A model with some evidence from the regions of Abruzzo and Molise (Italy, 1963)|This paper analyses the case of a local secession, i.e. the birth of a new local jurisdiction by separation from an existing one. We present a stylized model in which society is composed of heterogeneous groups and individuals have an homophily bias. The model predicts that: (i) separations, such as the split of a territory into distinct administrative units, occur when the costs of mixed communities are sufficiently large; (ii) the smaller community drives the decision to secede; (iii) welfare gains from the split are associated with positive population growth; (iv) higher payoffs under separations, however, might be related to taste for sameness only, with no (or even negative) effect on economic growth. Empirically, we exploit the secession of the Italian region of Molise from Abruzzo in 1963, a unique event in Italian history. Historical records document that the split was the result of pressures from Molise, the smaller community. Our evidence suggests that the split was associated with population inflows in both areas. Finally, by using a synthetic control approach, we show that the split caused significant benefits to per-capita GDP growth, in both regions.
H77|Taxation, social protection, and governance decentralization|Governments do not have perfect information regarding constituent priorities and needs. This lack of knowledge opens the door for groups to lobby in order to affect the governmentâ€™s taxation levels. We examine the political economy of decentralized revenue-raising authority in light of social protection expenditures by constructing a theoretical model of hierarchical contests and comparing the implications of centralized with decentralized governance. Increasing information available to the government may generate additional expenditures by interest groups trying to affect government taxation decisions. We show the potential existence of a poverty trap as a result of decentralization in taxation decisions.

Es gibt empirische Evidenz, dass die Steuersatz-anhebungen durch Verhaltensreaktionen zu niedrigeren Immobilienumsätzen geführt haben. Durch die gesonderte Berücksichtigung der Grunderwerbsteuer im Länderfinanzausgleich werden negative fiskalische Effekte der Verhaltensreaktionen zum Teil ausgeglichen, so dass ein Anreiz für zusätzliche Steuersatzanhebungen besteht. Die Studie quantifiziert die Effekte von Verhaltensreaktionen und zeigt in verschiedenen Szenarien das Zusammenspiel mit dem Länderfinanzausgleich auf.

H77|The Political Economy of Fiscal Supervision and Budget Deficits: Evidence from Germany|In many federal countries, local governments run large deficits, even when fiscal supervision by state authorities is tight. I investigate to which extent party alignment of governments and fiscal supervisors influences budget deficits. The dataset includes 427 German local governments for the period 2000-2004. I exploit a period after a far-reaching institutional reform that entirely re-distributed political powers on both the government level and the fiscal supervisor level. Results do not show that party alignments of governments and supervisors (co-partisanship) drive short-term deficits. Instead, I find that the ideology of partisan governments and supervisors matters: left-wing local governments run higher deficits than their right-wing counterparts; left-wing supervisors tolerate higher deficits than right-wing supervisors. These findings imply that political independence for fiscal supervisors is recommended.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H77|Electoral Externalities in Federations - Evidence from German Opinion Polls|Party performance in state and federal elections is highly interdependent. Federal elections impact regional voting dynamics and vice versa (electoral externalities). We quantify the extent of simultaneous electoral externalities between two layers of government. We apply vector autoregressions with predetermined variables to unique opinion poll data for the German state of Berlin and the federal level in Germany. State voting intentions for the state and for the federal parliament are the endogenous variables; the federal election trend is treated as predetermined. Our results suggest that shocks in federal parliament voting intention impact state parliament voting intention, but – as a new finding – to the same extent also vice versa. Externalities account for around 10% to 30% of variation at the other level of government. The effects differ across parties. Electoral externalities are less pronounced for the conservative party, but increase in times of government. The opposite holds true for left-wing parties.
H77|Do local governments tax homeowner communities differently?|"This paper investigates whether and how strongly the share of homeowners in a community affects residential property taxation by local governments. Different from renters, homeowners bear the full property tax burden irrespective of local market conditions, and the tax is more salient to them. ""Homeowner communities"" may hence oppose high property taxes in order to protect their housing wealth. Using granular spatial data from a complete housing inventory in the 2011 German Census and historical war damages as a source of exogenous variation in local homeownership, we provide empirical evidence that otherwise identical jurisdictions charge significantly lower property taxes when the share of homeowners in their population is higher. This result is invariant to local market conditions, which suggests tax salience as the key mechanism behind this effect. We find positive spatial dependence in tax multipliers, indicative of property tax mimicking by local governments."
H77|Policy diffusion and the competition for mobile resources|Reforms are often introduced in one region and afterwards adapted by other regions. This paper analyzes a model where policy diffusion can be explained by competition for mobile resources. I provide conditions under which initially symmetric regions realize reforms sequentially and a reform initiated in one region is afterwards adapted by another region. Forward-looking agents anticipate the policy convergence and respond less to the reform than the current difference in policies would imply.
H77|What Motivates French Pork: Political Career Concerns or Private Connections?|This paper uses the detailed curricula of French ministers and the detailed accounts of French municipalities to identify governmental investment grants targeted to specific jurisdictions. We distinguish between municipalities in which a politician held office before being appointed as a government's member and those in which current ministers lived during their childhood. We provide evidence that municipalities in which a minister held office during her career experience a 45% increase in the amount of discretionary investment subsidies they receive during the time the politician they are linked to serves as minister. In contrast, we do not find any evidence that subsidies flow to municipalities from which ministers originate. Additional evidence advocate in favour of a key role of network and knowledge accumulated through connections, illustrated by a persistence of the impact of intergovernmental ties.
H77|Winning Competitive Grants For Regional Development in Albania: The Role of Local Leaders|In post-socialist countries, regional development and decentralization has been a fast process accompanied by strong deregulation and significant institutional changes. Despite the reforms in Albania, local government units (LGUs) are often significantly underfunded, understaffed and depend heavily on grants from the central government. The focus of this study is the Regional Development Fund (RDF), a competitive investment fund which finances LGUs investments. We aim to analyze the factors influencing the LGU access to RDF funds, based on a survey with LGU leaders. Political affiliation of the LGU leader, networking and the knowledge the LGU leader about the RDF procedure are important factors affecting access to RDF funds. Interestingly, however, the factors that correlate with the number of applications are different from those that explain the success rate of those applications. Our findings call for a further institutionalization of the process in order to reduce the (informal) personal and political affiliation based influences in the RDF competition.
H77|The Shaping of a Settler Fertility Transition: Eighteenth and Nineteenth Century South African Demographic History Reconsidered|Using South African Families(SAF), a new database of settler genealogies, we provide for the first time, a description of female marital fertility in South Africa from 1700 to 1909. We find high and stable levels of fertility up to the mid-nineteenth century, typical of a pre-transition population, after which fertility declines. The usual correlates of a decline in fertility, namely, later starting and earlier stopping of childbearing, together with increased spacing between births, can be seen from the second half of the nineteenth century. The South African fertility transition mirrors to a large extent the pattern found in other settler communities, aswell as the European experience despite the somewhat different economic and social circumstances of the country, in particular relative to Europe.
H77|Artificial Administrative Boundaries: Evidence from China|What happens when subnational boundaries are badly drawn? We use China as a laboratory to investigate the rami cations. As Chinese provincial and long-standing socioeconomic boundaries are not fully aligned, counties of the same province may not share the same regional identity. Using Deng Xiaoping's eco-nomic liberalization campaign in 1991-92 to implement a difference-in-differences, we find that the annual growth differential between non-is located and dislocated counties increased by 3.1 percentage points after Deng's campaign galvanized the provinces to pursue economic expansion. We also uncover evidence of discrimination against the dislocated counties by the provincial authorities.

H77|The principle of subsidiarity and centripetal forces: 14 years of application of the 2001 Italian constitutional reform|The 2001 reform made profound changes to the Italian Constitution, which led to a broad transfer of legislative powers from the State to the regions. The paper analyses the division of legislative powers introduced in 2001 from two points of view: i) consistency with the indications of economic literature; and ii) the effect on the functioning of the institutional system. In some cases the changes enacted in 2001 do not seem to meet efficiency criteria. Regarding the effects on the institutional system, the reform does not appear to have had an impact on the amount of laws approved at the regional level. However, there was a substantial increase in litigation between the State and the regions before the Constitutional Court. Moreover, the decisions of the Constitutional Court have tended to circumscribe the exercise of regional legislative powers in order to ensure uniform rules and a homogeneous level of protection throughout the country.
H77|The Territorial Fiscal Gap in Colombia|This paper presents an estimation of expenditure needs and fiscal capacity of Colombia’s municipalities and departments in 2014. We use standard per capita norms to estimate the spending needs and data envelopment analysis for the local fiscal capacity. The results show that: (i) there are high horizontal fiscal disparities in Colombia, with greater incidence in municipalities than in departments; (ii) these disparities favor more developed territories; and (iii) there is evidence of a centerperiphery pattern in the horizontal fiscal disparities, causing central regions of the country to have a lower imbalance between expenditure needs and fiscal capacity. An equalization transfers system is an option for public policy to eliminate these disparities.
H77|Political Alignment in the Time of Weak Parties: Electoral Advantages and Subnational Transfers in Colombia|Este documento explora el efecto de alineación entre políticos locales y nacionales en un contexto de partidos débiles. Utilizando métodos de regresión discontinua en elecciones reñidas, encontramos que en ausencia de partidos fuertes, las coaliciones presidenciales se convierten en los ejes de la alineación política en Colombia. De hecho, mientras que los partidos políticos proveen muy pocas ventajas electorales a sus miembros, los candidatos de la coalición a posiciones nacionales obtienen muchos más votos en municipios gobernados por alcaldes alineados. A su vez, los alcaldes alineados reciben más transferencias discrecionales para financiar carreteras por parte del gobierno nacional. Estas transferencias, sin embargo, no se traducen en mayor crecimiento económico en los municipios. ******ABSTRACT: This paper explores the effect of alignment between local and national politics in a context of weak parties. Based on a regression discontinuity design in close elections, we find that, in absence of strong parties, presidential coalitions become the focal point of political alignment in Colombia. In fact, while parties provide almost no electoral advantages to their members, candidates aspiring to national positions get significantly more votes in municipalities governed by mayors aligned with the incoming presidential coalitions. In turn, aligned mayors receive additional discretionary transfers from the National Government to finance road investments. These discretionary transfers, however, do not translate into local economic growth.
H77|¿Hay pereza fiscal territorial en Colombia?|La descentralización colombiana fue profundizada por la Constitución Política de 1991, donde se establecieron las transferencias a los municipios y departamentos para financiar los gastos que debían asumir. Desde entonces los esquemas de transferencias han sido reformados y se argumenta que han generado pereza fiscal en los entes territoriales. A través de un modelo de dobles diferencias y un panel con efectos fijos, este documento evalúa la hipótesis de pereza fiscal en los municipios colombianos. La investigación discrimina por tipo de municipios y por los dos fondos de transferencias vigentes (SGP y SGR). Adicionalmente, cubre un periodo de tiempo más amplio que estudios previos, permitiendo observar los efectos de los cambios en los sistemas de transferencias. Los resultados muestran que, en el agregado, no hay evidencia de que el SGP y el SGR hayan afectado negativamente el recaudo municipal. Sin embargo, este comportamiento es diferencial por tipo y tamaño de la entidad territorial. Adicionalmente, el efecto positivo resulta ser menor con las regalías que con las transferencias del Situado Fiscal, participaciones municipales y SGP. *****ABSTRACT: Colombia's decentralization was extended by the Political Constitution of 1991, which established the formula to transfer funds for municipalities and departments to finance their own expenses. Since then, the transfer's systems have been reformed and it is argued that they have become a source of fiscal laziness in subnational governments. Through a model of double differences and fixed effects panel data, this document revises the hypothesis of fiscal laziness in Colombian municipalities. The analysis distinguishes between types of territorial entities and between the two current schemes of funds transferring (SGP and SGR). Further, this document covers a broader period of time than previous studies, hence, it illustrates the effects of changes in the systems through time. All in all, the results show that there is no evidence that the increasing intergovernmental transfers have affected municipal tax collections negatively. However, this pattern varies between types and sizes of territories. Additionally, the positive effect is lower in terms of royalties than for transfers from the Situado Fiscal, municipal shares, and the SGP.
H77|The dog that didn’t bark: on the effect of the Great Recession on the surge of secessionism|This paper explores the relationship between the economic turmoil generated by the Great Recession and the increase of secessionism in different regions of Western countries. Some authors have stressed that the Great Recession triggered profound changes in political attitudes and preferences and, in the context of a conflict between the centre and the periphery, fuelled secessionism as a radical shift of the institutional setup. Nevertheless, other researchers have remarked that a deep recession may make voters more accommodating with the status quo and more reluctant to take radical stances. Our paper aims at contributing to this debate by analyzing the case of Catalonia. We use the variation of economic variables and data from surveys and electoral outcomes at the level of municipalities to explore the relationship between the deterioration of the economic situation (that is, the local variation in the intensity of the crisis) and the increase of preferences for secession among the Catalan population. The findings from the analysis of our empirical models do not support the hypothesis that the heterogeneous effects of the Great Recession had any significant impact on political preferences at the level of municipality in Catalonia. These findings contribute to our understanding of the effects of hard economic times on people’s attitudes and behaviour.
H77|European Fiscal Compact in Action: Can Independent Fiscal Institutions Deliver Effective Oversight?|The paper explores if EU independent fiscal institutions (IFIs) are in a position to exercise effective scrutiny over national fiscal policies. It identifies substantial heterogeneity across IFIs in resources which is not matched by a similar diversity in mandates, and highlights the role of local ownership as a potentially important factor in explaining this. In addition to financial and human resources, better access to information, effective comply-or-explain mechanisms and closer links with legislatures could enhance fiscal scrutiny and accountability in the EU. The paper provides rankings of individual IFIs constructed based on measures that quantitatively aggregate these pre-conditions for effective fiscal scrutiny.
H77|Effect of central transfers on municipalities' own revenue mobilization: Do conflict and local revenue management matter?|This paper analyzes the effect of the transfers from central government to municipalities on the revenue mobilization by municipalities in Côte d'Ivoire over the period 2001-2014. The analysis is based on a new carefully-constructed dataset covering the conflict and post conflict periods for 115 municipalities. A two-stage least squares estimator is combined with the Grouped Fixed Effects estimator to address a potential endogeneity bias and to allow for unobserved heterogeneity varying over time. The results show a statistically significant and positive effect of central transfers on revenue mobilization by municipalities for both tax revenue and non-tax revenue. The effect of transfers is found to be higher for tax revenue than for non-tax revenue. The conflict eroded the capacity of municipalities to raise revenue. During the conflict, a 10 percent increase in transfers is associated with a 3.3 percent increase in revenue mobilized by municipalities, while this increase reaches 5.9 percent after the conflict.
H77|Foreign Aid in Areas of Limited Statehood|We review the aid effectiveness literature to assess whether foreign aid given to areas of limited statehood can be expected to promote economic and social outcomes in the recipient country. We distinguish different types of aid, motives for granting it, recipient country policies and characteristics, and modalities by which aid is delivered, as these factors have been argued to influence the effectiveness of aid. In short, aid is most likely to be successful if given for non-strategic motives, and if given to recipient countries with “good” policies and democratic institutions. Fragmented aid and aid amounts that exceed the absorptive capacity of the recipient reduce the effectiveness of aid. We then compare these properties between recipients most affected by limited statehood and those least affected. This allows us to assess the relative effectiveness of aid in countries with areas of limited statehood. We conclude that on average aid given there is less likely to be effective than elsewhere.
H77|Electoral Externalities in Federations - Evidence from German Opinion Polls|Der Erfolg von Parteien unterschiedlicher politischer Ebenen ist stark voneinander abhängig. Föderale Wahlen beeinflussen regionale Wahlentscheidungen und umgekehrt (Wahlexternalitäten).

Wahlexternalitäten erklären zwischen 10% und 30% der Variation der jeweils anderen politischen Ebene. Die Effekte sind höchst heterogen zwischen den Parteien.
H77|The Intricacy of Adapting to Climate Change: Flood Protection as a Local Public Goods Game|We study adaptation to climate change in a federalist setting. To protect themselves against an increase in flood risk, regional governments choose among adaptation measures that vary with respect to their costs, the level of protection they offer, and the presence and nature of spillovers to neighboring regions. The central government can provide co-funding in response to specific proposals. If it has to deduce the vulnerability of regions by their actions, the resulting adaptation measures are too costly from a social point of view. The results show that adaptation cannot be expected to be efficient without specifically designed incentive schemes.
H77|Partisan Determinants of Federal Highway Grants|Using data on federal highway grants from the Department of Transportation’s Federal High- way Administration, this paper investigates several questions regarding the political economy of highway funding. We investigate the period 1994 - 2008 and examine whether political align- ment and political ideology play a role in determining how much highway funding per capita a state receives. We find evidence that Republican-dominated House of Representatives del-egations receive more highway funding per capita compared to Democrats, especially in rural states. We also find that senators in the party of the president are able to secure more highway funding per capita. Overall, the distribution of highway spending over this time period appears to have been determined by political rather than deterministic considerations and in a way that is consistent with how the Interstate Highway System has distributed Republican voters to rural areas.
H77|Tax Mimicking in Local Business Taxation: Quasi-experimental Evidence from Portugal|I exploit an exogenous reform introducing a local business tax in Portugal to study tax mimicking among jurisdictions. The identiï¬ cation strategy relies on a quasi-experimental diï¬€erence-in-diï¬€erences methodology and heterogeneity in treatment intensity. Results provide evidence of signiï¬ cant short-run tax mimicking that decreases over time. I study possible generating processes underlying the strategic interaction among municipalities and ï¬ nd signiï¬ cant evidence of electoral concerns. These electoral concerns are not met with electoral consequences at the local elections, which may be behind the diï¬€usion of local business taxation in the long run.

H77|Descentralización (y centralización) sin representación: a propósito de la composición territorial del congreso colombiano|Este artículo explora la composición territorial del Congreso bicameral colombiano en las legislaturas del período 1991-2018. Ilustra la prevalencia y persistencia del fenómeno de los Departamentos sin senador, que ha afectado a jurisdicciones pequeñas y medianas en tamaño de población. Muestra que la composición de la Cámara de Representantes y la del Senado tienden a duplicarse, con predominio de las entidades territoriales más pobladas. Arguye que las reglas de composición del Senado no son inclusivas territorialmente y que conducen a una concentración geográfica excesiva del poder político, desaprovechando las posibilidades que ofrece el bicameralismo como mecanismo de balance de poderes en una democracia. Los problemas de representación política territorial en el centro no son intrascendentes: es allí donde se forja el marco legal de la descentralización y la centralización. El escrito analiza algunas propuestas y medidas dirigidas a encararlos. *** This paper explores the territorial composition of the Colombian bicameral Congress in the legislatures of the period 1991-2018. It illustrates the prevalence and persistence of the phenomenon of Departments without a Senator, which has affected small and medium-sized jurisdictions in population. It shows that the composition of the House of Representatives and that of the Senate tend to be similar, with predominance of the most populous territorial entities. It argues that the rules of composition of the Senate are not territorially inclusive and lead to an excessive geographical concentration of political power, missing out on the possibilities offered by bicameralism as a balance of power mechanism in a democracy. The problems of territorial political representation in the center are not inconsequential: It is there where the legal framework of decentralization and centralization is forged. The paper discusses some proposals and measures aimed at addressing such problems.

H77|The Survival and Demise of the State: A Dynamic Theory of Secession|This paper describes the repeated interaction between groups in a country as a repeated Stackelberg bargaining game, where conflict and secessions can happen on the equilibrium path due to commitment problems. If a group out of power is sufficiently small and their contribution to total surplus is not too large, then the group in power can always maintain peace with an agreeable surplus sharing offer every period. When there is a mismatch between relative size and relative surplus contribution of the minority group, conflict can occur. While in the static model secession can occur only as peaceful outcome, in the infinite horizon game with high discount factor conflict followed by secession can occur. We discuss our full characterization of equilibrium outcomes in light of the available empirical evidence.
H77|Tax Federalism And Cooperative Games: Stability Analysis|This paper is devoted to analyzing the problem of how to distribute the public spending among the different regions of a country once all taxes are collected. We model the problem as a cooperative game in coalitional form. For that purpose, we need to specify how much tax is collected in every region (and coalition of regions) in the country under secession. In this way, we obtain the tax game of the problem, and its core is given by the set of stable tax allocations. Following such an approach, we are able to analyze the stability of a tax financing system. The Spanish case is considered and we show that the present regional financial system is unstable from this perspective.
H77|Tax Federalism and Cooperative Games: Value Approach|We model the problem of how to distribute the public spending between the different regions of a country once all taxes are collected as a cooperative game in coalitional form. A tax game is built, specifying how much tax is collected in every region and coalition of regions in the country under secession. In this paper we propose two tax rules: the balanced tax rule, and the redistributive balanced tax rule. Both rules have the property of being stable for every tax problem, as they belong to the core of the tax game. The Spanish case is considered as example. We compare their redistributive behavior with the present Spanish financial system, with the population egalitarian, and with the optimistic secession tax rules.
H77|Public Expenditures and Debt at the Subnational Level: Evidence of Fiscal Smoothing from Argentina|This paper uses the particular features of the tax-sharing regime Coparticipación Federal de Impuestos and the fact that some provinces earn hydrocarbon royalties to investigate public expenditures and debt at the subnational level in Argentina. We obtain that facing a one peso increase in intergovernmental transfers, provinces spend on average 36 cents in public expenditures with no changes in public debt. On the other hand, when royalties increase one peso, 59 cents are used to pay back public debt while public expenditures are not affected. These results, which are robust to many different specifications of the basic regressions, suggest a non-negligeable expenditure/debt smoothing behavior of Argentine provinces.
H77|Trade Facilitation And Customs Control: An Examination Of Main Customs Of Baja California, Facilitacion Comercial Y Control Aduanero En Las Principales Aduanas De Baja California|General Management Customs in Mexico plays a pivotal role in international trade, given the rise of globalization in which economies are increasingly interconnected. A balance between trade facilitation and customs control are essential for a good external performance. The Customs Modernization Plan 2007-2012, defined three strategies: more efficient customs operations, increase compliance with the obligations of trade and national security. The aim of this paper is to review implementation of the main customs of Baja California, according to “Customs Modernization Plan 2007-2012. We wish to understand the balance between the trade facilitation and the customs control. Nine interviews were completed, three experts in customs matters, three operating sub-managers and the three brokers associations in Ensenada, Tijuana and Mexicali. We conclude that the Customs Modernization Plan 2007-2012 has not yet fully developed, Continuous changes are required since offenders are continually updated so they can insert o removed smuggled items into the country

Through three indicators (own revenue, dependency and debt) and according to the degree of marginalization, the results show that the level of dependence increases for all municipalities in the study period, especially in the municipalities of very high marginalization however, in municipalities with lower degree of marginalization also increase the proportion of external financing
H77|Globalization and Political Structure|Globalization is rapidly changing economic borders and yet political borders change only slowly. In this paper we study the nature and consequences of this growing mismatch. We show that globalization requires a political structure that redistributes power away from the centralized jurisdictions or states and towards a new set of overlapping jurisdictions that are both larger and smaller than existing states. Our theory suggests that globalization provides a simple yet powerful explanation for the rise of large nation-states followed by the creation of international authorities (such as the EU) together with a process of political fragmentation within states.

H77|On the determinants of fiscal non-compliance: an empirical analysis of spain’s regions|This paper proposes an empirical framework that distinguishes between voluntary and involuntary compliance with fiscal deficit targets on the basis of economic, institutional and political factors. The framework is applied to Spain’s Autonomous Communities (regions) over the period 2002-2015. Fiscal non-compliance among Spain’s regions has proven persistent. It increases with the size of growth forecasting errors and the extent to which fiscal targets are tightened, factors not fully under the control of regional governments. Non-compliance also tends to increase during election years, when vertical fiscal imbalances become accentuated, and market financing costs subside. Strong fiscal rules have not shown any significant impact on containing fiscal noncompliance. Reducing fiscal non-compliance in multi-level governance systems such as Spain’s requires a comprehensive assessment of inter-governmental fiscal arrangements that looks beyond rules-based frameworks by ensuring enforcement procedures are politically credible.

H77|Federalismo municipale e nuovo sistema perequativo: il Fondo di solidarietà comunale 2016|La legge delega sul federalismo fiscale n. 42 del 2009, in coerenza con il titolo V della Costituzione riformato nel 2001, ha previsto il superamento della spesa storica quale criterio principale per il finanziamento erariale dei servizi forniti dai comuni e la sua sostituzione con l’assegnazione di entrate proprie che, unitamente ai trasferimenti perequativi, devono essere sufficienti per garantire lo svolgimento delle funzioni comunali, in particolare per le spese dovute per le cosiddette funzioni fondamentali. Dalla legge delega fino all’inizio dell’applicazione del riparto perequativo nel 2015, l’intera materia del federalismo municipale ha conosciuto importanti sviluppi, spesso in chiara contraddizione con il disegno delineato dalla legge delega stessa. Lo schema di riparto in base a fabbisogni e capacità fiscali standard, applicato già al Fondo di solidarietà comunale nel 2015 e 2016, dovrebbe divenire, nel giro di pochi anni, il definitivo meccanismo perequativo per i comuni delle regioni a statuto ordinario. Si tratta di uno schema di perequazione “orizzontale” che segue criteri misti (fabbisogni e capacità fiscali), alimentato esclusivamente dai comuni, che per una parte è destinata alle funzioni fondamentali e per la rimanente parte agisce per ridurre le differenze territoriali in termini di capacità fiscale pro capite. Data la rilevanza del processo di riforma in corso, l’obiettivo principale di questo lavoro è analizzare lo schema di riparto mettendo in chiara luce il suo modus operandi e quantificare i suoi effetti redistributivi anche considerando alcuni scenari di modifica allo schema attuale, con l’auspicio di contribuire al dibattito politico e scientifico.
H77|Equalization transfers and convergence between federal and unitary systems: a contribution to their historical analysis|Equalization transfers, or grants, are a crucial component of modern federal and unitary countries. They also shape the evolution of different political systems promoting convergence in their effective working. The literature does not provide studies with a long-term and comparative perspective despite the relevance of this approach to the study of intergovernmental relations. The paper provides a contribution aimed at filling this void. It considers a small set of countries, including two unitary systems, Italy and the UK with a focus on English local government and three federal countries, Australia, Canada, and the United States. Federal systems are paying now more attention than initially to uniformity of policies and equality of access to the benefits of public policies, while unitary systems show now much more attention than in the past to reaching equality of access and benefits from policies through local autonomy and use of transparent intergovernmental grants, rather than with hierarchical command. Another way of illustrating this process is stressing the growing recognition of common citizenship in both federal and unitary states.
H77|Tax competition among U.S. states: Racing to the bottom or riding on a seesaw?|Dramatic declines in capital tax rates among U.S. states and European countries have been linked by many commentators to tax competition, an inevitable “race to the bottom,” and underprovision of local public goods. This paper analyzes the reaction of capital tax policy in a given U.S. state to changes in capital tax policy by other states. Our study is undertaken with a novel panel data set covering the 48 contiguous U.S. states for the period 1965 to 2006 and is guided by the theory of strategic tax competition. The latter suggests that capital tax policy is a function of “foreign” (out-of-state) tax policy, preferences for government services, and home state and foreign state economic and demographic conditions. The slope of the reaction function – the equilibrium response of home state to foreign state tax policy – is negative, contrary to casual evidence and many prior empirical studies of fiscal reaction functions. This result, which stands in contrast to most published findings, is due to two critical elements that allow for delayed responses to foreign tax changes and responses to aggregate shocks. Omitting either of these elements leads to a misspecified model and a positively sloped reaction function. Our results suggest that the secular decline in capital tax rates, at least among U.S. states, reflects synchronous responses among states to common shocks rather than competitive responses to foreign state tax policy. While striking given prior empirical findings, these results are fully consistent with the implications of the theoretical model developed in this paper and presented elsewhere in the literature. Rather than “racing to the bottom,” our findings suggest that states are “riding on a seesaw.” Consequently, tax competition may lead to an increase in the provision of local public goods, and policies aimed at restricting tax competition to stem the tide of declining capital taxation are likely to be ineffective.
H77|Why not fully spend a conditional block grant?|Abstract This paper studies a conditional block grant that Dutch municipalities receive for welfare-to-work programs. Many municipalities do not fully use this grant, although programs are beneficial for them. We argue that municipalities incur expenses to use the grant. If these costs are substantial, then it is optimal not to fully use the grant. Based on municipality-specific data on grants and actual expenditures, we estimate that municipalities have to add about 90 cents from their own resources to spend 1 euro of the grant. As a result, the conditional block grant is de facto a closed-ended matching grant.
H77|Information sharing, neighborhood demarcation, and yardstick competition: an empirical analysis of intergovernmental expenditure interaction in Japan|Abstract The Japanese government provides information on local fiscal performance through the Fiscal Index Tables for Similar Municipalities (FITS-M). The FITS-M categorize municipalities into groups of “similar localities” and provide them with the fiscal indices of their group members, enabling municipalities to use the tables to identify their “neighbors” (i.e., those in the same FITS-M group) and refer to their fiscal information as a “yardstick” for fiscal planning. We take advantage of this system to estimate municipal spending function. In particular, we examine whether the FITS-M help identify a defensible spatial weights matrix that properly describes municipal spending interactions. Our analysis shows that they do. In particular, geographical proximity is significant only between a pair of municipalities within a given FITS-M group, and it does not affect competition between pairs belonging to different groups even if they are located close to each other. This would suggest that the FITS-M work as intended, indicating that spending interaction among Japanese municipalities originates from yardstick competition and not from other types of fiscal competition.
H77|Vickrey Meets Alonso: Commute Scheduling and Congestion in a Monocentric City|This paper studies the interaction between dynamic traffic congestion and urban spatial equilibrium, using a model that is a straight unification of the Vickrey (1969) bottleneck congestion model and the Alonso (1964) monocentric city model. In a monocentric city with a bottleneck at the entrance to the CBD, residents choose their commute departure time jointly with residential location and housing consumption. Commuters arrive at the bottleneck in sequence sorted by residential location, so that more distant residents arrive later. The socially optimal toll makes central residents commute earlier in the morning than they would without the toll, which in turn induces a city that is less dense in the center and more dense further out. This is the opposite effect of what is found in models with static congestion.
H77|Term limits for mayors and intergovernmental grants: Evidence from Italian cities|We investigate how term limits for mayors influence central government transfers to municipalities. Estimates are based on a dataset of Italian cities over the 1998–2010 period. To credibly identify the influence of term limits, our estimations include mayor fixed effects. We also consider intra-term differences in intergovernmental grants. We provide evidence that electoral incentives distort rather than discipline incumbent mayors’ behavior because transfers are higher before an election with an eligible incumbent, in line with the political budget cycle literature. This evidence is also consistent with the idea that the allocation of intergovernmental grants is influenced by lobbying on the part of eligible local government officeholders, as in Borck and Owings (2003).
H77|The Effect of Supranational Banking Supervision on the Financial Sector: Event Study Evidence from Europe|This paper investigates how the introduction of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, the European Union’s implementation of harmonized banking supervision, has affected the banking sector in Europe. I perform an event study on banks’ stock returns and find evidence for small but significant positive effects. A potential hypothesis for this result is the fact that a single supervisory authority can take spillover effects between countries into account and is therefore able to stabilize the European banking sector. Splitting the sample by an indicator for supervisory power, an indicator for corruption and by Debt/GDP reveals that the positive impact of the SSM was stronger for banks in countries that perform poorly with respect to these measures.
H77|What drives the substitutability between native and foreign workers? Evidence about the role of language|This paper investigates the role of language in determining the degree of substitutability between foreign and native workers. To this end, we focus on Switzerland, an immigration-receiving country with four official languages spoken, three of which in common with bordering countries. We modify the model proposed by Ottaviano and Peri (2012) to account for the linguistic background of native and immigrant workers. We find that language plays a central role in determining the elasticity of substitution between foreign and native workers and accounts for much of their imperfect substitutability. These findings are robust to a number of robustness checks, such as different specifications of the model structure and the inclusion of cross-border workers. Then, we compute the total wage change for native and foreign workers caused by new immigration in flows. In the long run, the average percentage wage changes for native and foreign workers are quite small and not significant.
H77|The Emergence of Inter-Municipal Cooperation – A Hazard Model Approach|We use a hazard model to identify the factors that drive the emergence of inter-municipal cooperation (IMC). We focus on IMC in tasks of internal administration in West-Germany between 2001 and 2014 – tasks where IMC may generate economies of scale while regional spillovers are negligible. Our results support the homophily-hypothesis and the relevance of political transaction costs. Municipalities situated in clusters of small and shrinking municipalities are more likely to start IMC. At odds with the previous literature, IMC is more likely to emerge among municipalities in fiscally strong clusters. We find no evidence that IMC is more likely in certain phases of the election cycle while state subsidies for IMC are an important driving force behind IMC.
H77|Financing Central Cities: The Economics Underlying Fiscal Strategy Options With Special Reference to Syracuse City and the Consensus Report|A consortium of Syracuse City and Onondaga County governments along with a number of local area non-profit organizations have recently organized a commission on Local Government Modernization for the Syracuse area. The Report makes three major recommendation to strengthen the local public sector in the Syracuse region: seek opportunities to share public services across local jurisdictions to reduce costs, adopt the Minneapolis region model for sharing revenues from new commercial and industrial development across localities, and work toward merging Syracuse City government with Onondaga County government. At the same time, current non-city residents would not have responsibility for the city or school district’s legacy debts or post-employment benefit obligations. The working paper reviews the urban economics and local public finance literature in the context of fiscal viability of central cities. Central cities form the heart of knowledge-based economies and those benefits redound to the entire region in the form of higher property values and incomes. In addition, suburban enclaves have developed in part through discriminatory policies and practices at the federal and local levels and they have weakened the fiscal viabilities of central cities. It also reviews the relevant local public finance literature on city annexation and government mergers, optimally sized jurisdictions, non-profit entities’ payments in lieu of taxes in cities, efficient local government taxes, and related topics. Based on the review, the economic development of a region depends on the economic and fiscal sustainability of its central city. Suburban resident benefit in tangible ways from the economic activities in their respective cities and suburban areas could reasonably devote a portion of their tax base to enhance the resources available to the city to service the city’s legacy debts and other obligations. The working paper concludes with fiscal implications for Syracuse City and its metropolitan area.
H77|Fiscal Sustainability of the German Länder: Time-Series Evidence|We analyze the sustainability of public finances in the 16 states (Länder ) of the Federal Republic of Germany, using an unprecedentedly comprehensive fiscal data set covering the period from 1950 to 2011 for West German Länder and from 1991 to 2011 for East German Länder . We extend the existing literature in that we apply unit-root and stationarity tests not only to debt but also to expenditure and revenue and explore their long-run relation in cointegration analyses for each Land . The results provide evidence against strict fiscal sustainability in a majority of German Länder . A notable exception to this finding is Bavaria.
H77|Implications of Medicaid Financing Reform for State Government Budgets|"We analyze potential reforms to Medicaid financing through the lens of fiscal federalism. Because substantial dollars are at stake, both the economic and political sides of intergovernmental transfers have high relevance in this setting. We show that changes in Medicaid financing formulas can shift amounts exceeding several hundred dollars per capita from ""winning"" states to ""losing"" states. In some cases, these amounts exceed 10% of states' own-source revenues. States' balanced budget requirements imply that such changes would, if not phased in gradually, require significant budgetary adjustment over short time horizons. We next show that alternative Medicaid financing structures have significant implications for states' exposure to budgetary stress during recessions. During the Great Recession, an acyclical block-grant structure would have increased states' shortfalls by 2-3.5% of own-source revenues relative to either an explicitly countercyclical block grant or the current matching system. Finally, we assess the implications of several financing structures for the extent to which they subsidize states' decisions on both the ""extensive"" and ""intensive"" margins of coverage generosity over the short and long term."
