Q00|The Fossil Energy Interlude: Optimal Building, Maintaining and Scraping a Dedicated Capital, and the Hotelling Rule|It is well known that the price and consumption paths of most nonrenewable resources, including the fossil primary energies, do not follow the paths predicted by the standard Hotelling rule (Krautkraemer,1998, Gaudet, 2007). We develop a model in which a dedicated capital together with the fossil fuel are both required to produce useful energy. Starting from a state of the economy in which the fossil fuel is not yet exploited, we characterize the optimal path of the double transition: The first transition from the initial renewable energy regime to a mixed or full fossil fuel regime and later the second transition from the fossil fuel regime back to a renewable energy regime when the available stock of the fossil fuel becomes more and more rare. We show that, absent any technical progress, the useful energy price must first decrease, next be constant during the phase of maximum expansion of the fossil fuel energy consumption before entering the phase of decreasing use of the fossil energy. Only this third phase of decreasing fossil fuel consumption looks like a standard Hotelling path.
Q00|Energy Conversion Rate Improvements, Pollution Abatement Efforts and Energy Mix: The Transition toward the Green Economy under a Pollution Stock constraint|To prevent climate change, three options are currently considered: improve the energy conversion efficiency of primary energy sources, develop carbon free alternatives to polluting fossil fuels and abate potential emissions before they are released inside the atmosphere. We study the optimal mix and timing of these three mitigation options in a stylized dynamic model. Useful energy can come from two sources: a non-renewable fossil fuel resource and a carbon free renewable resource. The conversion efficiency rate of fossil energy into useful energy is open to choice but higher conversion rates are also more costly. The economy can abate some fraction of its potential emissions and a higher abatement rate incurs higher costs. The society objective is to maintain below some mandated level, or carbon cap, the atmospheric carbon concentration. In the empirically relevant case where the economy is actually constrained by the cap, at least temporarily, we show that the optimal path is a sequence of four regimes: a 'pre-ceiling' regime before the economy is actually constrained by the cap, a 'ceiling' regime at the cap, a 'post-ceiling' regime below the cap and a final regime of exclusive exploitation of renewable resources. If the abatement option has ever to be used, it should be started before the beginning of the ceiling regime, first at an increasing rate and at a decreasing rate once the cap constraint binds. The efficiency performance from any source steadily improves with the exception of a time phase under the ceiling regime when it is constant. Renewables take progressively a larger share of the energy mix but their exploitation may be delayed significantly. Absolute levels of carbon emissions drop down continuously but follow a non monotonic pattern in per useful energy unit relative terms.
Q00|Optimization of age-structured bioeconomic model: recruitment, weight gain and environmental effects|More and more fishery researchers begin to acknowledge that one-dimensional biomass models may omit key information when generating management guidelines. For the more complicated age-structured models, numerous parameters require a proper estimation or a reasonable assumption. In this paper, the effects of recruitment patterns and environmental impacts on the optimal exploitation of a fish population are investigated. Based on a discrete-time age-structured bioeconomic model of Northeast Atlantic mackerel, we introduce the mechanisms that generate 6 scenarios of the problem. Using the simplest scenario, optimizations are conducted under 8 different parameter combinations. Then, the problem is solved for each scenario and simulations are conducted with constant fishing mortalities. It is found that a higher environmental volatility leads to more net profits but with a lower probability of achieving the mean values. Any parameter combination that favours the older fish tends to lend itself to pulse fishing pattern. The simulations indicate that a constant fishing mortality around 0.06 performs the best. A comparison between the optimal and the historical harvest shows that for more than 70% of the time, the optimal exploitation precedes the historical one, leading to 43% higher net profit and 34% lower fishing cost.
Q00|Greed is good: from super-harvest to recovery in a stochastic predator-prey system|This paper demonstrates a predator-prey system of cod and capelin that confronts a possible scenario of prey extinction under the first-best policy in a stochastic world. We discover a novel ‘super-harvest’ phenomenon that the optimal harvest of the predator is even higher than the myopic policy, or the ‘greedy solution’, on part of the state space. This intrinsic attempt to harvest more predator to protect the prey is a critical evidence supporting the idea behind ‘greed is good’. We ban prey harvest and increase predator harvest in a designated state space area based on the optimal policy. Three heuristic recovery plans are generated following this principle. We employ stochastic simulations to analyse the probability of prey recovery and evaluate corresponding costs in terms of value loss percentage. We find that the alternative policies enhance prey recovery rates mostly around the area of 50% recovery probability under the optimal policy. When we scale up the predator harvest by 1.5, the prey recovery rate escalates for as much as 28% at a cost of 5% value loss. We establish two strategies: modest deviation from the optimal on a large area or intense measure on a small area. It seems more cost-effective to target the stock space with accuracy than to simply boost predator harvest when the aim is to achieve remarkable improvement of prey recovery probability.
Q00|Overview on rural poverty in developed countries|Despite the long tradition of intervention, rural poverty is still an important issue to face in the economic and social growth of developed countries. Often hidden for many reason recalled in the paper, rural poverty is transmitted by the cumulative negative effects of vicious circle of labour market, demography, education and remoteness. Agricultural and rural policy with social policy has reached important result for reducing rural poverty in developed countries, especially promoting diversification of rural area and sustainability approach to the production. The paper underlines the role of coordination between top-down and place-based policies, as well as the indicators for adapting policies and having successful intervention, shortly discussing some examples of good practices

Good digital practices in the furniture manufacturers are also presented, and some opportunities for development of the Forest industry entities are suggested."
Q00|The influence of environment regulation on marine economy efficiency: evidence from China|With the depletion of terrestrial resources and the development of marine science and technology, marine economy has become a new growth pole in the world economic development. After more than ten years of hard work, many coastal areas have seen significant improvements in their ecological environment. As an important marine country, China is not an exception. To analyze the influence of eco-environment governance policies on marine economy, this paper quantifies the relationship between environmental regulation and marine economic efficiency for 11 provinces (or municipalities) in China's coastal areas. The Super-Efficiency Slacks-Based Measure (SE-SBM) model is used to illustrate the marine economic efficiency considering undesired outputs. The results of the system Generalized Moment Method (GMM) regression support a U-shaped relationship between the two variables, with one threshold effect of the environmental regulation intensity. It is also verified the implementation of the environmental regulation policy has a time-lag effect. During the process of implementation, industrial structure optimization, scientific and technological innovation have different impacts on marine economy. The paper concludes with detailed explanation for the effects of environmental regulation and policy on marine economy development in China. Policymakers can use these insights to formulate appropriate environment policies that aim to realize marine ecological civilization.
Q00|Energy Conversion Rate Improvements, Pollution Abatement Efforts and Energy Mix: The Transition toward the Green Economy under a Pollution Stock Constraint|To prevent climate change, three options are currently considered: improve the energy conversion efficiency of primary energy sources, develop carbon free alternatives to polluting fossil fuels and abate potential emissions before they are released inside the atmosphere.

Q00|Guns, Environment, and Abortion: How Single-Minded Voters Shape Politicians' Decisions|We study how electoral incentives affect policy choices on secondary issues, which only minorities of voters care intensely about. We develop a model in which office and policy motivated politicians choose to support or oppose regulations on these issues. We derive conditions under which politicians flip-flop, voting according to their policy preferences at the beginning of their terms, but in line with the preferences of single-issue minorities as they approach re-election. To assess the evidence, we study U.S. senators' votes on gun control, environment, and reproductive rights. In line with our model's predictions, election proximity has a pro-gun effect on Democratic senators and a pro-environment effect on Republican senators. These effects only arise for non-retiring senators, who represent states where the single-issue minority is of intermediate size. Also in line with our theory, election proximity has no impact on senators' decisions on reproductive rights, because of the presence of single-issue minorities on both sides.
Q00|Prices versus Quantities Reassessed|“Prices versus quantities” (Weitzman 1974), a hugely influential paper, is widely cited (and taught) in current debates about the best policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The paper’s criterion for ranking policies suggests that technological uncertainty favors taxes over cap and trade. Weitzman models a flow pollutant, but greenhouse gases are persistent. Stock pollutants require a fundamental change in the ranking criterion. Innovations’ persistence and their gradual diffusion both favor the use of cap and trade. Numerical results show that the case for cap and trade as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions is stronger than widely believed.
Q00|Seasonality matters: a multi-season, multi-state dynamic optimization in fishery|Many biological and economic processes in fishery happen seasonally. Most of the extant literature tends to neglect this fact. This work is an initial attempt to treat seasonality in a systematic and proper way. We apply a periodic Bellman approach to obtain the optimal feedback policy of each season. Our approach has rich potentials. It could deal with seasonal patterns of uneven lengths: some may span years and some within the year. We find that, in some cases the equilibrium consists of one harvesting season followed by a moratorium period, indicating an optimal closure of the fishery that would be overlooked by a yearly model. Unlike a typical policy that enforces a moratorium to recover the stock, we find that many states first undergo harvesting all year round and later evolve into the seasonal moratorium. A rising group biomass could be the overshooting effect instead of a clear sign to increase harvest. We sometimes observe declining optimal harvest with increasing states (‘valley’), which may relate to the unit profit difference between seasons. Fishing pressure on the mature elicits even heavier harvest in the next season on the same group. A protective moratorium of the immature seems to hinder the value of the whole stock.
Q00|Flow-Based Market Coupling in the European Electricity Market – A Comparison of Efficiency and Feasibility|In May 2015, the Flow-Based Market Coupling (FBMC) model replaced the Available Transfer Capacity (ATC) model in Central Western Europe to determine the power transfers between countries or price areas. The FBMC model aims to enhance market integration and to better monitor the physical power flows. The FBMC model is expected to lead to increased social welfare in the day-ahead market and more frequent price convergence between different market areas. This paper gives a discussion of the procedures of market clearing and a mathematical formulation of the FBMC model. Moreover, we discuss the relationships between the nodal pricing, ATC, and FBMC models. In addition to an illustrative 3-node example, we examine the FBMC model in two test systems and show the difficulties in implementing the model in practice. We find that a higher social surplus in the day-ahead market may come at the cost of more re-dispatching in real time. We also find that the FBMC model might fail to relieve network congestion and better utilize the power resources, even when compared to the ATC model.
Q00|The Flow-Based Market Coupling Model and the Bidding Zone Configuration|In May 2015, the Flow-Based Market Coupling (FBMC) model replaced the Available Transfer Capacity (ATC) model in Central Western Europe to determine the power transfer among bidding zones in the day-ahead market. It might be easier to change the bidding zone configuration in the FBMC model than in the ATC model as the FBMC model does not need to determine the maximum trading volume between two bidding zones. In our study, we run a simulation in the IEEE RTS 24-bus test system and examine how the bidding zone configurations affect the performance of both the FBMC and ATC models. We show that by improving the zone configuration, the FBMC model outperform the ATC in terms of reducing the re-dispatching cost only when the systems operators have a higher level of cooperation in the real-time market. Our results also indicate that better cooperation among the system operators would help to reduce the need for load shedding.
Q00|The Green Paradox and learning by doing|Production of a renewable substitute to fossil fuels is modeled as causing the cost of this backstop technology to fall over time in proportion to the scale of the substitute production and how long it has been in use. The unit cost of resource extraction is assumed to rise as the stock is depleted, so learning by doing will increase the reserves permanently left in the ground. The green paradox can nevertheless be present, in the sense that the resource extraction path can initially lie above what it would be in the absence of a parallel production of renewable energy. In a monopolistic market, the resource monopolist’s optimal price path is two-phased, even with inelastic demand. In the limit-pricing phase, the price is falling, due to the progressive learning by doing effect, and the extraction path is rising.
Q00|Global temperature, R&D expenditure, and growth|We shed new light on the macroeconomic effects of rising temperatures. In the data, a shock to global temperature dampens expenditures in research and development (R&D). We rationalize this empirical evidence within a stochastic endogenous growth model, featuring temperature risk and growth sustained through innovations. In line with the novel evidence in the data, temperature shocks undermine economic growth via a drop in R&D. Moreover, in our endogenous growth setting temperature risk generates non-negligible welfare costs (i.e., 11% of lifetime utility). An active government, which is committed to a zero fiscal deficit policy, can offset the welfare costs of global temperature risk by subsidizing the aggregate capital investment with one-fifth of total public spending.
Q00|Relationship-specificity, incomplete contracts, and the pattern of trade: a comment on the role of natural resources|In his seminal paper, (2007) finds that countries with good contract enforcement have a comparative advantage and, therefore, specialize in exporting goods for which relationship- specific investments are most important. We argue that this result cannot be extrapolated to all industries: there is substantial heterogeneity regarding the effect of contract enforcement on exports. In particular, we empirically demonstrate that there is a disconnection between judicial quality and exporting in relationship-specific natural resource related industries. Due to the lack of input factor mobility, for such industries, the quality of contract enforcement cannot explain the pattern of trade, but rather other factors that are widely discussed in the literature. We discuss some relevant implications of this disconnection between judicial quality and relationship-specific industries in terms of the natural resource curse and the impact of natural resources trade on economic development.
Q00|A Multi-dimensional Measure of Environmental Behavior: Exploring the Predictive Power of Connectedness to Nature, Ecological Worldview and Environmental Concern|Abstract In this study we examine the multi-dimensional structure of environmental behavior and its potential domains. Factor analysis reveals six behavioral domains: civic actions, policy support, recycling, transportation choices, behaviors in a household setting and consumerism. We use the Connectedness to Nature and Inclusion of Nature in Self scales to measure connection with nature, the New Environmental Paradigm to measure ecological worldviews, and Environmental Motives Scale to assess people’s environmental concern. We further explore the predictive power of connectedness to nature, ecological worldview, and environmental concern for explaining the diverse behavioral domains. Connectedness to nature and ecological worldview were more predictive of civic actions, recycling, household behaviors, and consumerism than were environmental concerns. In the case of policy support and transportation choices, environmental concerns explained more variance than the other constructs.
Q00|Mathematics vs. Statistics in tackling Environmental Economics uncertainty|In this paper the appropriate background in Mathematics and Statistics is considered in developing methods to investigate Risk Analysis problems associated with Environmental Economics uncertainty. New senses of uncertainty are introduced and a number of sources of uncertainty are discussed and presented. The causes of uncertainty are recognized helping to understand how they affect the adopted policies and how important their management is in any decision-making process. We show Mathematical Models formulate the problem and Statistical models offer possible solutions, restricting the underlying uncertainty, given the model and the error assumptions are correct. As uncertainty is always present we suggest ways on how to handle it.
Q00|Does CSR contribute to the development of rural young people in cultural tourism of sub-Saharan Africa? Evidence from the Niger Delta in Nigeria|Handicrafts are key cultural products consumed in the Nigeriaâ€™s tourism industry. Owing to low entry barriers, as handicrafts require a low level of capital investment, there is potential to develop viable linkages between tourism and local handicrafts sectors that create economic opportunities for local artisans. Thus, we assess the impact of a new corporate social responsibility (CSR) model of multinational oil companies on the development of rural young people (RYP) in cultural tourism in the Niger Delta of Nigeria. Six hundred RYP were sampled across the rural Niger Delta region. Using the logit model, results indicate that RYP have remained widely excluded from the General Memorandum of Understandings (GMoUs) interventions in cultural tourism projects due to the traditional beliefs that cultural affairs are prerogatives of elders, a caveat to the youths. This implies that if the traditions of the communities continue to hinder direct participation of the RYP from the GMoUs cultural tourism project interventions, achieving equality and cultural change would be limited in the region. The findings suggest that since handicrafts are key cultural products consumed in the tourism industry, GMoUs can play a role in helping to create an appropriate intervention structure that will be targeted towards youth empowerment in the area of traditional handicraft. This can be achieved if the Cluster Development Boards (CDBs) would focus on integrating rural young artisans into local tourism value chains and ensuring that they benefit economically from the sector. The CDBs should aim at creating space for the views of rural young indigenous peopleâ€™s handicrafts; emphasizing the value of indigenous knowledge, particularly on arts and crafts for tourists and expatriate in multinational corporations in Nigeria.

Q00|Evolution of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) in Agricultural Cold Chain Monitoring: A Literature Review|Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a technology providing considerable opportunities to improve quality control for perishable foods. Over the past decade, a significant improvement in RFID application has been observed in cold chain monitoring. The aim of this paper is to, first, demonstrate the role of RFID in improving the monitoring of the agricultural products cold chain. Particular focus is placed on the specifications of RFID and its advantages, which makes its application appealing in food temperature monitoring. Second, this paper aims to provide an overview of RFID developments in cold chain monitoring. For this purpose, we conduct a review of the literature throughout 2004-2018 citing the challenges of this technology’s practical implementation in temperature monitoring of perishables, and provide the solutions presented in the literature for each limitation. This survey would be beneficial for those involved in food distribution, as it offers approaches for overcoming the limitations of RFID, making its application more advantageous
Q00|Business ethics and corporate social responsibility as a tool to stimulate interest in the living environment|Business ethics, corporate social responsibility and environmental management in business largely overlap and are often the reason for the controversy over their effectiveness and real benefits for businesses and society. An elementary prerequisite for their effective functioning is the overall social interest. Specifically, it concerns the interest on the part of businesses management and, on the other hand, the interest of the citizens who are able to appreciate these practices and put a special emphasis on them. The constant pressure for the protection of the environment from interest groups and international organizations is of a fundamental importance in the development and application of ethical, social and environmental standards that are used in business practice. The information contained in this article presents the information from both primary and secondary surveys carried out in the Czech Republic. The aim of the information is to assess the attitudes of the respondents in the Czech Republic toward the issue of the overall social nature, which the business ethics and related areas such as corporate social responsibility and environmental management certainly are. In the light of the results of national surveys, it is possible to talk about a contradictory perception of these areas. The contradictory nature can be mainly seen in the positive attitudes toward the acquaintance with this issue and the real interest in the support through a financial compensation of such an approach to business. All interpretations are based on the data, which are derived from the questionnaire surveys carried out in the years 2015 - 2018.
Q00|Competing Land Uses and Fossil Fuel, Optimal Energy Conversion Rates During the Transition Toward a Green Economy Under a Pollution Stock Constraint|We study the transition to a carbon-free economy in a model with a polluting non-renewable resource and a clean renewable resource. Transforming primary energy into ready-to-use energy services is costly and more efficient energy transformation rates are more costly to achieve. Renewable energy competes with food production for land and the food productivity of land can be improved at some cost. To avoid catastrophic climate damages, the pollution stock is mandated to stay below a given cap. When the economy is not constrained by the cap, the efficiency of energy transformation increases steadily until the transition toward the ultimate green economy; when renewable energy is exploited, its land use rises at the expense of food production; food productivity increases together with the land rent but food production drops; the food and energy prices increase and renewables substitute for non-renewable energy. During the constrained phase, the economy follows a constant path of prices, quantities, efficiency rates, food productivity and land rent, a phenomenon we call the ’ceiling efficiency paradox'.
Q00|Risk attitudes, knowledge, skills and agricultural productivity|Agriculture is a risky business contingent on risks and uncertainty. Without strong technical knowledge, farmers tend to rely heavily on heuristics and subjective judgments to deal with their daily business. It is crucial to understand farmersâ€™ practices to provide suitable supports. This study uses a rich data set from a long panel household survey to assess farmersâ€™ agricultural productivity in Hue province of Vietnam that we combine with data collected from special surveys conducted in 2014 and 2015 focusing on farmersâ€™ knowledge, skills and risk attitudes. It aims to provide an overview of the environment in which farmers do business under constraints. Particularly, we investigate the relations among risk attitudes, farmersâ€™ knowledge, management ability and agricultural productivity by using univariate and bivariate analyses. The results indicate a large variation in farmersâ€™ knowledge. Most of them have low degree of technical knowledge, but show higher subjective knowledge. Agricultural performance tends to be more dependent on subjective knowledge than technical knowledge. Accordingly, farmers received limited support from the extension institutions. While risk attitudes are significantly correlated with farmersâ€™ knowledge and decision-making ability in livestock production, it has no direct significant relation with agricultural performance. The previous outcome showed that livestock productivity is prone to fluctuation, risk-taking should be important for farmers to cope with shocks. This study suggests extension services to fill the gap between subjective knowledge and technical knowledge and to build a significant linkage between risk-taking and learning to improve farmersâ€™ abilities and consequently enhance agricultural productivity.

Q00|Some Links between Sustainability and Well-Being|Sustainability aims to ensure that people live their lives without compromising the well-being of future generations. Increasing well-being by providing more goods and services to consume is a sustainability challenge. There are two opposing schools of thought on the consumption of natural resources: strong sustainability and weak sustainability. Proponents of strong sustainability emphasize the preservation of natural capital in each period because they argue that it cannot be replaced with any other type of capital. By contrast, weak sustainability scholars argue that natural resource can be consumed to build other forms of capital in which case sustainability requires that the aggregated monetised value of all capital stocks is non-declining or preferably increasing over the time. In this paper, we propose to adopt a balanced approach instead of taking either of these extreme positions where critical natural capital (CNC) limits are defined by strong sustainability and, within that limit, substitutability between various types of capital is allowed for economic efficiency and growth in total wealth. In such frameworks, weak sustainability indicates the minimum sustainability requirement for an economy in which all types of capitals are substitutable under the limits of CNC.
Q00|Von Sinn und Unsinn der Alternativen zur betäubungslosen Ferkelkastration: Kommunikationseffekte in der deutschen Nutztierpolitik am Beispiel einer aktuellen Debatte|Kommunikation spielt eine Schlüsselrolle bei der Herausbildung sogenannter policy beliefs. Am Beispiel der wieder aktuell gewordenen Debatte um die Ferkelkastration zeigen die Autoren, wie die Kommunikationsstruktur die Einschätzung von Alternativen zur betäubungslosen Ferkelkastration beeinflusst. Basierend auf dem Modell der Belief-Bildung und Daten aus einer Stakeholderbefragung werden einflussreiche Gruppen identifiziert, die den Austausch von Wissen zur Nutztierhaltung prägen. Durch die Simulation von Kommunikationsprozessen zur Kastration unter Schmerzausschaltung, der Immunokastration und der Ebermast werden diese Effekte veranschaulicht.
Q00|Knowledge Accumulation from Public Renewable Energy R&D in the European Union: Converging or Diverging Trends?|Bottom-up processes of policy convergence are increasingly discussed as a substitute for the absence of supranational energy policy coordination and harmonization in the EU. The overall objective of this paper is to analyse the development of government support to renewable energy R&D across EU countries over time: does the empirical evidence suggest bottom-up convergence? In order to answer this question, we first construct country-specific R&D-based knowledge stocks, and then investigate whether the developments of these stocks tend to converge or diverge across EU countries. A data set covering 12 EU Member States over the time period 1990-2012 is employed to test for the presence of conditional -convergence using a bias-corrected dynamic panel data estimator. The empirical results are overall robust and suggest divergence in terms of public R&D-based knowledge build-up in renewable energy technology. This finding is consistent with free-riding behavior on the part of some Member States, and the presence of industrial policy motives in other States in combination with agglomeration effects in the renewable energy sector. Energy import dependence and electricity regulation are found to influence the growth of the R&D-based knowledge stock, and the deregulation of the EU electricity markets has tended to contribute to a lower speed of divergence.
Q00|Actors, Decision-making, and Institutions in Quantitative System Modelling|Increasing the realism with respect to the representation of actors, decision-making, and institutions is critical to better understand the transition towards a low-carbon sustainable society since actors, decision-making, and institutions are the defining elements of transition pathways. In this paper, we explore how this can be done by conducting a model-based scenario analysis. The increasing focus on implementation and transition dynamics towards long-term objectives requires a better comprehension of what drives change and how those changes can be accelerated. We explore opportunities that arise from a deeper engagement of quantitative systems modeling with socio-technical transitions studies, initiative-based learning, and applied economics. We argue that a number of opportunities for enriching the realism in model-based scenario analysis can arise through model refinements oriented towards a more detailed approach in terms of actor heterogeneity, as well as through integration across different analytical and disciplinary approaches.
Q00|Is there a price premium for energy efficiency labels? Evidence from the Introduction of a Label in Korea|This study examines the price premium from Korea's Energy Efficiency Grade Label. The Korean government recently began energy certification of televisions, providing a setting to analyze a possible price effect of the new label. Hedonic regression results seem to show that a price premium exists for products with the Energy Efficiency Grade Label. However, potential unobserved heterogeneity is a concern. Difference-in-difference and fixed-effects models are used to capture the net effect of the label by controlling for time and product differences. The results suggest that any price premium does not result from the energy efficiency label itself. Instead, energy-efficient products already had higher prices before the introduction of the energy efficiency label. The finding turns our attention to the importance of careful design of labeling programs.

Q00|Bioethanol Production In Mexico: Socio- Economic Implications, Produccion De Bioetanol En Mexico: Implicaciones Socio-Economicas|Energy reforms in Mexico and the search for new sources of environmentally friendly energy have generated changes in the Mexican economy. One potential solution for decreasing the emission of greenhouse gases is the use of bioethanol produced from corn, sorghum, barley or wheat. These crops were studied to estimate the elasticities of the Marshallian and Hicksian demands through the application of the Almost Ideal Demand System with seemingly unrelated regressions and the use of the Stone Index. Results indicate that corn is the only superior good. Its demand increases despite price increments. The apparent relationship with the use of corn in the United States for the production of ethanol has generated speculation in the international market and has affected the price of tortilla and corn, decreasing the capability of the Mexican population for purchasing corn derived products
Q00|Crop Disease and Agricultural Productivity|Crop diseases and how they are managed can have a large impact on agricultural productivity. This paper discusses the effects on agricultural productivity of Verticillium dahliae, a soil borne fungus that is introduced to the soil via infested spinach seeds and that causes subsequent lettuce crops to be afflicted with Verticillium wilt. We use a dynamic structural econometric model of Verticillium wilt management for lettuce crops in Monterey County, California to examine the effects of Verticillium wilt on crop-fumigation decisions and on grower welfare. We also discuss our research on the externalities that arise with renters, and between seed companies and growers due to Verticillium wilt, as these disease-related externalities have important implications for agricultural productivity.
Q00|Role of socio-economic variables in adoption of crop insurance: A Discriminant Function Approach|This study examined the influence of the respondents’ socio-economic characteristics on their adoption of crop insurance schemes. Discriminant analysis based on the criteria values of standardized canonical coefficient and correlation matrix identified that educational level, farm size, satisfaction level, awareness and access to source of credit were positive discriminators while negative coefficients were obtained for age, income level and number of earning members. Awareness about crop insurance scheme, satisfaction level of farmer respondent with respect to the insurance scheme and access to source of credit were the highest discriminant variables. The study made it amply clear that socio-economic characteristics of farmers exert a significant influence on their adoption of crop insurance schemes. Taking into cognizance the findings of the discriminant analysis it can be inferred that awareness about the schemes and their benefits have to be created among the farmers in order to motivate them to go for insurance of their crops.
Q00|Eficiencia técnica en la producción de café en Nicaragua: Un análisis de fronteras estocásticas<BR>[Technical efficiency in coffee production: a stochastic frontier analysis for Nicaragua]|This article analyses the technical efficiency of coffee production in Nicaragua. We apply a stochastic frontier model to estimate the technical efficiency which reaches 60%; this means that Nicaraguan coffee producers have chances to improve the way they get things done. This level of efficiency prevents Nicaragua from capturing 340 million dollars for coffee exports. At the end of 2015, revenues from coffee exports represented 3.09 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), if 100 percent productive efficiency had been achieved, the relative importance of this item would have represented 5.77 percent of GDP. A counterfactual analysis shows the gains that would be derived from achieving technical efficiency.
Q00|The government capacity on industrial pollution management in Shanxi province: A response impulse analysis|This study employs Vector Auto-regression model with Generalized Response Impulse Function to analyse the dynamic nexus between economic growth and the industrial environmental pollution intensity for six specific pollutants in Shanxi province of China from 1995 to 2015. The results show there exists bi-directional effects, with stronger impact running from economic development to industrial pollution is stronger. We also find Shanxi government shows significant capacity in the management of industrial solid waste and waste gas. The provincial government has higher capacity in controlling Sulfur Dioxide compared to soot/dust. Our results verify the existence of Environmental Kuznets Curve through dynamic interactions between industrial pollution intensity and economic growth impulse. Three out of the six environmental pollution intensity responses are in the shape of inverted U curve. There are exceptions for three pollutants: N curve for Chemical Oxygen Demand and U curve for solid waste and waste gas.
Q00|Resource curse: Case study of Nigeria|The aim of the article is to verify the validity of resource curse in the case of Nigeria at the beginning of the new millennium. The theoretical part defines the role of natural resources as a form of capital, the symptoms of the alleged curse and transmission channels of resource curse. The practical part verifies several hypotheses established by comparing research papers on impacts of natural resources. The validity of the Prebisch-Singer hypothesis, Dutch disease symptoms and a negative impact on political institutions (inclination toward authoritarianism, high level of corruption, high government spending and low efficiency of economic and political decision-making) are verified. Results confirm most of the manifestations of the resource curse.
Q00|Exploring farmers? selection of crop protection levels as an adaptation strategy to climate risks|Among the challenges facing the European Union agricultural sector in the coming years, the impacts of climate change could lead to much greater variability in farmers? incomes. In this context, the insurance industry will have to develop new instruments to cover farmers? incomes against losses due to meteorological factors. Some protective technologies that farmers can use for climate risk management have associated costs that vary as a function of the losses involved. These sorts of instruments compete with other less flexible instruments such as crop insurance. We here analyse an issue of decision-making, where the farmer can decide how much to invest in protection, as in situations where the farmer chooses which portion of a loss to protect in the case of adverse weather conditions, and we propose optimal management to mitigate the increasing negative effects of climate uncertainty. By analysing the optimal policy in a continuous choice situation, we consider whether farmers, as part of their crop management duties, should opt to protect some portion of their harvest value with available technologies, or whether they should protect the entire crop. To analyse this decision-making problem, we employ the cost-loss ratio model and take risk aversion into account.
Q00|The Inclusion Of Natural Resource Wealth In The Index Of Economic Well-Being: Results For OECD Countries, 1980-2013|This report presents augmented estimates of the Index of Economic Well-being (IEWB) for 14 OECD countries for the 1980-2013 period
Q00|Futures of inland aquatic agricultural systems and implications for fish agri-food systems in southern Africa|"The CGIAR Research Program on Aquatic Agricultural Systems (AAS) is collaborating with partners to develop and implement a foresight-based engagement with diverse stakeholders linked to aquatic agricultural systems. The programâ€™s aim is to understand the implications of current drivers of change for fish agri-food systems, and consequently food and nutrition security, in Africa, Asia and the Pacific. Partners include the Global Forum on Agricultural Research (GFAR), the Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA) and the African Unionâ€™s New Partnership for Africaâ€™s Development (AU-NEPAD). A key part of the program was a participatory scenario-building workshop held in July 2015 under the theme of ""futures of aquatic agricultural systems and implications for fish agri-food systems in southern Africa."" The objectives for the workshop were (i) to engage local stakeholders in exploring plausible futures of aquatic agricultural systems, and (ii) to broker and catalyze collaborative plans of action based on the foresight analysis. This report presents technical findings from the workshop."
Q00|Food and nutrition security in the Barotse floodplain system|The CGIAR Research Program on Aquatic Agricultural Systems (AAS) is being implemented in ten communities in the Barotse floodplain of Zambiaâ€™s Western Province. With a focus on the rural poor and vulnerable, the AAS program aims to reduce poverty and improve food security by harnessing the development potential, productivity and diversity of aquatic and agricultural systems. The development challenge in the Barotse floodplain, as identified by relevant stakeholders, is to make effective use of seasonal flooding patterns and natural resources through more productive and diversified aquatic agricultural management practices that improve the lives and livelihoods of the poor and vulnerable. Food and nutrition are essential to support the overall AAS program objective and overcome the specific development challenge of the Barotse floodplain. Zambia has very high malnutrition rates, particularly for stunting in children under five. Poor nutritional status, especially of women and children, inhibits individual growth and development, and negatively impacts the overall health, productivity and economic potential of a community. The purpose of this report is to analyze the food and nutrition security situation within the Barotse floodplain. It explores multiple sectors, including nutrition, agriculture, health, and gender, at the national, provincial and community level to provide a comprehensive understanding of food and nutrition in the ten AAS communities in relation to the country as a whole. The analysis will provide informative inputs to the AAS Barotse hub design process to develop an appropriate food and nutrition research-in-development agenda.
Q00|A social and gender analysis of Northern Province, Zambia: Qualitative evidence that supports the use of a gender transformative approach|A qualitative social and gender analysis was carried out in June 2015 in Luwingu and Mbala Districts in Northern Province, Zambia. The research explored the norms and power relations at various institutional levels that constrain certain social groups from benefiting from programmatic investments aimed at improving livelihoods, health status, and food and nutrition security within the Irish Aid Local Development Programme (IALDP). This technical paper provides a summary of the research findings, lessons learned and suggests options for action the IALDP could consider to help bring about gender transformative change in the lives and livelihoods of poor and vulnerable people.
Q00|Improving Employment and Income through Development of Egyptâ€™s Aquaculture Sector (IEIDEAS) project|The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC)-funded Improving Employment and Income through Development of Egyptâ€™s Aquaculture Sector (IEIDEAS) project was implemented by WorldFish in partnership with CARE Egypt and the Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation from 2011 to 2014 and later extended to November 2015. The project focused on four governorates with significant aquaculture production (Kafr El Sheikh, Behera, Sharkia and Fayoum) and one governorate (El Mineya), where aquaculture was a new activity. The project was based on a value chain analysis conducted by WorldFish in September 2011 that identified the aquaculture value chain as a significant employer, particularly in rural areas. The analysis suggested that there was scope to increase employment of youth and women in the aquaculture sector The main objective was to increase aquaculture production by 10% and create 10,000 jobs. Other objectives included improving profitability for existing producers, securing employment for women fish retailers, expanding aquaculture in El Mineya and improving the policy environment for aquaculture.
Q00|Value chain analysis of Lake Nasser fisheries in Aswan, Upper Egypt|This report documents the outputs of the Aswan fisheries value chain study that took place in January and February 2015. This value chain analysis forms part of the Youth Employment in Aswan Governorate (YEAG) project funded by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) and led by CARE Egypt in partnership with WorldFish. The aim of the YEAG project is to increase incomes and employment for youth, women and men in Aswan by focusing on improving the performance of key value chains and enhancing the enabling environment. The current study concentrates on mapping and documenting fisheries value chains from fishers to retailers to identify the scope for job creation, livelihood improvement and poverty reduction.
Q00|Promoting gender-transformative change with men and boys: A Manual to spark critical reflection on harmful gender norms with men and boys in Aquatic Agricultural Systems|The CGIAR Research Program (CRP) on Aquatic Agricultural Systems (AAS) led by WorldFish aims to lift millions of people out of poverty and promote positive, transformative change in aquatic agricultural development. The AAS program recognizes that gender and power inequalities between men and women, which are reinforced at all levels of society, are key factors perpetuating poverty. One of the AAS themes aims to engage men as an integral part of its gender-transformative approach to the questioning and fundamental altering of unequal power relations and structures. These goals require the creation of spaces for critical reflection and action focused on harmful masculinities and their effects on the lives of women, girls, and men themselves â€“ in combination with other approaches. However, thematically relevant resources (i.e. those that provide a conceptual and programmatic approach to such reflection with men and boys) have been lacking. To help fill this gap, this manual was developed by Promundo, based on experiences training in AAS country â€œhubsâ€ (i.e. geographic locations providing a focus for innovation, learning, and impact through innovation research) in 2014 and informed by other resources related to the engagement of men and boys.
Q00|Learning from the lagoon: Research in development in Solomon Islands|A major challenge for international agricultural research is to find ways to improve the nutrition and incomes of people left behind by the Green Revolution. To better address the needs of the most marginal and vulnerable people, the CGIAR Research Program on Aquatic Agricultural Systems (AAS) developed the research-in-development (RinD) approach. In 2012, WorldFish started to implement RinD in Solomon Islands. By building peopleâ€™s capacity to analyze and address development problems, actively engaging relevant stakeholders, and linking research to these processes, RinD aims to develop an alternative approach to addressing hunger and poverty. This report describes the key principles and implementation process, and assesses the emergent outcomes of this participatory, systems-oriented and transformative research approach in Solomon Islands.
Q00|Value chain transformation: Taking stock of WorldFish research on value chains and markets|The goal of WorldFishâ€™s research on markets and value chains is to increase the benefits to resource-poor people from fisheries and aquaculture value chains by researching (1) key barriers to resource-poor men, women and other marginalized groups gaining greater benefits from participation in value chains, including barriers related to the availability, affordability and quality of nutrient-rich fish for resource-poor consumers; (2) interventions to overcome those barriers; and (3) mechanisms that are most effective for scaling up of value chain interventions. This paper aims to promote and document learning across WorldFishâ€™s value chain research efforts in Asia and Africa. It has three main objectives: (1) to take stock of WorldFishâ€™s past and ongoing research on value chains; (2) to draw out commonalities and differences between these projects; and (3) to provide a synthesis of some learning that can guide future work.
Q00|The SILC+GTA facilitation manual: the Savings and Internal Lending Communities plus Gender-Transformative Approach (SILC+GTA)|The purpose of integrating a gender-transformative perspective into savings and internal lending communities (SILC) is to engage men in SILC group participation and support, and to improve gender relations and decision-making processes for enhanced group performance and financial investments. Savings-group programs have historically targeted women, as there is a long-standing assumption that improving womenâ€™s access to finance will lead to increases in womenâ€™s empowerment. Existing evidence, however, shows womenâ€™s membership in savings (or other types of microfinance) groups does not necessarily translate to womenâ€™s control over funds, greater investments in production, or increased involvement in income-generating activities with corresponding decreases in unpaid domestic work. To address this concern, a gender-transformative approach (GTA) has been developed to work together with the SILC methodology to challenge harmful social norms and power relations. This Savings and Internal Lending Communities Plus Gender-Transformative Approach (SILC+GTA) works to create pathways through which members can freely invest their time and money in economically productive (agricultural-based) activities, thus leading to better, longer-lasting, and more equitable development outcomes for poor women and men. This manual is intended for community facilitators who are well trained in gender equality issues and who coordinate savings and internal lending communities in the Barotse Floodplain of western Zambia. This manual contains 12 activity-based sessions designed for use with partnered and un-partnered men and women in the Barotse Floodplain. Specific topics addressed in this manual include gender and power dynamics, caregiving and shared household decision-making, and gender-based violence (GBV) prevention.
Q00|A Manual for improving fish production in Northern Zambia through integrated farming systems|This manual was written as part of the Integrated Research in Development for Improved Livelihoods Programme in Northern Province, Zambia (IRDLP) and is primarily intended for extension agents to use with smallholder farmers engaged in semi-intensive fish farming in Northern Zambia. The IRDLP is an Irish Aid-funded project implemented by WorldFish, Harvest Plus and the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR). The goal of the IRDLP is to help improve the livelihoods, health status, and food and nutrition security of resource-poor households in the Mbala and Luwingu districts in Northern Zambia, especially women and vulnerable groups. This is achieved through generating and providing evidence-based information, scientific technologies and livelihood solutions to trigger community and farmer innovations for positive change. This manual provides information on how smallholder fish farmers can improve fish production in Northern Zambia, particularly in the Luwingu and Mbala districts, through integrated farming practices.

Q00|The feasibility of milkfish (Chanos chanos) aquaculture in Solomon Islands|Fish is crucial to food and nutrition security in Solomon Islands, and demand is expected to increase due to a growing population. However, it is projected that current capture fisheries production will not meet this growing demand. Aquaculture has the potential to mitigate the capture fishery shortfall, and the Government of Solomon Islands is prioritizing aquaculture as a solution to meet future food and income needs. Aquaculture in Solomon Islands is still in early development. Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) is farmed for household consumption, but its prolific reproductive rate and resulting slow growth limit its potential as a commercial aquaculture species. More productive fish species that are not indigenous to Solomon Islands but are successfully farmed overseas could be introduced; however, such a decision needs to take into account the potential ecological or social impacts. For land-based pond aquaculture, the only indigenous species that has been farmed extensively elsewhere is milkfish (Chanos chanos). This report presents a feasibility assessment for milkfish farming in Solomon Islands. It synthesizes the current knowledge about milkfish farming and presents results of a 4-year study on the potential for milkfish aquaculture in Solomon Islands.
Q00|The potential of community fish refuges (CFRs) in rice field agro-ecosystems for improving food and nutrition security in the Tonle Sap region|The fisheries sector in Cambodia contributes 8%â€“12% to national GDP and 25% - 30% to agricultural GDP, with an estimated 4.5 million people involved in fishing and associated trades. Fish and other aquatic animals are important food sources, contributing an estimated national average of 60% - 70% of total animal protein intake. Of the 2013 total fish production, 550,000 metric tons were harvested from freshwater habitats, of which rice field fisheries and small-scale family fisheries contributed approximately 20%. The productivity and value of rice field fisheries to households in rural Cambodia has been highlighted in a number of previous studies. The Fisheries Administration of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries plans to increase productivity from rice field fisheries and aquaculture at an annual rate of 15% to maintain supply for a growing population. This report draws mainly on the baseline and monitoring data from the Rice Field Fisheries Enhancement Project (RFFEP) during its implementation between 2012 and 2014. Reference is also made to the Fish on Farms project to highlight the relative contribution of fish from small-scale aquaculture compared to wild-caught fish.
Q00|Are returns to research quality lower in agricultural economics than in economics?| We compare effects of research quality and quantity on the salary of academics in agricultural economics and economics departments of the same universities. Agricultural economists get a significantly lower payoff to research quality, whether measured in terms of citations or in terms of quality-weighted journal output (based on nine different weighting schemes). Instead, salary in these agricultural economics departments appears to depend on the quantity of journal articles. In contrast, article counts have no independent effect on economist salaries. One-third of academics in the agricultural economics departments studied here have doctoral training in economics; these very different reward structures for research may cause frustration for these faculty due to the muted returns to research quality that agricultural economics departments seem to offer.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Q00|Biorefineries in the bio-based economy: opportunities and challenges for economic research|No abstract is available for this item.
Q00|Institutions and the Environment: Existing Evidence and Future Directions|In this review we synthetize the existing contributions that use econometric approaches to examine the influence of institutions and governance on environmental policy, environmental outcomes, and investments. The paper describes how the relationship between institutions and various response variables related to environmental performance and environmental policy have been conceptualized and operationalized in the literature, and it summarizes the main findings. The second part of the paper outlines avenues for future research in the specific context of energy and climate change. We identify various opportunities for empirical work that have recently emerged with the growing availability of data in the field of green investments, climate, and energy policy. Expanding the current empirical literature towards these research topics is of scientific and policy relevance, and can provide important insights on the broader field of sustainability transition and sustainable development.
Q00|Grass-Fed Beef: How is it Marketed by US Producers?| Increased interest by consumers and producers in grass-fed beef has led to recent expansions in this segment of the beef industry. A mailed survey was used to determine the “what, where and how” of grass-fed, beef marketing in the United States. The most important factors in farmers’ decisions on when to harvest and sell cattle are animal weight and consumer demand. Most farmers use multiple venues for advertising and marketing their beef. Direct sale to consumer is the most commonly used marketing channel. Farm experience, diversification, farm size, production system, and production region impact marketing channel choice.
Q00|Similarities and Differences of Animal Welfare Perceptions between U.S. Cow-Calf Producers and the Public| The U.S. livestock industry is increasingly faced with pressure to adjust practices in response to societal concerns. A specific area of growing concern surrounds how production practices impact the welfare of farm animals. The objective of this analysis is to use best-worst scaling to determine which practices the U.S. public and cow-calf producers view as the most effective and most practical practices to improve the welfare of beef cattle in the U.S., and to determine similarities and differences in the public and producer views. Results indicate that both the U.S. public and cow-calf producers view provide access to fresh, clean feed and water appropriate for the animal’s physiological state, and provide adequate comfort through the use of shade, windbreaks, and ventilation assuring clean, dry, sanitary environmental conditions for cattle as the most effective and most practical practices to improve the welfare of beef cattle in the U.S. The practices which were viewed as the least effective and least practical were castrate male calves either within the first three months of age or with pain control, and dehorn/disbud calves either before horn tissue adheres to the skull or with pain control.
Q00|The Economic Development and the Rise and Fall of Únĕtice Populations: A Case of Ecologically Unsustainable Economic Growth? Initial Thoughts|After a long period of substantial economic growth and population increase in the Early Bronze Age, the reason(s) for the relatively rapid disappearance of Únĕtice populations in Central Europe and the subsequent lack of population in much of their former territory for around 200 years remains a mystery. Various theories have been proposed for these developments, such as changed long distance trade routes or the depletion of materials for bronze-making. However, these fail to explain why large areas formerly occupied by the Únĕtice remained unoccupied (or virtually so) for so long after their abandonment by the Únĕtice. We argue on the basis of demographic and other scientific evidence that the collapse of the Únĕtice was in all probability primarily the result of unsustainable ecological development. Human-induced changes to ecosystems eventually reduced agropastoral productivity, substantially reduced the standard of living of the Únĕtice and resulted in the abandonment of many of their settlements. The extent and nature of ecological damage was such that it took much time for natural ecosystems to recover sufficiently before the affected former Únĕtice areas were economically suitable for resettlement. The possibility that resource shortages for bronze-making and changed trade routes contributed to the unsustainable development of Únĕtice settlements is also considered.
Q00|Environmental Management And Companies\' Sustainable Development|Since the beginning of 2008 the world faced multiple crises (fuel, food and financial). As a reaction to the negative effects of economic development on the environment, but also because of the multiple crises, the international community began to seek solutions to support a sustainable economy and society. One of the solutions is the implementation of the environmental management. The present paper presents the core concepts regarding the environmental management and the organization benefits by implementing the environmental management systems, benefits which have a direct influence upon the companies sustainable development of the.
Q00|Analysis Of The Iso 14001 Environmental Management System Diffusion|As a reaction to the negative effects of economic development on the environment, the international community began to seek solutions to support a sustainable development. One of the solutions is the implementation of the environmental management systems. ISO 14001 is an environmental management standard which establishes a worldwide environmental management system, with the aim of self-assessment or certification. At the beginning of the present paper are presented the core concepts of the environmental management and ISO 14001 standard. Then, it is realized an analysis of the 14001 environmental management system diffusion at global, regional and country-level.
Q00|The Complex Adjustment of the Canadian Economy to Lower Commodity Prices|In this analytical note, we provide a comprehensive assessment of the complex structural adjustment facing the Canadian economy following the commodity price decline since mid-2014. We quantify separately the impacts coming from the commodity sector restructuring and the broader effect of significantly lower terms of trade. Based on our analysis, the impact on the Canadian economy will occur in three phases. By the end of phase 3, in 2020, the level of Canadian GDP will be 2 per cent lower due to the commodity price decline than it otherwise would have been had commodity prices stayed at the mid-2014 level. At this point, the commodity sector is expected to play a smaller role in the Canadian economy.
Q00|To Leave or Not to Leave? Climate Change, Exit, and Voice on a Pacific Island|Observers predict that climate change will lead to massive migrations. Yet, most of the empirical micro- and macro-research on the link between climate change and migration fails to find much evidence of this migration happening. We focus on Tuvalu, a small South Pacific atoll nation that can serve as the canary in the mine for climate change research. If migration driven by climate change is not happening, Tuvalu may explain why. One plausible reason is the desire by Tuvaluans to Voice. ‘Voicing’, a concept we borrow from Hirschman’s Exit, Voice, and Loyalty, is the advocacy of expressing wish for change. We argue that Tuvaluans have decided that their preferred policy is to stay and Voice. This present choice to Voice may explain why the evidence on climate-induced migration is so fragile. Tuvalu may be using Voice to attempt to avert dire outcomes, or to strengthen its bargaining position for the discussions about compensation. The risk may be that the equilibrium choice between Voice and Exit is unstable and that the transition from one strategy to the other may be abrupt—in response to a catastrophic disaster. Advance planning and funding for climate-induced migration are therefore necessary through the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage.
Q00|La política económica del Presidente Santos está en contravía a los acuerdos de la Habana|Las conversaciones del gobierno Santos con la dirigencia de las FARC que arrancaron en 2012 partieron de una premisa: el modelo económico no se negocia. Con este punto grueso por fuera de la agenda, la hoja de ruta acordada contempló seis temas centrales de los cuales el referido al desarrollo agrario integral es el de mayor incidencia en el plano económico. No sobra tener en cuenta que el posible acuerdo tendrá impacto en sí sobre la economía en su conjunto, sobre lo cual varían las especulaciones entre un optimismo desaforado y un pesimismo derrotista. Este artículo se centra en examinar la relación que puede existir entre los acuerdos parciales firmados en La Habana sobre desarrollo agrario, el modelo económico imperante en el país y las medidas económicas que ha tomado el gobierno del presidente Santos en los últimos años. Al final se hace una reflexión sobre las necesidades de financiamiento para poner en marcha los acuerdos y la realidad de la economía colombiana en el momento. *** Santos government's talks with the leadership of the FARC took off in 2012 started from a premise: the economic model is not negotiable. With this thick point off the agenda, the roadmap agreed watched six central themes of which referred to the comprehensive agricultural development has the greatest impact on the economic level. Needless to note that the possible final agreement itself will have an impact on the economy as a whole, on which unbridled speculation varies between optimism and defeatist pessimism. This article focuses on examining the relationship that may exist between partial agreements signed in Havana on agricultural development, the economic model in the country and the economic measures taken by the government of President Santos in recent years. The text end with a reflection on the funding needs to implement the agreements and the current reality of the Colombian economy.
Q00|Resource Windfalls, Political Regimes, and Political Stability|We study theoretically and empirically whether natural resource windfalls affect political regimes. We show that windfalls have no effect on democracies, while they have heterogeneous political consequences in autocracies. In deeply entrenched autocracies, the effect of windfalls is virtually nil, while in moderately entrenched autocracies, windfalls significantly exacerbate the autocratic nature of the political system. To frame the empirical work, we present a simple model in which political incumbents choose the degree of political contestability and potential challengers decide whether to try to unseat the incumbents. The model uncovers a mechanism for the asymmetric impact of resource windfalls on democracies and autocracies, as well as the the differential impact within autocracies.
Q00|Determinants of the Contemporary Inequality among MENA and African Countries: What are in the variation of Land and Natural Resource ownership?|This paper examines the fundamental determinants of the contemporary income inequailty and economic growth in MENA and African countries in a panel data estimation during the period 1970-2013 for 24 countries. It is hypothesized that the variation in oil rents, human capital accumulation, and initial inequality in land ownership have significant impacts on contemporary income inequality in different countries. Furthermore, various political economy factors are included in the regression in order to measure the effect of institutional quality. The estimation results show that the oil rents levels, initial inequality in land ownership, rule of law and property rights affect income inequality and growth performance with a statistical significance. Keywords: Landownership inequality, Oil rents, Income inequality, Growth performance, MENA and African countries JEL code: O13, O15, O41, O43, P16, Q00 Random Effects Model. Panel Data Estimation. The estimation results show that the oil rents levels, initial inequality in land ownership, rule of law and property rights affect income inequality and growth performance with a statistical significance.
Q00|From Primary Resources to Useful Energy: The Pollution Ceiling Efficiency Paradox|We study an economy producing energy services from a polluting fossil fuel and a carbon free renewable resource under a constraint on the admissible atmospheric carbon concentration, equivalently under a constraint on the admissible temperature. The transformation rates of natural primary resources energy into useful energy are costly endogenous variables. Choosing higher efficiency rates requires to bring into operation more sophisticated ones, that is more costly ones. We show that, independently of technical progress, along a perfect foresight equilibrium path which is Pareto optimal, the transformation rate of any exploited resource should increase though out time, excepted within the period during which the carbon constraint is binding, what we call the 'ceiling paradox'.
Q00|The scientific and editorial history of the journal Economia agro-alimentare|This short note presents an overview of the editorial path of journal Economia agro-alimentare during the past 20 years, from the journal’s inception in 1996 through 2015. The paper is aimed at highlighting the publication’s contribution to the scientific analysis of the food economy. A wide set of relevant areas of interest and trends emerged from the analysis of 382 published papers. Perspectives of the journal in the international literature are discussed.

Q00|Optimal fishing mortalities with age-structured bioeconomic model - a case of NEA mackerel|The effects of random environmental impacts on optimal exploitation of a fish population are investigated using both optimization and simulation, based on a discrete-time age-structured bioeconomic model. The optimization problem is solved as a non-linear programming problem in GAMS. First, a basic model structure and 6 different scenarios, dealing with two interactions between fish and environment, are introduced. Based on the simplest scenario, eight different parameter combinations are tested. Then the optimization problem is solved for each of the 6 scenarios for a period of 100 years in order to gain long term insights. The main finding is that higher volatility from the environment leads to higher net profits but together with a lower probability of actually hitting the mean values. Simulations are conducted with different fixed fishing mortality levels under 6 scenarios. It seems that a constant fishing mortality around 0.06 is optimal. In the end, a comparison is made between historical and optimal harvest for a period of 40 years. It turns out that in more than 70% of the time, the optimal exploitation offered by our optimization model dominates the historical one, leading to 43% higher net profit and 34% lower fishing cost on average.
Q00|Greening the Vehicle Fleet: Evidence from Norway’s CO2 Differentiated Registration Tax|Fiscal policies are used to improve vehicle fuel efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions in the transport sector. Years of forceful reform in Norway may be seen as informative. From 2007, Norway has linked its new vehicle registration tax to CO2 intensities, later adapting it into a feebate form. We exploit a detailed dataset of new vehicle registrations, using fixed effects and instrumental variables in our econometric analysis. We find that the CO2 differentiated registration tax contributes significantly to shifting purchases towards low-emitting cars. A 1000NOK tax increase (about 120USD) is associated with a reduction of 1.13% - 1.58% in vehicle registrations, and the responsiveness in car choice to fuel costs is of the same magnitude. The estimated effect of the tax explains the majority (79%) of the reduction in average CO2 intensity in the new car fleet 2006 through 2011. A point estimate of the elasticity of the CO2 intensity with respect to the CO2 price is minus 0.06, whereas the elasticity with respect to (resulting) car prices is about minus 0.5. An intuitive model with ‘all’ car types losing demand to low-emitting types applies fairly well: low-emitting segments gain in share and do not get CO2 leaner, while high-emitting segments lose in share and become CO2 leaner. Moves between nine segments and within those segments are equally important.
Q00|Business Environmental Management On Micro And Small Enterprises Processing Food Located In Puebla, Mexico, Gestion Ambiental Empresarial En Las Micro Y Pequenas Empresas Procesadoras De Alimentos Ubicadas En Puebla, Mexico|The objective of this research is to identify and analyze the factors that may be considered environmental management in micro and small food processing companies located in the municipality of Puebla. We also determine what actions are aimed at conservation, prevention and use of natural resources and the prevention and control of pollution. In this descriptive research, we provide a research documentary to support the theoretical framework, as well as direct research using the survey to the empirical study. In the empirical study, a questionnaire was applied to 54 micro and small enterprises. Results found the main reasons to apply good environmental practices. These include small business 20.4% and 16.7% of the buses, related it to reducing costs by reducing energy consumption, 14.8% of small and 3.7% of microenterprises on innovation

Q00|Dynamical Methods Applied in Natural Resource Economics|This paper presents, in brief, the fundamentals of optimal control theory together with some notes for differential games, which is the game theoretic analogue of the optimal control. As it is recommended by literature references the main tool of analysis in open loop information structure for environmental models is the Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle, while the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation is the tool of analysis for any closed loop informational structure. As applications of the above theoretic considerations we present some environmental economic models which are solved both as optimal control problems and as differential games as well.
Q00|Martin Qaim, Genetically Modified Crops and Agricultural Development|Qaim is a leading academic researcher on the global impacts of genetically modified crops and his diligence and thoroughness abound in his newest book, Genetically Modified Crops and Agricultural Development. Qaim’s objective is to inform the reader about the contribution that GM crops have, and can, make to improving economic circumstances and contribute to increased food security, particularly in developing countries. He accomplishes this objective through an artful blending of storytelling and scientific fact, allowing the reader to come away with a new appreciation for the technology and its impacts. The book provides an in depth review of the commercialization of GM cotton in India, informing readers about the extent and degree of benefits that have resulted over the past decade. This book should be required reading for those involved with organizations that actively campaign and protest against GM crops. Perhaps if those opposed gained the insights presented by Qaim, the European acceptance of a beneficial agricultural technology would begin to improve.
Q00|Organizational And Economic Foundations Of Organic Production In Ukraine|High-quality and safe food products that come to market from the operators of organic production is an integral part of national food security. Growing demand for organic products in our country and abroad leads to the development of this sector of the economy, which requires special scientific research.
Q00|Which Social Cost of Carbon? A Theoretical Perspective|"This paper develops a theoretical foundation for the social cost of carbon (SCC). The model highlights the source of debate over whether countries should use the global or domestic SCC for regulatory impact analysis. I identify conditions under which a country's decision to internalize the global SCC is individually rational. I show that obtaining international consensus on a uniform value to internalize will be more challenging than often appreciated. I introduce the notion of a ""preferred SCC"" to reflect each country's preference conditional on a true value of the global SCC and a distribution of the domestic SCCs among countries. While all countries have a preferred SCC greater than their domestic SCC, a country's preferred SCC can be greater than or less than the global SCC. How these preferences translate into agreement depends on institutional arrangements for collective decision making, for which I provide empirical evidence based on various decision rules."
Q00|"Marx contra o otimismo tecnológico: economia ""imaterial"" desmistificada e desdobramentos para as questões ambientais [Marx against technological optimism: demystified ""immaterial"" economy and outcomes concerning environmental issues]"|In previous papers, we have conducted a broad review of the economic literature concerning environmental debates (especially the debate on climate change). In general, the several considerations - ranging from the ones built upon neoclassical theory to the ones based on heterodox thinking - tend to converge, with very few exceptions, to the notion of dematerialization; or, to put it clearly, to the hope that technological development will allow for the realization of a supposedly immaterial production. This paper starts from these previous assessments and has the objective of demystifying (that is, deconstructing critically) the notion of dematerialization as a real possibility in the present socioeconomic formation. Along with the very nature of this critique, we simultaneously intend to offer a theoretical argument of our own, rooted in Marx's thinking and capable of explaining why the faith in the dematerialization process tends to be systematically frustrated as long as the production and distribution of social wealth is structured around capital.
Q00|Designing a Climate Agreement for the Reality of Self-interested and Short-term Oriented Nations|The global and long-term nature of climate change conflicts with the reality of self-interested and short-term oriented nations. International negotiations have failed to reach an agreement that achieves effective mitigation, as this dual conflict has not been resolved. This paper proposes an alternative approach to international cooperation, one designed with the conflicting self-interests and short-termism in mind. Key elements of the proposed framework are: establishing a new international treaty and fund; determining a benchmark emission path for each country as well as a carbon price; paying countries annually through the fund for reducing emissions below their benchmark levels as opposed to penalizing them for higher emissions; financing the fund’s annual payments by raising capital from private investors; and repaying the private capital in the long-term using contributions from participating countries. The benefits of this approach include that reaching an international agreement becomes more realistic, self-interest and short-termism are transformed from obstacles into drivers of climate change mitigation and additional financing is created to support the necessary investments. Cutting emissions, currently a burden to be shared among countries in a zero sum game, turns into an opportunity.
Q00|The role of plants on the impact of cultural and historical monuments|Visual impact of cultural and historical monuments determined by surrounding plants is the focus of discussion in the paper. Their influence on passengers and onlookers sidelong roadways and trails is described in detail. A great number of practical examples have been examined with the purpose of drawing some general conclusions from this problem to the advantage of landscape design practice. The result of the analysis shows a considerable role of vegetation in visual impact of monuments over the observers. Using color photographs and observations from a number of different positions for a lot of monuments and memorials the survey concludes that from the standpoint of aesthetic value or attractiveness the vegetation often plays a leading role. It is not a detailed study of compositional principles for the formation of spaces around the monuments, but demonstrates the complexity of the problem and gave some results in addition to the theoretical foundations in this respect. Although the scenic beauty metrics are quite debatable and controversial case it is hoped that the conclusions of this paper will facilitate needed discussion on vegetation appropriateness and usefulness in monument's landscape design.
Q00|Environmental and Financial Performance. Is there a win-win or a win-loss situation? Evidence from the Greek manufacturing|This study examines the causal linkage between environmental and financial performance in Greek manufacturing firms. Environmental performance is measured according to accounting data following the Eco Management and Auditing Scheme guidelines and ISO certification. Return on assets and return on sales are used as indicators of financial performance. Empirical findings suggest that there seems to be a link between these dimensions irrespectively of the particular sector of activity. Contrary to similar studies a “virtuous circle” does not exist as the avoidance of environmental improving investments is related to a better financial performance. On the other hand firms with superior financial performance seem to achieve a better environmental performance. At the same time firm specific and market characteristics significantly affect this relationship. These findings provide evidence that governmental and corporate actions are necessary in order to lead to a more sustainable corporate performance in the long run
Q00|Postulating the theory of experience and chance as a theory of co~events (co~beings)|The aim of the paper is the axiomatic justification of the theory of experience and chance, one of the dual halves of which is the Kolmogorov probability theory. The author’s main idea was the natural inclusion of Kolmogorov’s axiomatics of probability theory in a number of general concepts of the theory of experience and chance. The analogy between the measure of a set and the probability of an event has become clear for a long time. This analogy also allows further evolution: the measure of a set is completely analogous to the believability of an event. In order to postulate the theory of experience and chance on the basis of this analogy, you just need to add to the Kolmogorov probability theory its dual reflection — the believability theory, so that the theory of experience and chance could be postulated as the certainty (believability-probability) theory on the Cartesian product of the probability and believability spaces, and the central concept of the theory is the new notion of co~event as a measurable binary relation on the Cartesian product of sets of elementary incomes and elementary outcomes. Attempts to build the foundations of the theory of experience and chance from this general point of view are unknown to me, and the whole range of ideas presented here has not yet acquired popularity even in a narrow circle of specialists; in addition, there was still no complete system of the postulates of the theory of experience and chance free from unnecessary complications. Postulating the theory of experience and chance can be carried out in different ways, both in the choice of axioms and in the choice of basic concepts and relations. If one tries to achieve the possible simplicity of both the system of axioms and the theory constructed from it, then it is hardly possible to suggest anything other than axiomatization of concepts co~event and its certainty (believability-probability). The main result of this work is the axiom co~event, intended for the sake of constructing a theory formed by dual theories of believabilities and probabilities, each of which itself is postulated by its own Kolmogorov system of axioms. Of course, other systems of postulating the theory of experience and chance can be imagined, however, in this work, a preference is given to a system of postulates that is able to describe in the most simple manner the results of what I call an experienced-random experiment.
Q00|Determinants of Demand for Fertilizer: A Case for India| In India agriculture contributes 14 percent to GDP and provides subsistence to two-thirds of the population. One of the top priorities of the Indian government is to provide food security to more than 1.25 billion people. Hence, increasing farm productivity is viewed as a primary goal for the government. Agricultural growth, with its forward and backward links to the industry and service sectors, is directly linked to India’s economic growth. Using national time-series data, this study estimates a demand function for fertilizer using a simple linear regression model and explores the relationship between demand and various non-price factors. The results from the regression analysis found that non-price factors are more important than the price of fertilizer in determining fertilizer demand. This study recommends that to increase agricultural output, government subsidy policies need to be geared toward the use of balanced nutrients for improving soil conditions, at the same time, provide an incentive to fertilizer manufacturing firms to develop new environmentally-sustainable products for agriculture.

Q00|The Potential for Developing New Materials for a Sustainable Bioeconomy|There is a great potential for using bio-based feedstocks and waste to develop new materials for a wide range of applications, in industries sectors such as chemical, automobile, electronic and others. This responds to a great demand for substituting petroleum-based resources for renewable ones. Besides contributing to the carbon sequestration, these new materials can also lead to products that are environmentally more friendly, such as biodegradable plastics, which are essential for a sustainable bioeconomy approach. In this presentation, it will be shown several techniques for developing new materials from renewable sources, including continuous casting and solution blow spinning. Their applications in bio-plastics, edible films, bionanocomposites, sensors, biosensors, tissue engineering, regenerative medicine and controlled release systems for fertilizers, pesticides and pharmaceuticals will be also discussed.
Q00|Genuine Savings in developing and developed countries, 1900-2000|This paper traces the long-run development of Genuine Savings (GS) using a panel of eleven countries during the twentieth century. This panel covers a number of developed countries (Great Britain, Germany, Switzerland, France, the US, and Australia) as well as a set of resource-abundant countries in Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico). These countries represent approximately 50 percent of the world’s output in terms of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 1950, and include large economies and small open economies, and resource-rich and resource-scarce countries, thus allowing us to compare their historical experiences. Components of GS considered include physical and human capital as well as resource extraction and pollution damages. Generally, we find evidence of positive GS over the course of the twentieth century, although the twoWorldWars and the Great Depression left considerable marks. Also, we found striking differences between Latin American and developed countries when Total Factor Productivity (TFP) is included; this could be a signal of natural resource curse or technological gaps unnoticed in previous works.
Q00|Converting Primary Resources into Useful Energy: The Pollution Ceiling Efficiency Paradox|We study an economy producing energy services from a polluting fossil fuel and a carbon free renewable resource under a constraint on the admissible atmospheric carbon concentration, equivalently under a constraint on the admissible temperature. The transformation rates of natural primary resources energy into useful energy are costly endogenous variables. Choosing higher efficiency rates requires to bring into operation more sophisticated energy transformation devices, that is more costly ones. We show that, independently of technical progress, along an optimal path, the transformation rate of any exploited resource should increase throughout time, excepted within the period during which the carbon constraint is binding, a phenomenon we call the â€˜ceiling paradoxâ€™. The effects of technical progress in the fossil fuel and the renewable energy sectors are strongly contrasted. JEL Codes: Q00, Q32, Q43, Q54. Keywords: Energy Efficiency, Carbon Pollution, Non-Renewable Resources, Renewable Resources.
Q00|How Markets Alleviate the Excessive Choice Effect: A Field Experiment on Craft Beer Choice| Research in psychology suggests that, somewhat paradoxically, providing consumers more choice can reduce the likelihood of making a purchase, producing the so-called excessive choice effect (ECE). To the extent the ECE exists, firms have an incentive to alleviate the effect through a variety of consumer-focused institutions that lower search costs. This study determines the effectiveness of three consumer-focused institutions on the excessive choice effect in a field experiment focused on beer sales in a restaurant. We manipulate the number of options on the menu (6 vs. 12) in addition to the use of search cost lowering consumer-focused institutions (a control, a menu, a menu with a special prominently displayed, a menu with local options prominently highlighted, and a menu with beer advocate scores). Although we find that consumers tend to be more likely to order beer when presented 6 rather than 12 options, the differences are often not significant depending which data are used and how it is analyzed. Highlighting specials or listing beer rankings have an effect on consumer choices, and have the potential to decrease the excessive choice effect. The experiment also suggests including a special is the most effective way to increase sales of a product category, but not the specific product itself.

Q00|The UK public’s perceptions on the issue of the dog overpopulation problem and people’s willingness to pay (WTP) for a humane stray dog management| The present study surveyed a UK representative sample of 500 individuals and employed the Choice Experiment (CE) to elicit the UK public’s views on the management of stray dogs and people’s willingness to pay (WTP) to reduce the current euthanasia rate. The results revealed that people have an emotional bonding with companion animals and are willing to pay to reduce the current euthanasia rate. According to the findings the UK public believes that the current stray dog management of euthanizing unhomed dogs is of grave or moderate concern and appears to be keen on the imposition of welfare-improving policies such as dog licensing, compulsory micro-chipping, etc. In addition, the CE investigated people’s willingness to pay (WTP) on a monthly basis to extend the current stray dog seven day statutory period in order to reduce the euthanasia rate. By constructing two payment methods, those of a Voluntary Contribution and of a Mandatory Council Tax Charge the study revealed that people are willing to pay £5.83 per month for small cross/mixed breed dog under the Voluntary Contribution regime and £2.14 per month for a young dog under the Mandatory Council Tax Charge regime.
Q00|Factors Influencing Access to Fresh Fruits and Vegetables in Baton Rouge, Louisiana| Increasing obesity rates and associated poor diets are a major concern in the U.S. The USDA recommends that Americans increase fruit and vegetable intake. This study examines produce availability in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Results indicate that competition, store type, and income may be associated with produce availability.
Q00|Impact of Remittance on Food Security in Bangladesh|Abstract Purpose The purpose of this chapter is to assess the food security situation in Bangladesh based on 2011/2012 Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey data using two commonly measured food security indicators: Food Consumption Score (FCS) and Household Hunger Scale (HHS). Methodology/approach The dependent variable in the model is a categorical variable representing different scales of food security as obtained from the FCS and HHS indicators. These categorical variables are explained by annual remittances received by the households; the demographic characteristics (age, gender, literacy level, and occupation) of the household head; and total monthly income from agricultural and non-agricultural wages using ordered probit regression models. Findings Results indicated that remittances play an important role in improving the food security of households. Other significant variables in the model were income earned outside of the farm, male-operated household, and literacy. Increasing income from other than the agricultural sector significantly raises the probability of a household being food secure. Practical implications The Government of Bangladesh should make the agriculture sector stronger at all levels of the value chain. Additionally, providing income generation opportunities for households outside of the farm can be used as a diversification measure to achieve food security within the country.
Q00|The Bioeconomics of Spatial-Dynamic Systems in Natural Resource Management|We synthesize literature on the spatial aspects of coupled natural-human systems across a variety of natural resource contexts and introduce a framework that can be used to compare modeling approaches and findings across applications. The important components of these systems include spatial heterogeneity in benefits and costs and connectivity of the network. One or more of these components is necessary for spatial policies to be the efficient solution. We highlight the importance of these components by identifying their role in previous work that shows that spatial differentiation in policy implementation is optimal. We pay particular attention to research highlighting the difference between spatial and aspatial policies and the presence of optimal boundary solutions. Finally, we develop a stylized metapopulation model to relate findings in the spatial bioeconomic literature to the theory of second best in public economics and suggest areas for future analysis.
Q00|Large-Scale Asset Purchases: Impact on Commodity Prices and International Spillover Effects|Prices of commodities, including metals, energy and agricultural products, rose markedly over the 2009–2010 period. Some observers have attributed a significant part of this increase in commodity prices to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s large-scale asset purchase (LSAP) programs. Using event-study methodologies, this paper investigates whether the announcement and subsequent implementation of the Fed’s LSAPs, and communication of the tapering of these purchases, affected commodity prices. Our empirical results suggest that LSAP announcements did not lead to higher commodity prices. However, there is some evidence that the currencies of commodity exporters appreciated and that their stock markets posted gains. The results suggest that other factors, such as supply constraints and robust demand from emerging-market economies, were the likely drivers behind the increase in commodity prices. Last, the paper finds that commodity prices have become more sensitive to macroeconomic news when monetary policy is at the effective lower bound.
Q00|Genuine Savings And Sustainability| Genuine Savings (GS) has emerged as the leading economic indicator of sustainable economic development at the country level. It derives from the literatures on weak sustainability, wealth accounting and national income accounting. We discuss the theoretical underpinnings of GS, focusing on the relationship between changes in a nation's extended capital stock and the future path of consumption. The indicator has entered widespread use propelled by the World Bank's publications, despite its varying performance as a predictor for future consumption. Notwithstanding the extensive body of literature reviewed, promising future research avenues are identified.
Q00|Institutional Framework Of The Seurop Classification System In Romania|The aim of this paper is to present the institutional framework developed by Romania in the process to implement the European Union legislation in the field of animal classification. It describes the organizations involved in the system, outlining their responsibilities related to various aspects of the sector. The results of the research are useful for other European Union candidate countries in their integration effort.
Q00|Sustainable Agrifood Investment And Its Marketing|A project is sustainable when it provides continuity of economic activity and society without destroying the environment we all depend on. The continuity of the economic activity is based on a viable project, righteous and acceptable for the three pillars of sustainability: society, economic activity and the environment. Sustainable development is not a utopia. Sustainable development means finding the adequate means in creating usefulness, for which the end-user is paying, finding alternative resources, solutions for a more efficient use of our resources, which are theoretically limited to our planet’s potential, while the needs were, are and will be unlimited. The sustainability of the economic activity or continuous development will take into consideration potential necessary resources for future generations. A sustainable consumption does not necessarily mean consuming less. It means consuming differently or smarter, reducing the consumption of goods and services or discovering substantial possible changes in the way consumers behave, as well as changes in corporate activity. Thus the Marketing responsibility is to get inside the customer’s point of view’, the assertive feedback and vice versa to bring on market the whole business result.
Q00|Methods for including income distribution in global CGE models for long-term climate change research|The consequences of climate policy and the impacts of climate change vary among different types of households depending on their income level, expenditure pattern, and other socioeconomic characteristics. Global economy-environment models that are used to assess climate change issues traditionally do not distinguish households by income or other attributes. To facilitate progress in this area, we review and assess literature on methods to include household heterogeneity in global long-term Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models. We distinguish among three categories of approaches: 1) the explicit modeling of multiple household types within the CGE framework, 2) micro-simulation modeling, and 3) direct modeling of income distribution. For each of these approaches we describe the method, key assumptions, limitations and several prominent examples from the literature. Moreover, we discuss data needs, including the contents of household survey data, their availability and processing. We conclude with an overview of what each method could provide for global, long-term climate-related research.
Q00|Why have greenhouse emissions in RGGI states declined? An econometric attribution to economic, energy market, and policy factors|The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) is a consortium of northeastern U.S. states that limit carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation through a regional emissions trading program. Since RGGI started in 2009, regional emissions have sharply dropped. We use econometric models to quantify the emissions reductions due to RGGI and those due to other factors such as the recession, complementary environmental programs, and lowered natural gas prices. The analysis shows that after the introduction of RGGI in 2009 the region's emissions would have been 24% higher without the program, accounting for about half of the region's emissions reductions during that time, which were far greater than those achieved in the rest of the United States.
Q00|Understanding the economic value of water ecosystem services from tropical forests: A systematic review for South and Central America|There is a well-established body of literature on monetary valuation of water ecosystem services to support the case for sustaining tropical forests. However, this literature is heterogeneous in its purposes and approaches and has not been carefully compared, providing a fragmented view of the values of forest water services. This paper addresses this knowledge gap through an orderly review and a regression meta-analysis of existing valuation studies at the regional level in South and Central America. This analysis allows identifying some factors that systematically influence forest values. However, it also reveals a lack of a systematized approach to valuation and a lack of sufficiently coherent evidence. This represents a barrier for the incorporation of the values of water ecosystem services into decision-making.
Q00|Does microfinance change informal lending in village economies? Evidence from Bangladesh|This paper examines how availability of microfinance influences households’ borrowing from informal sources in village economies. It uses a unique household level panel data set, which spans more than two decades (1987–2008), from rural Bangladesh. We find that households’ access to microfinance reduces the incidence of borrowing from informal sources, but not the amount of borrowing. We find that less poor households benefit more in terms of reducing their reliance on informal borrowing and that the benefit accrues over time. We also find that having access to microfinance increases women’s informal borrowing for small consumption usage, without facilitating access to new business opportunities.
Q00|Co2 Emissions Trading At The Stock Exchange – Quality Enhancement Of Tourism Potential, Ecological And Economic Growth|Since climate changes have caused significant problems in the functioning of the modern world, human society and economics at the global level, it is inevitable to take appropriate protective measures. Climate change and its bad influence directly relate to the environment and indirectly to economic, i.e. tourist activities which are linked to natural potentials. For years, human or industrial activities have been emitting greenhouse gases into atmosphere, which have harmed the climate to a large extent. In order to prevent further pollution, permits for emitting greenhouse gases were introduced at various conferences on a global level. These permits are traded on the stock exchange so this paper gives an overview and description of CO2 emission trading. Such an indirect environmental protection provides the possibility of reducing harmful gasses emission into atmosphere, and thus less harming climate factors. The paper puts emphasis on the Kyoto Protocol, CO2 emissions market, situation and tendencies on the market and their influence on tourism.
Q00|Social Media and its Impact on Decision Making for Trip|Social networks are not a new phenomenon of the human community. Social communication tools represent a revolution in terms of the possibility of publicity for enterprises. In this way mechanisms of social networks have not only changed the instruments, but also the communication. Social media is not focused exclusively on the development platform of promotion and communication, but also in the implementation of services to create new business opportunities and career. Professional groups present in networks are often closed and specifically dedicated towards specific groups in order to achieve defined objectives and set by direction of the company that benefit from these platforms. Social communications tools represent a revolution in terms of publicity opportunities for enterprises. Social media is becoming the key marketing tool for organizations who manage tourist destinations, in this way having a major impact on tourism markets. The role which social media is playing in various aspects of life is becoming increasingly every day, especially in areas such as social interaction and cultural and educational aspects of our lives. Social media are becoming important tools in marketing management for companies of tourist destinations, having a major impact on tourism markets. The arrival of new technologies such as social media have made it possible to change the way consumers seek information on their buying decisions. Ease of use, flexibility and interactivity offered by these social sites makes it easy for customers to get information that after all generate sales. These interactive web pages that have the status of social communities encourage consumers to interact with the community, strengthening prospects of customers. This will be resulted in customers who visit the community more often to get the desired information (Poon, A. 1993). With advices or knowledge that they get from the community they build the perception of destination and are used for making decisions by consumers. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the use of social media and the impact of social media in the decision making to travel by consumers choosing Albanian.
Q00|Universal Epidemiology of Insidious Meningococcal Syndrome|Neisseria meningitidis is one of the principal sources of bacterial meningitis worldwide and can as well cause sepsis, pneumonia, and further expressions. In states with elevated widespread rates, the illness load puts a huge tension on the public health structure. The universal epidemiology of persistent meningococcal disease (IMD) diverges distinctly by area and in due course. This appraisal summarizes the burden of IMD in diverse states and recognizes the highest-incidence countries where habitual preventive programs aligned with Neisseria meningitidis would be essentially profitable in offering security. Accessible epidemiological figures from the past 20 years in World Health Organization and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control assortments and available articles are comprised in this review, in addition to straight statements with important specialists in the area. The nations were clustered into high-, moderate-, and low-occurrence states. The mainstream of countries in the elevated-occurrence set are located in the African meningitis belt; several reasonable-occurrence states are located in the European and African areas, and Australia, whereas low-occurrence countries comprise numerous from Europe and the Americas. Precedence nations for vaccine involvement are high- and restrained-incidence nations where vaccine-avoidable serogroups prevail. Epidemiological records on burden of IMD are required in nations where this is not distinguished, predominantly in South- East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean areas, so evidence-based assessments concerning the application of meningococcal vaccines can be created.
Q00|Digital Generation - Analysis of the Use of ICT by Young Poles|In the Europe 2020 strategy in area of smart growth one of the flagship initiatives is Digital Agenda for Europe. Implementation of this initiative will lead to wide-availability of ICT solutions to society. Young people belonging to Generation Y most often treat the computer as a natural household equipment. Regular use of the Internet is very popular among them. They increasingly use mobile solutions in the field of ICT. The intelligent use of information technology possibilities will lead to sustainable economic growth. The purpose of the study was to cheque changes in the use of ICT among young Poles, and whether related behavioural patterns are similar in other countries of the European Union. The paper concludes with main reasons differencing generations in Poland due to the using the Internet.
Q00|Laudato Si':the Beauty of Pope Francis' Vision|"The Encyclical Letter of Pope Francis, ""Laudato si'"", addresses for the first time in the Church's history the subject of the protection of the environment, ""the care of our common home"". This rich and complex document analyses the causes of today’s ecological challenges, acknowledging the scientific consensus but adding an original analysis of the social, cultural, ethical and spiritual dimensions that are associated with the degradation of the environment. The Pope’s vision is that the ecological crisis is ultimately linked to a crisis of values, a spiritual void that permeates today’s technocratic society. In the authors' analysis, what makes this document particularly innovative is the Pope's appeal to action that, acknowledging the urgency and the immensity of the challenge we face, sees also its beauty, being a unique occasion for humankind to show what it is capable of doing, and that is capable of taking responsibility. This positive narrative has the potential to mobilise people and governments towards a joint action that cannot however be limited to technological fixes, but should be broadened to consider new development models capable of addressing the deep roots of this crisis."
Q00|Revisiting Worst-case DEA for Composite Indicators|Composite indicators are becoming increasingly infuential tools of environmental assessment and advocacy. Nonetheless, their use is controversial as they often rely on ad-hoc and theoretically problematic assumptions regarding normalization, aggregation, and weighting. Nonparametric data envelopment analysis (DEA) methods, originating in the production economics literature, have been proposed as a means of addressing these concerns. These methods dispense with contentious normalization and weighting techniques by focusing on a measure of best-case relative performance. Recently, the standard DEA model for composite indicators was extended to account for worst-case analysis by Zhou, Ang, and Poh [21] (hereafter, ZAP). In this note we argue that, while valid and interesting in its own right, the measure adopted by ZAP may not capture, in a mathematical as well as practical sense, the notion of worst-case relative performance. By contrast, we focus on the strict worst case analogue of standard DEA for composite indicators and show how it leads to tractable optimization problems. Finally, we compare the two methodologies using data from ZAP's Sustainable Energy Index case study, demonstrating that they occasionally lead to divergent results.
Q00|Research in Food Economics: past trends and new challenges|Over the past 30 years, food chains in Europe have undergone a dramatic transformation resulting from technological, economic and other societal changes. In turn, this evolution has opened multiple new areas of research for food economists, and this review attempts to summarise major developments in the field by focusing on four salient topics: (i) the formation of retail food prices in the context of rising concentration in the food chain; (ii) the continuous process of differentiation of the goods exchanged on food markets, and concurrent decline in the importance of commodity markets; (iii) the issue of consumer trust in the safety of the goods supplied by the food chain, following several food scares; and (iv) the problem of the growing burden of diet-related chronic diseases. After summarising the main methodological and empirical contributions in the analysis of those issues, we conclude by identifying gaps in knowledge and unanswered questions which food economists may want to turn their attention to in the coming years.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

Q00|Peak price hours in the Nordic power market winter 2009/2010: effects of pricing, demand elasticity and transmission capacities|The Nordic electricity market experienced extremely high prices during the winter 2009/2010. Using real data from the peak price hours the zonal solution from the Nordic market is replicated and compared to the nodal price solution when the central grid and its physical characteristics are explicitly modelled. Demand elasticity is introduced to the bid curves and its effect on prices and network utilisation is studied for the nodal solution. The sensitivity of the zonal solution to the changes in aggregate transfer capacities is investigated. The results demonstrate that better system utilisation is possible without capacity expansion. Nodal pricing solutions compared to the actual zonal pricing mechanism give insights into how the system functions in strained capacity situations and what hinders a more efficient system utilisation.
Q00|Missing in Action? Speed optimization and slow steaming in maritime shipping|This paper analyzes the claim, made by both academics and by industry insiders, that vessels speed up under conditions of high freight rates and low bunker prices. The rationale for the claim is that a ship should move slowly when high bunker prices make energy cost savings great and when the low reight rates give little temptation to rush for the next transport job. The analysis is based on the theoretical model for speed optimization by Ronen (1982) applied to AIS1 data on actual speeds of all VLCCs2 leaving from the Persian Gulf to main destinations in Japan, South Korea, China from 2006 to 2012. We find some support for the theory, however with elasticities, both for freight rates and bunker prices, of smaller magnitude than expected. We also find that speed optimizing behaviour is much more pronounced on backhaul trips than on laden trips and that the speed on trips to Japan is almost completely insensitive to changes in freight rates and bunker prices. Our conclusion is that there is a potential for gains from more adoption of slow steaming.
Q00|Optimal Scale in Different Environments – The Case of Norwegian Electricity Distribution Companies|We study returns to scale in Norwegian electricity distribution companies. The scale issue of this sector has become an important political question, and it was for instance discussed by the Reiten commission (OED, 2014) in a study about the future structure and organization of the Norwegian electricity network industry. We use panel data from the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE) for the period from 2004 to 2010. The Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method and the Stochastic Nonparametric Envelopment of Data (StoNED) approach are applied to examine the scale issue. We show that a majority of the companies are smaller than the optimal size, in line with Kumbhakar et al. (2014). The performance of Norwegian distribution companies are influenced by a number of environmental factors, and some of these factors are negatively correlated with company size. However, our results show that controlling for environmental factors when estimating returns to scale does not have a big effect on the estimated optimal sizes.
Q00|On the Distributional Assumptions in the StoNED model|In a recent paper Johnson and Kuosmanen (2011) propose a new, semi-parametric, general cost-frontier model, the stochastic nonparametric envelopment of data (StoNED). The model is semi-parametric in the sense that the cost function is estimated nonparametrically, while the functional form of the distribution for the error term is parametrically specified. A common assumption for this distribution is that it is a convolution of a truncated normal distribution, representing inefficiency, and a normal distribution, representing noise. This parametric form has the drawback that a negative skewness implies a negative expected inefficiency. It can thus never capture a negatively skewed distribution with a positive expectation. In this paper we investigate this assumption and its consequences for an analysis of inefficiency. Furthermore, we propose a solution to the problem and investigate its performance by means of a Monte Carlo simulation.
Q00|Malmquist Productivity Analysis based on StoNED|We construct a Malmquist productivity index based on stochastic non-parametric envelopment of data (StoNED) method, and we study how the distributional assumptions in the second StoNED stage affect productivity change and its decompositions. Our discussion show that the distributional assumptions do not affect the estimates of overall productivity change and scale efficiency change, but that estimates of efficiency change and technical change are affected. Data on Norwegian electricity distribution companies is used to illustrate our discussion.
Q00|Productivity Development for Norwegian Electricity Distribution Companies 2004-2013|Norwegian distribution companies have been subjected to an incentive regulation scheme from 1997, and the efficiency incentives were further strengthened with the introduction of yardstick regulation in 2007. We examine the productivity development for these companies in the period from 2004 to 2013. Using three benchmarking methods, DEA, SFA, and StoNED, we examine productivity change, with the usual decompositions into efficiency change, technical change, and scale efficiency change. Increasing investments and use of accounting-based capital costs in our analysis may lead to a negative bias in the productivity change estimates, and we therefore perform our analysis with and without capital costs. Our results indicate a negative productivity development for the whole period from 2004 to 2013, and we do not observe a positive effect of the change in regulation regime from 2007.
Q00|Hybrid Pricing in a Coupled European Power Market with More Wind Power|In the European market, the promotion of wind power leads to more network congestion. Zonal pricing (market coupling), which does not take the physical characteristics of transmission into account, is the most commonly used method to relieve congestion in Europe. Zonal pricing fails to provide adequate locational price signals regarding the energy resource scarcity and thus creates a large amount of unscheduled cross-border flows originating from wind-generated power, making the interconnected grid less secure. Prior studies show that full nodal pricing works better in integrating wind power into the grid. In this paper we investigate the effects of applying a hybrid congestion management model, i.e. nodal pricing model for one country embedded in a zonal pricing system for the rest of the market. We test how nodal pricing works in such a hybrid context with more wind power. We find that, compared to full nodal pricing, hybrid pricing fails to fully utilize all the resources in the network and some wrong price signals might be given. However, hybrid pricing still performs better than zonal pricing. The results from the hybrid pricing model of Poland, Germany, Slovakia and the Czech Republic show that, within the area applying nodal pricing (Poland), better price signals are given; the need for re-dispatching reduces; more congestion rent is collected and the unit cost of power is reduced. The results also show that international power exchange increases between the nodal pricing area and the zonal pricing areas, especially on windy days. Moreover, the nodal pricing area has less unscheduled cross-border power flow from the zonal pricing area entering its network and collects more cross-border congestion rent.
Q00|The State And Evolution Of Agricultural Land Resources In The Post-Socialist Period In Romania|In Romania, after the 1989 Revolution, the land resources have acquired an increasingly important role in agriculture and rural area development. The main objective of this paper is to increase the awareness degree on the current situation and evolution of land resources as well as on the related opportunities and challenges. The land resource analysis revealed that Romania has significant agricultural land resources, with a favourable agricultural land structure, in which arable land prevails. The land reform implementation produced significant changes in the land ownership structure, and the private landed property prevails in all the agricultural categories of use. Romania is characterized by significant soil diversity, yet with almost half of its agricultural areas being affected by various constraining factors.
Q00|Economic And Social Importance Of Ecosystem Services: A Review Of Research Agenda Importancia Economica Y Social De Los Servicios De Los Ecosistemas: Una Revision De La Agenda De Investigacion|50 years ago ecosystem services were invisible to the economic and social analysis. Their contribution to the economic system and the human life in general was unkown. Now, thanks to the work of many researchers the subject is studied from a multidisciplinary approach, ecology and economics blend to recognize and estimate the contribution of ecosystem services and the importance of their conservation. Therefore, a comprehensive theoretical review of the topic was conducted to relÃ©ase the importance of the ecosystem services to the economic and social systems, always have contributed to the human welfare, provide food, water, fuel, medicines, regulation of air, among other, however less, once considered as the environmental godos and services were infinite, their use was intensive and produce the degradation of the environment in critical levels, therefore currently the research focuses in policies and conservation strategies which ensure their regeneration and perdurability. Was found the natural capital is fundamental both the economic system and social system, would not exist without him, the natural capital contributes with multiple benefits direct and indirect that support human welfare.
Q00|Strategic Study On Cluster Strengthening To Support The Supply Of Volatile Food Commodities|the main contributor to inflation comes from volatile food commodities whose price movements are highly influenced by seasonal factors. The supply of food commodities is affected by the disruption of production, distribution, and government policy. When there is disruption to production, the supply of commodities is unable to meet demand. he program to develop clusters was a form of Bank Indonesia’s participation in safeguarding supply in order to control the price movements of foodstuffs. The emergence of lusters is expected to raise productivity from commodities by managing clusters using the value chain approach (value chain). The study was conducted to understand and improve the role of clusters in supporting the supply and controlling the prices of volatile food commodities. The study was conducted in two commodity clusters in six regions, namely three regions for chillies (Jember Regency-East Java Province, Minahasa Regency-North Sulawesi Province, and Tanah Datar Regency-West Sumatera Province) and three regions for shallots (Majalengka Regency-West Java Province, Palangkaraya City-Central Kalimantan Province, and Simalungun Regency-North Sumatera Province). This study makes use of several analytical tools, namely: in-depth interviews with cluster stakeholders, the analytical hierarchy process (AHP), and SWOT analysis. Nationally, there was a production surplus of chillies relative to consumption. Nonetheless, it proved difficult to take advantage of the surplus at the national level in order to stabilize prices in the main centers of consumption because chillies are perishable by nature, while consumers prefer fresh chillies. Fluctuations in the prices of chillies are more determined by the distance between producers and consumers and also seasonal demand factors. The formation of national average prices of chillies was driven by the fundamentals of current production and consumption which are weekly or even daily in nature. For shallots, there was a surplus nationally, although prices still spiked at certain times. It was because the production of shallots was relatively uneven and only centered on Java and NTB. Nonetheless, the demand for shallots did not show large seasonal spikes in comparison to the demand for chillies.
Q00|Urbanisation, natural amenities and subjective well-being: Evidence from US counties|This paper examines the relationships between county-level urbanisation, natural amenities and subjective well-being (SWB) in the US. SWB is measured using individual-level data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) which asks respondents to rate their overall life satisfaction. Using individual-level SWB data allows us to control for several important individual characteristics. The results suggest that urbanisation lowers SWB, with relatively large negative coefficients for residents in dense counties and large metropolitan areas. Natural amenities also affect SWB, with warmer winters having a significant positive relationship with self-reported life-satisfaction. Implications for researchers and policymakers are discussed.
Q00|A Theoretical Approach To The Transition From A Resource Based To A Knowledge-Economy|Economic development and the emergence of new technologies have changed the optics on the factors that are generating added value. The transition from a resource-dependent economy to one focused on tangible non-financial factors has progressed in a gradual manner and took place under the influence of globalization and of the internet boom. The aim of this article is to provide a theoretical approach to this phenomenon from the perspective of the temporal evolution of enterprise resources.
Q00|Guidelines for Conducting Economic Impact Studies on Fracking|In recent years, many studies have attempted to estimate the economic impact of fracking. When done properly, economic impact studies can be valuable to both policy makers and researchers. Unfortunately, the quality of these economic impact studies varies. Often times these studies are released with obvious errors or authors clearly exhibit bias either for or against fracking. In this paper, we briefly review the studies that have estimated the economic impact of fracking. We discuss many of the issues researchers face when attempting to estimate the economic impact of fracking, and provide recommendations to those who wish to conduct these studies in the future.

Q00|Addressing Bad Management Practices in a Family Owned Oil Field Environmental Organization: A Longitudinal Case Study of a Management Turn Around|Bad management practices can plague any organization and can be an on-going challenge for organizations of all sizes. In the case of Extra Environmental, Inc. (EEI), bad managementhas had a more significant impact as it permeated throughout every major department in the company. A culture of bad management has entrenched itself at EEI, while the ownership partners operated as if bad management practices were a byproduct of the oil and gas industry. A case study, used to undertake this report was based on the uniqueness of the parameters and specific measures taken to address the challenges. The case study identified five (5) key problems, as detailed below, that was studied, diagnosed, and addressed, to meet this case study’s objectives. This case assessed the steps employed to address the specific bad managementpractices, and to gain an understanding of what good management looks like so corrective actions can be employed to aid an organization. The strategies and activitiesundertaken in this study focused on not only fixingbad management practices, but also to create strong management functions inan organization and stabilize their workforce and grow the organization. Cultural and change aspects were also key factors in this study in that they are foundational components that must be addressed to gain any level of success in turning around bad management practices at an organization. Thus, a compilation of diagnosis, corrective actions, change, and culture were identified as the key success factors in this study as well as the support given by many of the literature resources used in this study. It was the financial impact, as well as other major problems identified in the due diligence process, that created the rationale for this case study.
Q00|Commodity Price Changes are Concentrated at the End of the Cycle|This paper introduces a new approach to the analysis of the cyclical behaviour of world commodity prices. Within booms and slumps, the behaviour of commodity prices seems to be quite similar, surprisingly even amongst different types of commodities (soft and hard), which are influenced by different shocks. The key result is that during commodity price booms, the faster growth occurs towards the end of the boom. Likewise, most of the collapse of prices occurs towards the end of slumps. This paper first establishes this behaviour as a new empirical regularity of commodity prices. Secondly, this paper introduces a novel way to conceptualise shocks to commodity prices as a cyclical occurrence, and on the basis of this newly established empirical regularity, the size of these cyclical shocks act as leading indicators of impending turnings points.
Q00|Regional Agriculture in Romania: A Quantitative Assessment|In last decade, the Romania’s regional agriculture has become the main driver of development through absorption of EU funds. According to official data of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Romania has reached 84% (or 12.85 billion euros) in the field of EU absorption funds for agriculture and rural development programmes during 2007-2013. According to the latest EU statistics, in Romania agricultural sector has a high importance in ensuring income through self-employment, while diversification of rural economy remains challenging. Most people engaged in agriculture are self-employed and agriculture accounts for only 3.2% in the total number of the employees in the Romanian economy. The paper intends to assess the stage of development of agriculture in Romania by regions, based on a quantitative analysis, using both national and European statistics. The results of this article show regional disparities of agricultural development in Romania and the need for central authorities to diminish the differences between macro regions in the agriculture field.
Q00|Romanian Agriculture In European Context|This paper presents the main features of Romanian agriculture, as part of the European agricultural sector. Based on statistical data, the article presents an analysis of the main problems that Romanian agricultural sector faces, such as fragmentation, preponderance of small and non-competitive farms, high employment but very low labour productivity, and modest crop and animal output.
Q00|Inventory management of spare parts in an energy company|We address the problem of how to determine control parameters for the inventory of spare parts of an energy company. The prevailing policy is based on an (s, S) system subject to a fill rate constraint. The parameters are decided based mainly on the expert judgment of the planners at different plants. The company is pursuing to conform all planners to the same approach, and to be more cost efficient. Our work focuses on supporting these goals. We test seven demand models using real-world data for about 21 000 items. We find that significant differences in cost and service level may appear from using one or another model. We propose a decision rule to select an appropriate model. Our approach allows us to recommend control parameters for 97.9&percnt; of the items. We also explore the impact of pooling inventory for different demand sources and the inaccuracy arising from duplicate item codes.
Q00|Globalization, the environment and the future “greening” of Arab politics|The pressures of globalization, rising ecological footprint and shrinking biocapacity and concomitant global value change will contribute towards an increase of the importance of environmental issues in the Arab world in the coming years. Without question, already the time series data from available indices – like the KOF-Index of Globalization (2015) and Ecological Footprint Network data on ecological footprint and biocapicity - all point in the direction that in objective terms the Arab World will be confronted by a synchronous increase of these phenomena in the coming years. In addition, the newly available opinion data from the recently released World Values Survey (6) for twelve members of the Arab League (Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestinian Territories, Qatar, Tunisia, and Yemen), containing almost 70% of the population of the countries of the Arab League show to us that membership rate environmental organizations, participation in environmental demonstrations and giving priority to protecting the environment over economic growth are already a factor in those countries. Their weight will increase in the years to come, given the general and very robust underlying tendencies. Our article analyzes the empirical relationship between rising globalization and ecological performance by establishing the global long-term, structural macro-quantitative determinants of environmental performance in the world system with cross-national data. In multiple standard OLS regression models, we test the effects of 26 standard predictor variables, including the ‘four freedoms’ of goods, capital, labor and services, whose weight will all increase in the Arab world in the coming years, on the following indicators of sustainable development - avoiding net trade of ecological footprint gha per person - Carbon emissions per million US dollars GDP - CO2 per capita - Yale/Columbia Environmental Performance Index (EPI) - Global footprint per capita - Happy Life Years - Happy Planet Index - ln (number of people per mill inhabitants 1980-2000 killed by natural disasters per year+1) Our research shows that the apprehensions of quantitative research, critical of neo-liberal globalization are fully vindicated by the significant negative environmental effects of the foreign savings rate. High foreign savings are indeed a driver of global footprint, and are a blockade against a satisfactory Happy Planet Index performance. The new international division of labor is one of the prime drivers of high CO2 per capita emissions. The penetration of economies by foreign direct investments by transnational corporations, which is the master variable of most quantitative dependency theories (MNC penetration), blocks environmental performance (EPI-Index) and several other socially important processes. Worker remittances have a significant positive effect on the Happy Planet Index, and Happy Life Years. In attempting to draw some cautious predictions for the Arab World, the article then evaluates the performance of the Arab countries in this context with our cross-national data and with our analysis of World Values Survey (6) data for the region. While the documented data for the region from the Yale/Columbia EPI Index, which is the best single-shot available global environmental quality indicator today, and the Ecological Footprint Network time series data about rising ecological footprint and shrinking biocapacity in the Arab countries clearly indicate the sharply mounting and pressing environmental policy priorities in the region, the “greening” of Arab civil societies towards a higher degree of environmental consciousness and activism already is also becoming a considerable factor. The overall publics in Qatar and Libya are in the lead, while in the other Arab countries, environmental policy issues will gain considerably in importance in the public mindset as well. Decision makers would be well advised to channel already now these future environmental debates and movements to be expected in a way compatible with the overall well-being, prosperity, democratization and stability of the region.
Q00|Pro farmer, pro industry land acquisition act|Varma suggests a new land acquisition act which is pro farmer, pro industry and pro development, and which leads to faster economic growth. My suggestions for new land acquisition act consist of 6 segments 1. Land acquisition 2. Categorisation of Land allotment 3. Time table for completion of projects 4. Compensation 5. Rehabilitation
Q00|Agricultural Export and Economic Growth: A Case Study of Pakistan|The main concern of this study is to analyze the impact of agricultural exports on macroeconomic performance of Pakistan. This study estimated the relationship between Gross domestic product (GDP) and agricultural and non-agricultural exports for Pakistan employing Johansen co-integration technique by using secondary data for the period 1972-2008.The main findings of the study depict that agricultural exports have a negative relationship with economic growth of Pakistan while non-agricultural exports have positive relation with economic growth. On the basis of empirical results this study suggested that Pakistan have to do structural changes in agricultural exports by converting its agricultural exports into value added products.
Q00|La Fiscalità in agricoltura<BR>[Taxation in agriculture]|Agricultural tax categories do not differ from the general three-tier: income, wealth, consumption; so the main taxes affect income (Irpef, Ires) and production activities (Irap), real estate (Imu, Tasi) and transfers (register, mortgages, cadastral), added value (VAT). It notes, however, that the fuel is low for its characteristic character, while, among the countless bales that characterize the life of the agricultural enterprise, concession fees, secretarial and inscription rights, taxes on machinery and vehicles, by consortia of reclamation contributions. The system focuses on the new Article 2135 of the Civil Code, which redefines the role of agricultural entrepreneur, with the recognition of the multifunctionality and multiplicity of the agricultural enterprise, foreseeing beyond cultivation, breeding and related activities, the supply of other goods and services for the community, agritourism, valorisation of the rural territory, reception and hospitality, the production of energy. Farmers go beyond land-based cooperatives, even those upstream and downstream of agricultural production, and their consortia, provided that they supply, or use, predominantly products to, or members (Article 1, Dlgs 18 May 2001, 228, Guidance and modernization of the agricultural sector).
Q00|Consumer Demand for Fair Trade: Evidence from a Multistore Field Experiment|We provide new evidence on consumer demand for ethical products from experiments conducted in a U.S. grocery store chain. We find that sales of the two most popular coffees rose by almost 10% when they carried a Fair Trade label as compared to a generic placebo label. Demand for the higher-priced coffee remained steady when its price was raised by 8%, but demand for the lower-priced coffee was elastic: a 9% price increase led to a 30% decline in sales. While consumers attach value to ethical sourcing, there is significant heterogeneity in willingness to pay for it. © 2015 The President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Q00|Community water access, availability and management in the Tonle Sap region, Cambodia|During the rollout of CGIAR Research Program on Aquatic Agricultural Systems (AAS) in Tonle Sap in 2013, water management was highlighted as one of the key development challenges. With limited capacity to regulate water, the situation oscillates between too much water in the wet season and too little water in the dry season. Access to and availability of water were seen by local communities as major limitations for aquatic and agricultural production, impacting on functions that include the lake fishery, intensive (dry season) rice crops, recession rice, rainfed rice and floating rice by the lakeside. For both fish and rice production, water and water management are determined principally by the natural flooding of the Tonle Sap Lake. This study is based on a community survey on water access, availability and management and was conceived out of the AAS consultation process and was developed to help identify existing practices in water use and management, as well as best practices where lessons can be learned and promising activities scaled out to other communities. The community survey also aims to understand, identify and analyze constraints and opportunities related to water, and includes a gender perspective to better understand the role of women in water management and use.
Q00|Commodity and product identification for value chain analysis|This commodity and product identification research was undertaken in the context of the CGIAR Research Program on Aquatic Agricultural Systems (AAS). AAS seeks to reduce poverty and improve food security for the millions of small-scale fishers and farmers who depend on the worldâ€™s floodplains, deltas and coasts. The objective of this research is to strengthen the capacity of AAS to undertake value chain studies with high potential impact on smallholders. The capacity-building aspect of this research was focused on the process of commodity and product identification for value chain analysis. Its scope was limited to fish and other aquatic animals and products in the Tonle Sap area identified for AAS intervention. The result of the identification process was the selection of a number of commodities and products that were deemed to involve a high number of smallholders along the value chain and that have high market development potential.
Q00|Focal community profiles for Barotse Hub, Zambia|The purpose of the CGIAR Research Program on Aquatic Agricultural Systems (AAS) focal community profiles is to provide basic descriptions of initial conditions in each community where AAS works in the Barotse Floodplain (the Barotse Hub) in Zambiaâ€™s Western Province. This information will contribute to, among other things, (i) evaluating change through future benchmarking activities; (ii) developing hub-specific panel research designs to answer program and initiative research questions; and (iii) strengthening current community engagement processes. Data and analysis provided in this report are primarily intended to inform AAS stakeholders and other researchers working in the area.
Q00|Community visioning and action plans: Tonle Sap hub|"The process of rolling out the CGIAR Research Program on Aquatic Agricultural Systems (AAS) in 12 target villages in the Tonle Sap region in Cambodia throughout 2013 involved several important tasks at different stages. This report covers one of those tasks: the Community Life Competence Process (CLCP), commonly referred to by stakeholders as ""visioning"". It has two main objectives: (1) to document the community visioning process, including the development of a community action plan and NGO work plan to monitor progress; and (2) to document village and network profiles of key community stakeholders at the village level."
Q00|Promising practices in food security and nutrition assistance to vulnerable households in the Tonle Sap Region, Cambodia|The CGIAR Research Program on Aquatic Agricultural Systems (AAS) seeks to reduce poverty and improve food security for many small-scale fishers and farmers who are dependent on aquatic agriculture systems by partnering with local, national and international partners to achieve large-scale development impact. This study on promising practices in food security and nutrition assistance to vulnerable households in the Tonle Sap region forms part of the preliminary research that informs AAS work in the highly productive Mekong Delta and Tonle Sap Lake floodplain. The study aims to identify and learn from promising practices that have had a positive impact on the food security and nutrition of vulnerable households in the Tonle Sap region.
Q00|Gender integration in aquaculture research and technology adoption processes: Lessons learned in Bangladesh|This working paper is part of a review of aquaculture technologies and gender in Bangladesh in the period 1990 to 2014. It assesses how gender has been integrated within past aquaculture technology interventions, before exploring the gender dimensions associated with current approaches to transferring knowledge about homestead aquaculture technology. It draws out existing knowledge, identifies research gaps, and selects practices to build upon--as well as practices to move away from. The review examines the research and practice of WorldFish and other development partners in Bangladesh through consultations, a review of gray and published literature, and fieldwork. It aims to contribute to the development of aquaculture technology dissemination methodologies that strengthen and underpin womenâ€™s participation in aquaculture.
Q00|Identification and effectiveness of self-help groups in Cambodia|The CGIAR Research Program on Aquatic Agricultural Systems (AAS) seeks to reduce poverty and improve food security for the millions of small-scale fishers and farmers who depend on the worldâ€™s floodplains, deltas and coasts. AAS combines more conventional approaches for introducing and scaling technical innovations, such as applied research and training, with approaches that foster innovation and promote institutional and policy change. Specifically, AAS utilizes participatory action research with communities to identify technology and policy solutions that best meet community long-term needs. One of the themes identified under AAS is the role of self-help groups in increasing livelihood resilience of agriculture and fisheries communities. As AAS establishes a hub of operations in Cambodia, AAS and Oxfam America are cooperating to investigate the potential of community-based self-help groups as a strategy for AAS implementation. As part of this cooperation, Oxfam America undertook this consultancy to analyze and describe the role, efficiency and effectiveness of the various types of self-help groups in Cambodia. This report gives an overview of this program which aims to conduct a field-based study to identify the types, main characteristics and effectiveness of self-help groups, with a particular focus on livelihood resilience of agriculture and fisheries communities.
Q00|A characterization of community fish refuge typologies in rice field fisheries ecosystems|"In rural Cambodia, fish is a source of food and income to millions of people. However, there has been a real threat to fish populations in natural wetlands due to the degradation of aquatic biodiversity and habitat, illegal fishing, increase of population and demand for fish, and the use of harmful pesticides for agriculture. The Rice Field Fisheries Enhancement Project (RFFEP) seeks to rebuild and protect the fish populations through innovative methods. The project works with communities to sustainably strengthen the rice field fisheries near their villages by improving protected habitats called ""community fish refuges"". This handbook characterizes rice field fisheries that are connected to community fish refuges. Community fish refuges are designated fish conservation areas promoted by the Fisheries Administration of the Royal Cambodian Government. It also examines the characteristics of rain-fed rice field ecosystems that are connected to community fish refuges in order to further refine descriptive criteria and better understand potential benefits and management strategies."
Q00|Exploring Indonesian aquaculture futures|Aquaculture is the fastest-growing food production sector globally, with production projected to double within the next 15â€“20 years. Future growth of aquaculture is essential to providing sustainable supplies of fish in national, regional and global fish food systems; creating jobs; and maintaining fish at affordable levels for resource-poor consumers. To ensure that the anticipated growth of aquaculture remains both economically and ecologically sustainable, we need to better understand the likely patterns of growth, as well as the opportunities and challenges, that these trends present. This knowledge will enable us to better prioritize investments that will help ensure the sustainable development of the sector. In Indonesia, WorldFish and partners have applied a unique methodology to evaluate growth trajectories for aquaculture under various scenarios, as well as the opportunities and challenges these represent. Indonesia is currently the fourth largest aquaculture producer globally, and the sector needs to grow to meet future fish demand. The study overlapped economic and environmental models with quantitative and participatory approaches to understand the future of aquaculture in Indonesia. Such analyses, while not definitive, have provided new understanding of the future supply and demand for seafood in Indonesia stretching to 2030. The learning from this research provides a foundation for future interventions in Indonesian fish food systems, as well as a suite of methodologies that can be applied more widely for insightful analyses of aquaculture growth trajectories in other countries or regions.
Q00|Strengthening capacities for research in development in aquatic agricultural systems|The research-in-development (RinD) approach to agricultural research focuses on working closely with communities through multistakeholder engagement to strengthen capacities to design, plan, implement and adapt research in order to improve the lives and livelihoods of the resource-poor living in complex social-ecological systems. The approach requires researchers and implementing partners to learn new skills and build new capacities as they work in multistakeholder teams. Capacity development is central to programs utilizing RinD, both to ensure quality engagement with stakeholders and to enable capacity to innovate as an outcome. In this working paper, the authors share learning from the implementation of a systems approach to capacity development in the CGIAR Research Program on Aquatic Agricultural Systems (AAS) over 3 years in five geographies.
Q00|Aquatic agricultural systems in Cambodia: National situation analysis|The objective of the current report produced for the CGIAR Research Program on Aquatic Agricultural Systems (AAS) is to provide basic information on key constraints driving poverty and vulnerability in aquatic agricultural systems in the Tonle Sap region in Cambodia. Six objectives and corresponding research themes are included in the program: sustainable increases in productivity; equitable access to markets; resilience and adaptive capacity; empowering policies and institutions; reduced gender disparity; and expanded benefits for the resource-poor. In this report, the authors review the main aquatic agricultural systems (status, specific policies and strategies, interventions, challenges, and options), then review the main drivers of change. This leads to an identification of plans and strategies important to AAS, with a particular focus on perspectives, gaps and opportunities in national policies, community engagement, increased benefits, adaptive capacity, and gender. This review, of potential interest to decision makers and all development partners, leads to conclusions and recommendations aimed at policymakers and institutional as well as private investors in development.
Q00|Lake Nasser fisheries: Recommendations for management, including monitoring and stock assessment|This study sought to improve the baseline knowledge of the fisheries of Lake Nasser and to make recommendations for the improved management of the fisheries, including stock assessment. The study included the review of key literature, visits to fisheries infrastructure and fishing camps, and individual consultations with the key stakeholders by means of semi-structured interviews, as well as a collective stakeholder consultation workshop. A preliminary stock assessment was also undertaken using the most recent time series of catch and effort estimates.
Q00|Lake Nasser fisheries: Literature review and situation analysis|This study sought to improve the baseline knowledge of the fisheries of Lake Nasser and to make recommendations for the improved management of the fisheries, including stock assessment. This review draws heavily from the most recent reviews of Lake Nasser and its fisheries, including van Zwieten et al. (2011), Habib et al. (2014) and Habib (2015). It is supplemented with findings from the field study described in the final technical report, Lake Nasser fisheries: Recommendations for management, including monitoring and stock assessment (Halls 2015).
Q00|Capturing views of men, women and youth on agricultural biodiversity resources consumed in Barotseland, Zambia|This paper presents data and findings from focus group discussions in study communities selected by the CGIAR Research Program on Aquatic Agricultural Systems (AAS) in the Western Province of Zambia. The discussions focused on cultivated crops and vegetables collected from open fields and consumed as food. Participatory tools for agricultural biodiversity (agrobiodiversity) assessment were used to capture community perspectives on plant species and varietal diversity; factors influencing the availability and use of plants for food; unique, common and rare crop species cultivated in a community, identified through a four-cell analysis methodology; and core problems, root causes, effects and necessary actions to tackle them, using problem tree or situation analysis methods.
Q00|The WISH pond: Potential for development of aquaculture in northeast Cambodia|"In Cambodia, fish provide a major source of animal protein for rural households. Capture fisheries have declined and aquaculture has been identified as playing an important role in food and nutritional security and rural income generation. In 2011, WorldFish, in partnership with the Stung Treng Fishery Administration Cantonment and the Culture and Environment Preservation Association, aimed at improving the uptake of small-scale aquaculture by communities with limited experience in fish culture in Stung Treng Province in northeast Cambodia. The system was given the name â€œWISH ponds,â€ derived from the combination of the words ""water"" and ""fish"" to reflect the integration of fish cultivation with water for storage and vegetable growing. It was targeted towards households with limited space to construct large aquaculture ponds, such as peri-urban households. The study indicated that WISH ponds can create an important learning platform for communities to address challenges associated with small-scale aquaculture development by using scientific data generated and owned by the participants. Results from this 2011 study provided important insights into the challenges and constraints for introducing small-scale aquaculture into rural households in Cambodia. In mid-2013, WorldFish won a Feed the Future Partnering for Innovation grant, funded by the United States Agency for International Development, to build upon its successful engagement with communities in northeast Cambodia where WISH ponds had already been introduced and investigate scaling this technology to establish more WISH ponds in these communities."
Q00|Research in development: Learning from the CGIAR Research Program on Aquatic Agricultural Systems|This working paper aims to synthesize and share learning from the experience of adapting and operationalizing the Research in Development (RinD) approach to agricultural research in the five hubs under the The CGIAR Research Program on Aquatic Agricultural Systems. It seeks to share learning about how the approach is working in context and to explore the outcomes it is achieving through initial implementation over 3 Â½ years. This learning can inform continuation of agricultural research in the second phase of the CGIAR research programs and will be useful to others aiming to implement research programs that seek to equitably build capacity to innovate in complex social-ecological systems. Each of the chapters in this working paper have shown that RinD has produced a range of outcomes that were often unexpected and broader in scope than might result from other approaches to agricultural research. RinD also produces innovations, and there is evidence that it builds capacity to innovate.
Q00|Social and gender analysis report: Barotse Floodplain, Western Province,Zambia|There is increasing awareness that integrating gender into development frameworks is critical for effective implementation of development strategies. In working to alleviate rural poverty, the CGIAR Research Program on Aquatic Agricultural Systems (AAS) recognizes that â€œbusiness as usualâ€ gender integration approaches will not deliver lasting and widespread improvements in agricultural productivity, poverty reduction and food security. In response, AAS operationalized a gender transformative approach. The approach is informed by conceptual frameworks that explicitly recognize the potent influence of social relations on creating and perpetuating gender inequalities. In this way, AAS aims to address the underlying causes of rural poverty and gender inequality in Zambiaâ€™s Barotse Floodplain, where people rely extensively on riverine and wetland ecosystems for food and livelihood security. A central question guiding the research program is â€œHow do social norms and gendered power relations influence agricultural development outcomes?â€ The findings presented in this report provide insights that help answer this question. The report presents a review of literature relevant to livelihoods, ecosystem services, and gender and social relations in Zambia, with a specific focus on Western Province, where AAS is currently implemented. It also presents a synthesis of findings of a social and gender analysis conducted in 2013 in 10 focal communities situated in and around the Barotse Floodplain.
Q00|The role of farmed fish in the diets of the resource-poor in Egypt|The Egyptian aquaculture industry provides more than 100,000 full-time or part-time jobs and produces the countryâ€™s least-expensive farmed animal protein. Thus, aquaculture plays an important role in both sustaining livelihoods and improving the diet quality and nutritional health of Egyptians, including a significant proportion of the 25.5% who are resource-poor. Recognizing this dual role, WorldFish has promoted sustainable growth in Egyptian aquaculture for more than 20 years. Through its work, WorldFish has identified a lack of quality data about fish consumption preferences and practices. Eager to fill this knowledge gap, WorldFish partnered with the Environment and Development Group (EDG) to study consumption of fish, red meat and poultry among the resource-poor in Egypt. This study aimed to characterize current consumer preferences for and consumption patterns of animal-source foods, comparing red meat, poultry and fish. The resulting data is meant to contribute to a better understanding of what drives demand for fish among the resource-poor in Egypt, allowing value chain actors to more successfully market their products to this segment of the population.
Q00|Risk analysis in aquaculture: A step-by-step introduction with worked examples|This publication is based on materials covered and outputs generated during the Workshop on Risk Assessment Methodologies and Tools for Aquaculture in Sub-Saharan Africa, which was jointly held by WorldFish and FAO in Siavonga, Zambia on 28 June - 2 July 2010. The workshop was delivered as a training exercise to 17 participants from seven sub-Saharan countries and was designed to highlight current methodologies and tools available for environmental risk analysis in aquaculture development. A key focus of the workshop was to encourage participants to consider hypothetical but realistic scenarios and to discuss issues relevant to evaluating the environmental risks of a given activity or scenario. This publication presents selected scenarios from the workshop and the outcomes of the deliberative process as developed by the participants. This publication is factual but not comprehensive, therefore any statements or estimations of risk do not represent the actual risks arising from the described scenario. It is intended to serve as an easily readable introduction to risk analysis, highlighting worked examples that will provide guidance on how a risk analysis may be approached in a similar situation.
Q00|Building climate-resilient food systems for Pacific Islands|The countries and territories of the Pacific Islands face many challenges in building the three main pillars of food security: availability, access and appropriate use of nutritious food. These challenges arise from factors including rapid population growth and urbanization, shortages of arable land for farming and the availability of cheap, low-quality foods. As a result, many are now highly dependent on imported food, and the incidence of non-communicable diseases in the region is among the highest in the world. This report summarizes: 1) the projected effects of climate change on agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture in the Pacific region; 2) adaptations and supporting policies needed to reduce risks to food production; 3) gaps in knowledge that must be filled in order to implement the adaptations effectively; 4) recommendations to fill these knowledge gaps.
Q00|Seasonal food availability: Barotse floodplain system|The CGIAR Research Program on Aquatic Agricultural Systems (AAS) is being implemented in ten communities in the Barotse floodplain in Zambiaâ€™s Western Province. The objective of the AAS program is to reduce poverty and improve food security by harnessing the potential, productivity and diversity of aquatic and agricultural systems. Within the Barotse floodplain, the program aims to improve the productivity and diversification of aquatic agricultural management practices in order to make better use of seasonal flooding patterns and natural resources and improve the livelihoods of the poor and vulnerable. An understanding of the food and nutrition security situation in the Barotse floodplain is essential to supporting the AAS program objective. Food availability in the Barotse is highly seasonal and is especially limited during the hunger season, which lasts from August or September to January. During this time, as food shortages increase, food and nutrition insecurity become more severe.3 Exploring the links between biodiversity and diet diversity within the floodplain allows the identification of entry points for sustainable and diverse diet options. Participatory action research (PAR) was therefore conducted between 2014 and 2015 in the ten AAS communities to identify the available food items within the communities and observe patterns in temporal changes of food availability. This narrative provides an explanation of how that research has been conceptualized/envisaged in the form of one all-inclusive seasonal food availability calendar of the AAS Barotse floodplain communities, and discusses trends in food availability across the communities.
Q00|Market surveys: Barotse floodplain system|The aim of the CGIAR Research Program on Aquatic Agricultural Systems (AAS) is to improve livelihoods and food security by enhancing the productivity and diversity of aquatic and agricultural systems. The AAS program in the Barotse floodplain of Zambia, which is being implemented in ten communities including; Kabula, Kapanda Lealui, Mapungu, Mwandi, Nalitoya, Nembwele, Senanga, Sifuna and Situlu in December 2014, in Nanikelako in April 2015 and in Mwandi, evaluates changes in seasonal flooding patterns and the availability of natural resources to strengthen the productivity of aquatic agricultural management practices and improve the livelihoods of the poor and vulnerable. It is essential to understand the current food and nutrition security situation in the Barotse floodplain in order to support the AAS program objective. Food availability in the Barotse is highly seasonal; it becomes limited from August or September to January, during which time food and nutrition insecurity worsens. It is therefore necessary to identify opportunities to promote sustainable and diverse dietary options. This narrative provides an explanation of how the market research was conducted and some preliminary results. Overall, our research indicates that poor market access is a significant constraint in the Barotse floodplain, inhibiting AAS community members from securing proper nutrition and food.
Q00|Measuring gender-transformative change: A review of literature and promising practices|"Gender-transformative approaches aim to move beyond individual self-improvement among women and toward transforming the power dynamics and structures that serve to reinforce gendered inequalities. As defined by the CGIAR Research Program on Aquatic Agricultural Systems (AAS), a gender-transformative approach to development goes beyond the ""symptoms"" of gender inequality to address ""the social norms, attitudes, behaviors, and social systems that underlie them"". This approach entails engaging groups in critically examining, challenging and questioning gender norms and power relations that underlie visible gender gaps. This report broadly examines existing literature on frameworks and monitoring, evaluation and learning systems, as well as specific indicators and approaches for measuring gender-transformative change, particularly in the smallholder agriculture sector."
Q00|Improving income and livelihood of poor farming household in Bangladesh through adoption of improved aquaculture technologies and varieties|Fish are an important part of Bangladeshi culture and diet. Bangladesh ranks among the top five freshwater fish producers in the world. Fish are abundant in the thousands of rivers, ponds, lakes and seasonal floodplains across the country. They are a major source of protein for people living near these waterbodies. In Bangladesh, many households depend on fish farming for their livelihood. By growing fish in homestead ponds, households have a consistent supply of nutritious fish and can sell the surplus for an income. The USAID-funded Cereal Systems Initiative for South Asia in Bangladesh (CSISA-BD) aimed to increase the income of farming households through increased productivity of aquaculture systems. Key activities of the project included developing and disseminating appropriate improved agricultural technology and quality fish seeds to improve livelihoods, food security and nutrition.
Q00|Understanding the gender dimensions of adopting climate-smart smallholder aquaculture innovations|This study explored how climate-smart agricultural and aquaculture innovations may lead to more successful climate adaptation efforts and enhanced resilience for both men and women in households and across communities, as well as to improved and equitable outcomes in terms of income, nutrition and livelihood opportunities. Specifically, it investigated efforts to target women with household aquaculture innovations to understand (1) if such approaches enable women to use or benefit from them; (2) if and how usage impacts the sustained use of these innovations; and (3) if it would be possible to scale out these innovations to achieve largescale development outcomes.
Q00|Aquaculture technologies in Bangladesh: An assessment of technical and economic performance and producer behavior|This study evaluates the performance of a wide range of aquaculture systems in Bangladesh. It is by far the largest of its kind attempted to date. The purpose of this study was to identify and analyze the most important production systems, rather than to provide a nationally representative overview of the entire aquaculture sector of Bangladesh. As such, the study yields a huge amount of new information on production technologies that have never been thoroughly researched before. The study reveals an extremely diverse array of specialized, dynamic and rapidly evolving production technologies, adapted to a variety of market niches and local environmental conditions. This is a testament to the innovativeness of farmers and other value chain actors who have been the principal drivers of this development in Bangladesh. Data was collected from six geographical hubs. The survey was conducted from November 2011 to June 2012. Technological performance in terms of detailed input and output information, fish management practices, credit and marketing, and social and environmental issues were captured by the survey questionnaire, which had both open and closed format questions. The study generated insights that enable better understanding of aquaculture development in Bangladesh.
Q00|'Two decades after the war' - the management of international commons|Memory is important, also for Economics. The ephemeris can be used not only as moments of who relives the past in a single-rewind-perspective but of those who use these occasions to reflect on the past and to project the future from it. 1995 was a special year for fisheries in Portugal. Never before and never again, was the sector so under the eye of the media. First pages every day journals, opening in the TV daily informative programs?, and that, for more than three months. A unique scenario. The cause was a fish war in the NAFO area, between Spain and Canada, about a species, the turbot, that put also the Portuguese in a big tension. Two decades after the war, our proposal goes through resume the so-called turbot war and, from it, to reflect on its causes, how the problems were solved and to outlook for the guidelines of future research. Our paper therefore has the following structure. In the first and second points, the original problems of High Sea fisheries management and how they reflected in practice in the turbot war, are presented. In section 3 we reflect on how the problem was solved. Theoretically we shortly review the basic results of the literature on this issue, in particular those arising from the usual combination of the basic model of fisheries management with Game Theory. In empirical terms we draw attention to the diplomatic efforts between the EU and Canada to overcome disagreements that led to war and to promote a cooperative agreement that would avoid the problem of overfishing on the High Sea. The rationale and substance of the 1995 UN Agreement on Transboundary Resources and Highly Migratory Species, its strengths and weaknesses, is presented and discussed. Finally, in Section 4, the paper reflects on the theoretical and practical issues that still pose important questions to this problematic and ask for some perspectives on future developments.
Q00|Economic Impact of CO2 Emissions and Carbon Tax in Electric Vehicle Society in Toyohashi City in Japan|In this paper, we explore the economic impact of promotion and realization of an electric vehicle society (EVS) in Toyohashi City in Japan. More concretely, this paper emphasizes a computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling approach to evaluate the following issues: economic impacts of subsidies for promotion of an EVS, economic impacts of carbon tax for reducing CO2, industrial structure change towards an EVS, and modal shift occurring towards an EVS. Our simulation results demonstrate that after applying 5 ~ 25% up subsidies to five industries including electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing, EV transport, solar power, cogeneration and other transport, the total industrial output and city GDP increase. A large growth rate is found in industries where subsidies are introduced, but non-ferrous metal industry also grows without subsidies due a repercussion effect. Moreover, it is interesting that decreasing proportions are found in oil and coal product, mining, heat supply and gasoline vehicle (GV) transport industries. However the total CO2 emission in Toyohashi City is increased being interpreted as a rebound effect. All the commodity prices decrease since subsidies are given to some industries. Hence Toyohashi City's economy shows a direction where the demand for conventional vehicles and energy use are decreased, conversely, the demand for EVs and renewable energy are increased illustrating a different life style from the current one. Regarding CO2 emissions, we introduced a carbon tax of 1,000 yen/t-CO2 for industries except the five industries mentioned above. As a result the total CO2 emission is decreased and the equivalent variation shows a positive value as compared with the base case. Thus introducing 5 ~ 25% subsidies and the carbon tax can really represent a realistic alternative society to EVS in Toyohashi City.
Q00|Aktuelle Forschung in der Gartenbauökonomie: Tagungsband zum 1. Symposium für Ökonomie im Gartenbau am 27. November 2013 in der Paulinerkirche Göttingen|[Vorwort] Das 1.

Q00|Master’s Programs in Agricultural Economics: Situation and Analysis| While interest in agricultural graduate programs increases throughout the nation, there is a lack of comprehensive information characterizing Master’s programs in agricultural economics. This study examines Master’s programs in agricultural economics (or equivalent, including resource economics, applied economics, and agribusiness) at U.S. land grant universities and categorizes commonalities, differences, strengths and positive aspects. The research identified a common core structure among the existing agricultural economics Master’s programs, as well as differentiating characteristics contributing to the individuality and viability of each program.
Q00|Reflexiones sobre la evolución de la economía agroalimentaria| En esta nota se describen algunas reflexiones personales acerca de los condicionamientos que han marcado la evolución de la economía agroalimentaria. Se toma Estados Unidos, como punto de partida, por la importancia de ese país en el desarrollo profesional de la profesión en todo el mundo. También se hace mención a algunos países europeos. España ocupa la siguiente parte siempre mencionando sólo algunos aspectos más relacionados con la investigación que la enseñanza. Finalmente, se expresan algunos comentarios sobre aspectos que han estado influyendo, en mayor medida, o que pudieran influir en el futuro del desarrollo profesional relacionado con la economía agroalimentaria.
Q00|Bottlenecks and Opportunities for Quality Improvement in Fresh Pineapple Supply Chains in Benin| This study mapped and diagnosed the fresh pineapple supply chains in Benin to identify bottlenecks in pineapple quality improvement for different markets. A research framework was defined that comprised all relevant aspects to be researched. After 54 semi-structured interviews with key informants, 173 structured interviews were held with actor groups. The chain diagnosis showed there was no concordance between actor groups in which quality attribute they valued most. Moreover, pineapple quality was found to be highly heterogeneous. Key bottlenecks identified were lack of training of primary producers in production practices, unconditioned transport, and unavailability of boxes for export.
Q00|Impacts of Climate Change on Economics of Forestry and Adaptation Strategies in the Southern United States| This article analyzes the impacts of different levels of forest productivity scenarios, disturbance risk, and salvageable rates resulting from climate change on the economics of loblolly pine in the southern United States. Potential adaptation strategies examined include reduction in planting density and use of slash pine instead of loblolly pine. Economic returns are most sensitive to changes in disturbance risk and productivity changes as compared with the salvage rate, planting density, or species selection. Loblolly pine with low planting density economically outperforms high-density loblolly pine. Slash pine is generally a less viable option compared with loblolly pine in most cases.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

Q00|Comparing Consumer Preferences for Livestock Production Process Attributes Across Products, Species, and Modeling Methods| Consumer preferences for four livestock products were investigated to determine consumer willingness to pay (WTP) for livestock production process attributes. We use an inferred method of attribute nonattendance (ANA) using the coefficient of variation on individual specific parameter estimates to assess the variability of preference intensity for various product characteristics. We find that accounting for ANA did not significantly impact mean estimates of WTP. Implications of our findings on the reliability of existing work in the area of consumer preferences for animal welfare attributes are discussed.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

Q00|Determination Of Spatial Integration And Substitution Of Foreign Rice For Local Rice In Ghana| This study tested for spatial integration in the rice market and the substitution of imported rice for local rice in Ghana. It is established that the markets for domestic imported rice are well-integrated, but not complete. The imperfect spatial integration of domestic foreign rice markets implies that the market provides opportunities for arbitrage. Price leadership roles are found to be determined by the kind of sub-inter-regional-trade network defined. However, in all, the Accra market emerged as a dominant market leader in the domestic foreign rice market. There is evidence of significant regional substitution of foreign rice for local rice in the long run, but the result is mixed in the short run. The result that local rice is not a perfect substitute for imported rice implies that price disincentive measures such as increasing the import tariffs on foreign rice will only produce a mild effect on increasing the producer price faced by local rice farmers, but aggravate the burden on households’ budget.
Q00|Beyond benchmarks: DEA study of Kansas Farm Productivity| This paper investigates productivity growth as measured by the Malmquist productivity index (MPI) among a sample of 331 Kansas farms between the years 1993 and 2011. The MPI index is decomposed to explore the main sources of productivity growth. Technical change (TC) is found to be the main driver of productivity growth. Previous literature cites relative prices as influential factors affecting technical change and efficiency. Two-way fixed effect regressions of efficiency and productivity measures on relative prices and lagged productivity are conducted. It is shown that past performance is a significant determinant in productivity, while statistical significance of different input and output prices vary. It is suggested that the direction of influence may be the opposite as cited in previous literature, so that past productivity improvements, and associated farm profitability, results in increased input prices.
Q00|Los sectores agroindustriales de Argentina y Brasil, 1990-2010, y su evolución comparada|Las economías de Argentina y Brasil marcaron una fuerte impronta productiva y exportadora agroindustrial en las dos últimas décadas. Ambos fueron socios iniciales y promotores de la integración regional en el Mercosur, pero presentaron a lo largo del período una evolución dispar. Los principales factores que marcaron esas diferencias debemos buscarlos en el comportamiento de los mercados internacionales, las innovaciones tecnológicas, el clima, los capitales invertidos y, en especial, la incidencia de las políticas internas de cada país. Una desproporción en el tamaño de sus mercados internos, crisis internacionales, crisis dentro de los países, devaluaciones, relaciones con otros bloques y políticas de diferente signo, fueron algunos de los desafíos por los que transitaron ambos. El objetivo de este trabajo es analizar entonces la evolución del sector de la producción agroindustrial en ambos países por medio del análisis comparativo y plantear el debate académico necesario para identificar las causas de las evoluciones dispares; así mismo, sugerir cuáles son las herramientas más útiles para el desarrollo a largo plazo de Argentina o de otros países enfrentados a disyuntivas similares.
Q00|Disease control, demographic change and institutional development in Africa|This paper addresses the role of tropical disease in rural demography and land use rights, using data from Onchocerciasis (river blindness) control in Burkina Faso. We combine a new survey of village elders with historical census data for 1975–2006 and geocoded maps of treatment under the regional Onchocerciasis Control Program (OCP). The OCP ran from 1975 to 2002, first spraying rivers to stop transmission and then distributing medicine to help those already infected. Controlling for time and village fixed effects, we find that villages in treated areas acquired larger populations and also had more cropland transactions, fewer permits required for cropland transactions, and more regulation of common property pasture and forest. These effects are robust to numerous controls and tests for heterogeneity across the sample, including time-varying region fixed effects. Descriptive statistics suggest that treated villages also acquired closer access to electricity and telephone service, markets, wells and primary schools, with no difference in several other variables. These results are consistent with both changes in productivity and effects of population size on public institutions.
Q00|The relationship between energy and equity markets: Evidence from volatility impulse response functions|This paper examines the relationship between the energy and equity markets by estimating volatility impulse response functions from a multivariate BEKK model of the Goldman Sach's Energy Index and the S&P 500; in addition, we also calculate the time varying conditional correlations and time varying dynamic hedge ratios. From volatility impulse response functions, we find that low S&P 500 returns cause substantial increases in the volatility of the energy index; however, we find only a weak response from S&P 500 volatility to energy price shocks. Moreover, our dynamic hedge ratio analysis suggests that the energy index is generally a poor hedging instrument.
Q00|The relationship between spot and futures prices: An empirical analysis|In their recent article, Tilton et al. (2011, Resour. Policy, 36, 187–195) contend on the basis of conceptual and theoretical arguments that spot and futures prices for metals and other commodities should be closely correlated during periods of strong contango and much less correlated during periods of backwardation or weak contango. If true, this hypothesis implies that speculation and investor demand, most of which takes place on futures markets, should affect spot prices much less or not at all during periods of backwardation or weak contango.
Q00|Reviewing electricity production cost assessments|A thorough review of twelve recent studies of production costs from different power generating technologies was conducted and a wide range in cost estimates was found. The reviewed studies show differences in their methodologies and assumptions, making the stated cost figures not directly comparable and unsuitable to be generalized to represent the costs for entire technologies. Moreover, current levelized costs of electricity methodologies focus only on the producer's costs, while additional costs viewed from a consumer perspective and on external costs with impact on society should be included if these results are to be used for planning. Although this type of electricity production cost assessments can be useful, the habit of generalizing electricity production cost figures for entire technologies is problematic. Cost escalations tend to occur rapidly with time, the impact of economies of scale is significant, costs are in many cases site-specific, and country-specific circumstances affect production costs. Assumptions on the cost-influencing factors such as discount rates, fuel prices and heat credits fluctuate considerably and have a significant impact on production cost results. Electricity production costs assessments similar to the studies reviewed in this work disregard many important cost factors, making them inadequate for decision and policy making, and should only be used to provide rough ballpark estimates with respect to a given system boundary. Caution when using electricity production cost estimates are recommended, and further studies investigating cost under different circumstances, both for producers and society as a whole are called for. Also, policy makers should be aware of the potentially widely different results coming from electricity production cost estimates under different assumptions.
Q00|Public sector transparency and countries’ environmental performance: A nonparametric analysis|Based on the theoretical background of the link between countries’ public sector transparency and environmental policy, our paper provides empirical evidence for a sample of 49 countries for the time period of 1995–2000. Assuming that countries’ environmental performance is a product of their environmental regulations and policies, we utilize a nonparametric estimator for investigating the link with public sector's transparency levels. Specifically, by applying conditional directional distance function models, we incorporate on the measurement of countries’ environmental performance the effect of their public sector transparency levels. In a second stage analysis applying local constant estimators, the results reveal an inverted ‘U’-shape relationship between countries’ public sector transparency levels and their environmental performance.
Q00|La nature devenue projet de compensation écologique|L’opposition homme-nature est une réalité. L’homme s’impose et détruit. Conscient de son impact sur l’environnement et des enjeux que cela entraine, des mesures juridiques ont été élaborées afin de limiter cet impact. La loi n° 76-629 du 10 juillet 1976 relative à la Protection de la Nature encadre désormais l’élaboration de certains projets et propose la mise en place de mesures destinées à éviter, réduire, voire compenser les effets néfastes que ces travaux pourraient avoir sur la nature. Bien que l’intention du législateur semble aller en faveur de l’environnement, nous verrons que la mise en application de ces nouveaux outils, et particulièrement la mise en œuvre des mesures compensatoires, pourrait tendre au contraire, à faire disparaître la nature. En effet, la compensation écologique telle que mise en pratique, vise au remplacement des écosystèmes détruits, par de nouveaux écosystèmes recréés soit in situ, soit sur un terrain à proximité du dommage. Mais peut-on réellement recréer la nature ? Notre analyse du droit et de sa mise en œuvre tentera alors de questionner cette évolution : la nature serait-elle en train de devenir un projet de compensation ?
Q00|The effect of oil prices on offshore production: evidence from the Norwegian Continental Shelf|I use detailed field-level data on Norwegian off-shore oil field production and a semi-parametric additive model to control for the production profile of fields to estimate the effect of oil prices on production. I find no significant evidence of a concurrent reaction of field production to oil prices, though a slight lagged effect is found of the magnitude of approximately 2 to 4% for a 10 dollar per barrel increase in the real price of oil. Most of this effect appears to come in the planning phase of a field’s development.
Q00|Nodal Pricing in a Coupled Electricity Market|This paper investigates a pricing model for an electricity market with a hybrid congestion management method, i.e. part of the system applies a nodal pricing scheme and the rest applies a zonal pricing scheme. The model clears the zonal and nodal pricing areas simultaneously. The nodal pricing area is affected by the changes in the zonal pricing area since it is directly connected to the zonal pricing area by commercial trading. The model is tested on a 13-node power system. Within the area that is applying nodal pricing, prices and surpluses given by the hybrid pricing model match well with those given by the full nodal pricing model. Part of the network is better utilized compared to the solutions given by the full zonal pricing model. However, the prices given by the hybrid system may send wrong economic signals which triggers unnecessary generation from existing capacities, exacerbates grid congestion, and induces higher re-dispatching costs.
Q00|Cost Efficiency Analysis based on The DEA and StoNED Models: Case of Norwegian Electricity Distribution Companies|Our paper applies data envelopment analysis (DEA) and stochastic non-parametric envelopment of data (StoNED) to measure cost efficiency of electricity distribution companies. The data cover 123 Norwegian electricity distribution companies during 2004-2010, and the performance of these companies is compared across the two models with and without environmental variables, i.e., variables that account for local conditions that affect the companies’ costs. The results indicate that the cost efficiency estimates with the StoNED approach are much higher than with the DEA method when we do not consider environmental variables. It shows that the choice of estimation methods is important with respect to the estimated impact of environmental variables on the performance. In addition, the inclusion of the environmental variables has considerable effect on the classification of companies with respect to local returns to scale.
Q00|Market Power in a Power Market with Transmission Constraints|In this paper we present a model for analysing the strategic behaviour of a generator and its short run implications on an electricity network with transmission constraints. The problem is formulated as a Stackelberg leader-follower game. The upper level problem is generator’s profit maximisation subject to the solution of the lower level problem of optimal power flow (OPF) solved by system operator. Strategic bidding is modelled as an iterative procedure where the supply functions of the competitive fringe are fixed while the strategic player’s bids are changed in a successive order until the bid giving maximum profit is found. This application rests on the assumption of supply function Nash equilibrium when the supplier believes that changes in his bids will not influence other actors to alter their bid functions. Numerical examples are presented on a simple triangular network.
Q00|Simulation of Congestion Management and Security Constraints in the Nordic Electricity Market|Presently in the Nordic day-ahead market, zonal pricing or market splitting is used for relieving congestion between a predetermined set of price areas. Constraints internal to the price areas are resolved by counter trading or redispatching in the regulation market. In a model of the Nordic electricity market we consider an hourly case from winter 2010 and present analyses of the effects of different congestion management methods on prices, quantities, surpluses and network utilization. We also study the effects of two different ways of taking into account security constraints.
Q00|Sun and Lemons: Getting over Information Asymmetries in the California Solar Market|Using detailed data of approximately 125,000 solar photovoltaic systems installed in California between 2007 and 2014 I argue that the adoption of solar panels from Chinese manufacturers and the introduction of a leasing model for solar systems are closely intertwined. First, cheaper Chinese panels allowed a leasing model to be profitable for contractors. But an asymmetric information problem exists in the market for solar panels. Solar panels are long-lived productive assets, where quality is important but costly for individual consumers to verify. Consumers can instead be expected to rely on brands and observed reliability. This led to a barrier to entry for cheaper panels from new, primarily Chinese manufacturers. The adoption of a leasing model by several large local installers solved the asymmetric information problem and led to the adoption of Chinese panels and in turn lower overall system prices.
Q00|A Nodal Pricing Model for the Nordic Electricity Market|In the Nordic day-ahead electricity market zonal pricing or market splitting is used for relieving congestion between a predetermined set of bidding areas. This congestion management method represents an aggregation of individual connection points into bidding areas, and flows from the actual electricity network are only partly represented in the market clearing. Because of several strained situations in the power system during 2009 and 2010, changes in the congestion management method have been considered by the Norwegian regulator. In this paper we discuss nodal pricing in the Nordic power market, and compare it to optimal and simplified zonal pricing, the latter being used in today’s market. A model of the Nordic electricity market is presented together with a discussion of the calibration of actual market data for four hourly case studies with different load and import/exports to the Nordic area. The market clearing optimization model incorporates thermal and security flow constraints. We analyze the effects on prices and grid constraints and quantify the benefits and inefficiencies of the different methods. We find that the price changes with nodal pricing may not be dramatic, although in cases where intra-zonal constraints are badly represented by the aggregate transfer capacities in the simplified zonal model the nodal prices may be considerably higher on average and vary more than the simplified zonal prices. On the other hand nodal prices may vary less than the simplified zonal prices if aggregate transfer capacities are set too tightly. Allowing for more prices in the Nordic power market would make dealing with capacity limits easier and more transparent.
Q00|The Causality between Quality environment, Income and Openness in Oil Exporting Countries: Panel Cointegration and Causality|This paper investigates the causal relationship between CO2 emissions and GDP in a panel of 11 selected oil exporting countries by using panel unit root tests and panel cointegration analysis for the period 1970-2011. A three-variable model is formulated with openness as the third variable. The results suggest that there is a long-run relationship between these variables. CO2 emissions have a positive long-run relationship with per capita income as well as openness, indicating economic growth tends to worsen environmental quality. The Granger Causality test indicates strong unidirectional effects from GDP and openness to CO2 emissions.
Q00|Socio-economic Effects of Mpesa Adoption on the Livelihoods of People in Bureti Sub County, Kenya|MPesa is a mobile phone based money transfer system in Kenya which grew at a blistering pace following its inception in 2007. Its adoption is country wide; both in the urban and rural areas. Mpesa enables the users to send money in electronic form, store money on a mobile phone in an electronic account and deposit or withdraw money in the form of hard currency at any of the Mpesa agents, pay bills and purchase goods and services. The purpose of the study was to identify socio-economic effects of Mpesa adoption on the livelihoods of people in Bureti Sub County. The study adopted a survey research design. The sample of study comprised of 105 Mpesa owners and operators selected purposively from three divisions: Roret; Cheborge, and Buret. Data for this study was obtained mainly from primary sources collected using a structured questionnaire. Data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was used to test hypotheses. Among the respondents 54% were male and 46% were female. The results indicate that majority (45%) of the Mpesa shops had been in operational between 2 and 3 years. The study established a positive correlation between Mpesa and creation of employment (correlation coefficient of 0.334), Mpesa and access to credit facilities with a coefficient of 0.141 and, Mpesa and income generation with a coefficient of 0.356. This shows that Mpesa operation had improved peoples’ livelihood in Bureti Sub County by creating employment opportunities, increasing income generation, access to credit facilities and social capital between families and friends. In order to fully tap the benefits of Mpesa in the area, its services should be extended to all parts of the SubCounty, as well as widening the scope of banking services to include provision of micro credits to customers.
Q00|Trade, Environment Quality and Income in MENA Region|This paper investigates the causal relationship between environmental quality, GDP and trade for MENA region countries by using panel unit root tests and panel cointegration analysis for the period 1970-2011. The results show a strong causality from GDP and trade to environmental quality in these countries. Yet, Trade and environmental quality does not have any significant effects on GDP in short- and long-run. It means that it is the trade and GDP that drives environmental quality in mentioned countries, not vice versa. So the findings of this paper support the point of view that the cost of higher trade and economic growth is paid in terms of poorer environment.
Q00|Potential For Green Building Adoption: Evidence From Kenya|The construction industry plays an important role in economic, environmental, and social development and sustainability. Several studies have demonstrated that green building evolution is key to promoting sustainability in the built environment. This paper is based on a recent research study that employed a mixed methods approach to explore the potential for adoption of green building in Kenya. The study unveiled a set of select green attributes that would provide best potential for adoption. Kenya stands out as a suitable case study because of its latitude as a leading economic hub in a region that is endowed with an abundance of natural resources, some of which could constitute renewable energy sources. Essentially, this study was timely in providing a preliminary platform for developing green building guidelines and best practices that would be meaningful to the Kenyan construction industry.
Q00|Sustainable Environment and in the Context of Environment Economy Necessary and an Analyze|In global world, the environment has become a scarce resource. Since economics is about how to deal with scarce resources, environment and economics are interrelated with each other. On the other hand it is also clear that economics which creates both positive and negative externalities, affects the environment. For this reason, it is not possible to except environmental problems from the economics. Today some socio-economic activities like increasing consumption based on shopping malls, urban regeneration, fast population growth and etc. have being created environmental cost. One way of using economics is to ensure that the costs and the benefits of environmental measures are well balanced. Although it is difficult to estimate costs and benefits, there is an increasing demand that this is should be done before the economical activity. Economic and environmental objectives are often perceived as being contradictory. It is believed that a choice must be made between one and the other and that cannot be achieved concurrently. To change this perception, some measures should be taken on both national and international level. At this point, an efficient environmental auditing is being important day by day to ensure environmental economics. In this study we will research what was done in the world in terms of environmental economics. In this context, we will examine what will have to do in Turkey in terms of legislation?
Q00|A 4-Stated DICE: Quantitatively Addressing Uncertainty Effects in Climate Change|We introduce a version of the DICE-2007 model designed for uncertainty analysis. DICE is a wide-spread deterministic integrated assessment model of climate change. Climate change, long-term economic development, and their interactions are highly uncertain. The quantitative analysis of optimal mitigation policy under uncertainty requires a recursive dynamic programming implementation of integrated assessment models. Such implementations are subject to the curse of dimensionality. Every increase in the dimension of the state space is paid for by a combination of (exponentially) increasing processor time, lower quality of the value or policy function approximations, and reductions of the uncertainty domain. The paper promotes a state-reduced, recursive dynamic programming implementation of the DICE-2007 model. We achieve the reduction by simplifying the carbon cycle and the temperature delay equations. We compare our model’s performance and that of the DICE model to the scientific AOGCM models emulated by MAGICC 6.0 and find that our simplified model performs equally well as the original DICE model. Our implementation solves the infinite planning horizon problem in an arbitrary time step. The paper is the first to carefully analyze the quality of the value function approximation using two different types of basis functions and systematically varying the dimension of the basis. We present the closed form, continuous time approximation to the exogenous (discretely and inductively defined) processes in DICE, and we present a numerically more efficient re-normalized Bellman equation that, in addition, can disentangle risk attitude from the propensity to smooth consumption over time.

Q00|Cuisine – a Regional Tourism Differentiation Tool|"Good for the stomach, but excellent also for business, gastronomic tourism has flourished greatly in the previous year’s having an adventurous and exotic side, but at the same time allowing direct contact with the cuisine of a country and a healthy ""serving"" conditions as it really is and not as often inaccurately describes the dozen brochures or travel guides. Gastronomic tourism addresses both amateurs in search of new recipes and unique culinary indulgences and professionals involved in the food industry or tourism, for both there is currently prime destinations interest either in Europe or overseas or in faraway Asia. Our article tries to find as far as possible the culinary particularities of the various that could generate interest from tourists, and to accomplish this we made a descriptive exploratory research based on the data available online. Finally we present our findings and conclusions."
Q00|Fodder Production Scenario and Strategies for Revitalizing Fodder Production Technologies|Livestock production is the backbone of Indian agriculture and also plays a key role in providing employment especially in rural areas. This sector has been the primary source of energy for agriculture operation and major source of animal protein for masses. Therefore, India has been the home of major draught, milch and dual-purpose breeds of cattle. Indian dairy production system is complex and generally based on traditional and socioeconomic considerations. However, there has been a rapid change in way of agriculture (i.e. cropping system, water resources, diversification of crops, intensification of agriculture), increasing use of mechanical power, transformation from sustenance farming to market oriented farming, changing food habits etc., All these factors have their impact on animal husbandry practices. Livestock rearing in India is changing fast and there has been a rise in demand of milch cattle as compared to dual or draught breeds. The paper tries to deal with the issues and strategies for revitalizing fodder production in India.
