N63|The year 1819 epitomizing the issues and challenges of modernity after the Revolution and Empire|After the recess imposed by the intensification of Napoleonic wars and defeat in 1810-1815, the Restauration regime had to restart the leverage forces of growth. Economic and academic elites struggled to conceive the paths of renewal of innovative and entrepreneurial spirits, in order to foster French competitiveness. The philosophy of liberalism was renewed; calls for innovation, for spreading new techniques across industry, and to stimulate refreshed flows of savings and banking loans constituted a package able to renew with the hopes of the 1795-1810 years. Thus the 1819 year could be inserted into intercrossing schemes of narrative and business histories as it gathered so many signs of such a renewal and of the move towards the first industriel and banking revolutions.
N63|Building Workers in Madrid (1737-1805). New Wage Series and Working Lives|This paper provides new series of building wages for 18th-century Madrid. At an international level, the usual point of reference for Spain during the 18th century is the wage series that Earl Hamilton compiled (and Robert Allen included in his database) using the payrolls from the construction of the Royal Palace of Madrid. However, Hamilton did not fully exploit the rich information that those data provide about wage rates, skills and labour force participation. Contrary to the simplicity of the labour categories in Hamilton’s series, our results show the existence of a complex world of skills and, consequently, of wage rates that only come to the surface when we reconstruct the working lives of the thousands of workers who participated in the building of the new palace. The new data presented in this paper provide some new insights into the functioning of labour markets and the complexity of wage (and even human capital) formation in pre-industrial Madrid.
N63|Women Leaders in Industry in Nineteenth Century France: The Case of Amélie de Dietrich|This article traces the history of Amelie de Dietrich’s role - from 1806 to her death in 1855 - as the head of one of the oldest family-owned businesses: the De Dietrich company. Amelie took important strategic decisions to adapt the company to the new economic opportunities in the metal sector, which arose in the first half of the nineteenth century. Her choices were decisive for the future of the company; what is more, she succeeded in restoring the familial ownership. Given the entrenched assumptions about gender roles prevalent in the early nineteenth century, how can we explain her success in meeting such difficult challenges? Relying on Amélie de Dietrich’s own unpublished correspondence, this contribution examines the factors that explain her success in imposing herself as a Maître des Forges. It thus underlines women’s role – as business leaders – during the industrialization process.
N63|Secrets for sale? Innovation and the nature of knowledge in an early industrial district: the Potteries, 1750-1851|This paper investigates innovation and knowledge in the North Staffordshire Potteries during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. It evaluates new empirical evidence of formal and informal patterns of knowledge creation and dissemination in order to highlight tensions between forms of open knowledge sharing and the appropriation of returns to innovative activity. By presenting new patent data it shows that formal protection was not a widespread strategy in the industry. It uses patent specifications to determine what specific types of knowledge were, and could be, patented in the district, and by whom. A range of sources are used to demonstrate evidence of innovation and knowledge appropriation outside of the patent system. The paper identifies distinct types of knowledge in the industry and shows how differences in these led to a range of strategies being employed by potters, with the role of secrecy highlighted as a particularly prevalent and effective strategy.
N63|Machinery and horse power prices, 1850-1913|"""The debate on industrial revolution (IR) has been focused on the incentives behind investment deci- sions and how the preliminary conditions to allow this phenomena were situated in England. One of the most famous and original theories to explain IR is the developed by (Allen, 2012, 2009b,a), who taking into account a vast literature on organic fuels and the transition to fossil fuels (WRIGLEY, 1962; Wrigley, 2013), argues that the reason why IR was British is the unique combination of expensive labour and cheap en- ergy. This combination produces the incentives to invest in labour saving machinery. Several works have proved the existence of cheap fossil fuels during the XIX century, determined by the introduction of coal. Figures and indicators on wages and energy are broadly accepted, however, machinery price indexes are at least discussed and the elaboration of the most used index is based almost completely in the iron price (Feinstein (1972, 1988). To prove the Allen hypothesis we require a better index on machinery, measur- ing horsepower prices, relative costs and changes in their international trade. Using novel data based on merchants catalogues, several international trade statistics plus all the price indexes available, this article presents a improved machinery price index for UK in the period 1850 - 1913; given the influence of British Machinery & Equipment in the world market until 1913, this price index could be useful to understand relative costs transformation in several regions."""
N63|Looking for work? Or looking for workers? Days and hours of work in London construction in the eighteenth century|Abstract This paper provides new information and data on how work and pay actually operated for skilled and semi-skilled men on large London construction projects in the early 1700s, and for the first time, offers detailed firm level evidence on the number of days per year worked by men. Construction workersâ€™ working days were bounded by structural factors of both supply and demand, men worked a far lower number of days than has been assumed until now. This has implications for our understanding of the â€˜industrious revolutionâ€™, and industrialisation.
N63|Spinning their Wheels: A Reply to Jane Humphries and Benjamin Schneider|Abstract Jane Humphries and Benjamin Schneider have assembled several large data bases of spinnersâ€™ production and wages that they believe disprove my view that high wages led to mechanization in eighteenth century England. This paper examines their data and shows that they have little value in understanding the incentives to mechanize. They collected thousands of observations of the earnings of women, but they do not know how many hours the spinners worked, so the data fail to establish whether their wage per hour (the relevant variable) was high or low. Another large sample of evidence concerned the production per day of spinners, but this information was mainly derived from schools and charity programs whose participants were selected because they were unproductiveâ€“so valid inferences about the productivity of women in general cannot be derived from these data. In addition, I present new evidence that substantiates my earlierestimates of productivity and earnings. The High Wage Hypothesis is unimpaired by the critique of Humphries and Schneider.

Global History indisputably has contributed with a theoretical perspective in this achievement. However, in this literature lacks more studies in the long term and in more specific geographical units. This research intends to contribute with a case study in two specific European ports: Marseille and Seville. The study is about the consumption of Chinese silk fabrics in 1680 – 1840 period and has as aim find the way like these commodities change the taste and pattern of consumption in local population preparing the receipt of Silk fabrics with Chinese taste made in Europe in an import substitution process. An innovation in the research is the use of Chinese sources and the database of GECEM project

N63|The Growth of the Italian Economy, 1861-1913: Revised Second-Generation Expenditure-Side Estimates|This paper presents revised expenditure-side constant-price historical national accounts for Italy from Unification to 1913. The extant estimates at 1911 prices by the present author on the one hand and Alberto Baffigi on the other are both derived from the better-documented production side, but with significantly different algorithms and results. The new estimates are based on the new, extensively revised production-side accounts; the underlying methodology remains the present author’s, arguably altogether sounder than Baffigi’s.
N63|The Growth of the Italian Economy, 1861−1913: The Composition Of Investment|Previous papers on Italy’s economic growth from Unification to 1913 reestimated 1911-price GDP from the production side, and reconstructed its allocation on the expenditure side; both efforts sharply revised the latest figures in the literature. The present paper examines the composition of investment, as documented by the new series.
N63|The Fruits of Disaggregation: the Engineering Industry, Tariff Protection, and the Industrial Investment Cycle in Italy, 1861-1913|All the extant interpretations of united Italy's early industrial development focus on the long swing in industrial investment evident in the familiar indices of the engineering industry's aggregate product. Disaggregated production series for that industry have now been compiled. The evidence they incorporate establishes that the long swing that dominates the aggregate was actually in the production of hardware, tied to investment in infrastructure. The production of machinery followed a different path: against the extant literature it shows that tariff hikes were influential, and above all that industry's purchases of (domestic and foreign) equipment grew very steadily decade after decade. Industrial investment did not grow faster than before in the 1880s or over the belle Ã©poque, it did not follow the long swing at all: the disaggregation of the engineering-industry product series has undercut the empirical premise of sixty years of scholarship.
N63|The Age Distribution of the Labour Force as Evidence of Prior Events: The Italian Data for 1911 and the Long Swing in Investment from Unification to the Great War|Data on the age distribution of the labour force, by activity, appear in numerous early twentieth-century European censuses; but economic historians seem never to have explored them. This paper provides an initial examination of the age-distribution data in the Italian census of 1911, showing how they shed light on various aspects of the economy of the day, and on its preceding path. A point of particular interest is that these data reflect the long cycle in construction, and in the production of construction materials. They further suggest that the long cycle of the engineering industry documented by its aggregate metal consumption was indeed present in the production of construction-related hardware, but notably absent from the production of machinery and, derivatively, industrial investment. This last point denies the empirical premise of the extant interpretations of Italy's post-Unification industrial growth; but it sits we ll with the new disaggregated time-series estimates of the engineering industry's product.
N63|The Political Economics of Growth, Labor Control and Coercion: Evidence from a Suffrage Reform|In this paper, we analyze how a suffrage reform in 1862/63 that shifted the de jure distribution of political power from landowners to industrialists affected Sweden’s industrialization and economic and social development from the 1860s to the 1910s. Using a newly constructed, comprehensive historical data set of the universe of approximately 2,400 Swedish local governments, we document that the change in suffrage affected a very large number of development and social outcomes at the local level, such as labor coercion, factor price manipulation in the form of entry barriers including investments in local public goods (i.e., schooling) and transportation (i.e., local railways), the real wage structure, technology adoption in both agriculture and industry, labor productivity in both agriculture and industry, changes in the composition of employment and the structure of production, demographic transition, organized labor, and persistence in dysfunctional local political institutions. Our findings are consistent with the idea that political institutions are a key determinant of long-run development and growth. Specifically, our results suggest that politically powerful landowners can block economic development using labor coercion and factor price manipulation, i.e., using entry barriers and other distortionary policies.
N63|Drivers of industrialisation: intersectoral evidence from the Low Countries in the nineteenth century|In this paper, we trace the causes of regional industrial development in the nineteenth century Low Countries by disentangling the complex relationship between industrialisation, technological progress and human capital formation. We use sectoral differences in the application of technology and human capital as the central elements to explain the rise in employment in the manufacturing sector during the nineteenth century, and our findings suggest a re-interpretation of the deskilling debate. To account for differences among manufacturing sectors, we use population and industrial census data, subdivided according to their present-day manufacturing sector equivalents of the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC). Instrumental variable regression analysis revealed that employment in the manufacturing sector was influenced by so-called upper- tail knowledge and not by average educational levels, providing empirical proof of a so-called deskilling industrialisation process. However, we find notable differences between manufacturing sectors. The textiles and clothing sectors show few agglomeration effects and limited use of steam-powered engines, and average education levels cannot adequately explain regional industrialisation. In contrast, the location of the fast- growing and innovative machinery-manufacturing sector was more influenced by technology and the availability of human capital, particularly upper-tail knowledge captured by secondary school attendance rates.
N63|The Growth of the Italian Economy, 1861-1913: Revised Second-Generation Production-Side Estimates|This paper presents revised production-side constant-price historical national accounts for Italy from Unification to 1913; these amend the extant estimates at 1911 prices by the present author on the one hand and Alberto Baffigi on the other. The time series are updated to allow for short-term movements of agricultural production, to include the results of recent research on industry, to remove conspicuous overestimates in the services sector, and more: estimated total product appears more volatile, and generally lower, than the extant series suggest.
N63|Common Factors, spatial dependence, and regional growth in the Italian manufacturing industry|We review the methods currently available for the analysis of regional datasets characterised by possible non-stationarity over time and both strong and weak spatial dependence and present, as a representative case study, a comparative analysis of the regional development of the Italian manufacturing industries in the second halves of the 19th and 20th centuries. For highly heterogenous datasets we suggest a two-stages approach: (1) fit a dynam factor model with endogenous determination of the number of factors; (2) estimate a spatial model for the de-factored data. Applying this strategy we find two similar non-stationary afctors sufficient to explain long-run growth of the whole set of series examined in both centuries. Further, the results suggest that some conditional spatial error correction mechanisms seem to have been in action in both centuries.
N63|Negocio, tecnología e instituciones en la molienda del trigo en Castilla la Vieja y León a mediados del siglo XVIII|This text offers an approximation to the milling of wheat in the middle of the eighteenth century with respect to its mercantile, technological and institutional nature. For this purpose, the general responses of the Catastro del Marqués de la Ensenada in Palencia have been used. The hypothesis is that the conditions for obtaining flour were extremely archaic in these three dimensions, but at the same time efficient enough to guarantee the bread supply to the Castilian population without altering the status quo between the nobility, the church and the councils. However, a review of the accounts of the large wheat mills reveals that this balance started to break down around 1780, just when the new Enlightenment agricultural policy was implemented.
N63|"A replication of ""Education and catch-up in the industrial revolution"" (American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, 2011)"|Although European economic history provides essentially no support for the view that education of the general population has a positive causal effect on economic growth, a recent paper by Becker, Hornung and Woessmann (Education and Catch-Up in the Industrial Revolution, 2011) claims that such education had a significant impact on Prussian industrialisation. The author shows that the instrumental variable BHW use to identify the causal effect of education is correlated with variables that influenced industrialisation but were omitted from their regression models. When this specification error is corrected, and a systematic model selection procedure is used, the evidence shows that education of the general population had, if anything, a negative causal impact on industrialisation in Prussia.
N63|Population Size Effects in the Structural Development of England|The English structural transformation from farming to manufacturing was accompanied by rapid technological change, expansion of trade, and massive population growth. While the roles of technology and trade in this process have been investigated, the literature has largely ignored the role of population growth. We examine population size effects on various aspects of structural development, characterizing their explicit dependence on preference-side and production-side characteristics of the economy, and trade. Our quantitative analysis of the English transformation assigns a major role to population growth, with especially notable contributions to post-1750 rise in the manufacturing employment share and the relative price dynamics.

The gradual emergence of breweries, mainly by master brewers from German states, led to this sector becomingthe second industry in importance in Madrid behind heavy industry during the eighteen sixties. Also, reducing the distance from the price of beer compared to wine and institutional protection in tax and foreign trade regulations would encourage beer consumption in Madrid to widen its leadership in Spain.

N63|Niveles de vida biológicos en Castilla-La Mancha durante el siglo XX . El caso de Hellín|This article analyzes the biological quality of life in south-eastern Castile-La Mancha during the 20th century through a case study. The objective is to determine the extent of the biological well-being in a primarily agricultural community characterized by relative poverty and backwardness. By using the heights of the military recruits of Hellin from 1908-1985, the results show that the average heights were among the lowest in Spain. This was despite the substantial increase in biological well-being in the second half of the twentieth century, suggesting that nutritional status poverty was much more widespread than in the Mediterranean Spain. It concludes that the socioeconomic changes had a significant influence on the case analyzed, which showed a poorer biological quality of life compared to that of the nearby towns of Murcia and Valencia, and the decline in the mean height became more evident in times of privation and scarcity.

N63|Le ferriere genovesi in età preindustriale: aspetti tecnici, innovazioni e declino [Genoese ironworks in preindustrial age: techniques, innovations and decline]|"These pages take up very briefly, the results of a series of research on ""The steel industry of the Ligurian ancient regime (sec. XV-XIX): technical, settlement, language"", one of the first activities developed by the Centre for Study of History Technology (CSST) of CNR of Genoa, since the early seventies. The study on the local production of iron in the pre-industrial age, has identified a number of production sites in particular settled Ligurian Apennines, the detecting method of reduction of iron ore - direct method of low fire - and technical innovations adopted in the production process, from bellows to idroeholic machine, the change in the composition of the charge: iron ore, scrap iron in different percentages and fluxes. They did not miss, in the course of research, comparisons with other steel settlements that used the same method of the low fire, particularly the ironworks Catalan and also references to other production sites that operated differently, with the indirect method or blast furnace, just in the neighboring Tuscan area. Research has achieved a sufficiently clear activity practiced by the genoese steel industry ironworks of old regime, considering all the technical-scientific difficulties accompanying historical aspects.Therefore, this paper highlights some moments, especially economic and technical, of a very broad research and aims to point out some possible interpretations that have emerged during that long period of investigation. However, the interpretation of the low fire Genoese as technical back, compared to the blast furnace ""at the Brescian way"" and that has been given by researchers from the CSST - while trying appreciation historic - a recent article that we point out in the course of these pages, provides useful information for the genoese technical not considering it outdated compared to contemporary blast furnace ""at the Brescian way""; in fact, the Genoese being linked to the elbano mineral could not operate differently, demonstrating among other things, most suitable technique. Therefore, suggestions and criticisms in the historical re-reading of one of the oldest and main activity are welcomed, and all that requires further study, in view of the fact that the old genoese ironworks also lost the memory, in favor of more recent term ""Catalan"".Finally, to investigate historical technique of ancient genoese ironworks we also give here a small push to observe and investigate historically the subsequent to the current complex technical steel works (when it was possible to give more toughness to the steel using the alloys) in consideration that the steel industry and metallurgy, despite the increasing scientific knowledge of metal properties, is still today an essentially empirical activity in which the production of new alloys stimulates the search and, substantially, takes place proceeding by trial and error."
N63|The revealed comparative advantages of late-Victorian Britain|This paper calculates indicators of revealed comparative advantage (RCA) and revealed symmetric comparative advantage (RSCA) for 17 British manufacturing industries for the years 1880, 1890, and 1900. The resulting indicators show that the late-Victorian ‘workshop of the world’ was at a marked comparative disadvantage in a number of manufacturing industries. The paper then proceeds to identify the factor determinants of Britain’s manufacturing comparative advantages (disadvantages) using a four-factor Heckscher-Ohlin model that relies upon these indicators. In contrast with previous scholarship, the manufacturing comparative advantages of late-Victorian Britain were in the relatively labour non-intensive industries, and this pattern became more pronounced throughout the period. The paper concludes with the observation that the factor determinants of Britain’s manufacturing comparative advantages appear closer to those of the United States than had traditionally been thought.

N63|To be or not to be? Risk attitudes and gender differences in union membership|Attracting membership while stifling freeriding and heterogeneous preferences among potential members is critical for trade union success. Women are generally seen as less inclined to join trade unions, particularly at the onset of the labor movement. We highlight a previously neglected explanation for this: the importance of risk and gender differences in assessment hereof. We study matched employer-employee data from two industries around the year 1900 where union membership was associated with different levels of risk: the Swedish cigar and printing industries. We find that the gender gap in membership was larger in the high-risk environment (cigar) and smaller in the low-risk environment (printing). Women were not hard to organize but avoided risks and uncertain returns.
N63|The Hand-Loom Weaver and the Power Loom: A Schumpeterian Perspective|Abstract: Schumpeterâ€™s â€˜perennial gale of creative destructionâ€™ blew strongly through Britain during the Industrial Revolution, as the factory mode of production displaced the cottage mode in many industries. A famous example is the shift from hand loom weaving to the use of power looms in mills. As the use of power looms expanded, the price of cloth fell, and the â€˜golden age of the hand loom weaverâ€™ gave way to poverty and unemployment. This paper argues that the fates of the hand and machine processes were even more closely interwoven. With the expansion of factory spinning in the 1780s, the demand for hand loom weavers soared in order to process the newly available cheap yarn. The rise in demand raised the earnings of hand loom weavers, thereby, creating the â€˜golden ageâ€™. The high earnings also increased the profitability of developing the power loom by raising the value of the labour that it saved. This meant that less efficientâ€“hence, cheaper to develop--power looms could be brought into commercial use than would have been the case had the golden age not occurred. The counterfactual possibilities are explored with a model of the costs of weaving by hand and by power. The cottage mode of production was an efficient system of producing cloth, but it self-destructed as its expansion after 1780 raised the demand for sector-specific skills, thus providing the incentive for inventors to develop a power technology to replace it. The power loom, in turn, devalued the old skills, so poverty accompanied progress.
N63|Spinning the Industrial Revolution|Abstract: The prevailing explanation for why the Industrial Revolution occurred first in Britain is Robert Allenâ€™s (2009) â€˜highâ€ wage economyâ€™ view, which claims that the high cost of labour relative to capital and fuel incentivized innovation and the adoption of new techniques. This paper presents new empirical evidence on hand spinning before the Industrial Revolution and demonstrates that there was no such â€˜highâ€ wage economyâ€™ in spinning, a leading sector of industrialization. We quantify the working lives of frequently ignored female and child spinners who were crucial to the British textile industry in the Early Modern period with evidence of productivity and wages from the late sixteenth to the early nineteenth century. Our results show that spinning was a widespread, lowâ€ wage, lowâ€ productivity employment, in line with the Humphries (2013) view of the motivations for the factory system.
N63|Multiproduct Cournot oligopoly|We present a general Cournot model in which each firm may sell multiple quality-differentiated products. We use an upgrades approach, working not with the actual products, but instead with upgrades from one quality to the next. The properties of single-product Cournot models carry over to the supply of upgrades, but not necessarily to the supply of complete products. A firm`s product line is determined by the properties of demand, its costs, and competitor characteristics. For symmetric firms, these determinants reduce to returns to quality and changes in demand elasticity as quality increases. For asymmetric firms whose (potentially endogenous) technological capabilities are defined by their maximum feasible qualities, gaps in product lines are determined precisely by the capabilities of lesser rivals. Strategic commitment to product lines prior to quantity competition is considered. Incentives to so commit are markedly different from those under price-setting models.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

This dubious image of artisans inherited, on the one hand, from the political culture of the French Revolution, which connected this particular way of organizing work with the society of orders and privileges, and on the other hand with a ?large enterprise culture? that has characterized the analyses of several French historians, is today being questioned.

N63|Italian Industrial Production, 1861-1913: A Statistical Reconstruction. D. The Chemical, Coal and Petroleum Products, and Rubber Industries|This paper is the fourth section of Italian Industrial Production, 1861 1913: A Statistical Reconstruction (in progress). It documents the derivation, from the historical sources, of the 88 time series that trace the physical product of the chemical industry, of the further nine series that trace the physical product of the coal and petroleum products industries, of the single series that traces the physical product of the rubber industry, and of the corresponding estimates of value added per unit at 1911 prices. The series for coal and petroleum products and most modern chemicals (e.g., fertilizers, electrochemicals) are derived directly from the sources, albeit with frequent interpolations between early benchmarks; those for traditional chemicals (e.g., fats and oils, pharmaceuticals) are teased out from indirect evidence; and the rubber-products series is estimated from the apparent consumption of the raw material.

The Metalmaking Industries|This paper is the fifth section of Italian Industrial Production, 1861 1913: A Statistical Reconstruction (in progress). It documents the derivation, from the historical sources, of the four time series that trace the physical product of the ferrous-metals industry, of the further 12 series that trace the physical product of the non-ferrous-metals industries, and of the corresponding estimates of value added per unit at 1911 prices. The pig iron and rail series are taken almost directly from the sources; the semi-finished wrought iron and steel series extensively corrects the figures in the sources over the later decades, and is estimated from the apparent consumption of pig and scrap, allowing for cast iron, over the early ones; the cast iron series is estimated by interpolating widely separated benchmarks on the assumption that the ratio of cast iron to wrought iron and steel in final consumption followed a smoothly declining path. The non-ferrous-metal ingot production series are taken relatively directly from the sources; the corresponding semi-finished-metal series are typically estimated from the apparent consumption of ingot and scrap metal.
N63|Italian Industrial Production, 1861 1913: A Statistical Reconstruction. F. The Engineering Industries|This paper is the sixth section of Italian Industrial Production, 1861 1913: A Statistical Reconstruction (in progress). It documents the derivation, from the historical sources, of the 26 time series that trace the physical product of the engineering industry, of the corresponding estimates of value added per unit at 1911 prices, and of the further 19 series that trace the industryâ€™s maintenance activity. The shipbuilding and rail-guided-vehicles industries are well documented. The naval-construction series are built up from micro-data, the merchant-construction series from production data; maintenance is indexed by the corresponding fleets, allowing for trade in the maintenance of merchant vessels. The rail-guided-vehicle new production series are built up from abundant data on units acquired, converting these to weight and deducting imports; maintenance is indexed by the weight of the stocks in service (and, in the case of railway vehicles, annual mileage). The rest of the industry is poorly documented. The new production of fabricated metal goods, general equipment, and precision equipment is estimated, together with the corresponding maintenance, using census data to document the composition of the industry at periodic benchmarks, stock (and usage) indices to track maintenance, trade data to document the short-term movements of the various markets for new goods, and aggregate metal consumption as an overall constraint.
N63|Italian Industrial Production, 1861 1913: A Statistical Reconstruction. J. The Utilities Industries|This paper is the tenth section of Italian Industrial Production, 1861 1913: A Statistical Reconstruction (in progress). It documents the derivation, from the historical sources, of the eight time series that trace the product of the utilities industries, and of the corresponding estimates of value added per unit at 1911 prices. The electric utilities are relatively well documented by data on capacity and utilization; separate series trace the production (and distribution) of thermal power on the one hand and hydraulic power on the other. The production of the gas utilities is tracked by separate series for gas, coke, and tar. Data are abundant from the 1890s; the estimates for the earlier years are anchored by an early benchmark, but otherwise largely interpolated. The water utilities are represented by separate series for the exceptional Apulian aqueduct, the other aqueducts, and the local distribution systems. The real product of the Apulian aqueduct, still incomplete, is tracked by the embodied capital. The real product of the other aqueducts is tracked by their equivalent ton-kilometers (the square root of the yield, to allow for economies of scale, times length), estimated from cross-section evidence that includes construction dates. The real product of the local nets is measured by their length (augmented to allow for wells and cisterns), itself reconstructed from sporadic local data.
N63|Italian Industrial Production, 1861 1913: A Statistical Reconstruction. K. The Construction Industries|This paper is the eleventh section of Italian Industrial Production, 1861 1913: A Statistical Reconstruction (in progress). It documents the derivation, from the historical sources, of the time series that track the 1911-price value added of the construction industries. The path of railway and tramway construction is estimated from physical indicators. Construction to extend the (major/minor) railways and (urban/suburban, machine/horse) tramways is estimated from the annual completed mileage of the various networks, and the corresponding maintenance is estimated from track length and use; construction for (railway-net) improvements is indexed by rail consumption in excess of that required for network extensions. The new construction and maintenance of other public works are estimated from the expenditure figures in the national and local budgets, significantly corrected for changes in accounting rules, suitably scaled and deflated. The new construction and maintenance of private social overhead capital are estimated in part as expenditure (calculated for example from the matching public subsidy for land-reclamation projects), suitably deflated, and in part from physical indicators (for example of the additions to the productive capacity and distribution networks of the private utilities). The new construction and maintenance of private residential and commercial buildings are calculated by deflating assessment-based estimates of the gross additions to the stock, and of the stock itself, allowing for the buildings that were statutorily exempt. An index of urban construction is also estimated from the binder-consumption data available for a few dozen cities.
N63|The industrial geography of Italy: provinces, regions and border effects, 1871-1911|"""Italy has been characterized, throughout its unified history, by large regional differentials in the level of industrialization. This paper looks at the distribution of industrial employment in the period 1871–1911. Using provincial industrial employment from Ciccarelli and Missiaia (2013) we address the question whether the change in the industrial employment at provincial level depends on the change in the industrial employment in the neighbouring provinces. The methodology proposed by Overman and Puga (2002) use neighbouring effects, based on neighbours employment, as explanatory variables for change in industrial employment. The same exercise is repeated using pre-unitary borders to define neighbours, in order to assess the persistence of pre-1861 institutions on the industrial geography of unified Italy. The main result of the paper is that regional borders did matter in shaping the industrial geography of Italy. We find that the change in provincial industrial employment is positively affected by the change of the neighbouring provinces belonging to the same region but negatively from the change of the neighbouring provinces belonging to another region. When the pre-unitary borders are used, the findings are basically confirmed."""
N63|Height and Industrialisation in a City in Catalonia during the Nineteenth Century|Drawing on anthropometric information, this article investigates the evolution of the biological standard of living in nineteenth-century Catalonia. We focus on the city of Igualada, one of Catalonia’s main textile centres in the early part of the century. The results show a decline in the height of males born between the 1830s and the 1860s, the period in which factory-based industrialisation emerged and became consolidated. The article also suggests that height inequality rose during the third quarter of the nineteenth century. The empirical evidence gathered provides further support for the pessimistic view of the evolution of the standard of living during the early stages of industrialisation.
N63|Industrial Employment in Italy, 1911: The Burden of the Census Data|In Italy two censuses were taken in 1911: the usual demographic census, that contains labor-force data, and the first industrial census, that contains employment data. The two yield aggregate figures that are very far apart. The literature directly concerned with estimating industrial employment considers the industrial-census figures essentially exhaustive. In point of fact, the industrial census was self-admittedly, grossly incomplete, and its coverage of small-scale manufacturing, and construction, is particularly poor; the extant estimates badly underestimate total industrial employment, and badly distort its allocation by sector. Far better estimates of employment are obtained from the labor-force data, allowing for sector-specific unemployment and other distortions.
N63|Monks, Gents and Industrialists: The Long-Run Impact of the Dissolution of the English Monasteries|We examine the long-run economic impact of the Dissolution of the English monasteries in 1535, which is plausibly linked to the commercialization of agriculture and the location of the Industrial Revolution. Using monastic income at the parish level as our explanatory variable, we show that parishes which the Dissolution impacted more had more textile mills and employed a greater share of population outside agriculture, had more gentry and agricultural patent holders, and were more likely to be enclosed. Our results extend Tawney's famous ‘rise of the gentry’ thesis by linking social change to the Industrial Revolution.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N63|Temporary Shocks and Persistent Effects in the Urban System: Evidence from British Cities after the U.S. Civil War|Urban economies are often heavily reliant on a small number of dominant industries, leaving them vulnerable to negative industry-specific shocks. This paper analyzes the long-run impacts of one such event: the large, temporary, and industry-specific shock to the British cotton textile industry caused by the U.S. Civil War (1861-1865), which dramatically reduced supplies of raw cotton. Because the British cotton textile industry was heavily concentrated in towns in Northwest England, I compare patterns in these cotton towns to other English cities. I find that the shock had a persistent negative effect on the level of city population lasting at least 35 years with no sign of diminishing. Decomposing the effect by industry, I show that the shock to cotton textiles was transmitted to other local firms, leading to increased bankruptcies and long-run reductions in employment. This transmission occurred primarily through the link to capital suppliers, such as machinery and metal-goods producers. Roughly half of the reduction in city-level employment growth was due to the impact on industries other than cotton textiles.
N63|Consideraciones acerca de la «hidráulica feudal» desde la perspectiva de los molinos valencianos (siglos XIII-XVIII)|The enormous economic and social importance of water on the Mediterranean coast adds significance to the theoretical frameworks employed in explaining water uses. It is rewarding to compare monographs on mills in feudal Valencia with the proposal drawn up by Miquel Barceló (and followed by the “agrarian archaeology” group). Their statement of general approach has helped to conceptualise data, yet case studies published since 1988 suggest the need for a new appraisal of this topic. Water use in feudal societies cannot be analysed with no theoretical framework to guide it, using empiricism alone, nor can its foundations be a mere appendage of Andalusian water systems. Institutional features, such as local control based on communal cooperation, flexible operating mechanisms used to distribute water flows, consensual rules for irrigators, and the formulas employed to limit the enormous potential for conflict over water are important when examining the social strategies adopted. It is therefore imperative to launch a discussion of the challenge of building a family of models that shed light on the features of feudal water systems in the Mediterranean. Given its usefulness in attracting the interest of researchers to the critical study of constant institutional adjustments, the proposal by Arthur Maass and T.E Glick should play an important role in addressing this complicated matter.
N63|Notarial Credit in Eighteenth-Century Trentino: Dynamics and Trends|This paper investigates the informal credit market in Trentino in the second half of the eighteenth century by drawing upon notaries' loan contracts. The analysis focuses on four benchmark years: 1750, 1760, 1770, and 1780. More than 10,000 contracts from the period were examined, including 1,200 credit transactions registered in two different cities, Trent and Rovereto. The research aims to analyze dynamics and trends, as well as the mechanisms that characterize the two credit markets, specifically who the borrowers and the lenders were, what capital was borrowed for, and at what price. The findings show stark differences between the two cities' financial markets. In Trent, whose population amounted to some 9,000, credit activity accounted for 7.7% of all notarial transactions, whereas in nearby Rovereto, with about half that population, credit contracts represented twice as much, 15% of business. Likewise, capital flow reflects the different nature and dynamism of the two towns. In Trent, loans were mainly to finance agriculture and the urban economy (craftsmen, retailers). In Rovereto, where capital flow was nearly three times that of Trent, went largely to sustain agriculture and the flourishing international silk trade. The political and institutional frameworks around the two towns were indeed quite different. Trent, as the capital of the Prince- Bishopric, was chiefly an administrative town and apparently impervious to innovation. But Rovereto, part of the Habsburg Monarchy, was a well-integrated node in an international trade network of rapidly expanding silk manufacturing, whose growth was fostered by the vivid and effective credit market.
N63|Immigration and the Diffusion of Technology: The Huguenot Diaspora in Prussia|This paper analyzes long-term effects of skilled-worker immigration on productivity for the Huguenot migration to Prussia. In 1685, religiously persecuted French Huguenots settled in Brandenburg- Prussia and compensated for population losses due to plagues during the Thirty Years' War. We combine Huguenot immigration lists from 1700 with Prussian firm-level data on the value of inputs and outputs in 1802 in a unique database to analyze the effects of skilled immigration to places with underused economic potential. Exploiting this settlement pattern in an instrumental-variable approach, we find substantial long-term effects of Huguenot settlement on the productivity of textile manufactories.
N63|The French Revolution and German industrialization: The new institutional economics rewrites history|Our purpose here is to challenge the big-bang approach to economic history in which some alleged institutional imposition - a deus machine - is claimed to launch a series of new economic behaviors. This so-called prime mover is then carried forward by the inexorable forces of path dependency to change the course of history. The specific creation story under investigation here is the French Revolution and the subsequent Napoleonic conquest of parts of Germany. We show that recent efforts to re-write German economic history using this theoretical model cannot be supported by the abundant and concerted empirical evidence.

Este trabajo persigue dos objetivos básicos. Primero, conocer las diferentes etapas de la historia empresarial del agua envasada y la configuración de los grandes grupos empresariales que dominan el mercado actual. Con este fin, se aporta nueva información estadística sobre la producción y el consumo de agua embotellada desde una perspectiva de largo plazo y se reconstruyen las historias empresariales de las principales marcas de agua de envasada de Francia, Italia y Alemania, grandes líderes del mercado. Segundo, se analiza el sector de las aguas embotelladas en España, un país que en las últimas décadas ha conseguido escalar posiciones de manera espectacular en el ranking europeo, tanto en términos de producción como en consumo per capita
N63|The Deindustrial Revolution: The Rise & Fall of UK Manufacturing, 1870-2010|This paper considers the evolution of the manufacturing sector in the UK since 1870. It analyses the contribution of manufacturing to national income, employment and trade. From 1870 to 1960, manufacturing played a key role in the development of the economy, undergirding success in other sectors of the economy and securing rising living standards. The subsequent fifty years, from 1960, have witnessed a relative decline of the UK manufacturing sector - relative to other sectors of the economy, and relative to the manufacturing sectors in other countries. The paper considers the thesis that the relative decline of manufacturing is a natural outcome of the development of advanced economies, and the counter-arguments suggesting that decline of UK manufacturing reflected economic weaknesses and structural imbalances. We argue that in the case of the UK, the relative decline of manufacturing has indeed reflected deep-rooted structural problems. In particular there has been a chronic failure to invest in manufacturing, with the UK economy and investment being instead skewed towards short-term returns and the interests of the 'City'. A stronger manufacturing sector would help to rebalance the UK economy away from an over-reliance on the banking sector and would help rebalance the UK economy and society in regional terms. To achieve such a rebalancing requires active government policies to help increase investment in education, skills and innovation.
N63|The Early Growth of the Engineering Industry in Italyâ€™s Regions|"The reconstruction of the historical national accounts for post-Unification Italy is proceeding. The national time series most recently compiled are those for the all-important engineering industry; this paper presents their regional counterparts. The engineering industry is very unevenly documented in the historical sources. Data abound for the shipbuilding and railway-vehicles industries, where public procurement, subsidies, and regulation produced a regular stream of reports; the national and regional estimates for these two sectors have been presented elsewhere. This paper presents the complementary regional estimates for the other, poorly documented components of the engineering industry, and the resulting regional aggregates. The regional engineering-industry estimates, like their national counterparts, distinguish the fabricated-metal (hardware) industry, three general-equipment industries (shipbuilding, railwayvehicles, and the residual, covering other metal vehicles, agricultural and industrial machinery, and structural components), two precision-equipment industries (precision instruments; clocks and watches), and the precious-metal-products industry. For all but the last maintenance activity is distinguished from new production. At Unification Italyâ€™s engineering industry was dominated by the fabricated-metal industry, in essence the manufacture and maintenance of tools and other hardware by traditional smiths. The general-equipment industry then involved little more than (wood) shipbuilding; but it grew rapidly, and overtook the fabricated-metal industry early in the twentieth century. The precision-engineering and precious-metal-products industries were ever relatively small. The estimated regional value added series are collected in Table 1. Again like their national counterparts, these series are all at 1911 prices, in essence physical quantity series weighted by unit value added in 1911. This is the best that can be done with the evidence so far recovered; as has been pointed out elsewhere, with respect to the proper measures at a constant price level they suffer from two distortions that must be kept in mind. The minor one is that the use of constant prices tends to overstate industryâ€™s growth, though less so with late-year prices used here than with earlyyear prices (which is the only kernel of truth in the widely misunderstood ""Gerschenkron effect""); the major one is that as one goes back in time the weight of technologically stagnant production (maintenance, save for ships and railway vehicles) is increasingly overstated next to that of technologically progressive production (ship and railway vehicle maintenance, all new production). The regional series allocate the corresponding national totals with sector- and activityspecific regional value added shares. In general, and with the exceptions noted below, these are estimated initially for 1911, using the labor-force data in that yearâ€™s demographic census, and the (partial) data on employment and power in use, by shop size, in the contemporaneous industrial census. The regional maintenance value added (and employment) shares are then extrapolated to 1861-1913, using the sector-specific indicators recalled below. Regional new production shares are then estimated initially for the further benchmark years 1871, 1881, and 1900, using the census labor force data net of estimated employment in maintenance (and assuming that the differences in value added per new-production worker calculated in 1911 were less marked in earlier years); in the other years, finally, the estimated shares of new production are obtained by simple (linear) extrapolation or interpolation."
N63|The fruits of disaggregation: the general engineering industry in Italy, 1861-1913|"In post-Unification Italy the cyclical movements of the economy largely reflected those in the production of durable goods. The engineering industry has been seen as one that transformed metal into machines: its metal consumption suggests that investment in machinery followed the Kuznets-cycle long swing, as construction did, that domestic production ever dominated the domestic market, and that changes in protection didn't matter. New, disaggregated timeseries estimates force a radical revision of these long-held views. Far more metal was turned into (ever-protected) hardware than into machines: the long cycle in aggregate ""engineering"" was not so much parallel to, as simply part of, the cycle in construction. Investment in machinery grew altogether more steadily than investment in infrastructure, with more numerous but far more modest cycles (and a heretofore unrecognized peak in 1907). All the extant interpretations of Italy's industrial progress in the period at hand turn on the nonexistent long swing in industrial investment, and they all collapse together. The domestic production of machinery, initially very small, reacted strongly to increases in net protection: the conventional view of the impact of the tariff is also to be jettisoned."
N63|The Measurement of Production: Lessons from the Engineering Industry in Italy, 1911|Abstract This paper presents the second-generation estimates for the Italian engineering industry in 1911, a year documented both by the customary demographic census, and the first industrial census. The first part of this paper uses the census data to estimate the industry’s value added, sector by sector; the second further disaggregates each sector by activity, and estimates the value added, employment, physical product, and metal consumption of each one. A third, concluding section dwells on the dependence of cross-section estimates on time-series evidence. Three appendices detail the specific algorithms that generate the present estimates; a fourth, a useful sample of firm-specific data.
N63|The measurement of production movements: lessons from the engineering industry in Italy, 1861-1913|In the literature the (Italian) engineering industry is seen as one that transformed metal into machines; its time path is inferred from that of its consumption of metal. Newly recovered evidence indicates that far more metal was turned into (traditional) hardware than into (modern) machines. Machine production grew rapidly from a very small base: metal consumption fails to capture this change in the product mix, and understates the growth of new production at constant prices. Moreover, maintenance activity was in general as significant as new production. Maintenance was labor-intensive rather than metal-intensive, trend-dominated rather than cyclical, and relatively larger, next to new production, in 1861 than in 1913: metal consumption overstates the growth rate of the industryâ€™s total product at constant prices, and much overstates its cyclical volatility. Technical progress was negligible in maintenance, but rapid in new production: constant-price-weighted physical measures fail to capture productivity growth, and even late-weighted series overstate the growth of the industryâ€™s real product. These results are not tied to conditions peculiar to pre-War Italy: the new estimates presented here pave the way for emending, or at least reevaluating, the engineering-industry product series reconstructed for other times or places.
N63|The Location of the UK Cotton Textiles Industry in 1838: A Quantitative Analysis|We examine the geography of cotton textiles in Britain in 1838 to test claims about why the industry came to be so heavily concentrated in Lancashire. Our analysis considers both first and second nature aspects of geography including the availability of water power, humidity, coal prices, market access and sunk costs. We show that some of these characteristics have substantial explanatory power. Moreover, we exploit the change from water to steam power to show that the persistent effect of first nature characteristics on industry location can be explained by a combination of sunk costs and agglomeration effects.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N63|Temporary protection and technology adoption: evidence from the Napoleonic blockade|This paper uses a natural experiment to assess whether temporary protection from trade with industrial leaders can foster development of infant industries in follower countries. Using a new dataset compiled from primary sources, I find that in the short-run regions (départements) in the French Empire which became better protected from trade with the British for exogenous reasons during the Napoleonic Wars (1803-15) increased capacity in a new technology, mechanised cotton spinning, to a larger extent than regions which remained more exposed to trade. Temporary protection had long term effects. In particular, by exploiting the fact that the post-war location of the cotton industry was determined to a large extent by the historical accident of the wars, I first show that the location of cotton spinning within France was persistent, and firms located in regions with higher post-war spinning capacity were more productive 30 years later. Second, I find that after the restoration of peace, exports of cotton goods from France increased substantially, consistent with evolving comparative advantage in cottons. Third, I show that as late as 1850, France and Belgium - both part of the French Empire prior to 1815 - had larger cotton spinning industries than other Continental European countries which were not protected from British trade during the wars; this suggests that adoption of the new technology was far from inevitable.
N63|American tariff policy and the British alkali industry, 1880-1905|Until the late nineteenth century, the British alkali industry enjoyed a colossal export market in the United States. Yet, as several scholars have already noted, the highly protectionist Dingley Tariff of 1897 caused a precipitous and irreversible decline in the volume of British alkali exports to the United States. Drawing upon an abundance of textual evidence, this study argues that, in addition to the climactic Dingley Tariff, previous American tariff acts in 1883, 1890, and 1894 also exerted a pronounced influence on the volume of British alkali exports to the United States. Further corroborating this claim is a regression analysis that employs, as an explanatory variable, newly constructed annual estimates of the ad valorem equivalent tariff that the United States imposed upon alkali imports from Britain. Approaching the British alkali industry from a microeconomic standpoint, this study also argues that one particular British alkali firm, Brunner, Mond & Co., mitigated its financial exposure to American tariff policy by acquiring, in 1887, a minority shareholding in a nascent American alkali firm, the Solvay Process Company. Profits from Brunner’s shareholding in the Solvay Process Company substantially offset the profits that Brunner, Mond & Co. lost as the result of its diminished alkali exports to the United States. The other dominant British alkali firm, the United Alkali Company, did not fare so well.
N63|Wages and prices in early Catalan industrialisation|Catalonia was the only Mediterranean region among the early followers of the British Industrial Revolution in the second third of the nineteenth century. The roots of this industrialisation process can be traced back to the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries when the Catalan economy became successfully integrated in international trade and the region enjoyed an intensification of its agrarian and proto-industrial activities. These capitalist developments were subsequently reinforced by a successful printed calico manufacturing business concentrated in the city of Barcelona. Although the factory system was largely adopted by the cotton industry in the 1840s, the diffusion of the spinning jenny had occurred earlier in the 1790s. In this paper, in line with Allen (2009a, 2009b), we explore whether relative factor prices played a role in the widespread adoption of the spinning jenny in Catalonia. First, we supply series of real wages in Barcelona for the period 1500-1808 in line with studies conducted within the ‘Great Divergence’ debate. Second, we undertake a comparative analysis of the relationship between the prices of labour and capital.Finally, we focus on the cotton spinning sector to determine the potential profitability of the adoption of the spinning jenny in Catalonia. We find that although Catalonia was not a high wage economy in the way that Britain was in the second half of the eighteenth century, evidence from the cotton spinning sector confirms the relevance of relative factor prices in the adoption of new technology. Within the booming sector of cotton after the 1780s, high wages created strong incentives for adopting the labour-saving spinning jenny.
N63|Catching up and falling behind in technological progress: the experience of the textile and chemical industries in Italy between 1904 and 1937|We estimate the stocks of patents and their growth rates in the Italian textile and chemical industries between 1904 and 1937. The stocks and growth rates by nationality are estimated for Italy, France, Germany, the UK, Switzerland, and the USA. The Italian patent stock in the textile industry followed and attempted to catch up with the stock of the leading countries; by contrast, that in the chemical industry fell behind during that period. Although growth rates were similar, Italy fs growth rates fell into the lower group before and after World War I. Our results indicate that not all Italian industries succeeded in catching up with the leading countries.
N63|Dynamics of Overlapping Clusters: Industrial and Institutional Revolution in the Industrial District of Aachen, 1800‐1860|The economic transition characterizing the process of European industrialization in the 19th century was concentrated on regions rather than on states. In the first half of the 19th century, the region of Aachen (in the west of Prussia) pioneered on the territory of the German states and developed to a powerful industrial district. The implementation and diffusion of the factory system and the economic impact of adapted and new institutions make the core of this paper. Reciprocal interconnections between firms of different clusters shaped the region and created economic dynamics. Investments transgressed the boundaries of single industries and new industries emerged. One important feature of the regional production system was cross-sectional knowledge transfer; a second was institutions supportive to this process.

For this reason, the paper reconstructs the sector evolution considering all its phases. In the 1950s, on the basis of a semi-handcrafted production, an industrial sector takes shape, then becoming the “factory of Europe”. As much as at the beginning it was the Schumpeterian “innovation entrepreneurs” to give birth and then successfully develop a sector, strategic partnership innovation is now the key factor in order to overcome this negative phase.

However the Italian market has contracted over the past years. Those firms least present in the international markets are the hardest hit: data highlights the good performance achieved by exports that supported production in recovering from the 2011 downturn.

N63|Through the magnifying glass: provincial aspects of industrial growth in post-Unification Italy|In post-Unification Italy industrialization was ever sharply sub-regional. Initially industry was largely artisanal, and located in the former political capitals; factory industry was instead attracted by the waterfalls of the subalpine Northwest. From the 1880s, as modernization accelerated, industry concentrated: in the Lombard and Piedmontese subalpine provinces with the late-nineteenth-century boom in (protected) textiles, then particularly in Turin and Milan with the engineering boom, and novel energy-transmission, of the belle ï¿½poque; and in Liguria's Genoa, which captured (subsidized) civil and naval shipbuilding. The only significant diffusion came as (newly protected) beet-sugar-extraction spread throughout Emilia.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N63|Capital market efficiency in the British industrial revolution: the case of the Lancashire cotton industry, 1760-1840|"""Recent debates on the industrial revolution have continued to showcase the role of the cotton textile industry. These discussions have centred on the Schumpeterian view of rapid growth based on a disequilibrium model in which capital market imperfections allow innovative firms to restrict entry, thereby earning long run super-normal profits. Neo-classical interpretations, in contrast, argue that firms were relatively untroubled by capital market imperfections and experienced few problems accessing finance, facilitating entry and rapid adjustments to equilibrium profit levels, with the gains from technological innovation transmitted through falling prices. Important questions can therefore be addressed by examining further the question of capital market efficiency. To operate efficiently, inter alia, a capital market should allow freedom of access, equalise rates of profit across sectors and accurately price the risk of economic activity. To investigate efficiency of the capital market in these respects, the paper uses firm level data to examine whether or not, first the firm’s access to capital was restricted by outdated business practices, second, whether capital goods suppliers were able to charge monopoly rents to textile firms and third, whether the cost of finance accurately reflected the risk of the enterprise. The research uses archival evidence for a sample of cotton textile firms and the steam engine manufacturer, Boulton and Watt. These records are investigated to examine how, and at what cost, firms accessed financial resources. The results show that an important source of disequilibrium was the slow pace of capital market development relative to the technological pace and demands of industrialisation. The underdeveloped capital market perpetuated pre-industrial methods of finance, including high dependency on bills of exchange at prescriptive interest rates. Although some entrepreneurs took advantage of the most efficient steam technology, returns did not systematically reflect underlying risk. At the same time, profitable opportunities remained for firms entering the market using old technology and traditional organisational networks. For these reasons, cotton firms had the potential of super-normal profits but these opportunities were dissipated by the costs of circulation arising from capital market inefficiencies and the rents associated with monopoly, asset mispricing, arbitrage and fraud. As a consequence, although the story of the industrial revolution is one of Schumpeterian disequilibrium, the apparent lack of sustained abnormal profits in manufacturing reflected embedded local networks of capital and transaction cost, rather than the neo-classical story of rapid adjustment to equilibrium."""

N63|The Life of a Mariner in Eighteenth-Century Bristol: A Case Study of Higher-Value Probate Inventories|Anyone studying the eighteenth-century probate inventories of Bristol soon notices that the largest occupation group was mariner. However, as an occupation, mariner is exceedingly difficult to define and understand. The purpose of this paper is to reveal what the job of a mariner was by examining the real lives of wealthy mariners and the people who supported the maritime economy of Bristol in the eighteenth century. There were many ewage due f inventories in which the deceased or their family described themselves as mariners. Even though there were 1,486 of these inventories in the BRO for the eighteenth century, there are only 25 mariners f inventories in the higher-value range of more than ’50. Because there were no other names of higher- status marine occupations, except captain, the word emariner f was used not only by sailors, but also by people with significant personal property, meaning master mariners. Thus, the word emariner f covered a very wide of range of social statuses. From the four case studies of these mariners from probate inventories in Ecclesiastical Cause Papers, we can see their real lives. They all had many goods and chattels, as well as money owing. All the mariners selected in this paper spent their everyday lives surrounded by many consumer goods. Although one was more enthusiastic than the others, all of them were interested in improving their quality of life through consumer items such as tea and kitchenware. Two inventories included navigation equipment, proof and symbols of a master mariner. The credits show that James Owens had wide range of business, and also Thomas Smith fs inventory shows commercial relationships with business partners, indicating that they were not wage workers but wealthy traders.
N63|At the Onset of the original capital accumulation|The historical data show that the early modern period in Great Britain paved the way to the classical industrial revolution presenting the rst phase of capital accumulation and rise in per capita income. This paper captures the relevant evidence by means of a stylized model describing two engines determining this economic process: the role of the guilds in the manufacturing industry and proto-industrialization. On the evidence of the historical facts, we show that the process of capital accumulation was driven by a class of capitalists, the entrepreneurs-merchants, who shifted manufacturing production to the countryside in order to escape from the guilds' market power in urban environments. In the countryside entrepreneurs-merchants increased their rate of pro t, triggering capital accumulation by exploiting cheaper labour costs and the re-allocation of working time from agricultural to manufacturing activity. Finally, we show that the model corresponds to the pattern of historical data on manufacturing production and capital accumulation from the 14th century to the rise of the classical industrial revolution.
N63|La tierra en manos de menestrales. Las posesiones agrarias de los artesanos valencianos (1370-1450)|During the Late Middle Ages, in many European regions, artisans owned large amounts of land, though these were not central to their work activity. In the Valencian case, there are constant references to this in notarial and judicial sources. Nevertheless, there have been few in-depth studies of this subject. This article deals with the role of plots of land in the domestic economies of small enterprises and their importance in the social strategies of the families involved. We offer several examples from around the Valencian region at the end of the 14th and beginning of the 15th century. This includes professionals in small rural towns, as well as artisans from Valencia or other urban centres.
N63|Productivity and transition in Swedish iron and steel, 1870-1940| This paper presents a long-run analysis of an industrial branch in Europe's periphery. It examines how the Swedish iron and steel industry reacted to the strains of increasing competition on world markets which affected the branch between 1870 and 1940. The first part of the paper presents a breakdown into periods. We then go on to analyse the sources of growth with both a primal and a dual approach and look at the dynamics between factor substitution and relative prices. Finally, we examine the contribution of the different factors during the periods of transition. Overall we find total factor productivity as the main responsible force for overcoming the effects of competitive pressure. Some of this aggregate technological change can also be traced to a more intensive use of inputs and to extensive growth, indicative of structural change in the industry. Throughout the period examined the industry reacted to increased competition by process and organisational transformation.
N63|Patterns of industrial specialisation in post-Unification Italy| This paper investigates the main patterns of industrial specialisation in Italian provinces over half a century following the Unification of the country. To this end, we propose a multivariate graphical technique named dynamic specialisation biplot . In 1871, specialisation vocations towards the different manufacturing sectors were limited in size and no clear geographical clustering emerged. A regional specialisation divide resulted instead clearly in 1911. In 1871 as in 1911, the foodstuffs, textile and engineering sectors represented the three pillars delimiting the arena of the specialisation race. Within that arena, the effect of public policies on the temporal evolution of provincial specialisation is considered. The adoption of free trade in the early 1860s affected noticeably the industrial specialisation of a few Neapolitan provinces. The subsequent protectionist measures altered the specialisation trajectories of selected northern provinces, largely attracted by the textile sector during the 1880s, and by the rapidly growing engineering sector in the pre-First World War decade. Within and between regional homogeneity and smooth specialisation, trajectories are instead representative of most of the remaining provinces. Among them, southern provinces exhibit specialisation paths revealing that little more than a composition effect occurred among manufacturing sectors.
N63|The Dual Crises of the Late-Medieval Florentine Cloth Industry, c. 1320 - c. 1420|During the hundred-year period from about 1320 to about 1420, the Florentine woollen cloth industry underwent two closely connected crises. The first crisis was the consequence, direct and indirect, of the ravages of warfare and falling population, afflicting the entire Mediterranean basin and western Europe from the 1290s, which raised transportation and other transaction costs to such an extent that long-distance trade in cheaper textiles became unprofitable, thereby forcing West European cloth producers to reorient their export-oriented production to very high priced luxury woollens (and silks) and also to shift from being price-takers to price-makers. Initially, the first crisis seemed to have had beneficial consequences for Florence: for its luxury woollens industry soon became late-medieval Italy's single most important export-oriented manufacturing industry, with large spill-over benefits for Italian commerce, banking, and finance. Indeed, by the third quarter of the 14th century, the Florentine woollen industry (Arte della Lana) was rivalling and then surpassing the previously pre-eminent leaders - those in the southern Low Countries (Flanders and Brabant); and in Mediterranean markets of this era, Florentine woollens reigned supreme over all rival textiles. But the consequences of that first economic crisis, in the ensuing transformation of the Florentine cloth industry, contained the very seeds that spawned the second and far more major crisis, which led to the inexorable downfall of this once majestic industry, by the early 15th century. The chief factors in that decline were: the accelerating population decline (especially after the Black Death), further raising transaction costs; the reorientation to very narrow luxury markets, with very restricted demand; and especially the complete dependence on imported, tax-burdened English wools (as the prime determinant of both luxury quality and the very high prices of Florentine woollens). All of these adverse factors led to drastic reductions in Florentine cloth production: from about 75,000 bolts in the 1330s to only about 9,500 in the 1420s - an overall fall of 87% (far more than the decline in the Florentine labour supply, or the European population). The Florentine cloth industry never regained its former if transitory glory. How the industry did, however, manage to achieve some recovery in the later 15th and 16th centuries, by resorting to domestic and then Spanish wools, is beyond the scope of this study.
N63|The Institutional Approach to Economic History: Connecting the Two Strands|"This essay examines the historiography of two episodes in history – the scattering of plots in the open fields in the Middle Ages and the transition to the factory system in the Industrial Revolution – to shed light on the uses of institutional economics in economic history. In both of these episodes, economic ""just-so"" stories advanced our understanding of history. What animated intellectual innovation in both cases was a bold conjecture about the raison d’être of a puzzling institutional structure. But what ultimately enriched our understanding was the process of conjecture and revision those conjectures set off. In both episodes, the revised conjectures that best withstood criticism and revision were those that saw the phenomena not as static snapshots of economic agents confronting an economic problem but rather those that embedded the phenomena within a larger economic problem and within a process of economic change. In the end it is an account of institutional change – what I call the good old New Institutional Economics – that connects the use of institutional economics to explain puzzling historical phenomenon with the role of institutional economics in addressing the big questions of economic growth."

The paper concludes that these activities must have played a decisive role for the economic development in Norway during the nineteenth century.
N63|Amateur or professional? A new look at 19th century. patentees in Norway|The paper analyses Norwegian 19th century patentees. A special focus is on the affiliation or relationship of the patentees to the manufacturing industries, business and the wider economy. A main question is whether the inventors were what might be called ‘amateurs’ working independently, or ‘professionals’ working closer to firms or institutions. A main finding is that even the individual patentees, that comprised the majority of all patentees, had strong associations with industry, and the distinction between ‘professionals’ and ‘amateurs’ is not all that useful.
N63|Matthew Boulton fs Sales in Christie fs -A Review of Research Trends -|Research about Matthew Boulton in recent years indicates that the background for his business product development was based not only on management plans for his steam engine, but also on cultural factors and new global businesses, e.g. coinage. The Bank of England launches a new ’50 note in 2011, featuring Matthew Boulton. It seems that the role of Matthew Boulton in the Industrial Revolution has come to be evaluated highly by the UK public. Boulton fs ormolu business has still been underestimated in economic and business history. However, if we look at the expansion of manufacturing ormolu, which was the core business, as was the gtoy h trade in his early career, it has been found that Boulton intended to expand the market by new lines of consumer goods and the adoption of neo-classical design. Products were diversified by the development of Blue John ware in combination with ormolu. Boulton also attempted new style sales e.g. exhibitions, where he invited the upper classes, including the royal family. Some of these attempts were not successful. From the gwindow dressing h of sales and fictitious names of bidders on sales in 1771, we know that the financial result was a failure, and also that Boulton had a hard time to find ways to deal with the result of the sales. The adoption of neo-classical design for his products could not be said to have increased sales. However, analysis of the sales in 1771 shows Boulton tried to sell not only adornment, but also many practical products with associated decoration. This method of combining decoration and practical use was visible in many Boulton products after the sales in 1771. Boulton fs business did not simply shift from decorative products to the steam engine, but also to adornments to products which had both a decorative and a practical function. The technique, accumulated in the development and manufacturing of the adornments, was combined with a practical function such as the movement of the hall clock. This had a great influence on later business, e.g. the steam engine. In other words, the experience of sales in 1771 was not a purely negative experience, but a hint of business to come in the later career of Matthew Boulton.
N63|Education and Catch-Up in the Industrial Revolution|Research increasingly stresses the role of human capital in modern economic development. Existing historical evidence -- mostly from British textile industries -- however, rejects that formal education was important for the Industrial Revolution. Our new evidence from technological follower Prussia uses a unique school enrollment and factory employment database linking 334 counties from pre-industrial 1816 to two industrial phases in 1849 and 1882. Using pre-industrial education as instrument for later education and controlling extensively for pre-industrial development, we find that basic education is significantly associated with nontextile industrialization in both phases of the Industrial Revolution. Panel data models with county fixed effects confirm the results. (JEL I20, J24, N13, N33, N63)

The basic source for this research consists of the account books from different charity institutions. The main conclusions are: 1) after 1690, the cost of living in Madrid and in most European cities evolved in a similar way; 2) year on year price fluctuations were less steep in Madrid than in Palencia, Seville and Toledo; 3) in the second half of the 18th century, Madrid was one of Europe's cities where wages of unskilled workers fell more abruptly; 4) during the 18th century, skill premium remained in high levels in construction and increased notably in the services sector; and, 5) the wage gap between men and women decreased during the century owing, probably, to the relative increment in demand for female labour in the important sector of Madrid's domestic services.

N63|Identity Of National Heritage In Function Of Specialised Tourist Offer In Croatia|Every tourist oriented country tries to increase its content on global tourist market. Continuity of diverse tourist offer consolidation on the global market presumes specialized tourist’s offer of every small country, like Croatia. For those countries it’s the best way of market share protection on global market. Tourist market is dynamic and extremely oriented to contemporary trends. Tourist tends to experience authentically offer, typical for the country that he visits. In that sense, tourist offer adjustment to national identity (based on historic ambience for which the offer is created) presents sustainable competition strategy. Therefore, tourist offer on the Croatian market must include eco tourism, excursion, culture tourism and adventure tourism (with special reference to nautical tourism). Demands for ecological areas and personal safety are criteria that contribute to the choice of tourist destinations. Also the trend of health care is quite obvious (wellness, fitness etc.). In accordance to changed needs of modern tourist, tourist offer must be diversified. It could be done by applying the specialized form of tourist offer. Accordingly, we have used the market research “what tourist thinks” in order to define the appropriate marketing frame by which Croatia will be positioned as specialized tourist destination in a long term. The identity will be based on authentic tourist product. Also, it would provide the credibility of the new national tourist offer. Tourist will be offered to be the explorer of the historical and cultural heritage as well as the identity of the destination he is visiting. Croatian national cultural heritage has all necessary predispositions (cities, palaces, old castles, churches, museums... etc). Only specialized tourist’s offer can provide growing trend for the impendent period. The abstract will not exceed 150 words, in the Times New Roman font, 9 pts., italic, 0.75 cm indent.

N63|Internal Geography and External Trade: regional disparities in Italy, 1861-2011|This paper explores the interactions between external trade and regional disparities in the Italian economy since unification. It argues that the advantage of the North was initially based on natural advantage (in particular the endowment of water, intensive in silk production). From 1880 onwards the share of exports in GDP stagnated and then declined; domestic market access therefore became a key determinant of industrial location, inducing fast growing new sectors (especially engineering) to locate in regions with a large domestic market, i.e. in the North. From 1945 onwards trade growth and European integration meant that foreign market access was the decisive factor; the North had the advantage of proximity to these markets.
N63|Old and new Italian multinational firms|"After a quick profile of Italian foreign direct investments since 1900 and a short review of the main explanations of the lagged multinational growth by Italian manufacturing companies, a quick glimpse of business histories is given to the only two still today living ""old protagonists"" (Pirelli, Fiat) and to three old corporate groups (Olivetti, SNIA Viscosa, Montecatini-Montedison) who had also reached a significant degree of full internationalization early in the XX century, but during the second postwar period underwent profound dismantling of their original business mission. Finally the paper focuses on few cases of ""new protagonists"", mid-size family companies who undertook a true multinational strategy only in the most recent decades and today represent the core of the Italian ""fourth capitalism""."
N63|Convergence among Italian Regions, 1861-2011|"In 150 years, the trends in regional disparities in economic development within Italy have differed depending on whether they are gauged by longitude or by latitude. The disparities between western and eastern regions first widened and then closed; the North-South gap, by contrast, remains the main open problem in the national history of Italy. This work focuses on the underlying causes of the turning points in regional disparities since national unification in 1861. The first came in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, with the industrialization of the so-called ""industrial triangle"". This was followed by the ""failed new turn"" during the interwar years: not only were the beginnings of convergence blocked but the North-South gap, until then still natural, inevitable, was transformed into a fracture of exceptional dimensions. The second turning point, in the twenty years after the World War, produced the first substantial, lasting convergence between southern and northern Italy, powered by rising productivity and structural change in the South. The last turning point was in the mid-1970s, when convergence was abruptly halted and a protracted period of immobility in the disparity began."

N63|The English cotton spinning industry, 1780-1840, as revealed in the columns of the London Gazette| We investigate the early development of English cotton spinning by analysing about 700 bankruptcies and 1300 dissolutions of partnership reported in the London Gazette, 1770-1840. The data show three temporal cycles, peaking in the early to mid-1800s, in the later 1820s and again in the later 1830s, near the ends of investment booms. Both earlier peaks were absolutely higher than the later ones, despite industry expansion. Over time both bankruptcies and dissolutions show rising concentration of spinning in greater Lancashire, and within greater Lancashire in the surrounding towns rather than in Manchester. The industry was throughout dominated by single proprietors or firms with only two partners. Integration with weaving was increasing steadily. The paper demonstrates the potential of the Gazette, now searchable online, as a source for business and industrial history.
N63|The Rise, Expansion, and Decline of the Italian Wool-Based Textile Industries, 1100-1730: a study in international competition, transaction costs, and comparative advantage|This (revised) study seeks to examine the rise, expansion, and ultimate decline of the Italian wool-based textile industries over a period of six centuries (from ca. 1100 to ca. 1730). An international trade model combining transaction costs and comparative advantage is employed to explain the changing fortunes of the Italian cloth industries over these six centuries, in competition with their major northern rivals, in the Low Countries and England, who fought for market dominance both within Europe and abroad, in the Islamic world, in particular the MamlÅ«k and then Ottoman domains in the Levant (eastern Mediterranean). The transaction costs model is used to explain in particular which branches of this textile industry fared better and which fared worse during the Commercial Revolution era (ca. 1100-ca.1320), the so-called Great Depression era (ca. 1320-ca. 1460), the ensuing economic recovery and Price Revolution era (ca. 1460-ca. 1620), the General Crisis of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries (ca. 1620-ca.1740), to the eve of the Industrial Revolution era. One of the major errors in the literature is the failure to distinguish between the two main branches of the wool-based cloth industries, the technology of their industrial production, their relative prices, and markets, and the impact of transaction costs in international trade. For much of this era, the leading branch was the luxury-oriented woollens industry (Old Draperies), based on very fine, short-stapled English and then Spanish merino wools, producing fulled, heavy-weight, and generally high priced cloths. In the earlier and later periods, the other branch prevailed (New Draperies): the lighter-weight (unfulled), generally coarser and cheaper fabrics that were either full worsteds (cheap, coarse, long-stapled wools) or serges (hybrids with worsted warps and woollen wefts). The transition from a predominance of the lighter, worsted-style fabrics to the heavy-weight woollens, throughout western Europe, took place from the 1290s, with a rapid rise in transaction costs that were the direct and indirect result of a spreading stain of international warfare, especially injurious to overland trade routes, combined with a drastic fall in population, that engulfed most of Europe and the Mediterranean basin until the 1460s. That rise in transportation and transaction costs (determined by market scale economies) set a cost-price floor below which international trade in cheaper textiles became unprofitable: so much so that most West European wool-based industries re-oriented their production towards luxury markets, with far higher prices sustained by price-making monopolistic competition better able to withstand the rise of such costs, an impossible solution for those marketing cheap textiles as price-takers in Mediterranean markets. Such problems were less severe for the Italian industries, whose markets were chiefly in the Mediterranean; and thus the transition to luxury production was far less complete than in the north. The comparative advantage model is based on the price that woollen-cloth producers in both the Low Countries and Italy had to pay in that luxury re-orientation: a total dependence on the finest English wools as the prime component of luxury quality. From the late 1330s, English monarchs took advantage of that dependence by imposing exorbitant taxes on wool-exports, with even higher taxes imposed on Italian merchants, ultimately depriving them of almost all such wools by the early fifteenth century. At the same time, English clothiers were able to weave luxury-quality cloths from the very same wools, but free of any such taxes, giving them an almost insuperable cost advantage over all foreign woollen manufacturers. But England's comparative advantage in its wool supply, though finally giving them mastery of northern markets for luxury woollens, was undermined, during the later fifteenth, early sixteenth century, by the development of fine but much cheaper merino wools in Spain, which Italians could acquire with lower transport costs. The other change undermining the supremacy of English and other woollens industry was the sharp fall in transaction costs by the late fifteenth, early sixteenth centuries: with the decline in warfare, the recovery and growth of population, and with technological advances in both ocean and land transport, especially the latter with a major transition in long-distance trade from maritime to overland continental routes. Along with that decline in costs came a revival and expansion of the lighter, cheaper textile industries, though chiefly in the Low Countries and England, more so than in Italy, despite the continued predominance of Mediterranean markets. For woollens, the Italian industries, especially the Venetian, gained the comparative advantage in wools: with much cheaper access to (now more expensive) Spanish merinos. But in the Mediterranean and especially Ottoman markets the English finally gained supremacy over both the Florentine and Venetian woollens industries, by the later seventeenth century, from a new comparative advantage, in capital formation: from superior business organization (the new joint stock companies) and naval power (large, heavily gunned, swift carracks). The so-called General Crisis era of the later seventeenth century had again favoured maritime routes, and thus sea-power, over land routes. At the same time the Tudor-Stuart enclosure movements, in transforming English sheep -- from small sheep with fine short-stapled to larger (meatier) sheep with coarser, long-stapled fleeces, gave England's worsted-style New Draperies a comparative advantage in wool supplies over all its continental rivals, including the Italian; and by the 1730s, both branches of the Italian wool-based textile industries had succumbed to foreign competition, and become moribund.
N63|Eibar y la industria armera: evidencias de un distrito industrial|The Basque Gunmaking industry experienced its most important growth during the last decades of the 19th century and fi rst years of the 20th. This growth was due to the increasing exports of revolvers and pistols which made up almost 90 per cent of total sales. This industry was concentrated around the town of Eibar which, together with other villages of Guipuzcoa and Biscay, constituted the “Gunmaking Zone”. The international competitiveness achieved by this industry was mainly a consequence of the flexibility and adaptability given by its Marshallian industrial district structure since Eibar fulfilled most of the characteristics cited by specialized literature, e.g., specialization, in this case in fi rearms, a relatively homogeneous product; predominance of SME in its production structure and subcontracting relationships among them; existence of internal rules and institutions that protect them; and, due to cooperation between companies, creation of institutions to improve the development of the district’s characteristic industry.

N63|La adaptación tecnológica como factor de localización industrial. Una revisión de las investigaciones sobre la industria de hilados de algodón en Cataluña (1772-1885)|This article examines, through the analysis of the cotton spinning industry in Catalonia, the role of technological change in corporate strategies for industrial location in the first stage of the industrialisation process. It highlights the lack of consistency in the relation between territory and technology and demonstrates the influence that both the technological system adopted and the territorial features exert on the industrial location decision-making process. Through the review of the most recent bibliography, the article establishes that the location of the cotton spinning industry in Catalonia was determined by the existence of a pre-established industrial framework and by the relative change in the cost that factors such as labour, energy and transport experienced due to the introduction of foreign technology.

N63|Explaining contract choice : vertical co-ordination, sharecropping, and wine, France 1850-1950|Recent literature on sharecropping has emphasized its importance in reducing problems associated with moral hazard in cultivation (Tuscany), or in providing an important ‘rung’ on the farm ladder (US South). Yet despite these and other important features, sharecropping is surprisingly absent in many, if not most other settings. Using case studies associated with French wine production, this paper argues that a number of factors have often been overlooked in the literature: 1) the need for landowners to be able to offer farms that were both sufficiently large to employ full time the sharecropper’s family, and allowed them to produce a variety of products to minimize risk; 2) measurement problems associated with the division of the harvest, especially when quality was an important factor in determining farm price; 3) and the nature of vertical co-operation and integration associated with the production and marketing arrangements of individual crops explains that landowners were not indifferent to receiving payment in cash or kind, and this affected contract choice. This paper incorporates these ideas to explain not just the presence and absence of sharecropping in different geographical localities, but also the wide variety of different forms of the contract that existed in Europe.
N63|Consumption, Social Capital, and the “Industrious Revolution” in Early Modern Germany|This paper uses evidence from German-speaking central Europe to address open questions about the Consumer and Industrious Revolutions. Did they happen outside the early-developing, North Atlantic economies? Were they shaped by the “social capital” of traditional institutions? How were they affected by social constraints on women? It finds that people in central Europe did desire to increase market work and consumption. But elites used the “social capital” of traditional institutions to oppose new work and consumption practices, especially by women, migrants, and the poor. Although they seldom blocked new practices wholly, they delayed them, limited them socially, and increased their costs.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N63|Were British cotton entrepreneurs technologically backward? Firm-level evidence on the adoption of ring spinning|I study the slow adoption of ring spinning in Great Britain's cotton industry at the end of the 19th century, which has been used as evidence of British entrepreneurs' declining efficiency and conservatism (Musson, 1959; Aldcroft, 1964; Lazonick, 1981, 1981b). To this purpose I use firm-level data from all of Lancashire's cotton firms over several years. The data are from Worrall's The Cotton Spinners and Manufacturers' Directory for the years 1885, 1886-1887, 1890, 1894, 1902, and 1910. First, I show that the vertical organization of the industry, with its firms specializing in spinning or weaving, did not act as an impediment to the adoption of the ring spinning technology, as was argued by Lazonick. In particular, I show the following: i) non-integrated firms were the first to adopt rings in Great Britain; ii) the large majority of firms that adopted rings were incumbents; iii) vertically integrated firms that were spinning only either twist or weft yarn were still in existence in 1910; and iv) only a negligible number of firms changed their organizational structure upon adopting ring spinning. I also show that a large fraction of firms installed very small numbers of ring spindles upon the adoption of ring spinning, suggesting that firms were slowly adopting ring spindles to replace old mule spindles rather than transitioning over to ring spinning at a single point in time. Then, I show that the rate at which vertically integrated firms adopted rings suddenly accelerated after 1902. I interpret this as evidence that British entrepreneurs were fully aware of the technological complementarities between rings and automatic looms. These complementarities could only be fully exploited by vertically integrated firms.

N63|Prices and Profits in Cotton Textiles During the Industrial Revolution|Cotton textile firms led the development of machinery-based industrialization in the Industrial Revolution. This paper presents price and profits data extracted from the accounting records of three cotton firms between the 1770s and the 1820s. The course of prices and profits in cotton textiles illumine the nature of the economic processes at work. Some historians have seen the Industrial Revolution as a Schumpeterian process in which discontinuous technological change created large profits for innovators and succeeding decades were characterized by slow diffusion. Technological secrecy and imperfect capital markets limited expansion of use of the new technology and output expanded as profits were reinvested until eventually the new technology dominated. The evidence here supports a more equilibrium view which the industry expanded rapidly and prices fell in response to technological change. Price and profit evidence indicates that expansion of the industry had led to dramatic price declines by the 1780s and there is no evidence of super profits thereafter.

The accounts books of several charitable institutions have been the basic source of information for this research. The main conclusions of the work are as follows: 1) in the eighteenth century the evolution of prices in Madrid was quite similar to those in most western and central European cities; 2) yearly fluctuations in the cost of living were lower in Madrid than Palencia, Toledo and Seville; 3) in the second half of that century, Madrid was one of the cities of the old continent which showed the most abrupt fall in the wages of unskilled workers; 4) during the eighteenth century, the ‚'skill premium' increased quite noticeably in the Madrid service sector; and 5) the wage differential between men and women fell in that century, due, probably, to the considerable raise in the weight of female work in the important domestic service sector in Madrid
N63|La formación de un distrito industrial metalúrgico en Valladolid (c. 1842-c. 1953)|This work proposes a long term outlook in order to investigate the reasons explaining the development and importance of the metal-mechanic sector in Valladolid during the second half of the 20th century. We find that the political decisions after the Spanish Civil War of 1936 are determinant in explaining the change of size of this industrial district, but also that Valladolid knew how to take advantage of its privileged geographic situation, its means of transport -Canal and Railway-, and the introduction of electric power at the beginning of the century, to free itself from an excessive dependence on the agricultural sector for its development. Not only the political advantages coming out of the war, but also the tradition developed since 1842, explain the introduction of large companies in the next decades.

N63|Community Characteristics and Demographic Development: Three Württemberg Communities, 1558 - 1914|Demographic behaviour is influenced not just by attributes of individuals but also by characteristics of the communities in which those individuals live. A project on ‘Economy, Gender, and Social Capital in the German Demographic Transition’ is analyzing the longterm determinants of fertility by carrying out family reconstitutions of three Württemberg communities (Auingen, Ebhausen, and Wildberg) between c. 1558 and 1914. A related project on ‘Human Well-Being and the “Industrious Revolution”: Consumption, Gender and Social Capital in a German Developing Economy, 1600-1900’ is using marriage and death inventories to investigate how consumption interacted with production and demographic behaviour in two of these communities. This paper examines the historical, political, institutional, geographical, and economic attributes of the communities analyzed in these projects and discusses their potential effects. The aim is to generate testable hypotheses and relevant independent variables for subsequent econometric analyses of demographic behaviour.
N63|The Industrial Revolution in Miniature: The Spinning Jenny in Britain, France, and India|This paper uses the adoption and invention of the spinning jenny as a test case to understand why the industrial revolution occurred in Britain in the eighteenth century rather than in France or India. It is shown that wages were much higher relative to capital prices in Britain than in other countries. Calculation of the profitability of adopting the spinning jenny shows that it was profitable in Britain but not in France or in India. Since the jenny was profitable to use only in Britain, it was only in Britain that it was worth incurring the costs necessary to develop it. That is why the jenny was invented in Britain but not elsewhere. Irrespective of the quality of their institutions or the progressiveness of their cultures, neither the French nor the Indians would have found it profitable to mechanize cotton production in the eighteenth century.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

N63|Redes en la génesis y desarrollo de un distrito papelero catalán: el caso de Capellades (siglo XIX)|The area of Capellades (Barcelona), together with the Alcoy one, led the Spanish papermaking manufacture growth during the eighteenth century. Later on, during the mechanization process of the nineteenth century, this area did not adopt the continuous fabrication technique and went on making paper by hand. This decision was not guided by atavism. Such a technological option was an answer to its productive specialization (quality paper and cigarette paper) which could still benefit from a substantial demand. This technological model, which was not static, was successful thanks to the district dynamics and the establishment of a dense network for raw materials supply and for paper commercialisation. Without taking into account all these factors, it is very difficult to understand why very small firms have survived until the present and have been even able to hold leading positions in some paper markets.

N63|Asociacionismo, gremios y restricciones corporativas en la España medieval (siglos XIII-XV)|This article asserts that the Spanish associations banned in the Low Middle Ages were not trade corporations and that those restrictions were both Spanish and European monarchs response to nobility and urban oligarchy’s attempts to gain power, above all in politics, through different organizations. Guilds were indeed affected only when they took part of those political leagues or when craftsmen tried to control the market in their own benefit. And even in thoses cases the restrictions entailed just specific or temporal limitations. This assessment is based on a comprenhensive author’s review of the extensive non-corporate laws developed in medieval Spain and of the explanations provided by literature in the last decades. A new possible explanation is proposed: the impact of the Roman law from the 12th century onwards. KEY Classification-JEL: N33, N43, N63, N83
N63|Crisis y reconversión del tejido productivo en un espacio regional del norte de México: La Laguna (1875-1975)|The aim of this study is to describe the basic trends of a productive restructure process that took place in northern Mexico in the middle of the 20th century. Supported by a specialized agriculture and by agro-industry since the end of the 19th century, the cotton region known as La Laguna faced a severe transformation process which included: a) new productive methods; b) the reorientation of business activities; c) the introduction of important technological innovations; d) the search for new markets; e) alternative ways of association among producers; and f) a solid institutional presence. Based on these factores, the most important area of dairy production in the country was created in a semi-arid region. This process finally lead to the formation of the most powerful agro alimentary industry in modern Mexico: the LALA group. KEY Classification-JEL: L22, L23, N63, N93
N63|Construction in Italy's Regions, 1861-1913|Questo saggio presenta stime annuali della produzione delle industrie delle costruzioni nelle regioni dell'Italia post-Unitaria. Le costruzioni complessive manifestano andamenti ciclici diversi, indotti dagli sfasamenti delle costruzioni ferroviarie. Le altre opere pubbliche erano meno idiosincratiche: l'ascesa giolittiana è stata alquanto diffusa, quella depretisiana più concentrata nel Lazio e nella Liguria. Nella costruzione di edifici l'ascesa giolittiana si manifesta molto più nettamente nel Centro-Nord che nel Mezzogiorno; nel periodo precedente spicca il ciclo del Lazio. In complesso la distribuzione delle costruzioni ferroviarie appare, pro capite, abbastanza uniforme - e così pure le altre opere pubbliche, eccezion fatta per i picchi raggiunti nel Lazio e in Liguria. Le costruzioni di edifici tende invece a diminuire da Nord a Sud; ancora una volta si trova in testa la Liguria, seguita dal Lazio.
N63|Ship building and repairing in Italy, 1861-1913: national and regional time series|This paper presents the first comprehensive national and regional time-series estimates for ship building and repairing in post-Unification Italy. The path of the national aggregate differs markedly from the extant series, which cover merchant new-construction alone. The regional estimates point to considerable concentration: Liguria accounted for more than half the product, and Campania for almost another quarter. In Liguria, too, this sector represented up to a quarter of total industrial production; elsewhere, and nationally, it was barely significant.
N63|The comovements of construction in Italy's regions, 1861-1913|This paper examines the comovements of construction in Italy's regions from 1861 to 1913. The dynamic correlations of the series' deviation cycles decline in the case of buildings, remain very low in that of railways, and tend to decline in that of other infrastructure; the total-construction correlations instead peak in the 1870s, and again after 1900. Long-term comovements are examined by tracking the dispersion of the first differences of the measured trends. Increasing dispersion is obtained in the construction of buildings and of non-rail infrastructure; railway construction displayed a dramatic decline in dispersion, which dominates the aggregate.
N63|Necessities and Luxuries in Early-Modern Textile Consumption: Real Values of Worsted Says and Fine Woollens in the Sixteenth-Century Low Countries|If mankind’s three basic necessities have always been food, clothing, and shelter, whose production, trade, and consumption have rightly been a primary focus of economists and economic historians for many generations, we may ask this vital question: how do they distinguish between necessities and luxury products? Indeed, any examination of later-medieval, early-modern commodity prices soon reveals that for all three of these basic categories there was a seamless continuum from the very cheapest to the most expensive goods sold on the market, so that making clear cut divisions becomes virtually impossible. How, when, where, and why did the consumption of food and drink, for example, shift from being a basic necessity to ensure survival to become a luxury that enhances and enriches the quality of life? Obviously the very same considerations apply also to clothing. For many people, if only for a much smaller segment of the population, chiefly to be found in the aristocracy, the higher clergy, and wealthy bourgeoisie, clothing has also served and still serves other wants, in terms of luxury consumption: for decoration and for the assertion of personal values, and especially of one’s social status. Indeed, for such people, luxury textiles may have been deemed as personal ‘necessities’. This study is based upon two statistical tables, for the southern Low Countries, in the early to mid-sixteenth century, which, together permit us to make such a valid contrast between the nature, forms, and relative values of two major types of textiles. Representing ‘necessities’ in clothing are light-weight, coarse, relatively cheap worsted-type says (from the leading producer, Hondschoote, in Flanders); and representing ‘luxuries’ are the heavy-weight, very fine, and very costly woollen broadcloths from Ghent (dickedinnen) in the county of Flanders and Mechelen (Rooslaken) in the neighbouring duchy of Brabant. Table 1 provides the technical features of the composition of the cloths, the type of wools used, warp-counts, the dimensions, and weights, and finally the weight per square metre in grams. The luxury woollen broadcloths in Table 2 were all made uniquely from the finest English wools, then the world’s best; but Table 1 also provides, for comparison, a fine but cheaper woollen (from Armentières) made from a mixture of Spanish merino and English wools. The other textiles in Tables 1 are worsteds and semi-worsted says from several towns in sixteenth-century Flanders (including Hondschoote) and England. Table 2 presents the prices, in pounds groot Flemish for two types of Hondschoote says, and for the luxury woollens of Ghent and Mechelen for the decade 1535 - 1544. Two measures have been adopted in order to calculate the ‘real values’ of these textiles: (1) a comparison of the prices (nominal money-of-account values) of these textiles with the value of a ‘basket of consumables’, the one used to compute the Van der Wee Consumer Price Index for Brabant (Antwerp region); and (2) the purchasing power of wages: i.e., the number of days’ wages that a master mason in Antwerp would have had to spend to acquire each one of these textiles; and more particularly to buy 12 square metres of cloth, for a man’s annual clothing requirement. In terms of the latter measure, the average number of days’ wages required to purchase that same quantity of cloth would have been: 13.725 days for a Hondschoote single say; 16.958 days for a Hondschoote double say; and 5.4 times as many days, 91.413 for a Ghent dickedinnen, and 74.144 days for a Mechelen Rooslaken. That is certainly a much greater gulf in values that would be found today between every-day clothing and luxury apparel, for men at least. Consider that in Toronto, in July 2008, a journeymen carpenter earns a minimum of $33.07 per hour. In 91.413 days (i.e., the number of days’ wages to purchase that Ghent dickedinnen), at 8 hrs a day, that carpenter would earn $24,184 CAD (about € 15,115) and would never spend even 10 percent of that on clothing.
N63|Three Centuries of Luxury Textile Consumption in the Low Countries and England, 1330 - 1570: New Methodologies for Estimating Changes in Real Values|This study is a much revised and extended version of two previously issued working papers on the production, sale, and consumption of woollen textiles in England and the Low Countries, from the fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries. It focuses on the hey-day of the production and international trade in heavy-weight, very high quality, luxury woollen broadcloths (Flemish and English), during these three centuries. From the 1290s to the 1460s, as I have argued in earlier publications, the consequences of widespread international warfare, and the consequent dislocations to major trading routes, the sharp rise in transportation and transaction costs, and taxation, combined with disruptive coinage debasements and various trade barriers, and drastic declines in population (from plagues and warfare) produced major transformations in the international trade and production of textiles: a relative shift from cheaper line textiles (whose producers were price-takers) to very high priced luxury textiles — silks and woollens (whose producers were price-makers). Table 1 provides the wool compositions, dimensions, and weights of the various textiles. The major concern of this study is to estimate changes in the ‘real’ value of luxury woollen over these three centuries, especially for the longest price series: for the Ghent dickedinnen broadcloths, from the 1330s to the 1570s. The available price data are, of course, in current money-of-account: the pond groot of Flanders. Because of the chronic coinage debasement that afflicted this era, we cannot use current prices. Thus, for example, in the two centuries from 1350 to 1550, the quantity of fine silver in the Flemish penny or groot was reduced, in both fineness and weight, from 2.067 grams to 0.474 g – an overall reduction of 77.1 percent; and by 1580, that quantity had fallen to just 0.300 g. Most historians have sought a false remedy for this problem of coinage debasement: to estimate ‘real’ prices in terms of ‘silver equivalents’, i.e., the quantity of fine silver represented in the current circulating silver penny and thus in the penny (1d) of the money-of-account. Why this method is fallacious (in several respects) is a major aspect of this paper. Instead, three alternative methods of estimating real values over time have been utilized. The first is a method similar to the common calculation of real wages (NWI/CPI = RWI): that is, using a common base period of 1451-75 for all prices, I have calculated price indexes for all the textiles (Flemish and English) in this study; and I have then divided that index by the Consumer Price Indexes for Flanders, Brabant, and England (Table 18). If the textile price index rose more than did the CPI, its real value had also risen. The second and related method does not involve index numbers, but a comparison of the market values of the three ‘baskets of consumables’ with those of the textiles: the number of such ‘baskets of consumables’ whose market value equalled the value of each of the luxury woollen broadcloths under consideration, over these three centuries. The third method involves the purchasing power of labour: using my own tabulations of daily money wages for master masons and carpenters in the leading towns of Flanders, Brabant, and England, over these centuries, I have calculated the number of days’ wages that a master mason would have required to buy a unit of these textiles, over these three centuries. For any short period, such as that given in Table 2 (1535-44), comparing values of woollens and worsteds, all three methods provide the same results. But over the longue durée of this study, from the 1330s to the 1570s, these methods often produce differing results: for sometimes the real values of these textiles in terms of masons’ wages rose, while their values in terms of commodity baskets fell. The explanation for such a divergence is that the MRP of labour and the purchasing power of masons’s wages did not change in accordances with changes in the real values of the commodities in the ‘baskets of consumables’. The study ends by demonstrating the enormous differences in the purchasing power of modern-day building craftsmen with that of sixteenth-century craftsmen – and the sharp fall in the percentage shares of textiles and foodstuffs in the consumer price indexes, then and now (i.e., in Canada, in 2008).
N63|Why sharecropping? : explaining its presence and absence in Europe's vineyards, 1750-1950|The traditional view that sharecropping was a cause of low productivity in European agriculture prior to the Second World War has been challenged by economic historians, and today the contact is often considered as efficient at reducing the monitoring costs associated with labour and allocation of risk between landowners and farmers, especially when capital markets were weak for working capital. Yet if sharecropping was a relatively efficient contract, why was it not found more often? This paper looks at the vine, a crop that was widespread in Europe and that has been central to the current debates. It argues that while the literature has been right to emphasise the importance of the high monitoring costs, it has ignored the equally important costs associated with dividing the harvest. These were sufficiently large to make the contract unattractive, except in the few cases where the landowner was prepared to be actively involved in wine making and its sale, such as was found in Beaujolais or Tuscany.
N63|Hanseatic commerce in textiles from the Low Countries and England during the Later Middle Ages: changing trends in textiles, markets, prices, and values, 1290 - 1570|This paper analyses the major changes in textile products, production costs, prices, and market orientations during the era when the ‘draperies’ or cloth industries of the late-medieval Low Countries and England had become increasingly dependent upon northern markets and the German Hanseatic League as the major vehicle in marketing their textiles. In several previous articles, I had examined the major factors that had led to the industrial and commercial reorientations of the these cloth industries during the 14th and 15th centuries. In brief, the spreading stain of widespread warfare, piracy, and general insecurity, especially in the Mediterranean basin, from the 1290s (to the 1460s), led to a rise in transport and transaction costs that, in turn, had three major consequences for the Low Countries’ and England’s textile-based economies: (1) to cripple the export-oriented production of the very cheap and light fabrics, most of which had been sent to Mediterranean markets and had comprised the bulk of northern textile shipments to this region; (2) to encourage most draperies in the Low Countries and England to re-orient their export-oriented cloth production more and more towards high-priced ultra-luxury quality woollens, woven almost exclusively from the finer English wools, but wools that came to be burdened with high export taxes; and (3) to force these northern cloth industries, facing increasing difficulties in Mediterranean commerce, to become far more dependent on Hanseatic merchants and German towns for their cloth sales, certainly by the mid-14th century. But in effecting these industrial and commercial orientations, the Low Countries’ draperies encountered a new and even more dangerous challenge from expanding English competition in textiles, which enjoyed the signal advantage of control over high quality wools, which, for the domestic cloth industry, were tax-free and much cheaper. Nevertheless, for reasons outlined in this and earlier papers, the English took well more than a century to achieve final victory in the woollen broadcloth trade, though one that came to be fundamentally based upon German commercial forces, along with other commercial, monetary, and industrial factors outlined in this paper. Obeying the law of comparative advantage, the textile industries of the Low Countries responded to this English victory by once more re-orienting production to cheaper cloths, especially cheap, light worsted-says; but they were able to do so only when structural changes in European markets and trading networks, with falling transaction costs, from the later 15th century, once more favoured the export-oriented production of such cheap textiles. The major contributions of this paper, however, also lie in analysing production, product, cost, and prices changes in textiles, both cheap worsted and luxury woollens, in terms of 15 tables: (1) English wool and broadcloth exports, 1281-1550; (2) Production indices for the woollen cloth industries of the southern Low Countries, 1316-1575; (3) Production indices for the Hondschoote sayetterie and Leiden woollen industry, 1376-1570; (4 - 7) Prices and relative values of Ghent woollens: in terms of values of commodity baskets and a mason’s daily wage: 1331-1570 (no. of days’ wages to buy one cloth); (8) Prices of English woollen cloths at Cambridge and Winchester: and values in terms of a mason’s daily wage; and mean values of English cloth exports in pounds sterling, groot Flemish, and florins; (9) Prices of various Flemish woollen broadcloths, compared to the Flemish composite price index: 1351-1550; (10) Prices of various Brabantine woollen cloths, compared to the Brabant composite price index; and the no. of days’ wages for a master mason to buy one Mechelen broadcloth, 1351-1520; (11) Prices of Hondschoote Says and Ghent Dickedinnen Woollens, in pounds groot Flemish, compared with the purchasing power an Antwerp master mason's daily wages; (12) Purchase prices of Ghent woollens: by rank order of values, 1360-69: in pounds groot Flemish, units of Commodity Baskets of equivalent value, and the number of a master mason’s day’s wages required to purchase each cloth (from the cheapest to highest priced); (13) Dimensions, composition, and weights of selected Flemish and English textiles, 1456-1579; (14) Prices of and taxes on exported English wools (sacks), 1211-1500: (15) Prices of English Wools (48 grades) sold at the Calais Staple, in 1475 and 1499.

N63|The anti-red shift – to the 'Dark Side': Colour changes in Flemish luxury woollens, 1300 - 1550|This study documents, though it cannot fully explain, the striking shift in the spectrum of colour patterns in woollen textiles, from those of the Black Death era in the mid to late fourteenth century to those of the fifteenth and the first half of the sixteenth century, in the southern Low Countries: a radical shift from bright red and vivid colours, especially scarlet, or mixed colours (in medley and striped woollens) to much darker, blue-based colours, ending up with overwhelmingly black colours. The evidence is taken from the annual purchases of high-grade luxury quality woollen textiles for the upper echelons of the civic governments of Bruges (from 1302 to 1496) and of Mechelen (1361-1415, and 1471 - 1550): for the burgermasters or mayors, the aldermen (schepenen), and the upper clerks. Thus, in the Mechelen civic accounts, 75 percent of the woollens purchased for these civic leaders, from 1471 to 1550, were black, uniformly dark black. In the first half of the sixteenth century, from 1501 to 1550, 98 percent of those woollens were black. While other colours – reds, greens, blues, browns – can also be found, they were purchased only for the lesser officials. Clearly the civic leaders, the urban ‘patriciate’ had acquired a decisive preference for black woollens, one also shown by the nobility. But at Bruges, in the four decades of the mid fourteenth century, from the 1340s (just before the Black Death) to the 1370s, the bright, vivid, red or scarlet, and multi-coloured textiles clearly predominated: varying from 72.4 to 81.7 percent by number purchased, and from 77.25 to 86.19 per cent by value. The differences in percentages by number and value is explained by the decisive prominence of the most costly and luxurious of all medieval woollens: the scarlets, dyed in the extremely costly brilliant red dye kermes (extracted from Mediterranean insects). Scarlets often accounted for over a third of the textiles so purchased in the 14th century, but their number fell sharply in the 15th century, along with the radical shift in the colour spectrum to much darker blue and then black textiles. This study explains the differences in the production costs and values of scarlets and of other dyed woollen broadcloths, while demonstrating with comparative price and wage analyses (i.e., the purchasing power of industrial wages) that only the very rich could afford to buy these textiles: that the principal markets were the nobility, the upper mercantile bourgeoisie, and political leaders. Indeed, a master mason would have to spend more than a year’s income to buy a scarlet. The famed Johan Huizinga (Autumn of the Middle Ages) had indeed commented on this predilection for dark and especially black (with purples) colours in the dress of the mid-fifteenth-century Burgundian court; but he was mistaken in his supposition that by the end of this century, clothing fashions had gone more toward blues, in light of the evidence from the Mechelen accounts. Huizinga and others have suggested various theories for this shift in the colour spectrum for textiles and for the later preference for the ‘dark side’, but none – including any that I can offer – is convincing. Economic historians, however, must not be so supply-side oriented that they ignore the vital question of colours and thus fashions in textiles, in creating market demand. For the subsequent victory of the New Draperies, over the costly, heavy-weight woollens of the Old Draperies, in producing lighter, cheaper, but also more brightly dyed textiles, in more vivid colours, a transformation followed by the massive influx of Asian printed calicoes (with radical floral and geometric designs), helped to create the market conditions for the 18th-century Industrial Revolution, in both geographic range and income distributions.

N63|Real Wages and the 'Malthusian Problem' in Antwerp and South-Eastern England, 1400 - 1700: A regional comparison of levels and trends in real wages|In a path-breaking but largely overlooked study, published in a festchrift thirty years ago (1975), Herman Van der Wee provided a comparison of prices and real wages of building craftsmen in the regions of Antwerp and south-eastern England, from 1400 to 1700. To do so, he constructed a composite price index modelled as closely as possibly on the famous 'basket of consumables' price index that Phelps Brown and Hopkins had produced, for south-eastern England, in 1956. His graphs revealed that real wages for these craftsmen in Antwerp did not suffer the same deterioration as did comparable real wages in England, and in many other parts of Europe, during the era of the Price Revolution, ca. 1520 - ca. 1640 -- although the actual levels of the real wages were not shown. Most economic historians have attributed that significant fall in real wages, especially in England, to the consequences of population growth during this era: i.e., to a fall in the marginal productivity of labour, with a dramatic alteration in the land:labour ratio. There is, however, an alternative explanation: the consequences of an inflation, induced primarily by monetary forces, when nominal wages failed to keep pace with the rise in consumer prices (especially those for foodstuffs). This study examines the role of demographic, monetary, and also institutional factors in producing these diverging trends in real-wages. But the major contribution is to expand upon Van der Wee's study -- which used only disembodied index numbers -- by calculating the annual values of the baskets of consumables in both England and the Antwerp region, and thus in presenting the actual levels of real wages, in terms of the number of such baskets that building craftsmen could purchase with their annual money wages (for 210 days of employment), in each region, combining wage rates for summer and winter work (seasonal wages). The results are very striking. As measured in 50-year harmonic means, the level of real wages for master masons in Antwerp was only 83.79% of that for master masons in south-east England, in 1401-50; and worse, only 78.15% of the level for English masons in 1451-1500; but then real wages for Antwerp master masons began to climb above those for their English counterparts: reaching 102.60% in 1501-50, 136.34% in 1551-1600; and, for the peak achievement, 154.49% in 1601-50, before falling back, somewhat, to a level of 125.58% in the final half century studied, in 1651-1700. But part of that gain or achievement for master masons in Antwerp was at the expense of the real incomes for their journeymen-labourers, who did not fare quite as well, in comparison with the English journeymen labourers: earning just 68.94% of their English counterparts in 1401-50; 69.38% in 1451-1500; 91.18% in 1501-50; 107.60% in 1551-1600; 133.46% in 1601-50; and 109.88% in the final period, 1651-1700. Oddly enough, the Antwerp masons (both masters and journeymen) fared the very best after Antwerp had passed its Golden Age. The hypothetical explanations for these divergencies may be even more interesting than the data themselves. The study concludes by examining the statistical and theoretical nature of 'real wages': in terms of the purchasing power of the annual nominal money wage; in terms of the marginal productivity of labour; in terms of the marginal revenue product of labour; and in terms of the Total Factor Productivity of the occupation or economy as a whole. These data, however, do not take account of another factor that may have narrowed the gap between the actual levels of consumption in southern England and the Antwerp region: excise taxes on consumption, which had been a basic feature of urban finances in the southern Low Countries since the thirteenth century, but which were introduced into England only in 1643, shortly after the outbreak of the Civil War between Crown and Parliament.
N63|The Rise, Expansion, and Decline of the Italian Cloth Industries, 1100 - 1730: a study in conjoncture, transaction costs, and comparative advantage|This study of the Italian wool-based textile industries (woollens, worsteds, and serges) seeks to examine its rise, expansion, and ultimate decline, over a period of five centuries (from ca. 1200 to ca. 1730) in the context of both international competition and economic conjoncture, in the context of the major macro-economic and demographic changes that the European economy experienced during these five centuries. The story commences during the so-called 'Commercial Revolution' era of the thirteenth-century when the Franco-Flemish cloth industries of north-west European dominated the international markets in a very wide range of these textiles, even in the Mediterranean basin. From the 1290s, and then into the better know period of the Hundred Years' War (1337-1453) the European economy suffered from the ravages of ever more widespread and debilitating warfare, throughout the Mediterranean basin and western Europe, and then from various factors, including plagues, that led to serious depopulation. The consequences led to a severe rise in transportation and transaction costs that gravely undermined the profitability of long-distance trade in cheaper textiles. That, in turn forced most textile manufacturers dependent on long-distance trade, and especially those who had operated as price-takers, to re-orient their export-based production to far higher priced, indeed luxury textiles, which could better sustain the burden of rising transactions costs, especially in acting as 'price-makers' engaged in monopolistic competition. That industrial-commercial transformation can be seen in the textile industries of northern France, the Low Countries, and England; but also those in Catalonia and above all in Italy: principally Tuscany and Lombardy. In so far as warfare and rising transaction costs limited the importation of even luxury textiles from north-west Europe, the Italian cloth industries thereby gained a far larger share of Mediterranean markets. This study focuses in particular on the ensuring history of the Florentine woollen cloth industry in the later Middle Ages. One price that all of these luxury-oriented cloth industries had to pay was steeply rising tax burdens on exported English wools; for the prime determinant of luxury quality in these textiles was the use of the finer grade English wools, the best in the world, until the development (through breeding and management) of Spanish merino wools, which finally succeeded in rivalling and then surpassing the English by the later sixteenth century. By the sixteenth century, with a reduction in European warfare and with renewed population growth, substantial economic growth, and significant innovations in transportation, transactions costs fell, and fell enough to make long-distance trade in cheaper textiles once more profitable; and that is reflected in product changes in the Florentine textile industry, which increasingly used Spanish merino wools in place of the English. But the most important events in the history of the Italian textile industries was the sudden rise of the Venetian cloth industry from the early to mid-sixteenth century, reaching a peak in the early seventeenth century, and then experiencing an equally rapid decline, in the famous of English textile competition, by the agency of the new Levant Company, which gained major advantages over the Italians in the large Ottoman Empire. The study concludes by examining the nature of those English advantages, which lay far more in the commercial (and transportation sphere) than in the industrial sphere, in terms of both traditional heavy weight woollens (made from Spanish wools) and the lighter, coarser, and cheaper fabrics of the English New Draperies (benefiting from a transformation in English wool production, from the Tudor-Stuart Enclosures). In sum: a study of comparative advantage in five centuries of international trade, in wool-based textiles, in terms of transaction costs, inputs (wools), and commercial organization.
N63|Old and new ceramics: manufactures, products and markets in the Venetian Republic in the 17th and 18th centuries|This contribution aims to draw up a map of ceramics production sites in the Venetian area from 1600 to 1800, bearing particular attention to institutional and informal devices allowing local production to adapt to European markets trends and innovations. The paper investigates the logics of privileges allowance to pivate entrepreneurs outside of the guilds framework, conceived probably as a protection for offer more than for demand: they had to do with the exploitation of natural resources at a local level (water, raw materials), and of the services of a labor force accumulating specialized skills working in close contact with foreign invited artisans. The defence and seizure of industrial expertise was in fact the object of enduring court cases between manufacturers fighting to retain and attract highly qualified workers. These were the actual agents of innovation exchange among European, Italian and regional production centres. Continuous exchange and imitation allowed Venetian privileged firms to keep positions in econdary European markets providing most of the demand for local production.

N63|Hacia un cártel perfecto. Los acuerdos colusivos en el sector siderúrgico español (1871-1907)|The aim of this work is to analyse the process of cartelisation in the modern Spanish iron and steel industry from the first pricing agreements in 1871 to the creation of the Central Siderúrgica in 1907. Using documentation from archives of iron and steel companies, the article studies the internal operation of the cartels and the difficulties faced in detecting cheating and in avoiding competition from free riders. The work also aims to contribute to the debate on the responsibility of supply within the structure of the Spanish iron and steel market and its influence on the Spanish industrialization.
N63|Networks of People in Specialty Production: Family Firms in the Iron and Steel Wire Industries in Spain (1870-2000)|Capital intensive industries in specialized niches of production have constituted solid ground for family firms in Spain, as evidenced by the experience of the iron and steel wire industries between 1870 and 2000. The embeddedness of these firms in their local and regional environments have allowed the creation of networks that, together with favourable institutional conditions, significantly explain the dominance of family entrepreneurship in iron and steel wire manufacturing in Spain, until the end of the 20th century. Dominance of family firms at the regional level has not been an obstacle for innovation in wire manufacturing in Spain, which has taken place even when institutional conditions blocked innovation and traditional networking. Therefore, economic theories about the difficulties dynastic family firms may have to perform appropriately in science-based industries must be questioned.
N63|Subcontracting and vertical integration in the Spanish cotton industry|This paper examines changes in the organization of the Spanish cotton industry from 1720 to 1860 in its core region of Catalonia. As the Spanish cotton industry adopted the most modern technology and experienced the transition to the factory system, cotton spinning and weaving mills became increasingly vertically integrated. Asset specificity more than other factors explained this tendency towards vertical integration. The probability for a firm of being vertically integrated was higher among firms located in districts with high concentration ratios and rose with size and the use of modern machinery. Simultaneously, subcontracting predominated in other phases of production and distribution where transaction costs appears to be less important.
N63|I panni di lana: Nascita, espansione e declino dell’industria tessile di lana italiana, 1100-1730<BR>[The woollen cloth industry in Italy: The rise, expansion, and decline of the Italian cloth industries, 1100 - 1730]|This study of the Italian wool-based textile industries (woollens, worsteds, and serges) seeks to examine its rise, expansion, and ultimate decline, over a period of five centuries (from ca. 1200 to ca. 1730) in the context of both international competition and economic conjoncture, in the context of the major macro-economic and demographic changes that the European economy experienced during these five centuries. The story commences during the so-called ‘Commercial Revolution’ era of the thirteenth-century when the Franco-Flemish cloth industries of north-west European dominated the international markets in a very wide range of these textiles, even in the Mediterranean basin. From the 1290s, and then into the better know period of the Hundred Years’ War (1337-1453) the European economy suffered from the ravages of ever more widespread and debilitating warfare, throughout the Mediterranean basin and western Europe, and then from various factors, including plagues, that led to serious depopulation. The consequences led to a severe rise in transportation and transaction costs that gravely undermined the profitability of long-distance trade in cheaper textiles. That, in turn forced most textile manufacturers dependent on long-distance trade, and especially those who had operated as price-takers, to re-orient their export-based production to far higher priced, indeed luxury textiles, which could better sustain the burden of rising transactions costs, especially in acting as ‘price-makers’ engaged in monopolistic competition. That industrial-commercial transformation can be seen in the textile industries of northern France, the Low Countries, and England; but also those in Catalonia and above all in Italy: principally Tuscany and Lombardy. In so far as warfare and rising transaction costs limited the importation of even luxury textiles from north-west Europe, the Italian cloth industries thereby gained a far larger share of Mediterranean markets. This study focuses in particular on the ensuring history of the Florentine woollen cloth industry in the later Middle Ages. One price that all of these luxury-oriented cloth industries had to pay was steeply rising tax burdens on exported English wools; for the prime determinant of luxury quality in these textiles was the use of the finer grade English wools, the best in the world, until the development (through breeding and management) of Spanish merino wools, which finally succeeded in rivalling and then surpassing the English by the later sixteenth century. By the sixteenth century, with a reduction in European warfare and with renewed population growth, substantial economic growth, and significant innovations in transportation, transactions costs fell, and fell enough to make long-distance trade in cheaper textiles once more profitable; and that is reflected in product changes in the Florentine textile industry, which increasingly used Spanish merino wools in place of the English. But the most important events in the history of the Italian textile industries was the sudden rise of the Venetian cloth industry from the early to mid-sixteenth century, reaching a peak in the early seventeenth century, and then experiencing an equally rapid decline, in the famous of English textile competition, by the agency of the new Levant Company, which gained major advantages over the Italians in the large Ottoman Empire.

Then, traces the different stages of the crisis, which lasted 25 years but had an uneven course.

N63|Spatial Dependence and Regional Convergence in Brazil|The present paper introduces some spatial econometric techniques to the convergence issue among Brazilian states. State data over the 1970-95 period are considered to explore previous results that suggested convergence. As in the US case, strong patterns of spatial correlation are found during the period. The spatial econometric analysis reveals that spatial error dependence seems to be present resulting in the potential for model misspecification. The results indicate that, although some convergence among states is taking place, it seems to be more of regional phenomena or perhaps some type of club convergence than a global convergence process. States like São Paulo dominate the first group while the Northeast states form a second group or club.

La fabricación de locomotoras de vapor en España, ¿Una ocasión perdida para la industria?|El objetivo de este trabajo es el de analizar si existían elementos objetivos, de carácter tecnológico o infraestructural, que impidieran un temprano nacimiento de la industria de construcción de material ferroviario y, específicamente, de locomotoras de vapor. Para ello se hace un repaso a lo acontecido en otros países de la Europa occidental y Estados Unidos para conocer en que condiciones surgió esta actividad. A continuación se efectúa una reconstrucción del parque de locomotoras de las mayores compañías ferroviarias españoles, con el objeto de conocer su demanda y la procedencia de las locomotoras adquiridas. Seguidamente se reflexiona sobre las condiciones de la industria española en la segunda mitad del siglo XIX al objeto de establecer comparaciones con otros países que nos indiquen si las diferencias eran o no especialmente sustanciales. Por último se estudia, sintéticamente, la aparición del sector en España y su posterior desarrollo, lo que permite observar las similitudes y divergencias con los países de nuestro entorno .

En ese sentido, cuatro son los grandes paradigmas tecnológicos dentro del axioma termodinámico: las máquinas alternativas de vapor, los motores de combustión interna alternativos, las turbinas de vapor y las turbinas de gas. Cada una de estas trayectorias abrió oportunidades tecnológicas e industriales que, en un país atrasado y dependiente como España, fueron difíciles de aprovechar. En los tres primeros paradigmas descritos los procesos de innovación nacionales fueron muy escasos durante el periodo estudiado –cuando no inexistentes–, pero incluso la aparición y crecimiento de un sector industrial especializado en la fabricación de motores térmicos, aunque fuese a partir de la tecnología exterior, fue, o bien muy tardío (caso de las máquinas alternativas de vapor) o bien suficientemente lento y escaso (motores de combustión interna alternativos y turbinas de vapor) como para no poderlo considerar un sector clave en el cambio estructural, por más que durante el primer tercio del siglo XX se desarrollaran en la Península algunos centros importantes de producción de motores. Analizando los hitos principales en la historia tecnológica de las máquinas térmicas y estudiando en detalle todas las patentes relacionadas que se registraron en España entre 1826 y 1914 –junto con las más significativas depositadas en otros países– se pretende arrojar luz sobre la mecánica de los procesos de cambio técnico en el largo plazo, sobre las características del sistema español de innovación y sobre las causas de su escasa participación en el establecimiento y dirección de las trayectorias de los motores térmicos. Por último, también pretendemos acercarnos al origen de la industria nacional relacionada con este tipo de maquinaria antes de la Primera Guerra Mundial, para tratar de averiguar en qué medida pudieron existir capacidades y actitudes innovadoras y cuál fue su grado de dependencia tecnológica del exterior.

N63|Siglo y medio de comercio exterior de productos corcheros en españa, 1849-1999|In this work it is analyzed the evolution and composition of the foreign Spanish trade of cork products during the second half of the XIXth century and the XXth century. For it there has been in use the Estadística del Comercio Exterior de España, elaborated from 1849 up to the current importance. The above mentioned analysis sets up important changes in the characteristics that the cork business has had in Spain during the considered period, at least from a commercial point of view, emphasizing the major relevancy acquired by the import trade in the last quarter of the XXth century and the return to the stopper, which has frustrated the diversification process of the cork industry and trade, initiated in the first years of last century. For countries, Portugal has turned, from the civil war, into the first world power to the detriment of Spain. Our country could not have recovered the commercial leadership, that had during the second half of the XIXth century and the first third of the XXth, on the principal cork markets and, at present, it has small presence, in relative terms, on the markets of the new wine countries, great buyers of cork stoppers.
N63|Were Spanish migrants attracted by industrial agglomerations? An analysis for the interwar years in the light of the new economic geography|In this paper we examine whether access to markets had a significant influence on migration choices of Spanish internal migrants in the inter-war years. We perform a structural contrast of a New Economic Geography model that focus on the forward linkage that links workers location choice with the geography of industrial production, one of the centripetal forces that drive agglomeration in the NEG models. The results highlight the presence of this forward linkage in the Spanish economy of the inter-war period. That is, we prove the existence of a direct relation between workers localization decisions and the market potential of the host regions. In addition, the direct estimation of the values associated with key parameters in the NEG model allows us to simulate the migratory flows derived from different scenarios of the relative size of regions and the distances between them. We show that in Spain the power of attraction of the agglomerations grew as they increased in size, but the high elasticity estimated for the migration costs reduced the intensity of the migratory flows. This could help to explain the apparently low intensity of internal migrations in Spain until its upsurge during the 1920s. This also explains the geography of migrations in Spain during this period, which hardly affected the regions furthest from the large industrial agglomerations (i.e., regions such as Andalusia, Estremadura and Castile-La Mancha) but had an intense effect on the provinces nearest to the principal centres of industrial development.
N63|Creating firms for a new century: Determinants of firm creation around 1900|A rapidly growing literature in industrial economics and regional economics uses data sets of individual firms or regional firm creation rates to answer the central question: What makes entrepreneurs? Which factors encourage some people to set up their own business and create jobs, and what prevents potential entrepreneurs from doing so? This contribution explores the determinants of regional differences in firm creation rates by using a new data set of 4036 individual firms from Southwest Germany around 1900. Agglomeration effects and earlier firm creations stimulate current firm creation. In addition, a small and medium firm environment allows the formation of specific human capital – another favourable factor for a dynamic firm creation process in some regions.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N63|Builders’ wages in southern England and the southern Low Countries, 1346 -1500: a comparative study of trends in and levels of real incomes|The traditional and almost universal method of expressing real wages is by index numbers, according to the formula: RWI = NWI/CPI: i.e., the real wage is the quotient of the nominal (money) wage index divided by the consumer price index, all employing a common base period (here: 1451-75 = 100). This method is very useful in comparing long-term trends, and in ascertaining whether changes in nominal (money) wages or changes in the price level were paramount in determining changes in real wages. But it does not permit us to make any judgements about the levels of real wages and thus does not permit us to make comparisons of real wages amongst different regions. This paper presents a new method of presenting and comparing real wages, and one that may also be independent of any common base period. This particular paper compares the actual changing levels of real wages for building craftsmen and their journeymen-labourers in southern England, Flanders, and Brabant, in the late medieval era (1346-1500): and the real wage is expressed here as the number of very similar ‘baskets of consumables’ that a craftsmen and his journeyman could each purchase with his annual money wage income, based on 210 days of employment each year. Using the working papers for Phelps Brown & Hopkins’ very famous price and real-wage indexes for England (1264-1954), which were presented only in disembodied index numbers, I was able to compute the annual values of all commodities in their ‘basket of consumables’ and thus the total value in pence sterling. Herman Van der Wee had constructed a price-index for the Antwerp region (1400-1700), with annual values in pence groot Brabant (but still converted into index numbers); and I have produced a similar price index for Flanders (1348-1500), with annual values in pence groot Flemish. All three baskets have very similar contents. All wages and prices are expressed in terms of quinquennial (five-year) harmonic means The results of this comparative analysis are best expressed in the nine graphs that accompany this paper. But some brief conclusions may be stated here. First (as I had contended in two recent articles) the Black Death did not usher in a ‘golden age of the labourer’ in either England or Flanders, but was instead followed by a quarter century of falling real wages, because rampant inflation erased and countered the gains in nominal (money) wages. Real wages rose in the very late 14th and early 15th century because of a combination of institutional wage-stickiness and deflation. In the Low Countries, beset with war-induced and very inflationary coinage debasements, real wages again fell until the late 1430s, rising thereafter only with monetary stability, deflation, and ‘wage-stickiness; but then falling once more from the 1460s, because of warfare and debasement-induced inflations (to the 1490s). This evidence refutes the almost universally accepted axiom that the real wage is determined entirely by the marginal revenue product of labour. I do not, however, completely rule out the role of changes in productivity, though I offer the hypothesis that regional differences in Total Factor Productivity (and some degree of factor immobility) must be called upon to explain marked differences in real wages. The most striking difference is that, at the time of the Black Death, real wages for master building craftsmen in southern England were only a third of those enjoyed by master craftsmen in Bruges; but by the 1480s, when inflation was far more serious in Flanders than in England, that gap had narrowed to just about 80 percent of that for the Bruges craftsmen, still the best paid in north-west Europe. In Bruges, the craftsmen’s journeymen did not fare as well, however, earning only half the master’s wage, while the English journeymen came to earn two-thirds of their masters’ wage by the 15th century – and sometimes, during periods of severe debasement-induced inflations in Flanders, the English journeyman’s real wage was slightly higher than that for his Bruges counterpart. In general, English building craftsmen fared better than their counterparts in Antwerp, earning somewhat less in the early 15th century, but more in the last third of the century, when inflations from severe coinage debasements again reduced real wages in the Low Countries.
N63|Trade Policy and Industrial Location in Spain (1856-1995):a first analysis in the light of the New Economic Geography|This papers gives new evidence on the relationship between integration (internal and external)and industrial agglomeration in the presence of scale economies by testing directly one of the predictions that can be derived from Krugman (1991).That is,the existence of regional nominal wage gradients and its transformation following the changes in trade regimes.In this framework,we analyze whether or not,during the period 1856-1995,protectionists policies could have favored the loss of centrality of the main coastal location of Spanish industry (Barcelona).
N63|Industrial agglomerations and wage gradients: the Spanish economy in the interwar period (?)|The geographical distribution of Spanish industry shows today two interesting features. On the one hand, a high concentration, higher than what we can find in the majority of European countries. On the other hand, the coexistence of two industrial cities: Madrid and Barcelona. In Spain, the larger increases in the levels of concentration are to be found during the long period that goes from the middle of the 19th century to the Civil War (1936-1939). As for the geographical location of large industrial centers, the second half of the 19th century was dominated by the rising of Barcelona as the main center of industrial production in Spain. In those years, Barcelona got to concentrate a third of Spanish industrial output. However, the turning of the century marks a halt in this process, and Madrid begins then to increase its share in Spanish manufacturing, filling the gap gradually with the Catalan city. In this paper we suggest two explanatory hypothesis to these facts. On the one hand, we believe that the increase in the geographical concentration of Spanish industries along the period 1850-1935 is linked to the existence of scale economies in a context of increasing domestic market integration. On the other hand, we think that the initial development of Barcelona as the Spanish industrial capital and its subsequent loss of punch in front of other locations like Madrid, both the capital-city of the country and its geographical center, could be related, though not exclusively, with the changes in Spanish trade policy at the end of the 19th century. At this point in time, the nationalistic reaction after the loss of the remaining colonies, supposes the abandon of a liberal regime, characterized by a relative openness, and the adoption of a nationalistic model of development that breaks the former dynamics and imposes harsh restrictions in the international trade of goods and raw materials. The paper pretends also to provide new evidence on the relationship between integration and industrial agglomeration in the presence of scale economies, by testing directly one of the predictions that can be derived from Krugman (1991) seminal paper, that is, the existence of regional nominal wage gradients and its transformation following changes in trade regimes. Hanson (1996, 1997, 1998) has analyzed in depth these effects in the case of the Mexican economy and has shown how trade reform has weakened the industrial belt around Mexico city, giving rise to new industrial centers in the north of the country. On the contrary, our case study analyzes the effects of the substitution of an open economy by a closed economy regime, exactly the opposite process studied by Hanson. To this aim, in the empirical analysis, we test the existence of a nominal wage gradient centered in Barcelona during the period 1914-1930. Our results indicate the existence of a wage gradient centered in Barcelona during the interwar period (1914-1930) and its weakening after 1925. The evidence on the genesis of a new wage gradient centered in Madrid is not conclusive.
N63|Lira stabilisation, construction boom and the level of economic activity: the Shift in Favour of Non-Traded Goods Prices and Urban Rents|Lira convertibility in the 19th century was mainly advocated due to the need to attract foreign capital, to avoid the temptation of monetizing the huge state debt, to keep the state budget under control and to limit the uncertainties in trade settlements with Italy's main partners, which were gold-standard countries. However, going back to gold had various consequences. Urban rents and the sheltered sectors of the economy, as well as construction activity were favoured by a significant, relative price shift, while industrial and agricultural exporters were subject to additional stress. Two resumption episodes are studied and some conclusions for the present process of European monetary unification and enlargement are discussed.

N63|Patents, International Technology Transfer and Industrial Dependence in 19th Century Spain|This paper will attempt to reflect on the processes of international technology transfer at the beginning of European industrialization. During this period, when the achievement and the spread of technical innovations were vital to the acceleration of economic growth, the more underdeveloped countries experienced an increase in technological dependency on the leading countries. In some of them, the transfer of foreign technical information was more important than that generated by the nation itself, which —in spite of the cost increase of implanting foreign innovations, given the scant integration of international equipment markets— supposed a reduction of the degree of uncertainty associated with all processes of technological changes. The principal objective of the following pages is to analyse in detail the Spanish case, a country in obvious economic decline at the end of the 18th century and well below the average for Europe for most of the 19th century. This well-known delay translated into an external technological dependence in several economic sectors, which left its mark on the industrial protection system. Technological information which contains patent applications will be taken as a valid indicator —although only partial— of the direction and structure of the innovation processes in the Spanish economy. Upon careful study of the origin of patented inventions, it can be ascertained, among other things, the degree of dependence upon external technology; which countries played an essential role in the transfer of technology to Spain; and which economic sectors depended more on foreign technology.
N63|Regional industrialisation without national growth: The Catalan industrialization and the growth of Spanish economy (1830-1861)|This paper has two main objectives. First, it provides a stylised description of the Catalan industrial path of the period 1830-1861. Second, it reviews the evolution of the Catalan industry in the Spanish context and, thus, can serve to describe the relative importance of the Catalan industrial experience. Consequently, it is mainly devoted to computing and analysing the growth rates of Catalan industries during the early phase of industrialisation. The results show that Catalonia experienced a true process of industrialisation during the period 1830 to 1861, but that its contribution in rapid increase in Spanish GDP was relatively small.
N63|Industrial agglomerations and wage gradients: the Spanish economy in the interwar period|This paper gives new evidence on the relationship between integration and industrial agglomeration in the presence of scale economies, by testing directly one of the predictions that can be derived from Krugman (1991), that is, the existence of regional nominal wage gradients and its transformation following changes in trade regimes. Our case study analyzes the effects of the substitution of an open economy by a closed economy regime, exactly the opposite process studied by Hanson (1996, 1997). In Spain, during the interwar period, protectionist policies would have favored the loss of centrality of the coastal location (Barcelona) and the relative rise of central locations (such as Madrid). Our results indicate the existence of a wage gradient centered in Barcelona during the interwar period (1914-1930) and its weakening after 1925.
N63|A provincial (stock) exchange in Belgium: the case of Termonde|Like in many other European countries, Belgium had in the 19th century a lot of little stock exchanges. These institutions played an important role in the regional economy. They fulfilled in the first place a number of specific tasks regarding the trade in consumer goods such as seeds and grains. A closer investigation of these stock exchanges is not only important to have a better view on the local and regional networks but also to place them in a larger national perspective. By their specific structure these stock exchanges developed themselves differently compared to their counterparts in the important cities and left their marks on the stock exchange evolution in the 19th century.
N63|Wage-stickiness, monetary changes, and real incomes in late-medieval England and the Low Countries, 1300 - 1500: did money matter?|Bedevilling the ongoing debate about changes in real-incomes in late-medieval western Europe, especially during the so-called ‘Golden Age of the Labourer’, is the very troubling issue of ‘wage-stickiness’. The standard and long-traditional explanation for this supposed ‘Golden Age’ of rising real wages is that sharp fall in population – with the Black Death (from 1348), subsequent waves of bubonic plagues, and other forces for demographic contraction up to the late 15th century – dramatically altered the land:labour ratio in ways that led to a pronounced rise in the marginal productivity of labour, which in turn forced up real wages. This simplistic model assumes (1) that rising real wages in the agrarian sector were transmitted to other sectors (whether or not they also experienced rising labour productivity); (2) that changes in the marginal revenue product of labour did not diverge or vary from changes in its marginal productivity; and (3) that wages were flexible, downwards as well as upwards. Though one might readily provide evidence that the MRP of various kinds of labour, in England and the cross-Channel Low Countries (Flanders), did not in fact continually rise as this model predicts, the focus of this paper is instead upon the behaviour of money wages, with widespread nominal ‘wage-stickiness’, in relation to changes in the price-index and cost of living, in both of these countries. For England, the cost-of-living index is measured by the well known Phelps Brown & Hopkins ‘basket of consumables’ index; and for Flanders, it is measured by one that I have constructed from Flemish price data, using the same weights as in the PBH index. For both countries, the evidence indicates that, while money wages for most craftsmen and labourers did rise following the Black Death – though by no means for all labourers -- such a rise did not in all cases keep pace with the inflationary rise in prices that both countries endured for almost 30 years after the Black Death. In England, furthermore, where most craftsmen and workers had suffered a fall in money wages in the two decades before Black Death, the post-Plague rise in money wages did not regain the level of the 1320s until the 1360s. In the later 14th century, however, first England and then Flanders experienced an equally dramatic deflation, one that endured into the first quarter of the 15th century. It was during this deflationary era that real wages finally did rise substantially – and chiefly because nominal money wages remained fixed, while the cost of living fell sharply. The rest of this paper analyses the various institutional, social, and other factors that help to explain the widespread prevalence of money-wage stickiness over very long periods, in England and the Low Countries. For England, the most significant institutional factor to be considered is the role of the 1351 Statute of Labourers, which tried to fix wages at the unusually low level that had pertained on the eve of the Black Death. No comparable wage legislation was imposed in Flanders; and yet the behaviour of real wages there did not significantly differ from those in England. It must also be noted that, in the early to mid 15th century, some money wages did slowly rise, while deflation continued – thus indicating other forces at work to increase real wages; but in Flanders the resumption of short-term inflations, from the 1420s to early 1440s, with coinage debasements, tended to eliminate these gains, especially for woollen textile workers, those employed in Flanders’ major manufacturing industry. The question posed in the title, ‘did money matter’, is a very important one; for the almost equally important focus of this paper is that the late-medieval inflations and deflations (including the pronounced deflation preceding the Black Death) were essentially monetary, and not demographic, phenomena.
N63|Industrial energy from water-mills in the European economy, 5th to 18th Centuries: the limitations of power|The water-mill, though known in the Roman Empire from the second century BCE, did not come to enjoy any widespread use until the 4th or 5th centuries CE, and then chiefly in the West, which was then experiencing not only a rapid decline in the supply of slaves, but also widespread depopulation, and thus a severe scarcity of labour. For the West -- those regions that came to form Europe -- the water-mill then became by far the predominant ‘prime mover’: i.e., an apparatus that converts natural energy into mechanical power. The classic study, as a monograph in technological and engineering history, is Terry S. Reynolds, Stronger than a Hundred Men: A History of the Vertical Water Wheel (Baltimore and London, 1983). Indeed he has calculated that even the early medieval watermills provided about 2 hp, enough to liberate from 30 to 60 persons from the wearisome task of grinding grain into flour, the mill’s virtually sole use during the first millennium. He, and others, have neglected to note, however, that, apart from providing such economies in labour, water-mills also conserved on the capital and land resources (fodder crops) that would have been required to produce a comparable amount of power with animal-powered mills (horses, mules). The aim of this study is to analyse in greater depth the economic implications and consequences of the application of water-mills, their impact on European economic history up to the Industrial Revolution era, in those areas not well treated by Reynolds and other historians: in the fields of mining, metallurgy, and textiles – including the cotton industry of the initial phase of the Industrial Revolution. The study also necessarily analyses as well the necessary technological innovations to achieve the productivity gains in these economic sectors: especially in the devices (cam and crankshafts) to convert the basic rotary power of mills into reciprocal power, initially to operate trip-hammers; and the more gradual, if only late-medieval, displacement of the original undershot wheels with the far more effective, if more capital costly, overshot wheels. The study thus begins with the late-medieval technological revolutions in both mining and metallurgy, providing the key transitions to the early-modern European economy. A demonstration of significant productivity gains is counterbalanced, however, in this study by an examination of the physical and economic limitations on the uses of water-power and, particularly in the field of woollen-cloth production, the negative consequences of water-powered machinery, in the form of both fulling-mills and gig-mills (cloth-finishing), in impairing the quality of the finer fabrics. In particular, cost-benefit analyses are provided to show why the late-medieval English cloth industry did indeed achieve significant gains in switching from foot- to mechanical-fulling, while, at the same time, the leading draperies of the late-medieval Low Countries were perfectly rational in eschewing such mills before the 16th century – when they did indeed adopt them, for rather different types of textiles. On the other hand, and indeed in striking contrast, the application of water-power in the medieval production of silks and then especially in the 18th-century production of the new cotton textiles, with those major innovations of the Industrial Revolution era (water-frame and mule) had the opposite result: of greatly improving quality while also radically reducing production costs. Indeed quality-improvements in spinning cotton yarns was the chief goal of these entrepreneurs, with the ambition of displacing fine Asian textiles from world markets.
N63|A hesitant evolution: industrialisation and de-industrialisation in Greece over the long run|The paper is an attempt to examine the idiosyncratic unfolding of Greek industrialisation and de-industrialisation from a long-run perspective (1867-1994). Following stylized facts, it is shown that the main shifts in the Greek economy occurred outside industry (from agriculture to services). Also, industrialization was a hesitant process evolving slowly and reaching a plateau in 1950-73. Three structural continuities that accompanied this progress have been a large state sector, the commercial character of Greek entrepreneurship and the incomplete transition from a mercantile/family to corporate capitalism. Also, a rising share of manufacturing in GDP related consistently with increasing per capita income, improving trade performance and ‘trading up’ efforts within manufacturing.
N63|Uma contribuição ao debate sobre a primeira revolução industrial utilizando a técnica do diagrama de recorrência|The test aims at two objectives. First, it presents a new technique of time series analysis that allows to date historical processes: the recurrence plot. This technique was conceived originally to detect non- linearities and eventually chaotic dynamics in experimental signals in Physics, but it has been used recently to identify changes of dynamic patterns in time series in many other fields of the knowledge, for instance in financial data time series. The second objective is to contribute for the discussion about the first industrial revolution among the years of 1780 and 1830. This is exactly the traditional interpretation in economic history. That interpretation, however, has increasingly been objected by the new economic historians, which consider that the emergency of the first industrial potency of the word was a process very more evolutionary- in the sense of being incremental- than revolutionary- that is discontinuous. The text finally suggests (without however exploring the discussion ) that, to understand the processes of radical economical transformation and of him eventually to extract lessons, it is necessary to treat them of a perspective that attributes a larger role o the discontinuities involved in those processes.
N63|A Tale of Two Theories: Monopolies and Craft Guilds in Medieval England and Modern Imagination|Two fields of thought evolved simultaneously, but scholars in one ignored the evolution of the other. The first was the theory of monopoly, whose broad nineteenth-century definition narrowed considerably during the twentieth century. Concepts contained in its original incarnation attained independence when the Chamberlain-Robinson revolution introduced the modern lexicon of industrial organization. The second was the theory of guilds, originally devised when monopoly's definition was vague and rigidly maintained as its modern denotation developed.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N63|La competitividad internacional de la industria algodonera española (1830–1860)|Con el fin de explicar las grandes diferencias de precios entre los tejidos de algodón británicos y españoles, este articulo se ocupa de medir el coste de las materias primas y estimar los niveles de productividad total de los factores (PTF) en ambos países. Ambos cálculos sugieren una relación directa entre la falta de competitividad internacional de la industria española y los altos niveles de protección. Así, a 10 largo de artículo se demuestra que la especialización inadecuada, que fue una consecuencia directa de los altos aranceles, redujo los niveles de eficiencia en España porque las fabricas locales producían bienes demasiado sofisticados para las habilidades de su fuerza de trabajo.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N63|Integracion economica y localizacion industrial. Cataluna, la fabrica de Espana: cuando y por que?|In this paper we analyse the determinants of the localisation of industrial activity in Spain during the second half of the XIX century. In particular, we try to determine possible changes in the importance of the factors that explain industrial location in order to study the effects of economic integration in Spains industrial geography. To his aim, firstly we review the historical analysis of the changes experienced by Spains industrial geography during this period. Secondly, we summarise the different theories that explain location patterns. Thirdly, an empirical analysis of the geographic concentration of industries and industry location is performed. Fourthly, we carry out an econometrical analysis of the determinants of industrial location in two points of time, 1856 and 1893. Our results are consistent with trade theories. During the second half of the XIX century, Spain becomes an integrated economy, labour and capital mobility are favoured and hence, relative differences in factor endowments lose importance in explaining the pattern of industrial concentration. On the contrary, economic integration increased the importance of scale economies and proximity to the market as forces favouring the agglomeration of economic activities.
N63|Brand Names Before the Industrial Revolution|In emerging markets today, legal protections for intellectual property are weak and enforcement is lax. Counterfeiting of consumer goods and infringement on patents, copyrights, and trademarks cost corporations hundreds of billions of dollars each year. Strengthening laws and intensifying enforcement has done little to alleviate the affliction. No end to the epidemic appears in sight. Cures for this modern ailment may be found in medieval wisdom by investigating the methods manufacturers used to market durable goods before legal protections for the initial expansion of industry in Europe.
N63|The Property Specialisation Cycle: From Trough to Peak in Two and a Half Centuries|Since the eighteenth century there has been a long-run trend towards growing functional and geographical specialisation of commercial and industrial buildings within particular urban centres. This trend reached a peak in around 1960 and the last four decades have witnessed a move away from specialisation. The development of business and retail parks have blurred both the functional and geographical divisions between building types while more recently the advent of 'teleworking' and internet commerce appears to have the potential to return a substantial proportion of commercial activity back to the domestic environment.
N63|Industrial Estates and British Industrial Development, 1897-1939|This paper examines the role of pre-1939 British industrial estates as new industrial districts for rapid growth industries. Closely associated with 'new' industries and highly concentrated in the South East, industrial estates rapidly expanded to accomodate plant employing around 285 000 people by 1939. They are shown to have provided a number of important advantages to manufacturers, including external economies of scale, reduced production costs, and accelerated growth. A statistical analysis of the national growth of estate facilities and their employment is provided, together with an assessment of their contribution to industrial development in the South East over 1932-38.
N63|Industrial Revolution and Scientific and Technological Progress|This working paper is a draft chapter for the UNESCO-History of Humanity. Different views on the concept and spread of the industrial revolution, which took place from the late 18th century onwards, are dealt with. By way of example the revolutionary character of technological change and the search for new sources of energy is described and analysed for some major innovations and industries, namely the steam engine, the iron and steel industry and the use of electricity. Furthermore the question is discussed as to what extent sciences were related to technical progress. In this context the emergence of higher technical education at universities is put forward. Some brief remarks on the role of agriculture and the increasing economic ties among countries during the 19th century conclude this paper.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N63|The Evolution of Britain's Urban Built Environment : 1840-1960|This paper examines the evolution of the non-residential urban built environment in Britain form the 1840s to the 1950s. Long-run trends towards both functional and geographical specialisation of offices, shops, and industrial property are identified and the economic, and other, forces which contributred to this process are discussed. The paper also outlines the evolution of Britain's property development and investment sectors and their contribution to the built environment's evolution.
N63|When Piece Rates Work: More Lessons from the Cotton Mills|Workers paid by the piece should in principle cooperate with new techniques that increase their output. In practice, however, firms seem unable to keep piece rates fixed, and when they cut rates workers often respond by restricting output. This paper investigates a case where in fact firms abstained from cutting rates and workers refrained from reducing effort. In Lancashire cotton spinning workers and firms negotiated piece rate lists which fixed standard rates of pay. Both parties had incentives to keep at bay the forces of competition. The lists gave workers a share in the gains of technical change, and they allowed firms to reap the benefits of regional specialisation. The lists were enforced by community standards. Les travailleurs payés à la pièce devraient en principe coopérer avec l'avènement de nouvelles technologies qui augmentent leur production. En pratique toutefois, les firmes semblent incapables de conserver un taux à la pièce fixe et quand elles coupent les taux, les travailleurs répondent souvent en restreignant leur production. Ce texte examine un cas où dans les faits les firmes se sont abstenues de couper les taux et les travailleurs eux, se sont abstenus de réduire leurs efforts. Dans le Lancashire, les ouvriers des filatures de coton et les firmes ont négociés des listes de taux à la pièce qui fixait les taux standards à payer. Les deux parties trouvaient leur avantage à tenir en échec les forces de la compétition. Les listes donnaient aux travailleurs un profit sur les changements technologiques et elles permettaient aux firmes de récolter les bénéfices de la spécialisation régionale. Les listes étaient0501ntenues selon les standards des communautés du Lancashire.
