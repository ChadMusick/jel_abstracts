F02|Digital vulnerability and performance of firms in developing countries|This paper provides evidence of large positive effects of Internet use on local firm performance, using a sample of some 30,000 firms from 38 developing and transition countries. We adopt an IV approach emphasizing firm’s digital vulnerability to seismic shocks upon the telecommunications submarine cable network, and find that a 10% increase in Internet incidence raises by 36% their total annual sales, by 26% sales per worker, by 12% the number of permanent workers. Contrary to other studies on the effect of ICT adoption on trade, we do not find significant evidence on firms’ exports. A greater use of Internet by manufactures is also found to increase their number of production (unskilled) workers in a larger extent than non-production workers, which nuances recent evidence on a skilled-biased digital revolution. The concern for omitted variable bias, reverse causality or measurement error is lowered by proceeding to a wide range of restrictions upon the sample composition and the instrument set calibration, and by controlling for location, sector, year, country-by-year fixed effects.
F02|The impact of financial development on income inequality: A quantile regression approach|In a panel of 121 countries, the impact of financial development on income inequality appears to change with a country’s level of income. It promotes equality across inequality quantiles in upper-middle income countries, and it promotes inequality across inequality quantiles in low- and high-income countries.
F02|EU28 Capital Market Perspectives of a Hard BREXIT: Theory, Empirical Findings and Policy Options|Key aspects covered refer to the cost of leaving the EU and in particular the implications for corporate bond risk premiums in the UK and the Eurozone: The gap between the interest rates of corporate bonds and government bonds could increase in the UK and Eurozone, respectively, as a result of BREXIT where the 2016 BREXIT referendum itself is considered to be a first BREXIT event (see the empirical findings), followed by the main BREXIT event, namely the day of officially leaving the EU - possibly as a No-deal BREXIT. It is as yet not clear what type of BREXIT will be implemented – hard versus soft – and it is also unclear what type of free trade agreement the EU and the UK could accomplish post-BREXIT. However, it is obviously necessary to carefully consider the background of the BREXIT dynamics and to then refer to various versions of BREXIT if one is to understand the inherent politico-economic dynamics of BREXIT – with a No-deal case representing an analytical benchmark which most politicians in the British Parliament obviously would want to avoid; a simple way to indeed avoid this case, with obvious high costs for the British economy, is not easy to discern as the UK’s political system is fractured. If the safe-haven status of the UK should be impaired by BREXIT, the rise of government bond interest rates by 0.3% would stand for the same burden as the net UK contribution to the EU.
F02|El papel de la economía en el proyecto decolonial|El presente trabajo aborda la globalización desde sus crisis, fases y herencias con el fin de pretender una solución a los problemas que en esta se presentan. El análisis que se lleva a cabo y la solución que se propone se realizan desde una perspectiva transdisciplinar, más allá de una simple mirada económica; es decir, desde puntos de vista como los de la filosofía, el derecho, la lingüística, la historia, la sociología, etc. Se traza un mapa general de la teoría decolonial con el estudio de conceptos como colonialidad del poder, eurocentrismo, epistemología, matriz colonial del poder, colonialidad del ser, transmodernidad, gubernamentalidad, etc., en conexión con la historia económica y la transformación social que esta conlleva. A partir del análisis histórico-económico de la globalización, la importancia de la institucionalidad, del Estado y de las formas de gobierno en este proceso, se llega a un aporte desde la economía a este proyecto, fundamentado en la libertad y en el desarrollo de los individuos y su contexto social, esto es, en relación con su propia realidad. *** This paper addresses globalization from its crisis, phases and inheritances in order to seek a solution to the problems that arise in it. The analysis and the proposed solution are made from a transdisciplinary perspective, beyond the simple economic view; that is to say, from viewpoints such as philosophy, law, linguistics, history, sociology, etc. A general map of the colonial theory is drawn to the study of concepts such as coloniality of power, Eurocentrism, epistemology, colonial matrix of power, coloniality of being, postmodernity, governmentality, etc., in connection with economic history and social transformation that this entails. From the historical-economic analysis of globalization, the importance of institutionalism, State and forms of government in this process, it is possible to get a contribution from the economy to this project, based on freedom and the development of individuals and their social context, that is to say, in relation to their own reality.
F02|La globalización como proceso sinérgico en la evolución del desarrollo humano y la educación|Este documento busca analizar los efectos de la globalización sobre el desarrollo humano (medido a través del IDH) y la educación (medida a través del resultado de las pruebas PISA, número de solicitud de patentes e índice H) en Brasil, Chile, Colombia y México, para analizar si esta cumple con las características de un proceso sinérgico (heterogeneidad, complementariedad, autoorganización y sincronización). Se concluye que la evolución histórica de todos los indicadores analizados es positiva conforme avanza el proceso de globalización; por lo que este se puede considerar como un proceso sinérgico donde la cooperación, especialización y sincronización entre los países conlleva a mejoras en los campos de interés. Sin embargo, quedan por explicar las brechas existentes entre los distintos casos de estudio, así como la razón por la cual países con alto grado de globalización, como Colombia, tienen indicadores de desarrollo humano y educación con resultados menores en términos relativos. *** This paper seeks to analyze the effects of globalization on human development (measured through the HDI) and education (measured through the result of PISA test results, patent application number and H index) in Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico, to examine whether it meets the characteristics of a synergistic process (heterogeneity, complementarity, self-organization and synchronization). It is concluded that the historical evolution of all the analyzed indicators is positive as the globalization process advances; therefore, this can be considered as a synergic process where cooperation, specialization and synchronization among countries lead to improvements in the fields of interest. However, the existing gaps between the different case studies remain to be explained, as well as the reason why countries with a high degree of globalization, such as Colombia, have indicators of human development and education with lower results in relative terms.
F02|Revisiting the Economic Case for Fiscal Union in the Euro Area|Abstract After significant progress as an immediate result of the euro crisis, the drive to complete Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) has decelerated. While there is a broad consensus in Europe that EMU needs further development, the exact nature and timing of the reform agenda remains controversial. This paper makes an analytical contribution to the ongoing discussion about the euro area’s institutional setup. An in-depth look at the remaining gaps in the euro’s architecture, and the trade-offs that repairing them would present, suggests the need for long-run progress along three mutually supportive tracks. The first is more fiscal risk sharing, which will help enhance the credibility of the sovereign “no-bailout” rule. The second is complementary financial sector reforms to delink sovereigns and banks. And the third is more effective rules to discourage moral hazard. Helpfully, this evolution would ensure that financial markets provide more incentives for fiscal discipline than they do now. Introducing more fiscal union comes with myriad legal, technical, operational, and political problems, however, raising questions well beyond the domain of economics. These difficulties notwithstanding, without decisive progress to foster fiscal risk sharing, EMU will continue to face existential risks.
F02|Alignment of Multinational Firms along Global Value Chains: A Network-based Perspective|The multiple location choices of firms respond to a complex design of simultaneous and related goals. This paper reveals how the geographic coverage of French multinational firms is increasingly determined by Global Value Chains (GVCs) since the mid-1990s. I study the network structure of French multinationals using firm-level data, and of the Global Value Chains using the bilateral value added (VA) content of exports (from international Input-Output tables). The comparison of the two networks reveals an alignment of firms' plants along global value chains, supported by several econometric estimations including a multiple regression Quadratic Assignment Procedure and a panel OLS defined at the country-pair level. Multinationals have modified their foreign affiliates' locations to settle in countries engaged in sequential production, and this result holds when controlling for gravity-like location's determinants and raw international trade flows. Specifically, I report how MNEs are moving up the value chain, as their new locations turned to be more driven by an upstream alignment on GVCs (toward the VA source) rather than a downstream one (toward VA destination). Eventually, the GVCs' attraction increased after the 2008 crisis, even though GVCs were experiencing a slowdown. Therefore, firm's vulnerability to the dismantling of GVCs similarly increased.
F02|Optimal Route in International Transportation of Thailand – Guangxi (China)|Objective - This study examines the selection of international transportation routes from Thailand to Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (Guangxi), People's Republic of China. Guangxi has been designated a significant role as the gateway to ASEAN and has several land borders and seaports connecting to countries in ASEAN. Methodology/Technique - In this work, we studied 6 connecting routes, 3 of which are road routes, namely routes R8, R9, and R12 and 3 other multimodal (road-sea) routes operating from/to Laemchabang port and Nanning of Guangxi, route through Haiphong port of Vietnam, route through Qinzhou port of China, and route through Guangzhou port of China. We analysed the data using the Cost/Time Distance Model, in combination with surveys and in-depth interviews, to investigate the limitations and benefits of each route. Findings - Base on costs in 2017, we found that sea routes have much lower costs than the land routes in general; the lowest cost is route through Qinzhou port. On the other hand, the time used in transportation is much shorter for the land routes; the shortest route is the R12 route. Furthermore, in terms of limitations and benefits, we found that the Qinzhou route has many limitations such as long custom processes for fruit and agricultural products and no backhaul cargo. Meanwhile, the limitations for route R8 include crossing Mekong river on truck ferries and the presence of very steep mountain roads in the Lao People's Democratic Republic. Route R12 winds down the mountain both in Vietnam and Laos, whereas route R9 is advantageous; most of that route has a flat terrain and is operated under the Cross-Border Transport Agreement (CBTA). The route through Haiphong port is also advantageous with a direct highway from Haiphong to Hanoi of Vietnam. In conclusion, it is suggested that road transportation is more efficient than sea transportation. Novelty - Further consideration among road routes and, with emphasis on costs and time, the best route is then route R12. However, if one is concerned with risk of damage to products, then route R9 is the best. The optimal route from Thailand to Guangxi depends on the conditions and decision criteria of the stakeholders.
F02|Causality of Economic Growth and Openness in ASEAN-5|Objective – This study aims to determine the relationship between FDI and trade and its effect on economic growth in ASEAN-5 countries using the Engel-Granger causality method. Methodology/Technique – The study uses OLS panel regression analysis to identify the relationship between the variables in each country. The results of the Engel-Granger causality test indicate that there is a two-way relationship between economic growth and FDI, and economic growth and international trade. Findings – When tested together through panel regression, it is concluded that the best model is a random effect method (REM) in which FDI and international trade significantly influence economic growth in the same direction. However, the relationship between FDI and international trade and its effect on economic growth in Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand was negative, whilst in Malaysia and Singapore the relationship has a directional trend. Novelty – To reinforce the FDI inflows, authorities should continue the progressive reduction of barriers, and increase the sophistication of quality exports to compete in the global market. This paper is the first of its kind to analyze the role of both FDI and exports in the ASEAN5 economies using panel analysis. Type of Paper: Empirical.
F02|Territorialized forms of production in Morocco: provisional assessment for an own model in gestation|"With the current movement of ""glocalization"" imposed by openness to the global sphere and the necessary anchoring to the local, the productive systems - from here and elsewhere - can no longer be non-territorial or autarkic. As much openness opens up the prospect of competitiveness, as much the local territory ensures a kind of ""rescue net"" and refuge in the event of global crises that have become frequent. Whether it is the social movement paradigm or the local production system canvas ""glocalization"" is justified by the wealth potential that territories of any nation seeking its competitiveness on the international scene conceal. To identify, grasp, understand and value such a territorial resource, the diagnosis of the existing is necessary. Socio-spatial disparities are at the heart of the problems of regional development confronted with the double malaise of poverty and environmental degradation. With the certainty that wealth is created within companies and that they are the key players in territorial development, the analysis of the spatial anatomy of productive systems provides information on the symbiosis between the productive and the spatial. Without claiming to reproduce the evolution of productive systems and their spatial expressions in its completeness, this paper proposes to explore the major territorialized forms that the productive system in Morocco has taken from independence to our day. It's all about finding to characterize the specificities of Morocco in this matter by launching a sort of a provisional assessment. The main question here is to approach a kind of model in gestation that Morocco can create for the rest of Africa at this spatial / productive level."
F02|Roots of Tolerance among Second-generation Immigrants|Tolerance – respecting individual choice and differences among people – is a prominent feature of modern European culture. That immigrants embrace this kind of liberal value is arguably important for integration, a central policy goal. We provide a rigorous study of what factors in the ancestral countries of second-generation immigrants – including formal and informal institutions – that predict their level of tolerance towards gay people. Using the epidemiological method allows us to rule out reverse causality. Out of the 46 factors examined, one emerges as very robust: a Muslim background. Tolerance is lower the larger the share of Muslims in the country from which the parents emigrated. An instrumental-variable analysis shows that the main mechanism is not through the individual being a Muslim but through the individual being highly religious. Two additional attitudes among people in the ancestral country (valuing children being tolerant and respectful, and valuing children taking responsibility), as well as impartial institutions in the ancestral country, predict higher individual tolerance. Our findings thus point to an important role for both formal- and informal-institutional background factors in shaping tolerance.
F02|Extraction-cum-substitution: A KISS approach to mapping the impacts of bilateral trade conflicts|This paper presents a simple yet powerful methodological tool for analysing the impact of a bilateral trade conflict on third countries when trade includes intermediate inputs. Mixing input-output modelling with recent development of trade in value-added analysis, the extraction-cum-substitution approach maps and measures the sectoral and global interactions in global value chains.It can also be used to generate “in silico” a large data set of numerical “observations” that can be further analysed using appropriate exploratory statistical techniques. The paper counts with three parts, besides introduction and conclusion. The first one is theoretical, starting with a formal model of inter-industry trade before describing the empirical application to input-output analysis. The second part is didactic, illustrating the method on a small six-countries/three-industries model.The third part applies the methodology to the bilateral trade conflict that arose between China and the USA in 2018. This section shows also how the method can also be used for generating analytical data and identify modes of insertion in the global economy. The program, written in open-source R language, is shown in annex.
F02|The Deepening of the Economic and Monetary Union|This article seeks to guide the reader through the developments in the process of EMU deepening, clarifying the economic arguments and identifying the choices made by the decision makers, which led to the current institutional design. In addition, a critical analysis of the different proposals under discussion is made, aiming at identifying the most efficient way, in a long-term perspective, to ensure the proper functioning of the monetary union.
F02|Trade policy of the United States and China in the new era of trade wars: macroeconomic and behavioral approach|The aim of the paper is to analyze the causes and effects of the growing protectionist tendencies in the US trade policy during the Donald Trump Presidency and the course of retaliatory actions of states, in particular China, in response to the increase of tariffs by the United States, for the development of international trade.The study uses statistical data on the dynamics of international trade, trade exchange between trading partners, the level of tariffs, real GDP, the importance of industries covered by the trade war, in the economies of the United States, China and the European Union.The analysis covers the motives of the United States in trade policy in 2018-2019, both in economic and behavioral terms, in particular the problem of market imperfections, the crisis of homoeconomicus in the face of growing dissatisfaction of societies in developed countries from pressure to further liberalization of the international trade, with financial constraints in politics social. At the heart of President Trump's protectionist actions were many of the same reasons that led to the waning US interest in further multilateral liberalization in the WTO. The study uses statistical data, formulates a case study regarding the efficiency of the commercial dispute resolution system in the World Trade Organization (WTO). The study also uses a historical method. The comparative analysis concerns the contemporary trade conflict between the United States and China and the course and effects of the introduction of the Smoot-Hawley Act for trade in the United States in 1930. The economic and social effects of the US trade wars with China and other trading partners, including the European Union, will become visible in the short run by 2020. Most of these effects will affect production levels, domestic prices, trade, GDP, social policy in The United States, which in future will be reviewing, trade policy tools in bilateral trade relation, with less involvement in WTO initiatives.Controlled retaliation of US trading partners, China's conciliatory trade policy of unilateral concessions to China's access to the US market limits the likelihood of a global trade war, whose negative effects would affect most countries around the world.
F02|Trade Wars: What do they Mean? Why are they Happening Now? What are the Costs?|How should economists interpret current trade wars and the recent U.S. trade actions that have initiated them? In this paper we offer an interpretation of current U.S. trade actions that is at once more charitable and less forgiving than that typically offered by economic commentators. More charitable, because we argue that it is possible to see a logic to these actions: the United States is initiating a change from “rules-based” to “power-based” tariff bargaining and is selecting countries with which it runs bilateral trade deficits as the most suitable targets of its bargaining tariffs. Less forgiving, because the main costs of these trade tactics cannot be avoided even if they happen to “work” and deliver lower tariffs. Rather, we show that the main costs will arise from the use of the tactics themselves, and from the damage done by those tactics to the rules-based multilateral trading system and the longer-term interests of the United States and the rest of the world.
F02|Von der Troika zu einem Europäischen Währungsfonds: Welche Aufgaben und Grenzen sollte ein Europäischer Währungsfonds nach den Erfahrungen mit der Troika haben?|Die sogenannte Troika aus EU-Kommission, Europäischer Zentralbank und Internationalem Währungsfonds sollte die in eine schwere Staatschuldenkrise geratenen Mitgliedsländer der Europäischen Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion durch die Ausarbeitung und Überwachung von Hilfsprogrammen vor einem Staatsbankrott retten und damit das Auseinanderbrechen der Eurozone verhindern. Die Zusammenarbeit dieser Institutionen, die aus der Not geboren wurde, konnte Erfolge aufweisen, schuf aber auch anhaltende Probleme. Mit dem weiteren Anwachsen der Staatsverschuldung in Italien wächst die Gefahr einer neuerlichen Krise im Euroraum. Der Europäische Stabilitätsmechanismus soll nach Beschlüssen des EU-Gipfels vom Dezember 2019 in Zukunft zusammen mit der EU-Kommission die Troika ersetzen und im Falle von Krisen die Rolle eines Europäischen Währungsfonds spielen. Die aktuellen Weichenstellungen sind allerdings wenig geeignet die Kernprobleme der Eurozone anzupacken und Krisen zu vermeiden, die vor allem auf die ausufernde Staatsverschuldung und die mangelnde internationale Wettbewerbsfähigkeit einiger Mitglieder der Währungsunion zurückzuführen sind.
F02|Toward global paradigm change: Beyond the crisis of the liberal world order|This vision brief may be summarized by the following points. First, the crisis of the liberal world order arises from a misalignment of our social, economic and political domains of activity, along with a resulting destabilization of our physical environment. The integration of the global economy has generated problems that extend beyond our current bounds of social and political cooperation. Second, extending our social cooperation - on which basis our political cooperation can be extended as well - requires the creation of the appropriate moral narratives. These narratives must guide business strategies, public policies and civic activities. Third, these narratives must be supplemented by multilevel governance structures that address challenges at the scale - micro, meso and macro - at which these chal-lenges arise. Finally, past human experience in developing moral narratives, supported by multilevel governance structures, suggests guidelines for a future form of multilateralism that enables us to meet this challenge.
F02|Handelspolitische Schutzinstrumente zum Umgang mit Wettbewerbsverzerrungen durch China: Status Quo und Perspektiven|Reichen die handelspolitischen Schutzinstrumente der EU aus, um EU-Produzenten gegen die vielfältigen Wettbewerbsverzerrungen durch China mit seiner immer innovativer werdenden staatskapitalistischen Volkswirtschaft schützen zu können. Bei der Analyse dieser Fragestellung ist zu beachten, dass die EU vor kurzem ihr Antidumping- und Antisubventionsrecht in zwei Schritten reformiert hat, nicht zuletzt, um die Herausforderung durch China besser zu meistern. Damit soll zum einen verhindert werden, dass Schutzzölle gegenüber gedumpten Importen aus China sinken, falls China als Marktwirtschaft anerkannt werden muss. Zum anderen ging es darum, etwas höhere Schutzzölle als üblich erheben zu können, da die EU in der Regel deutlich geringere Zölle ansetzt als die USA und als die WTO erlaubt. Die WTO-Vorgaben sind so gestaltet, dass ein Schutzinstrumente-Verfahren sehr aufwendig ist. Damit ist nicht immer gewährleistet, dass die von den Wettbewerbsverzerrungen betroffenen EU-Produzenten ein Verfahren anstrengen. Dies gilt vor allem für KMU und für den Fall, dass es zu einem Koordinationsversagen kommt. Darüber hinaus weisen die WTO-Regeln erhebliche Lücken auf. So kommen China und viele andere WTO-Mitglieder ihrer Pflicht nur unzureichend nach, die eigenen Subventionen vollständig und zeitnah zu melden. Das erschwert aus Sicht der EU die Nutzung von Antisubventionsverfahren. Ferner wirken Schutzinstrumente nur auf dem EU-Markt und nicht gegen Wettbewerbsverzerrungen auf Drittmärkten und im Herkunftsland der Importe selbst. Außerdem gibt es im WTO-Rahmen keine Regeln, um sich vor Wettbewerbsverzerrungen durch Dumping im Dienstleistungshandel zu schützen. Der Königsweg, um diese Lücken zu schließen, führt über eine Reform der multilateralen WTO-Regeln, die sich jedoch bislang aufgrund einer weitgehenden Blockadehaltung Chinas als sehr schwierig erweist. Daher stellt sich die Frage, was die EU innerhalb des WTO-Rahmens aus eigener Macht tun kann, um sich gegen Wettbewerbsverzerrungen durch den chinesischen Staatskapitalismus zu schützen. (...)
F02|International Coordination of Economic Policies in the Global Financial Crisis: Successes, Failures, and Consequences|The global financial crisis dominated the international financial landscape during the first 20 years of the 21st century. This paper assesses the contribution of the international coordination of economic policies to contain the crisis. The paper evaluates international efforts to diagnose the crisis and decide on appropriate responses, the treatments that were agreed and adopted, and the successes and failures as the crisis unfolded. International economic policy coordination eventually contributed importantly to containing the crisis, but the authorities failed to agree on a diagnosis and the consequent need for joint action until the case was obvious. The policy actions that were adopted were powerful and effective, but they may have undermined prospects for coordinated responses to crises in the future.
F02|Evolving International Monetary and Financial Architecture and the Development Challenge: A Liquidity Preference Theoretical Perspective|This paper investigates the peculiar macroeconomic policy challenges faced by emerging economies in today's monetary (non)order and globalized finance. It reviews the evolution of the international monetary and financial architecture against the background of Keynes's original Bretton Woods vision, highlighting the US dollar's hegemonic status. Keynes's liquidity preference theory informs the analysis of the loss of policy space and widespread instabilities in emerging economies that are the consequence of financial hyperglobalization. While any benefits promised by mainstream promoters remain elusive, heightened vulnerabilities have emerged in the aftermath of the global crisis.

F02|Does a Currency Union Need a Capital Market Union? Risk Sharing via Banks and Markets|We compare risk sharing in response to demand and supply shocks in four types of currency unions: segmented markets; a banking union; a capital market union; and complete financial markets. We show that a banking union is efficient at sharing all domestic demand shocks (deleveraging, fiscal consolidation), while a capital market union is necessary to share supply shocks (productivity and quality shocks). Using a calibrated model we provide evidence of substantial welfare gains from a banking union and, in the presence of supply shocks, from a capital market union.
F02|"The ""New"" Economics of Trade Agreements: From Trade Liberalization to Regulatory Convergence?"|"What incentives do governments have to negotiate ""new trade agreements,"" i.e., agreements that constrain not only governments' choices of tariffs, but also their domestic regulatory policies? We focus on horizontal product standards, i.e., those that impose requirements along a horizontal dimension of product differentiation. We introduce differences in ideal products across countries and consider cases in which product choices do not and do confer externalities on other national consumers. In addition to characterizing the features of the optimal new trade agreement in each environment, we ask whether detailed negotiations about regulatory rules are needed for global efficiency or whether an ""old trade agreement"" augmented by some ""policed decentralization"" of regulatory procedures can achieve the same outcomes."
F02|The Fracturing of Globalization: Implications of Economic Resentments and Geopolitical Contradictions| In this comprehensive piece about the future of globalization, geopolitical competition will be a deciding factor. Until recently, the United States imposed what the author calls a neoliberal template on global trade. Today, this template is challenged in several ways and may well come apart. There will be regional integrations and adjustments as a result.
F02|Determinants of Deposit and Credit Euroization in Eastern Europe: A Bayesian Model Averaging Evidence|The paper investigates the motives of deposit and credit euroisation in Eastern Europe employing Bayesian empirical methodology. We analyse a unique dataset of macroeconomic fundamentals, perception surveys, and institutional quality indicators and deal with the uncertainty in the model by Bayesian model averaging. Apart from traditional fundamental factors, strong institutions are found to be an important driver of both credit and deposit euroisation. Business regulation, corruption environment, administrative costs and country-specific risk impact borrowing and saving behaviour in EURO and should be reflected in designing de-euroisation policies in the region.
F02|Paul van Zeeland and the First Decade of the US Federal Reserve System: the Analysis from a European Central Banker who was a Student of Kemmerer|The establishment of a central bank occurred at very different moments in the process of economic integration in the United States and the European Union. In this paper, we go into the first years of the Federal Reserve System through the lens of Paul van Zeeland’s PhD dissertation. Paul van Zeeland (1893-1973) became the first Head of the Economics Service of the National Bank of Belgium in 1921, after his studies in Princeton with Edwin Walter Kemmerer. There are clear similarities in their analyses of the Federal Reserve System, for instance in their adherence to the gold standard and the real bills doctrine as well as in their emphasis on the elasticity of the money supply. Moreover, they shared a view - with hindsight a rather naïve view - that with the Fed in place, financial crises would be a distant memory. However, there were also important differences. So, van Zeeland, like several other economists as Warburg, accorded greater significance to the discount market (a key factor for the international role of the dollar) and to a stronger centralization of the Fed (which would be taken up in the 1935 Banking Act). Moreover, very specific for van Zeeland is the importance given to the Fed’s independence from the State (an element related to van Zeeland’s continental European background and Belgium’s experience of monetary financing during the war).
F02|Economic and Policy Uncertainty: Export Dynamics and the Value of Agreements|We examine the interaction of economic and policy uncertainty in a dynamic, heterogeneous firms model. Uncertainty about foreign income, trade protection and their interaction dampens export investment. This can be mitigated by trade agreements, which are particularly valuable in periods of increased demand volatility. We use firm data to establish new facts about U.S. export dynamics in 2003-2011 and estimate the model. We find a significant role for uncertainty in explaining the trade collapse in the 2008 crisis and partial recovery in its aftermath. Consistent with the model predictions, we find that the negative effects worked (1) through the extensive margin, (2) in destinations without preferential agreements with the U.S. (accounting for over half its trade) and (3) in industries with higher potential protection. U.S. exports to non-preferential markets would have been 6.5% higher under an agreement—equivalent to an 8% foreign GDP increase. These findings highlight and quantify the value of international policy commitments through agreements that mitigate uncertainty, particularly during downturns.
F02|Brexit Uncertainty and Trade Disintegration|We estimate the uncertainty effects of preferential trade disagreements. Increases in the probability of Britain’s exit from the European Union (Brexit) reduce bilateral export values and trade participation. These effects are increasing in trade policy risk across products and asymmetric for UK and EU exporters. We estimate that a persistent doubling of the probability of Brexit at the average disagreement tariff of 4.5% lowers EU-UK bilateral export values by 15 log points on average, and more so for EU than UK exporters. Neither believed a trade war was likely.
F02|Economic History and Contemporary Challenges to Globalization|The paper surveys three economic history literatures that can speak to contemporary challenges to globalization: the literature on the anti-globalization backlash of the nineteenth century, focused largely on trade and migration; the literature on the Great Depression, focused largely on capital flows, the gold standard, and protectionism; and the literature on trade and warfare.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F02|Societal benefits and costs of International Investment Agreements: A critical review of aspects and available empirical evidence|This paper reviews alleged societal benefits and costs of International Investment Agreements (IIAs) as suggested by academia, governments, business and civil society. It sets out the wide range of issues that diverse actors have proposed in the context of assessing the societal benefits and costs of IIAs. The paper analyses and organises the available material generated by these sources to identify and classify the many different issues, summarises available empirical evidence and findings in these sources on the individual aspects, and assesses strengths and weaknesses of the approaches. The paper focuses in particular on the investor protection component of IIAs. The inventory finds that for many claims about the positive or negative impact of IIAs, little robust evidence has been generated to date. The paper highlights methodological challenges and suggests areas where further study would be required to draw firmer conclusions.

F02|Income terms of trade and economic convergence: Evidence from Latin America|The paper considers the effects of income terms of trade (ToT) on GDP per capita in Latin American economies and examines whether improvement in the income ToT (in absolute and relative terms) contributes to the stochastic convergence between respective economies and the US. It is shown that in the majority of the economies, income ToT had positive effects on the level of GDP per capita. The stochastic convergence was documented in Chile, Dominican Republic, and Uruguay. The positive effects of income ToT increase on GDP per capita convergence were documented only in Chile and Uruguay. The growth of the volume of exports played a key role in the process, while the effects on the part of net barter ToT were insignificant. In both economies, the improvement in the income ToT relative to the US level played a positive role in convergence.
F02|16+1, a New Issue in China-EU Relations?|The present paper investigates the positions of individual member states, European institutions and organizations towards the 16+1 cooperation framework. At the institutional level, the European Commission’s Joint communication on elements for a new EU strategy on China of June 2016, the reports and joint statements of the European Economic and Social Committee and China Economic and Social Council (May 2016 and June 2017) and European Parliament publications underline: the absence of a common EU-level strategy on recent large scale Chinese initiatives and some member states pursue individual economic interests, which do not correspond to those of the EU as a whole; 16+1 format as “controversial”, as its arrangements are “in conflict with the EU law” which leads to the “erosion of EU norms”; the necessity to “cooperate with the Commission, the EEAS and other Member States to help ensure that relevant aspects to the EU are in line with EU law, rules and policies, and that the overall outcome is beneficial for the EU as a whole”. We analyze the concerns and make specific proposals so that the 16+1 format might cease to be an issue in China-EU relations.
F02|An FDI-driven approach to measuring the scale and economic impact of BEPS|This paper explores the link between foreign direct investment (FDI) and the BEPS (base erosion and profit shifting) practices of multinationals (MNEs). It puts the spotlight on the outsize role of offshore investment hubs as major players in global corporate investment, a role that is largely due to MNEs’ tax planning, although other factors contribute. The paper shows that tax avoidance practices enabled by FDI through offshore hubs are responsible for significant leakage of development financing resources. In policy terms, these findings call for enhanced cooperation and synergies between international tax and investment policymaking.
F02|Pregatirea României pentru aderarea la Uniunea Europeana|Romania’s lead-up to the accession to the European Union lasted quite a long time (1991-2007). The first steps had been taken by the conclusion and the enforcement of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (1990) and the Association Agreement (1993) which paved the way for the transition to higher forms of cooperation and integration for expanding the domains and improving these forms. An important step for the accession was the negotiation for transposing and implementing the EC legislation in Romania, to be followed by economic, institutional and administrative changes and restructuring, which needed significant efforts. The wish of the majority of the Romanian citizens in favour of the country’s accession to the EU had a positive impact on the European Communities, which offered a substantial aid provided that the new candidate fulfils some requirements for ensuring the political, economic, institutional, legal and administrative compatibilities and all obligations of an EU member. The main actions taken by Romania, by the EU officials and by the EU member countries are presented below.
F02|21st Century Trade Agreements and the Owl of Minerva|The post Second World War liberal trade order has been a driver of global economic growth and rising average per capita incomes. This order confronts increasing opposition, reflecting concerns about adjustment costs and distributional effects of globalization, and the ability to pursue national policy goals. At the same time the development of complex production relations distributed across many countries calls for cooperation on a variety of regulatory policies. Contrary to what is argued by opponents of globalization, this does not imply one size fits all rules that constitute a threat to national sovereignty and democratic legitimation. There remains an important 'traditional' integration agenda that centers on rule-making by major trading powers on policies that generate negative international spillovers. But the core challenge for the political economy of 21st Century trade agreements is to support regulatory cooperation to better govern international production and address the non-pecuniary externalities associated with greater economic integration.
F02|Contesting an International Trade Agreement|After governments sign an international trade agreement (TA), each government must ratify the TA. Often, this ratification process is lengthy and the outcome highly uncertain. We model a two-country TA where, unlike prior literature, pro-trade and anti-trade interest groups in each country recognize that (i) TA implementation requires ratification by both governments and (ii) they cannot condition contributions on their government's ratification decision. In this new class of contests, which we call 'parallel contests', we show that (i) anti- and pro-trade lobbies lobby in equilibrium, (ii) the probability of TA ratification lends itself to intuitive and tractable comparative statics, and (iii) the protection embodied in negotiated TA tariffs reflects a tension between the liberalizing force of lobbying and inherently protectionist government preferences.
F02|Why Do Countries Engage in the Preferential Trade Agreement Network?|We analyze the determinants of Preferential Trade Agreements Networks dynamics. We propose a theoretical framework based in an extension of Baldwin (1995) to rationalize the determinants of PTA formation as a way to maximize preferential market access and/or diminish market discrimination. To build the empirical model we use a Stochastic Actor Oriented Models proposed by Snijders (2001). We suppose that three main set of variables will affect the countries motivation to change their PTA neighborhood at each moment. The first is related to natural trade cost and market size. The second group is related to political economy effects. And finally, we include a variable related to trade specialization, which has not been used in earlier works to explain PTAs. Following Snijders et al. (2012) we also control for hierarchy structures of the PTA, and we extend their work by analyzing the change in this phenomenon when considering a broader period of time. Results show that the signs of usual variables behave as expected in the literature for the first period but hierarchy effect dilutes after 2004. As a contribution to existing literature we found that trade rivalry between countries is also significant in explaining the dynamics of PTA.
F02|Development cooperation to ensure that none be left behind|The development cooperation system is undergoing a dramatic process of change. New actors are on stage, new instruments (beyond ODA) are being used, and the fields of work have been clearly widened. The enlargement of the development cooperation system is in line with the ambitious and comprehensive 2030 Agenda. However, those changes also imply massive tensions and challenges to the current development cooperation system in terms of its objectives, procedures and narrative. This paper presents some of these challenges in light of the â€œleaving no-one behindâ€ mandate. The paper discusses, firstly, how the development cooperation system can be brought up to date, taking into account massive changes in the international landscape; secondly, it argues why development cooperation may be still useful and effective in supporting an Agenda that goes beyond ODA; and finally, it discusses some dilemmas around the way in which resources should be allocated in order to preserve the distributive purpose of development cooperation.
F02|International trade: Who is left behind and what to do about it|We examine globalization’s effects on those left behind in both industrial and emerging markets. While access to global markets has lifted billions out of poverty in emerging markets, the benefits have not been equally shared. Trade has hurt less skilled workers in rich and poor countries. These unequal consequences have contributed to a backlash against globalization in developed countries, which now threatens the global trading system and access to that system for emerging markets. We conclude by proposing some solutions which cover both global trade policy prescriptions as well as country-level programs to compensate losers from globalization.
F02|An Empirical Examination of the J-Curve: New Zealand's Bilateral Trade with Selected Countries|The J-curve hypothesis holds that the devaluation or depreciation of a country’s currency worsens the trade balance in the short run before improving the balance in the long run. This study investigates the short-run and long-run effects of nominal exchange rate changes on the bilateral trade balance between New Zealand, Australia, USA, UK, China, India, Japan and Singapore using quarterly data from 1990 to 2014. The results show some evidence of J-curve effects in the case of New Zealand and China and New Zealand and Japan but with no evidence to support J-curve effects in the case of New Zealand and Australia, USA, UK, India and Singapore. Diagnostic tests, however, suggest that there are some omitted variables in the models.
F02|The Evolution of Trade Unit Values: A Measurement on Quality|In this paper, unit values and unit value ratios in bilateral manufacturing trade across all countries in the world are analysed over the period 1998-2014. Descriptive evidence of price differences across country groups and groups of manufacturing industries according to technology intensity is presented. Furthermore, the determining factors of unit values taking both demand and supply side factors into account are analysed. Estimation results confirm the arguments put forward in the existing literature that (i) advanced countries demand and supply high-quality products; (ii) capital- and skill-abundant countries export higher quality products, and (iii) larger economies tend to have lower unit values in their exports due to scale effects. However, the results by different industries and country groups point at a more diverse pattern.
F02|European Integration and the Future Institutions of Europe|This article summarizes a talk, given at the conference From Bretton Woods to Berlaymont: Globalisation, Integration and the Future of Europe, organized by KOF Swiss Economic Institute and ETH Zurich from 22-23 March 2018. It highlights the complexity and multidimensional nature of the question about the future development of the European Union. It argues that there is a need for rebalancing subsidiarity and supranationality, but that the assignment of tasks and the ‘optimal’ degree of centralization has to be judged on a case-by-case basis, differentiated by policy area. Moreover, it emphasizes the need to draw a line between what is desirable from a scientific perspective and can be judged by objective standards and what is desirable from a political perspective, which will vary a lot with political preferences. Finally, it argues that, at least in the short- to medium-run, economic integration should be given priority over political integration.
F02|Silent Promotion of Agendas: Campaign Contributions and Ideological Polarization|Until recently, both Republican and Democratic administrations have been promoting free trade and market deregulation for decades without intensive policy debates. We set up a two-party electoral competition model in a two-dimensional policy space with campaign contributions by an interest group that promotes a certain agenda. Assuming that voters are impressionable to campaign spending for/against candidates, we analyze incentive compatible contracts between the interest group and the candidates on agenda policy positions and campaign contributions. The interest group asks the candidates to commit to its agenda in exchange for campaign contributions, letting them compete over the other (ideological) dimension only. It is shown that, as the agenda is pushed further by the interest group, ideological policy polarization and campaign contributions surge.
F02|Explaining Trumpism as a Structural US Problem: New Insights and Transatlantic Plus Global Economic Perspectives|The 2016 US presidential election resulted in the populist Donald Trump becoming the 45th President of the United States. While many observers assume that this reflects a transitory phase of populism in the US, a closer analysis suggests that there will be a structural populist threat for the US, the West and the world economy. There is survey evidence that US voters consider the inequality which has emerged in the US over many years as unacceptable. At the same time the Lindh-McCall survey results show that the relative majority of US voters expect that big companies rather than government will correct this inequality. This is illusory and wishful thinking and will serve to create continued voter frustration for the lower half of households – this refers to the poorer half of US households – and populism could indeed expand on the basis of such frustration for many years to come. The main drivers of rising inequality in the US, namely ICT expansion, financial globalization and the rise of China’s exports will continue in the medium term so that US voters’ frustration is a structural problem that cannot easily be remedied and that has consequences for transatlantic and global economic relations as well as security policy implications. While the decline of the income share for the lower half of income earners in Western Europe has been rather modest in 1981-2015, the decline of that share in the US has been dramatic, namely from 20% to 13%. The EU is nevertheless threatened by US populism since its political representatives are trying to export their ideology and approach to Italy and other Western continental EU countries. In the UK, a subtle populism is already becoming more apparent under the heading of BREXIT. If the EU27 could defend the model of the Social Market Economy and export this system to Asia and Africa while joining political forces with ASEAN – and possibly China – to defend the multilateral economic order, European impulses could help to contain US populism.
F02|The UK’s Banking FDI Flows and Total British FDI: A Dynamic BREXIT Analysis|The City of London has been the global leader for the provision of international banking services since the 1980s when Thatcher-era deregulation, followed by the EU single market program, stimulated big international FDI inflows – mainly of US banks – into the UK. The “single passport” rule allowed international banks in the UK to serve the whole of the EU28 market from London whose supply-side dynamics contributed to economic growth in the UK and a rising output share of the UK banking system in British GDP. With BREXIT there are serious challenges for the City since the passporting of banks will end and the regulatory framework will be seriously adjusted; EU equivalence rules for UK banks that might be valid after the implementation of BREXIT cannot be a substitute for passporting so that lower FDI inflows and higher FDI outflows in the banking sector should be expected; inflow dynamics should also be shaped by international M&A dynamics influenced by the real Pound depreciation in 2016, while the prospects of reduced EU market access post-BREXIT also became relevant in 2017/18 and should influence the FDI dynamics of the UK – a similar pattern might occur in the BREXIT implementation year (i.e. 2019) and the following adjustment period where the change in City banks’ access to the single market will matter; as regards the latter, quasi-tariff-jumping FDI outflows from the UK can be expected where the FDI of City of London banks could go primarily to the EU27/Eurozone or the US. The empirical findings confirm the expected FDI pattern for the UK banking sector – overall FDI inflows in the wake of the BREXIT referendum have increased, in line with the Froot-Stein effect, while FDI inflows to the UK banking sector have reduced.
F02|Understanding the challenges to the world trading system|This paper discusses the challenges to the world trading system presented by the Brexit vote in the UK and the election of Trump in the U.S. It reviews two recent books and several papers that inform our understanding of these issues.
F02|The Europe of the five parts of the world: François Perroux on European Integration|"Although seldom remembered in this respect, François Perroux exerted direct and indirect influence on the debate on European integration in the immediate post-war period in France. The theme of European integration serves in Perroux’s work as a concrete case study on which a series of his recurrent themes could be explored, such as his theory of domination, his reflection on economic spaces, development and the costs of man (""coûts de l’homme""), or even as an extension of topics from his work in the 1930s related to corporatism and communitarianism. Perroux deals with the theme of European integration fundamentally in an extensive book from 1954, L’Europe sans rivages, but also in several others of his books and articles from the period, forming a complex and multifaceted analysis of the problematic that, nevertheless, insists in a central message: the importance of the global aspect of the European integration, thinking in a Europe of the “five parts of the world”. This paper offers an analysis of this set of writings, connecting it to the institutional and political context of the debate on European integration in France. The goal is to situate the effective influence Perroux’s ideas and his concrete personal influence on important names of Jean Monnet entourage. Taking these general questions as a reference, and starting with Perroux’s perspectives on topics such as national accounts, planning and liberal interventionism, the article also explores the critical thinking undertaken by Perroux, throughout the 1950s, on the institutional and political paths taken in the first years of the European integration process, approximating his analysis to other voices that critically discussed those paths, such as, for example, Gunnar Myrdal. Doing this, the paper also explores important connections, not frequently visited in the literature of the history of economic ideas, between the European integration and the field of economic development or regarding the debates on regional inequalities that took shape in the midst of the postwar European reconstruction projects."
F02|Globalisation and Income Inequality Revisited|We re-examine the globalisation-income inequality nexus. Globalisation is measured by the KOF globalisation index and sub-indicators for trade, financial, political and social global globalisation. Income inequality is measured by Solt’s pre tax/transfer and the post tax/transfer Gini indices. We use data for 140 countries over the period 1970-2014 and deal with the endogeneity of globalisation measures. Our instrumental variable is predicted openness based on a time-varying gravity model. OLS results show that globalisation and income inequality are positively correlated within the full sample of countries and the sample of emerging and developing countries. The positive relationship is mainly driven by export openness, FDIs and social globalisation. The 2SLS results do not show that overall globalisation or any sub-indicator influences income inequality. The effect, however, is positive within the sample of higher developed countries and driven by transition countries from Eastern Europe and China. Within the sample of the most advanced economies, neither OLS nor 2SLS results show any significant positive relationship between globalisation and inequality.
F02|International Agreements, Economic Sovereignty and Exit|"We develop a model in which it is uncertainty about the future domestic policy environment that both makes international cooperation attractive and induces the possibility of a nation reneging on such an international agreement. We show, in a fairly general setting that the possibility of exit reduces the optimal degree of initial cooperation. ""Full"" cooperation will never be optimal, and the optimal degree of cooperation will never be such as to ""squeeze out"" any possibility of exit."
F02|Telecommunication Submarine-Cable Deployment and the Digital Divide in Sub-Saharan Africa|The recent deployment of fibre-optic submarine cables (SMCs) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) raised the prospects for the digital economy expansion and the whole sub-continent take-off, but also exposed countries and populations to new sources of vulnerability. This paper provides empirical evidence on the ambivalent effect of SMC deployment on the digital divide in 46 SSA countries. On the one hand, results show that the laying of SEACOM, MainOne and EASSy cables in 2009-2010 has yielded a three percentage points increase in internet penetration rates. This is a huge increase, meaning that the deployment of these cables has almost doubled the penetration of Internet in the sub-continent’s population. On the other hand, exogenous sources of telecommunication disruptions related to SMC laying – the country’s exposure to SMC outages and digital isolation – are found to reduce internet and mobile penetration rates, to lower investments in ICTs, and to increase mobile-cellular tariffs and the wireline network instability. Therefore, while SMC arrival in SSA has reduced the digital divide, this divide would be lower if SSA countries were less digitally vulnerable.

F02|Lessons from historical monetary unions - is the European monetary union making the same mistakes?|Abstract This article examines three historical monetary unions: the Latin Monetary Union (LMU), the Scandinavian Monetary Union (SMU), and the Austro-Hungarian Monetary Union (AHMU) in an attempt to derive possible lessons for the European Monetary Union (EMU). The term ‘monetary union’ can be defined either narrowly or broadly depending on how closely it conforms to Mundell’s notion of ‘Optimal Currency Area’. After examining each of the historical monetary unions from this perspective, the article concludes that none of them ever truly conformed to Mundell’s concept, nor does the EMU. Nevertheless, the article argues that some lessons may be learned from these historical experiences. First, it is necessary that there exist robust institutions such as a common central bank and a unified fiscal policy in order to withstand external shocks. The three early unions could not withstand the shock of WWI. Another important lesson is that continuing national rivalries can undermine any monetary union.
F02|How did Regional Economic Structures in the EU Change during the Economic Crisis?|10 years on, many countries and regions in the EU still bear the scars of the 2008/2009 financial crisis. Countries and regions have recovered at different rates and undergone different structural changes. While the asymmetric impact of the crisis across regions and sectors has had a short-term impact on concentration and specialisation patterns; long-term forces, such as global economic and supply chain integration, continue to shape the economic landscape of European regions. In our empirical analysis, we describe the development of regional economic structures in terms of sectoral employment and production (gross value added) during the crisis. We focus on the location pattern of sectors (concentration), i.e. in which regions economic activities in a sector tend to be located, and the specialisation of regions, i.e. which sectors are particularly important in a region. Our analysis shows that the impact of the crisis on overall specialisation patterns appears rather limited, although some regions have been more affected than others. In addition, the general trend of sectoral location patterns in the EU becoming more similar over time has continued, albeit at a slower pace since 2009, especially in Central and East European Countries. In terms of sectors, employment and production concentration in the construction and manufacturing sectors, which displayed clustering before the crisis, have been dispersing since 2009. The data also show that regions with large employment losses during the crisis were mainly specialised in agriculture, low-tech manufacturing, construction and less-skilled services such as trade, accommodation/restaurants and transport. This suggests that local economic structures may have played a role in the economic resilience of regions during the crisis.
F02|Escaping the Middle-Income Trap: A Cross-Country Analysis on the Patterns of Industrial Upgrading|With rapid industrial upgrading along the global value chain of manufactured goods, China has transformed, within one generation, from an impoverished agrarian society to a middle-income nation as well as the largest manufacturing powerhouse in the world. This article identifies the pattern of China’s industrial upgrading and compares it with those of other successfully industrialized economies and the failed ones. We find that (i) China (since 1978) followed essentially the same path of industrial upgrading as that of Japan and the “Asian Tigers.” These economies succeeded in catching up with the developed western world by going through three developmental stages sequentially; namely, a proto-industrialization in the rural areas, a first industrial revolution featuring mass production of labor-intensive light consumer goods, and then a second industrial revolution featuring mass production of the means of mass production (i.e., capital-intensive heavy industrial good s such as steel, machine tools, electronics, automobiles, communication and transport infrastructures). (ii) In contrast, economies stuck in the low-income trap or middle-income trap did not follow the above sequential stages of industrialization. For example, many Eastern European and Latin American countries after WWII jumped to the stage of heavy industrialization without fully developing their labor-intensive light industries, and thus stagnated in the middle-income trap. Also, there is a clear lack of proto-industrialization in the rural areas for many African economies that have remained in the low-income trap. We believe that laissez-faire and “free market” alone is unable to trigger industrial upgrading. Instead, correct government-led bottom-up industrial policies are the key to escaping the low- and middle-income traps.

F02|On the performances of Dynamic Conditional Correlation models in the Sovereign CDS market and the corresponding bond market|The study of an efficient financial assets' modeling method is still an open hot issue especially during recent crises. Using credit risk data from 33 worldwide countries, this paper investigates the performance of 9 Dynamic Conditional Correlation models taking into account different properties of financial markets (long memory behavior, asymmetry and/or leverage effects...). This comparative study is based on the results of several multivariate diagnostic tests. Findings show that no model outperforms the others in all situations, though, the straightforward DCC-GARCH model seems to provide the most relevant estimator parameters. Yet, the innovations distributions assumption significantly impacts the statistical fit of the model. Our work is useful for financial markets' participants so as to making decision in terms of arbitrage, hedging or speculation. JEL Classification G11, G12, F02, C58
F02|Russia And The Eurasian Economic Union: Conflicting Incentives For An Institutional Compromise|The Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) is the first and relatively successful attempt to establish strong multilateral institutions of post-Soviet regional integration. The EAEU has greater scope of supranationalism compared to all previous post-Soviet integration projects and the Union’s multilateral institutions are based on the formal recognition of equal status of all the members. However, such a union is unlikely to promote the Russian economic and political dominance in the region, at least compared to what would be attainable through bilateral deals. On contrary, the post-soviet countries got opportunities to act more independently from Russia. We argue that it was the Ukrainian crisis in spring 2014 and the need to promote the domestic image of Russia as “great power” that created incentives for Russian leadership to accept institutional compromises necessary to initiate the Eurasian Economic Union.
F02|The Belt and Road initiative of China: A critical analysis of its feasibility|The so-called Belt & Road initiative of China is the largest and most comprehensive global economic activity of our times. It consists on a land as well as a sea channel that covers more than 60 countries in Asia and Europe, around 65 % of the world population, one-third of world's GDP, and 25 % of global trade. Although the project is still in a very early stage it is worth starting a scientific based judgment of its impact and success perspective. This paper aims to kick-off such a discussion by conducting a feasibility study including economic as well as political factors. In order to reduce the complexity of the task the overall project is disaggregated by its six economic corridors plus the sea channel, which are evaluated by the same categories and summarized to an overall result. Our analysis shows that for more than half of the corridors a successful implementation is highly likely, for two the feasibility is judged as medium, and only for one it turns out that a success is unlikely mainly due to political reasons.
F02|The new global agenda and the future of the multilateral development bank system|The authors assess the role of the multilateral development system and the reforms needed to support the new global agenda. There is an urgency to the reforms. The coming decades will see the largest urban expansion in history. More infrastructure needs to be built in the next 15 years than the existing stock of infrastructure in the world. Multilateral development banks (MDBs) are uniquely placed to support policy and institutional reforms and build institutional capacity, enhance the quality of projects and programs, and scale up for transformative change. They are the best mechanism today for leveraging public resources. By our calculations, each dollar of paid-in capital could reasonably translate into $50 of public investments if properly allocated. Despite these inherent strengths, MDBs are constrained by their financial and institutional capacities, effectiveness of instruments, and unclear mandates and governance shortcomings. The authors suggest MDBs do more in three client groups: (i) fragile states; (ii) high-debt countries; and (iii) upper middle-income countries, adjusting strategies and use of instruments in each case. With so many issues on the table, they believe that the greatest risk to the system lies in active inertia, a tendency to make changes on the margin that fall short of a collective response that is scaled to the task at hand. Individual MDBs each perform well, according to evaluation results, but their impact could be enhanced if they cooperated more as a system and developed scalable platform approaches. Major expansion is not feasible under current business and financial models. Shareholders need to reach consensus on capital and governance to unlock the financial potential and effectiveness of the MDB system.
F02|A German view on the Baltic Sea region|For Germany and the other large BSR neighbors Poland an the Russian Federation Baltic Sea trade is of minor importance. The BSR is only one integration area — i.e. destination of its exports and origin of its imports — among a lot of peers being located in other directions of the compass rose. Moreover the BSR in a narrower sense is characterized by a high degree of economic heterogeneity — a North-South downward gradient of wealth can be observed. This wealth gap at the Baltic Sea implies diverging economic interests.
F02|Structural conditions for currency internationalization: international finance and the survival constraint| This paper examines the relationship between currency internationalization and economic structure. It argues that the hierarchical and asymmetric architecture of the international monetary system imposes a ‘survival constraint’ upon non-center countries that obliges them to generate net inflows of the international center currency to finance their payment commitments. It outlines why management of this constraint has historically been associated with a development approach that prioritizes exports and investment over domestic consumption and illustrates how this development approach creates economic structure subject to path dependence and network effects, which perpetuates the role of non-center countries as users of the international currency and the role of the center country as supplier of the international currency. On this basis, it is argued that currency internationalization cannot be pursued in isolation from broader economic policy, but rather requires economic structural change, political mediation and accommodative balance of payments management. Specifically, raising the international profile of the Chinese renminbi would require rebalancing of the Chinese economy towards domestic demand, whereas the status of the US dollar is intimately intertwined with the international openness of the US economy.
F02|Verteidigungsausgaben in der (wirtschafts)politischen Diskussion|Die deutschen Verteidigungsausgaben werden im Rahmen der NATO immer wieder als zu niedrig kritisiert, insbesondere von Seiten der US-Administration. Auch wenn die Bindungswirkung des Ziels für die Militärausgaben in Höhe von 2 Prozent des Bruttoinlandsprodukts strittig ist, hat es doch erhebliche politische Relevanz. Deutschland bewegt sich seit Jahren deutlich unter diesem Ziel und wird es auch nach den aktuellen Haushaltsplanungen in den nächsten Jahren nicht erreichen. Im Gegensatz zu anderen europäischen Ländern hat Deutschland seine Verteidigungsausgaben nach dem Ende des Kalten Krieges deutlich gesenkt und auf dem niedrigeren Niveau gehalten. In den Achtziger Jahren lagen die Ausgaben in Deutschland noch zwischen zwei und drei Prozent des BIP, heute sind es laut der NATO-Definition noch 1,2 Prozent. Die beiden europäischen Atommächte geben jährlich rund 2 Prozent ihrer Wirtschaftsleistung für die Landesverteidigung aus, nachdem es gegen Ende des Kalten Krieges bis zu fünf Prozent waren. Verglichen mit dem absoluten Niveau von 1990 konnte Deutschland eine Friedensdividende von über 400 Milliarden Dollar in Form von geringeren Ausgaben einfahren. Die aktuellen außenpolitischen Diskussionen, eine sich verändernde Sicherheitslage und vielfach beklagte Ausrüstungsmängel der Bundeswehr können zu steigenden Ausgaben und damit zu zusätzlichen Risiken für den Bundeshaushalt führen. Die bisherige Finanzplanung spiegelt dies nur eingeschränkt wider.
F02|Competition policy, trade and the global economy: Existing WTO elements, commitments in regional trade agreements, current challenges and issues for reflection|Competition policy, today, is an essential element of the legal and institutional framework for the global economy. Whereas decades ago, anti-competitive practices tended to be viewed mainly as a domestic phenomenon, most facets of competition law enforcement now have an important international dimension. Examples include: the investigation and prosecution of price fixing and market sharing arrangements that often spill across national borders and, in important instances, encircle the globe; multiple recent, prominent cases of abuses of a dominant position in high-tech network industries; important current cases involving transnational energy markets; and major corporate mergers that often need to be simultaneously reviewed by multiple jurisdictions. Beyond competition law enforcement per se, increasingly, major issues of competition policy (e.g., the impact on competition of the structure and scope of intellectual property rights or the role of state-owned enterprises) implicate the interests of multiple jurisdictions.

F02|Challenged by migration: Europe's options|This paper examines the migration and labour mobility in the European Union and elaborates on their importance for the existence of the EU. Against all measures of success, the current public debate seems to suggest that the political consensus that migration is beneficial is broken. This comes with a crisis of European institutions in general. Migration and labour mobility have not been at the origin of the perceived cultural shift. The EU in its current form and ambition could perfectly survive or collapse even if it solves its migration challenge. But it will most likely collapse, if it fails to solve the mobility issue by not preserving free internal labour mobility and not establishing a joint external migration policy.
F02|Determinants of Novice, Portfolio and Serial Entrepreneurship: An Occupational Choice Approach|In this paper we present an occupational choice model for entrepreneurs, in which, based on their individual skills and on the quality of their business, entrepreneurs can keep their original business, open a new business in the same or another sector along the current business (portfolio entrepreneur), shut it down to either start a new one (serial entrepreneur) or to turn to dependent employment. We test our theory using a 10-year panel dataset (2001 to 2010) of more than 4,000 Vietnamese manufacturing firms. We estimate an occupational choice model and a survival model and find that: (i) a greater endowment of human capital is associated with a higher likelihood to become a serial or a portfolio entrepreneur; (ii) A higher quality of the new business is associated to a higher likelihood of being habitual entrepreneurs. Particularly, high entrepreneurial skills together with a high-quality business positively influence the likelihood to be serial or portfolio; (iii) novice entrepreneurs with high entrepreneurial skill and a high-quality business are more likely to keep their business.
F02|A globalisation challenge: Preventing a clash between the middle classes of the developed and emerging economies|"Tension is growing between the interests of the middle classes that are in decline in the mature economies and the rising ones in emerging markets. The aim of the public policies proposed in this paper is to impede such a clash by not threatening de-globalisation, avoiding protectionism, fostering inclusive technological innovation, compensating the losers of globalisation in developed economies and reassuring the winners in emerging economies. It argues that the G20 concept of ""inclusive growth"" must overcome the challenges that come with reduced inequalities between countries, growing inequality within countries and the disruptive impact that accompanies technological innovation."
F02|An evidence-based approach to ending rural hunger|Progress toward food and nutrition security (FNS) needs to be sharply accelerated in order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal for ending hunger and malnutrition, especially in rural areas. The G20 should target interventions and investment opportunities to maximize impact on people and transformation of rural areas. Currently, few G20 countries map investments, technical assistance, capacity building and policy improvement in a data-driven way. Such tracking of needs, policies, and resources could include G20 countries' domestic efforts alongside countries they support with development assistance. The G20 could develop such a methodology to identify countries and interventions where additional resources could have a lasting impact. They could then systematically track and streamline FNS actions taken across international organizations and initiatives to help ensure the SDG is achieved.
F02|The Euro from a business perspective|The euro area has several problems. Nevertheless, there is not only strong political support for it, but also most companies back the euro or at least do not complain. It is worthwhile to analyse which companies do profit from the euro and why most others do not oppose it. Exporting companies in the northern countries of the euro zone profit from the euro and the policies to save the common currency even if their countries and people suffer. Other companies, especially in the southern member countries, suffer themselves but fear a break-up of the euro area even more than its continuance. For small companies it is not worthwhile to lobby for other policies, while the companies worst affected already ceased to exist. All companies have to come to terms with the euro but should also prepare for the possible end of the euro zone. Companies in other European countries reconsider whether they really want their countries to join the euro area.
F02|Assessing marginal, threshold, and net effects of financial globalisation on financial development in Africa|This paper contributes to the extant literature by simultaneously accounting for variations in financial development and financial globalisation in the assessment of hypothetical initial financial development conditions for the rewards of financial globalisation. For this purpose, we examine marginal, threshold and net effects of financial globalisation on financial development throughout the conditional distributions of financial development. The empirical evidence is based on contemporary and non-contemporary quantile regressions with data from 53 African countries for the period 1996–2011. Financial globalisation is measured with net foreign direct investment inflows, whereas financial development entails all dimensions identified by the Financial Development and Structure Database of the World Bank. The findings consistently reveal (i) positive marginal effects, (ii) unfeasible financial globalisation positive thresholds and (iii) negative financial globalisation net effects. The second and third findings are fundamentally due to marginal effects of low positive magnitude. Policy implications are discussed.
F02|The effects of Brexit on the EU, the UK and Dorset - a migrants' account|The lecture evaluates the economic effects of Brexit on the EU taking Frankfurt as an example, the UK and in particular Dorset. Dorset stands out as having voted pro leave well above UK average. The lecture argues that Brexit is against the interest of Dorset businesses except for the tourism sector. The overall effect on the UK is presented as negative for the economy, whereas there will e a small positive effect on the EU. Much will however depend on whether there will be a hard Brexit or transitional arrangements can be established.
F02|The Globalisation of Inflation: The Growing Importance of Global Value Chains|Greater international economic interconnectedness over recent decades has been changing inflation dynamics. This paper presents evidence that the expansion of global value chains (GVCs), ie cross-border trade in intermediate goods and services, is an important channel through which global economic slack influences domestic inflation. In particular, we document the extent to which the growth in GVCs explains the established empirical correlation between global economic slack and national inflation rates, both across countries and over time. Accounting for the role of GVCs, we also find that the conventional trade-based measures of openness used in previous studies are poor proxies for this transmission channel. The results support the hypothesis that as GVCs expand, direct and indirect competition among economies increases, making domestic inflation more sensitive to the global output gap. This can affect the trade-offs that central banks face when managing inflation.
F02|International Inflation Spillovers through Input Linkages|We document that international input-output linkages contribute substantially to synchronizing producer price inflation (PPI) across countries. Using a multicountry, industry-level data set that combines information on PPI and exchange rates with global input-output linkages, we recover the underlying cost shocks that are propagated internationally via the global input-output network, thus generating the observed dynamics of PPI. We then compare the extent to which common global factors account for the variation in actual PPI and in the underlying cost shocks. Across a range of econometric tests, input-output linkages account for half of the global component of PPI inflation.
F02|Campaign Contributions for Free Trade: Salient and Non-salient Agendas|Although protectionism became a salient issue in the 2016 presidential election campaign, both Republican and Democratic adminis- trations have been silently promoting free trade for decades. We set up a two-party electoral competition model in a two-dimensional policy space with campaign contributions by a group (exporting/multinational firms) that is interested in promoting free trade, for which voters do not have positive sentiment. Assuming that voters are impressionable to campaign spending for/against candidates, we analyze the optimal contract between the interest group and the candidates on policy is- sues and campaign contributions. If voters' negative sentiment to free trade is not too strong, the interest group tends to contribute to both candidates to make free trade a nonsalient issue, and the candidates compete over the other (ideological) dimension only. If votersíneg- ative sentiment to free trade is strong, the interest group tends to contribute to a more malleable candidate only.
F02|Global Collaborative Patents|We study the prevalence and traits of global collaborative patents for US public companies, where the inventor team is located both within and outside of the US. Collaborative patents are frequently observed when a corporation is entering into a new foreign region for innovative work, especially in settings where intellectual property protection is weak. We also connect collaborative patents to the ethnic composition of the firm's US inventors and cross‐border mobility of inventors within the firm. The inventor team composition has important consequences for how the new knowledge is exploited within and outside of the firm.
F02|Milton Friedman and the case for flexible exchange rates and monetary rules|Milton Friedman was a strong proponent of flexible exchange rates accompanied by a domestic monetary rule. He believed that such a combination would deliver superior economic performance and would also be more consistent with democratic principles than a regime based on fixed exchange rates and discretionary monetary policy. John Taylor’s recent proposal of a rules-based international monetary system –- based on flexible exchange rates and a Taylor rule for each country - is very much in that spirit and represents a modern rendition of Friedman’s views. Under both the Friedman and Taylor proposals, instead of policy coordination among countries there would be policy harmonization.
F02|Europe in a New World Order|Abstract The EU is a relatively open economy and has benefited from the global multilateral system. We argue that the EU should defend its strategic interests with three steps. First, it should collaborate with partners around the world in defence of multilateralism. Second, it should establish deeper economic relations with emerging economies. Collaboration in support of the Paris agreement is also essential. Third, the EU must be reformed to increase its external credibility. The Singapore ruling has offered a useful clarification on trade policy. Addressing internal imbalances would also increase external credibility. Finally, strengthening Europe’s social model would provide a counter model to protectionist temptations.
F02|UK trade and FDI: A post‐Brexit perspective|Leaving the EU will reshape the UK's economic relations with the rest of the world. This paper summarizes the findings of recent research studying the UK's role in the global economy, and the consequences of Brexit for UK trade, investment, and living standards. We emphasize that international integration affects investment and labour flows as well as trade in goods and services. There are important interdependencies between different forms of integration that should be accounted for when evaluating policy changes. Brexit is likely to make the UK poorer by reducing trade and investment flows, but the magnitude of the economic decline will depend upon the nature of the UK's post‐Brexit economic relations with the EU and the rest of the world. We conclude by considering options for UK‐EU relations after Brexit and how the UK should approach future trade negotiations. La salida de la UE reformará las relaciones económicas del Reino Unido con el resto del mundo. Este artículo resume los hallazgos de investigaciones recientes que estudian el papel del Reino Unido en la economía global y las consecuencias de Brexit para el comercio, la inversión y los niveles de vida en el Reino Unido. El artículo pone de relieve que la integración internacional afecta los flujos de inversión y de mano de obra, así como el comercio de bienes y servicios. Existen interdependencias importantes entre las diferentes formas de integración que se deben tener en cuenta al evaluar los cambios en las políticas. Es probable que Brexit haga más pobre al Reino Unido a causa de la reducción de los flujos de comercio e inversión, pero la magnitud de la disminución económica dependerá de la naturaleza de las relaciones económicas post‐Brexit del Reino Unido con la UE y el resto del mundo. Las conclusiones sopesan las opciones para las relaciones post‐Brexit entre el Reino Unido y la UE y cómo debería el Reino Unido abordar las futuras negociaciones sobre comercio. EU離脱は、イギリスが諸外国との経済関係を再構築するということを意味する。本稿では、イギリスの世界経済における役割に関する最近の研究の知見、ブレグジッド(Brexit:イギリスのEU離脱)がイギリスの貿易、投資、生活水準にもたらした影響を要約する。我々は、国際統合が、投資、労働力フロー、そして物品およびサービス取引に影響することを強調する。政策転換の評価を行う際に考慮に入れるべき、異なる統合形式間の大きな相互依存性が存在する。ブレグジッドは取引と投資フローを減少させイギリスをより貧しくする可能性が高いが、経済の衰退の規模は、ブレグジッド後のEUとその他の諸外国との経済関係の性質に依存すると考えられる。最後にブレグジッド後のイギリスとEUの関係として考えられる選択肢と、イギリスが今後の貿易交渉にどのようなアプローチをとるべきか考察する。

F02|Patent Breadth In An International Setting|We examine the Nash equilibria of a game where two national governments set patent breadth strategically. Broader patents make R&D more attractive, but the effect on static efficiency is nonmonotonic. In a North.South model, where only the North can innovate, harmonization of patent breadth lowers welfare relative to the Nash equilibrium. When both countries can innovate, harmonization toward narrower patent breadth may raise world welfare.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F02|Wedges: Distribution, Distortions, and Market Integration|This paper proposes a stylized model of policy determination and imperfect international integration. A policy wedge aims to correct laissez-faire market imperfections and/or redistribute welfare across heterogeneous agents. Policy is subject to both race-to-the-bottom and beggar-thy-neighbor forces if the country's politico-economic equilibrium interacts with the rest of the world. Variation of international market wedges induces patterns of country-specific regulation and deregulation that depend on political and structural features in non-obvious, intuitive, and empirically realistic ways.
F02|Europa und Indien: Neustart in einer in Schieflage geratenen Handelsbeziehung|Seit Juni 2007 verhandeln die EU und Indien über ein umfassendes Freihandelsabkommen, die Verhandlungen ruhen jedoch seit dem Jahr 2013. Nichtsdestotrotz haben beide Seiten ihren Willen geäußert, die Gespräche zu einem umfassenden Handels- und Investitionsvereinbarung (BTIA) wiederaufzunehmen. In der Studie quantifizieren wir die potenziellen wirtschaftlichen Konsequenzen durch ein allgemeines Gleichgewichtsmodell. Auf Grundlage der Annahme, dass ein Freihandelsabkommen alle Zölle zwischen der EU und Indien beseitigen und nichttarifäre Barrieren reduzieren würden, wie dies bereits durch andere tiefgreifende Abkommen geschehen ist, simulieren wir Handels-, Wertschöpfungs- und Wohlfahrtseffekte eines BTIA. Das reale Pro-Kopf-Einkommen würde sich in Indien um 1,30% und in der EU um 0,14% ändern. Wir finden, dass Außenseiter eines Handelsabkommens im Verhältnis zum Status quo weitgehend unberührt bleiben. Allerdings existiert eine beträchtliche regionale Heterogenität über die 134 geografischen, untersuchten Einheiten. Aufgrund einer Vereinbarung könnte sich der EU-Indien Handel im Bereich der Geschäftsdienstleistungen annähernd verdoppeln. Wir finden eine geringe Anzahl von Handelsumlenkungseffekten durch eng integrierte Wertschöpfungsketten, aber eine deutliche Auswirkung auf den Strukturwandel in Indien. Auf den ersten Blick sollten also beide Parteien ein Interesse daran haben, ein Freihandelsabkommen abzuschließen.
F02|Panel de VAR : una aplicación en la movilidad de factores de producción en la integración económica Alianza del Pacífico|Resumen: Este trabajo presenta la aplicación de un modelo de panel de Vectores Autorregresivos (pVAR) para la estimación de un conjunto de coeficientes en un escenario dinámico, con variación en el tiempo de los mismos. Se toma como referencia el bloque de países de la Alianza del Pacífico. Se estudian las relaciones entre éstos, especialmente las vinculadas con los factores de producción como la mano de obra y capital; sobre los cuales se generan impulsos. Se encontró que en términos comerciales la Alianza del Pacífico no representa innovaciones y que las alteraciones del empleo y stock de capital desvían levemente las tasas de crecimiento del PIB de los cuatro países, presentándose un rápido retorno al estado estacionario de las mismas. / Abstract : This paper presents the application of one panel-vector autoregressive (p-VAR) model for estimating a coefficient set in a dynamic scenario, which allows for observing variations throughout time. The Pacific Alliance countries bloc is taken as a reference. The relations between these are studied, especially those related to the factors of production such as labor and capital; On which impulses are generated. It was found that in commercial terms the Pacific Alliance does not represent innovations and that the alterations of the employment and stock of capital slightlydeviate the rates of growth of the GDP of the four countries, being presented a fast return to the steady state.

F02|From National Independence to International Integration: Europe and Romania|In the process of globalization, some countries and their inhabitants do progress and prosper while others are left further behind. And here is where national governments still have an important role to play because they can enact policies that no corporation can. Thus, governments should keep a balance between international interests, local businesses, and the general population. There is a strong link between political decisions and economic activities. In order to prosper, a country needs honest and competent political leaders and good economic specialists. And they must act together keeping in mind the national interests of the country and the needs of the people. The case of Romania is complex and a true analysis of the transition from a command economy to a market economy is beyond the scope of this paper. The situation could only improve if people elect honest political leaders who in turn appoint competent specialists to rebuild the economy. Only then could Romania aspire to a dignified place in the New World Order brought about by the process of globalization.
F02|Capital Openness and Income Inequality: Smooth Sailing or Troubled Waters?|The 2008 Financial Crisis and subsequent financial turbulence has triggered economists and policymakers to revisit the extent to which capital account liberalization is optimal for all countries at all levels of development. While that literature has largely concluded that capital account liberalization may have detrimental effects on growth and accentuate financial instability in emerging markets, relatively little literature has examined the impacts of capital account liberalization on inequality—a subject that has also been under intense study over the past decade as well. In this paper, we attempt to build upon and bridge these two literatures to examine the extent to which capital account liberalization is associated with income inequality. We confirm earlier studies that show there is such a relationship between increased capital account openness and increases in inequality, and that capital account regulations are associated with less inequality—at least for emerging market economies. We expand on these findings to learn that there are differential impacts of capital account liberalization on inequality during booms and busts, being financial development a key factor. During normal times, we find that there are positive impacts on income inequality, whereas during busts, capital account liberalization appears to exacerbate inequality, calling for active policies.
F02|The fallacy of the globalization trilemma: reframing the political economy of globalization and implications for democracy|This paper argues Rodrik?s (2011) globalization trilemma is analytically mistaken. Rather than a trilemma, globalization poses a dilemma between more globalization and reduced national policy space. Not only may globalization shrink policy space, it may also twist it. The character of the twist depends on the type of globalization. There is no inherent contradiction between globalization and the democratic nation state. However, globalization has significant implications for the content of democratic politics which it tends to restrict. Furthermore, globalization can generate policy lock-in (Palley, 2017) which permanently reduces policy space. That has enormous implications for democracy and future democratic policymaking.
F02|Internationalization of Indian multinational enterprises - motivations, strategies and regulation from the experience of Indian investments - a focus on Europe|This paper makes a critical assessment of Indian companies’ internationalization experience. It introduces a new theoretical framework in order to go beyond classical notion based on western companies’ global aspirations. Besides the theoretical modifications the paper provides an empirical collection about those successful Indian internationalization projects that sought to enter the European market. The question to be answered here is whether Indian firms are able to compete out dominant western companies in an increasingly multipolar world economy in the future. By applying the modified method on the question of internationalization from developing companies’ point of view, the aim of the paper is to detect future world economic trends to which Indian companies will need to accommodate themselves.
F02|Globalisation and inequality in a dynamic economy: an axiomatic analysis of unequal exchange|Abstract An axiomatic analysis of the concept of unequal exchange (UE) between countries is developed in a dynamic general equilibrium model that generalises John Roemer’s (Central Planning and the Soviet Economy, MIT Press, Cambridge, 1983) economy with a global capital market. The class of UE definitions that satisfy three fundamental properties—including a correspondence between wealth, class and UE exploitation status—is completely characterised. It is shown that this class is nonempty and a definition of UE exploitation between countries is proposed, which is theoretically robust and firmly anchored to empirically observable data. The full class and UE exploitation structure of the international economy is derived in equilibrium.
F02|Integración económica, crisis económicas y ciclos económicos en México|En este artículo se analiza la peculiaridad de la dinámica de las fluctuaciones económicas de la economía mexicana en el marco de su integración con Estados Unidos y Canadá, y se demuestra cómo la economía mexicana endogeneizó las crisis macroeconómicas provenientes de Estados Unidos (2001 y 2007) y cómo los ciclos económicos de ambos países se fueron alineando. Con base en la teoría económica heterodoxa de las crisis y los ciclos verificamos la «ley empírica de la dinámica económica» del sistema capitalista mexicano según la lógica de la teoría del acelerador-multiplicador que nos permitió estudiar la dinámica de las fluctuaciones para el período de estudio (1993-2013). Para ello, construimos y estimamos un modelo VAR estacionario y utilizamos las pruebas de causalidad a la Granger y datos trimestrales.
F02|Economic integration, economic crises and economic cycles in Mexico|This article analyzes the peculiarity of the dynamics of economic fluctuations of the Mexican economy, within the framework of its integration with the US and Canada; the article demonstrates how the Mexican economy make endogenous the macroeconomic crises from the USA (2001 and 2007), and how the business cycles of both countries became more aligned to each other. Based on the heterodox economic theory of crises and cycles, we check the “empirical law of economic dynamics” of the Mexican capitalist system according to the logic of the multiplier–accelerator theory that allowed us to study the dynamics of business cycles for the period of the study (1993–2013). To do this, we construct and estimate a stationary VAR model and utilize the Granger causality tests and quarterly data.
F02|Israel's Immigration Story: Globalization lessons|The exodus of Soviet Jews to Israel in the 1990s was a unique event. The extraordinary experience of Israel, which has received three quarter million migrants from the Former Soviet Union, amounting to 17 percent of its population, within a short time, is also relevant for the current debate about migration and globalization. The immigration wave was distinctive for its large high skilled cohort, and its quick integration into the domestic labor market. Immigration also changed the entire economic landscape: it raised productivity, underpinning technological prowess, and had significant impact on income inequality and the level of redistribution in Israel's welfare state.
F02|Populism and the Economics of Globalization|Populism may seem like it has come out of nowhere, but it has been on the rise for a while. I argue that economic history and economic theory both provide ample grounds for anticipating that advanced stages of economic globalization would produce a political backlash. While the backlash may have been predictable, the specific form it took was less so. I distinguish between left-wing and right-wing variants of populism, which differ with respect to the societal cleavages that populist politicians highlight. The first has been predominant in Latin America, and the second in Europe. I argue that these different reactions are related to the relative salience of different types of globalization shocks.
F02|The balance between investor protection and the right to regulate in investment treaties: A scoping paper|There is vigorous debate about reforms to address the balance between investor protection and the right to regulate in the over 3000 existing investment treaties. This paper first notes the growing trend to analyse particular treaty rules rather than treaties as a whole and the importance of comparative analysis of balancing under other regimes. It then outlines issues in four areas: (i) the types of regulation potentially at issue in investment treaty claims by covered investors; (ii) the types and levels of investor protection; (iii) the degree of impact of treaties on regulation; and (iv) the processes and institutions that may be involved in balancing interests in investor protection and the right to regulate. While the paper recognises that dispute resolution institutions have a significant impact on the balance and the right to regulate, it focuses primarily on substantive issues in light of other ongoing work on dispute settlement.
F02|Addressing the balance of interests in investment treaties: The limitation of fair and equitable treatment provisions to the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law|The fair and equitable treatment (FET) provision has leapt to prominence in the last 15 years as the principal ground of liability at issue in many if not most investment treaty arbitration claims. In debates about the impact of investment treaties on the right to regulate, FET is second only to investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) as the most-cited provision. This paper examines government action to address the balance between investor protection and the right to regulate by limiting fair and equitable treatment provisions to the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law (MST-FET). The paper reviews the distinction between MST-FET clauses and autonomous FET clauses, and notes growing use of an express MST-FET approach in many regions. NAFTA governments’ views about the nature of the MST-FET standard, how it is identified, and its content are then examined in detail. An initial focus on NAFTA, while limited, is justified due to many singularities in NAFTA, including numerous government interpretations of MST-FET since 1994, their availability to the public and the comparatively higher success rate of NAFTA governments in defending FET claims. The paper concludes with brief comparisons between the government views and the views of ISDS tribunals and commentators.
F02|Reaping the benefits of global value chains in Turkey|Despite major progress, Turkey still lags behind most comparable countries in terms of exported value added per capita. Its remarkable economic performance over the past 15 years has not been sufficiently backed by gains in export market shares, in particular when measured in value added terms. While Turkey incorporates an increasing share of foreign value added in its own exports, its capacity to provide intermediate inputs to other countries’ exports is still limited. This paper argues that Turkey’s participation in global value chains remains below potential owing to institutional features that hamper efficient allocation of capital and labour, obstacles inherent in bilateral trade agreements and entry regulations, underdeveloped human capital and insufficient investment in innovation, R&D and knowledge-based capital. Progress along these dimensions would strengthen Turkey’s backward and forward trade linkages and contribute to rebalancing its growth model. The adjustment process towards a more export-oriented economy operating on a level playing field needs to be flanked by dedicated industrial, social and environmental policies to alleviate adverse consequences on displaced firms and workers and the ecosystem. Tirer les avantages des chaînes de valeur mondiales en Turquie Malgré des progrès, la Turquie accuse toujours un retard par rapport à la plupart des pays comparables en termes de valeur ajoutée exportée par habitant. Sa performance économique remarquable au cours des 15 dernières années n'a pas été suffisamment soutenue par des gains de parts de marché à l'exportation, en particulier lorsque ceux-ci sont mesurés en valeur ajoutée. Alors que la Turquie intègre une part croissante de valeur ajoutée étrangère dans ses propres exportations, sa capacité à fournir des intrants intermédiaires pour les exportations d'autres pays est encore limitée. Ce papier fait valoir que la participation de la Turquie dans les chaînes de valeur mondiales reste inférieure à son potentiel en raison de caractéristiques institutionnelles qui entravent l'allocation efficace du capital et du travail, des obstacles inhérents aux accords commerciaux bilatéraux et des règlements d'entrée de professions, du capital humain sous-développé et de l'insuffisance des investissements dans l'innovation, la R & D et le capital de connaissances. Progresser dans ces dimensions permettrait de renforcer les liens commerciaux en amont et en aval de la Turquie et de contribuer à rééquilibrer son modèle de croissance. Le processus d'ajustement vers une économie plus orientée vers l'exportation opérant avec des règles du jeu équitables doit être encadré par des politiques industrielles, sociales et environnementales dédiées à atténuer les conséquences néfastes sur les entreprises et les travailleurs déplacés et l'écosystème.
F02|Bringing together international trade and investment perspectives on state enterprises|State enterprises (SEs) have been increasingly competing with private firms in international markets, in terms of both cross-border trade and FDI. Given both the potentially positive contribution internationally trading and investing SEs can make, as well as the concerns raised about their competitive behaviour, there is an interest in elaborating policy approaches that minimise any potentially distortionary effects and at the same time restrain protectionist policies that may be directed at SEs. The growing interdependency between trade and FDI, the increased contestability and complexity of markets and the varied nature of state intervention in the economy today mean that policy approaches need to consistently cover issues which transcend the traditional boundaries between trade, investment and competition. This paper investigates how international trade and investment perspectives on SEs are being brought together in international trade and investment agreements and how they could be integrated further. It does so by examining both the ability of existing provisions to ensure a level playing field between private firms and SEs and the disparity in approaches to regulating international activities of SEs between international trade and investment treaties. The paper first reviews the work documenting international activities of SEs and the associated concerns, highlighting the example of the steel sector. Next, it discusses some of the non-binding approaches that can be used to level the playing field, before reviewing relevant provisions in multilateral and preferential trade and investment agreements and identifying potential gaps. The concluding section summarises the results and identifies key issues for policy consideration.
F02|Digital Trade: Developing a Framework for Analysis|This paper explores the definition, measurement, and policy implications of digital trade, proposing a tentative typology of digital trade that can be used to unpack transactions and analyse the issues. Digitalisation is changing what and how we trade: from digital delivery to greater physical trade enabled by digital connectivity. Online platforms mean more small packages crossing borders, while new technologies are changing how services are produced and delivered. Underpinning digital trade is the movement of data: data is a means of production, an asset that can itself be traded, and the means through which some services are traded and GVCs are organised. While there is no single definition of digital trade, there is a growing consensus that it encompasses digitally enabled transactions in trade in goods and services which can be either digitally or physically delivered involving consumers, firms and governments. Unpacking trade transactions along these lines using a tentative typology can help in understanding and identifying issues. For example, measuring digital trade poses challenges ranging from identifying transactions that are digitally enabled to the sectoral classification of services in a transaction, and efforts are underway to better reflect digital trade in trade statistics. For trade policy, the increased bundling of goods and services raises issues about which trade rules (GATT or GATS) apply; trade facilitation is ever more critical for just-in-time delivery and GVCs; and the role of data flows in enabling digital trade may require further attention, along with how to ensure that the gains from digital trade are inclusive, within and across countries.
F02|Financial Globalisation Dynamic Thresholds for Financial Development: Evidence from Africa|Abstract We investigate whether financial development benefits from financial globalisation are questionable until certain thresholds of financial globalisation are attained. The empirical evidence is based on (i) data from 53 African countries for the period 2000–2011 and (ii) interactive Generalised Method of Moments with forward orthogonal deviations. The following findings are established. First, thresholds of Net Foreign Direct Investment Inflows as a percentage of GDP (FDIgdp) from which financial globalisation increases money supply are 20.50 and 16.00 for below- and above-median sub-samples of financial globalisation, respectively. Second, FDIgdp thresholds from which financial globalisation increases banking system activity and financial system activity for below-median sub-samples of financial globalisation are 13.81 and 13.29, respectively. Third, for financial size, there is evidence of: (i) a positive threshold of 21.30 in the full sample and (ii) consistent increasing returns without a modifying threshold for the above-median sub-sample. Policy implications are discussed.
F02|Methodological Approach to the Study of International Economic Integration Influence on Development of the EAEU Members|Research background: In modern conditions the international integration processes act as pledge of a sustainable development of the states, activization of investment cooperation, implementation of joint perspective projects. The emergence of new international economic integration organizations predetermines the need to rethink the patterns of development models of international economic integration processes, especially in the context of their impact on the economies of the participating countries. The analysis methods for assessing the effects of the international economic integration (Bergeijk, Brakman (2010), Blomstrom, Kokko (1997), Kepaptsoglou, Karlaftis, Tsamboulas (2010), Michalopoulos, Tarr (1997), Plummer, Cheong, Hamanaka (2010), Zwinkels, Beugelsdijk (2010), Vinokurov (2010) shows that none of them alone doesn’t allow a comprehensive assessment of the regional integration effects. Therefore, in the presence of statistical and other relevant information necessary to use the methods of quantitative analysis in the complex, taking into account their strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and constraints. Purpose of the article: The purpose of the study is to develop the theoretical foundations and development of methodology for assessing the impact of international economic integration in the socio-economic development of the participating countries (for example, the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU)). Methodology/methods: The authors created methodological approach to the study of influence of international economic integration on development of the EAEU members based on reaching of target indexes of international movement of goods, services and factors of production. Findings & Value added: Depending on the value of the integral indicator, the authors list four levels of the economic potential of the countries participating in the EAEU. The presented methodological approach allows to early diagnose problem areas and to choose from a variety of management solutions for its improvement.
F02|Global Infrastructure Projects as the Factor of National Economies’s Development (the case of the Turkish Stream Gas Pipeline)|The current stage of the economy’s development differs from the past ones in that the role of global infrastructure projects acquires ever more importance and that forming and designing of such programs becomes now a much more sophisticated process, all of this has led to a situation where we have to revise our system of economic methods of the evaluation benefits of a global infrastructure project for all involved countries. The existing methods and ways of evaluation influence global infrastructure projects on socio-economic development of the participating countries are to be complemented by new approaches reflecting the market changes and the advent of new financial instruments and stratagems. The aim of the paper is to evaluate influence the global infrastructure project on socio-economic development of the participating countries in the globalized world economy with respect to its main economic and social consequences and synergy effects (the case of the Turkish Stream gas pipeline). The aim of the paper is to evaluate influence the global infrastructure project on socio-economic development of the participating countries in the globalized world economy with respect to its main economic and social consequences and synergy effects (the case of the Turkish Stream gas pipeline). The authors crated methodological approach to the study of infrastructure projects influence on socio-economic development of the members based on the identification, evaluation and prediction of the influence of factors external and internal environment on the changing economic potential of the infrastructure projects participants. Adequate investment in the development of infrastructure is an important driver of long-term economic growth. Traditionally, infrastructure has been funded mostly through public investment. However, in view of scarcity of budgetary resources and lack of capacity within the government to implement these ambitious programs, the strategy of the government relies significantly on promoting investment through a combination of public investment and private participation (include foreign investors). The presented methodological approach allows to define and early diagnose the global infrastructure projects which facilitate a multiplication effect within the national economy.

F02|Competitiveness of selected countries from Central and Eastern Europe in the era of globalisation|The changes that took place in the late twentieth century led to the transformation of the political system in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). As a result, there has been an increase in the competitiveness of some of the economies among the CEE states. Due to different priorities and goals, these countries are also characterised by different levels in socio-economic development. The aim of the article is to identify the determinants affecting the competitiveness among the selected CEE countries. Based on Eurostat data, a set of determinants affecting competitiveness was established. A number of determinants have been eliminated in relation to the variation coefficient. At the same time, a classification of the level of competitiveness among the CEE countries has been made by using the Perkal method. The analysis used 14 selected indicators, 10 of which are considered as stimulating and 4 as deteriorating the competitiveness of national economies. The result led to obtaining a synthetic level indicator of potential of the CEE countries. Following the findings of the conducted analysis, the highest economic competitiveness exists in Estonia and in the Czech Republic, while the lowest was found in Romania and Bulgaria. The results of the evaluation obtained with the Perkal method concerning the competitiveness of the CEE countries that belong to the EU are largely consistent with those presented in different global competitiveness rankings. However, the method applied in this article seems much simpler and less time-consuming, allowing at the same time an optimal choice of analytical determinants. The selected linear Pearson correlation’s coefficient confirmed that there is a strong positive relationship between the designated values of the synthetic indicator of competitiveness and the GDP per capita. This confirms the validity of test method used.
F02|The Role of SMEs in International Trade: Selected Aspects|Research background: International trade is an important stimulant for economic development that simultaneously ensures free access to raw materials, goods, services and technologies. It essentially involves trade in goods, yet what is also significant is the invisible trading sphere (tourism, transport, financing sources). Being a vital factor in macro-economic policies pursued by contemporary national economies, SMEs build the single market, which integrates the European economy, through trade development that directly fosters economic growth. Purpose of the article: The article strives to answer the question whether EU-based SMEs enjoy benefits and greater stability as well as state support when operating in foreign markets. The article presents the contribution of SMEs to international trade conducted by selected EU countries and Poland. The results of the author’s own research relate to the share of SMEs in the sectoral and geographical structure. Methodology/methods: The research findings are based on source data from annual reports and publications that have been produced and made available by financial market institutions and on the author’s own research concerning Polish entrepreneurs. The volume and structure of SME imports and exports in the various markets are outlined by means of analyses, figures and comparisons. Findings: The author’s own research shows that Polish entrepreneurs operating in international markets are primarily driven by: (1) profitability of transactions, (2) prospects for establishing long-term cooperation, and (3) high demand for products originating in their country in foreign markets. The ongoing standardisation and unification with respect to internationalisation should be supported by the state along with forms of financial security and contract insurance. What SMEs expect most is support as regards co-financing investments that are a necessary and costly element of the international activity development process.
F02|Multiple time-xcales analysis of global stock markets spillovers effects in African stock markets|This paper investigates the time and frequency interdependence relationship between seven African stock markets, emerging stock markets, developed stock markets and Japan) and oil prices. The spillovers are examined from 2005 to 2016 taking into account the recent financial crisis and the recent oil prices fall. We combine the generalized VAR framework proposed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) and the Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT) to obtain the spillovers at different time scales. Result show that African financial markets integration with themselves and the outside depends on the time scales, the economic relations, the world financial markets state. Relationships with global financial markets are generally weak in the short run but tend to grow in the long run. The interdependence with oil prices is strong in short and medium run but weak in long run. African stock markets could be an opportunity of capital diversification in short run.
F02|Utopian Left-Wing Expectations and the Social Consequences of the 3rd Memorandum in Greece|In January 2015 the radical left SYRIZA has won the Greek national elections and formed a coalition government with Independent Greeks (ANEL), a right-wing populist party. After a seven-month negotiation with Greece’s creditors and the agreement for the implementation of a third memorandum of fiscal adjustment, SYRIZA announced the conduction of a second round of national elections in September 2015. After a second electoral victory, SYRIZA formed again a coalition government with ANEL. The main characteristic of SYRIZA’s pre-electoral campaign was that it has primarily focused on the commitment for austerity measures termination and on the implementation of tax alleviation. Even during the second electoral campaign in September 2015, after the agreement for the implementation of the third memorandum of fiscal adjustment, SYRIZA was promising that its implementation will be socially endued in order to reduce negative social consequences, such as those created by the previous memoranda. Practically though, after the first months of the new memorandum implementation, it is obvious that the government has introduced an unprecedented tax policy. Interestingly, this policy is not different from a traditional left logic of tax enforcement but actually leads to the implementation of horizontal austerity policies which firstly affect the socially vulnerable groups. From this point of view, while SYRIZA emphatically declare that it aims at resolving the crisis, its policies seem to deepen the depression. For instance, its inability to find alternative options to finance the social security system, leads to the implementation of restrictive policies which dismantle the welfare state. This paper aims at analyzing the policies of the first left government in Greece by focusing on the tentative social consequences of the third memorandum and at the same time, studying some of the basic factors for its electoral victory, such as populism.
F02|Germany and Greece: A mapping of their great divide and its EU implications|The economic constitutions of Germany and Greece have resulted in the postwar period in two economies that are based on two vastly different philosophies. Germany has built a highly competitive, outward looking economy based essentially on the principles of the so-called “Social Market Economy”, whereas Greece has set up a “state-managed economy” by drawing on the principles of central planning and administrative controls. This divide is equally stark, if assessed on the basis of the performance of the two economies. For, as it is known by now, Germany has become once again the powerhouse of Europe while Greece has gone bankrupt. As to the implications of this great divide for the future of the EU, its identification and mapping helps understand why convergence criteria on the basis of economic performance and living standards should be abandoned in favor of criteria based on the widening and deepening of the four European freedoms. A multi-speed Euroland enmeshed in these freedoms is going to be more democratic, more cohesive and a much happier union for the European citizens to call homeland.
F02|Welfare Impact of ASEAN Economic Integration: “ASEAN Way” Versus Theory|The ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) has been implemented since the beginning of 2016 and expected to be completed in 2025. The ASEAN member countries preserve their value and norms highly even in the condition of integrated ASEAN, particularly in state’s sovereignty, resulting “ASEAN Way” of integration. This research is conducted to compare the ASEAN Way of integration and theoretical kinds of economic integration (Balassa, 1961). Using GTAP 9 Migration database with 2007 and 2011 base year, the comparative examination of ASEAN Way of integration impact on ASEAN member countries divided into five scenarios: (1) implementation of the ASEAN Free Trade Area, (2) ASEAN customs union, (3) ASEAN Economic Community, (4) ASEAN common market and (5) fully liberalized ASEAN trade. The welfare gains of ASEAN member countries in (1) implementation of ASEAN free trade area is higher than (2) ASEAN customs union, and the welfare gains of ASEAN member countries in implementation of (3) ASEAN Economic Community is higher than (4) ASEAN common market.
F02|On the Effects of the BRICS on World Economic Growth|The purpose of this empirical study is to examine the potential effects of the BRICS on other economies’ economic growth over the period 1960-2013. This investigation deploys the Saikkonen and Lu ̈tkepohl cointegration methodology to validate long run relations between Brazil and China’s economic growth and other nation’s output growth. The study further uses the Toda and Yamamoto approach to Granger causality to examine long run causal links between the BRICS economic growth. The results show that all countries exhibit long run relations with China and Brazil’s economic growth. In addition, the results prove that Brazil’s economic growth is induced by South Africa, China and India’s economic growth.
F02|Measuring degree of globalization of African Countries on almost equimarginal contribution principle|This paper is an exercise in construction of an alternative globalization index for 43 countries in Africa. It has used a new method for measurement of the degree of globalization (or construction of a globalization index) based on minimization of the Euclidean norm of the Shapley values, the concept borrowed from the cooperative game theory. It assigns weights to constituent variables such that their mean expected marginal contribution to the synthetic index is as equitable as possible. Since this index is based on combinatorial logic, it is also less likely to be affected by outlier data points. Globalization index for 43 African countries (for a time series of 45 years, 1970-2014) has been constructed. The new index has been compared with the KOF index of globalization for the countries under study. As its validation, it has been found that the index has stronger correlation (vis-à-vis the KOF index) with Human Development index, Corruption Perception index, Freedom index and the indicators of abject poverty in the African countries. Viewed as such the new index represents globalization closely in connection with other relevant socio-economic measures than its rival (KOF index of globalization) as well as it is based on more plausible theoretical premises based on marginal contribution rather than correlation.
F02|Trends in globalization of select Asian countries|In this study we have constructed a composite index of globalization of select Asian countries during 1970-2014 by minimizing the Euclidean norm of Shapley values of indicator variables contributing to the overall index. As a consequence, the mean expected marginal contributions of constituent variables to the overall index are approximately equal and thus, the overall composite index represents the constituent variables optimally. We call this index the Almost Equal Marginal Contribution (AEMC) index. We find that AEMC index and the KOF index of globalization are highly correlated (Pearson’s r=0.982). We find that Singapore, Cyprus, Israel, Qatar, Malaysia, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Kuwait, Bahrain and Japan have done very well and scored above 0.7. At the other end, Yemen, Tajikistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Iran, Nepal and Myanmar have scored below 0.5. Trends in globalization are increasing in general, but the rate of globalization, which accelerated after 1991, lost its momentum after 2007. Disparities in globalization, as measured by Gini coefficient over the countries under study, were more or less constant up to 1985 but after that they started declining. We have found that the index of globalization goes well with other socio-economic measures such as Economic Freedom Index, International Innovation Index, Social Progress Index, Human Development Index and Corruption Perception Index, showing high values of Kendall’s Tau and Spearman’s Rho. Its association with Democracy Index is rather weak but positive. It is almost uncorrelated with the Gender Gap Index. We observe, therefore, that globalization index is moving well with the indices of socio-economic condition in the Asian countries.
F02|Towards Regional Monetary Unions through Blockchain Networks|The concept of political and economic integration has not progressed beyond the concept of a Nation-state. The primary reason is the trust deficit among citizens in a supra-national entity. We can use Blockchain systems-which are trustless networks-to resolve this issue. We can float a Regional Cryptocurrency (RCC) which can bring about a successful Regional Monetary Unions (RMU) amongst a group of nations in a transparent manner. This paper deals with the idea of realizing a monetary union through Blockchain networks. Firstly I describe the basics of cryptocurrencies and RSBCs. Then we shall evaluate how RMUs have failed due trust deficit among citizens of members of RMU. We then analyse as to how Blockchain networks can be a solution to these problems. The paper concludes by summarizing the difficulties and solutions regarding successful formation of Regional Monetary Unions.
F02|IBSES: International Bank for Space Exploration and Sciences|The cost of landing man on Mars is estimated to be $500 billion. This kind of investment is difficult for a single nation to achieve. Moreover space exploration involves innumerable aspects of high technical expertise and thus demands sustained international collaboration. Space exploration projects span many years. It calls for uniformity in policies and reliable funding over long periods of time. Due to the high cost and technical skills involved, poor and developing countries cannot afford space programs. To address all of these concerns and other related issues we need to establish an entity which can provide solutions to problems involving various aspects (especially economic) of space exploration. This paper proposes the establishment of such an entity, IBSES: International Bank for Space Exploration and Sciences, and evaluates the various factors that can make this possible.
F02|Mars: Economic Analysis of Constructing Sustainable Open-Air Human Settlements in The Martian Environment|With a high surface radiation, very low and fluctuating temperature and a windy but thin atmosphere, Mars seems an inhospitable place. The dangers on the Martian surface entail that humans stay within indoors habitats on Mars. But it may be possible to build open air settlements on Mars where a direct connection to the Martian atmosphere is feasible. In such a scenario, humans may be able to inhabit Mars with minimal external protection like pressurized suits. For this to happen, humans need to be in atmospheric conditions similar to that on Earth. To achieve these results we need to excavate deep into the Martian crust to depths where air pressures will be sufficient to allow humans to survive without pressurized suits. The paper discusses about the various aspects and economic analysis of such an exercise. The hurdles for implementing this plan are also analyzed. The paper concludes by summarizing the feasibility, benefits and difficulties in undertaking such an activity.
F02|Romanian Attitudes and Perceptions towards the 16+1 Cooperation Platform|The aim of this paper is to analyze Romanian citizens’ attitudes and perceptions towards the 16+1 framework, their determinants and effects. The influencing factors are correlated with the general perception of China and its image, while the effects are seen from the perspectives of the engagement and level of participation in joint initiatives. Recent literature underscores that although this platform offers a range of opportunities in each of the nine pillars of sectoral cooperation, Romania has adopted a passive attitude as regards large-scale projects developed with Chinese partners. Beyond EU specific technical barriers to such projects, the Romanian attitudes towards the 16+1 strongly affected cooperation intensity with China. Positions towards this initiative (opinions from general public, elites, politicians and experts) are identified through three main channels: mass media research, individual interviews and focus groups. The quantitative analysis, combined with qualitative research, emphasizes that in spite of the recognition by some groups of the potential benefits offered by the cooperation in the 16+1 format, reluctance remains. This is not due to China’s assets-liabilities balance or the lack of capacity to understand China, but on both insufficient information on 16+1 and political inertia.
F02|أثر النفقات اللوجستية على نفاذ الصادرات المصرية إلى دول حوض النيل<BR>[The Impact of Logistics Costs on Access of Egyptian Exports to Nile Basin Countries]|"This paper tries to answer the main question ""To what extend logistics cost can affect the market access of Egyptian exports to Nile basin markets?”. The empirical study has been demonstrated using 2005 and 2014 both of exports and logistics costs data from Egypt, in addition to GNP per capita in each trading partner as an indicator for the demand side. The results show that logistics costs have a significant negative relationship with the exports of Egypt to Nile basin countries. Also, there is a positive relationship between GNI per capita in trade partners and Egyptian exports."
F02|The Life-Cycle Dynamics of Exporters and Multinational Firms|This paper studies the life-cycle dynamics of exporters and multinational enterprises (MNEs). We present a dynamic model of trade and MNE activity in which the mode of serving a market depends on the well-known proximity-concentration tradeoff. We show that the option of performing MNE activities in the model produces life-cycle patterns for exporters that differ from those in an export-only model. Calibrating our model to rich firm-level data from France and Norway, our main quantitative finding is that a reduction in trade costs triggers much larger responses in growth rates and exit rates, for young exporters, in the model with MNEs than in the model without MNEs. We also show that the model is largely consistent with a set of new facts on the joint life-cycle dynamic behavior of exporters and MNEs.
F02|How do ideas shape national preferences? The Financial Transaction Tax in Ireland|European countries have been required to formulate a national preference in relation to the EU Financial Transaction Tax. The two leading approaches to explaining how the financial sector makes its views felt in the political process – the structural power of the financial services sector based on potential disinvestment, and its instrumental power arising from direct political lobbying – fall short of providing a comprehensive account. The missing link is how and why policy-makers might be willing to adopt the priorities of key sectors of the financial services industry. We outline how two levels of ideational power might be at work in shaping outcomes, using Ireland as a case study. We argue firstly that background systems of shared knowledge that are institutionalized in policy networks generated broad ideational convergence between the financial sector and policymakers over the priorities of industrial policy in general. Secondly, and against that backdrop, debate over specific policy choices can leave room for a wider range of disagreement and indeed political and ideational contestation. Irish policymakers proved responsive to industry interests in the case of the FTT, but not for the reasons normally given. This work seeks to link literatures in two fields of inquiry. It poses questions for liberal intergovernmentalism in suggesting that the translation of structurally grounded material interests into national policy preferences is far from automatic, and argues that this is mediated by ideational considerations that are often under-estimated. It also contributes to our understanding of how constructivist explanations of policy outcomes work in practice, through a detailed case study of how material and ideational interests interact.
F02|Trade Agreements, Regulatory Sovereignty and Democratic Legitimacy|Governments increasingly are seeking to use bilateral and regional trade agreements to reduce the cost-increasing effects of differences in product market regulation. They also pursue regulatory cooperation independent of trade agreements. It is important to understand what is being done through bilateral or plurilateral mechanisms to address regulatory differences, and to identify what, if any, role trade agreements can play in supporting international regulatory cooperation. This paper reflects on experience to date in regulatory cooperation and the provisions of recent trade agreements involving advanced economies that have included regulatory cooperation. We argue for a re-thinking by trade officials of the modalities and design of trade negotiations and the incorporation of institutional mechanisms that draw on insights of experimentalist governance approaches to enhance the scope for international regulatory cooperation.
F02|Inter-Regional Migration In Cz And Sk: The Empirical Study Of Panel Data At Nuts3 Level|The aim of this paper is to define the relationship between migration, income, and unemployment rates, and therefore estimate these relationships using vector autoregression and the Granger causality test. This study focused on inter-regional migration at NUTS3 level in the Czech and Slovak Republics. The analysed period is from the year 2004 to 2013, and the final panel data is set for one variable, and therefore contains a total of 220 observations. According to the results, the regional migration in the Czech and Slovak Republics was determined by income differences and it is in accordance with the neoclassical theory. The causal relation was not confirmed for differences in unemployment rate. The changes of income and unemployment rates in the Czech Republic and Slovakia were not caused by migration. These results do not support conclusions of the neoclassical model of migration.
F02|The Inclusion Of Natural Resource Wealth In The Index Of Economic Well-Being: Results For OECD Countries, 1980-2013|This report presents augmented estimates of the Index of Economic Well-being (IEWB) for 14 OECD countries for the 1980-2013 period
F02|The European Trust Crisis and the Rise of Populism|We study the implications of the Great Recession for voting for antiestablishment parties, as well as for general trust and political attitudes, using regional data across Europe. We find a strong relationship between increases in unemployment and voting for nonmainstream parties, especially populist ones. Moreover, unemployment increases in tandem with declining trust toward national and European political institutions, though we find only weak or no effects of unemployment on interpersonal trust. The correlation between unemployment and attitudes toward immigrants is muted, especially for their cultural impact. To explore causality, we extract the component of increases in unemployment explained by the precrisis structure of the economy, in particular the share of construction in regional value added, which is strongly related both to the buildup preceding and the bursting of the crisis. Our results imply that crisis-driven economic insecurity is a substantial determinant of populism and political distrust.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F02|Balance sheet strength and the bank-lending channel: evidence from an emerging market|The bank lending channel view of monetary policy argues that bank loan supply should fall during periods of tight monetary policy. Employing a sample of over 122 Indian commercial banks for the period between 2005-17, we investigate the role of cross-sectional heterogeneity in bank balance sheet strength in the effectiveness of bank lending channel. We show that both small and large banks with liquid balance sheets are able to maintain their supply of loans during periods of tight monetary policy. Furthermore, we find that higher capital ratios can also enable banks to maintain their loan supply, in particular among smaller financial institutions. The mechanism at play is a time deposits insulation channel, whereby banks with strong balance sheets can raise time deposits during periods of contractionary monetary policy.

F02|From planning to policy: Half a century of the CDP|The United Nations Committee for Development Policy (CDP) comprises 24 independent specialists from a variety of disciplines. It advises the UN Economic and Social Council on emerging economic, social and environmental issues relevant to sustainable development and international co-operation. The paper argues that since its launch in 1965 the CDP has at times struggled to make an impact, but that it has been most effective when it has been at its most creative and when it has broken with convention. It helped put into practice the target that developed countries should devote 0.7% of their gross national income to official development assistance. The Committee created the least developed countries category and continues to monitor and update membership of the group. Its members were prominent in the genesis of the human development approach and continue to conduct new work in the areas of governance, productive capacity and sustainable development.
F02|Challenged by Migration: Europe’s Options|This paper examines the migration and labor mobility in the European Union and elaborates on their importance for the existence of the EU. Against all measures of success, the current public debate seems to suggest that the political consensus that migration is beneficial is broken. This comes with a crisis of European institutions in general. Migration and labor mobility have not been at the origin of the perceived cultural shift. The EU in its current form and ambition could perfectly survive or collapse even if it solves its migration challenge. But it will most likely collapse, if it fails to solve the mobility issue by not preserving free internal labor mobility and not establishing a joint external migration policy.
F02|One Belt One Road and the reconfiguration of China-EU relations|The context of EU-China relations has dramatically changed over the past five years. China’s interest in Europe has expanded geographically and substantially. At the broader diplomatic and strategic level, the OBOR initiative has come to symbolize China’s growing significance in international affairs, reshaping regional dynamics. The European Commission and the Chinese government have agreed to enhance synergies in connectivity platforms. However, new investment trends and trade relations with China are highly differentiated across Europe and across sectors. The lack of a clearly defined OBOR plan in most European countries is weakening their bargaining power. In the meantime, China is following its flexible foreign policy approach when dealing with the EU. So far, the OBOR projects in Europe are mainly focusing on transport and infrastructure in Central, Eastern and Southern Europe. We are witnessing the reconfiguration of international institutions and the emergence of a more multi-polar global order.
F02|New Zealand and Indian Trade in Agricultural and Manufactured Products: An Empirical Analysis|This study examines and presents a model of manufactured and agricultural exports from New Zealand to India and the world and from India to New Zealand. Our findings show that a country’s population, GDP, GDP per capita and exchange rate are important causal factors that influence both New Zealand’s and India’s agricultural and manufactured exports. Our findings also demonstrate that New Zealand agricultural exports are highly elastic with respect to average population, showing that a one percent increase in the average population/or market size can increase New Zealand agricultural exports to India by six percent. This is contrary to the conventional wisdom about low elasticity pessimism with respect to agricultural products. These results have policy implications in the context of trade negotiations between New Zealand and India at the bilateral level and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in which both New Zealand and India are participating.
F02|Do Bilateral Investment Treaties Attract Foreign Direct Investment? The Role of International Dispute Settlement Provisions|This paper studies the effect of the strength of Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) on FDI activity. We develop an index for the strength of international dispute settlement provisions included in BITs in order to examine the role the content of BITs plays in attracting FDI. To this end we make use of data from the UNCTAD’s International Investment Agreement Mapping Project and measure the provision strength of 1,676 BITs. Using panel data of bilateral and total inward FDI flows and stocks we study the effect of BITs on FDI. Our main finding indicates that stronger international dispute settlement provisions in BITs are indeed associated with positive effects on FDI activity.
F02|Wedges: Distribution, Distortions, and Market Integration|This paper proposes a stylized model of policy determination and imperfect international integration. A country-specific policy wedge corrects labor market imperfections and/or redistributes welfare across differently wealthy agents. Capital market integration with the rest of the world, indexed by another wedge, shapes the politico-economic equilibrium policy through race-to-the-bottom and beggar-thy-neighbor channels. The policy and welfare implications of tighter international integration depend in sharp and empirically realistic ways on country-specific political and structural features.
F02|The making of a national currency. Spatial transaction costs and money market integration in Spain (1825-1874)|This article analyses the integration of the Spanish money market in the 19th century. We use a Band-TAR model of prices in Madrid of bills of exchange on 9 Spanish cities to measure convergence and efficiency in the market between 1825 and 1875. While price gaps between cities were significantly reduced during the period, no progress took place in efficiency. We suggest that increasing convergence was associated to the reduction in transaction costs, which started before the railways through improvements in roads and postal services. By contrast, increases in efficiency were prevented by a very restrictive regulation of arbitrage.
F02|Value Added in Motion: Modelling World Trade Patterns at the 2035 Horizon|We address in this paper the future geography of production, migration and energy at the world level, and the consequences for the largest European countries. We take scant account of the wide range of possible evolutions of the world economy in terms of technological progress and diffusion, education, demography including migrations and finally energy price and efficiency. Taking a 2035 horizon, we examine how world trade patterns will be shaped by the changing comparative advantages, demand, and capabilities of different regions, and what will be the implications in terms of location of value added at the sector and country level. We combine a convergence model fitting three production factors (capital, labour and energy) and two factor-specific productivities, alongside a dynamic CGE model of the world economy calibrated to reproduce observed elasticity of trade to income. Each scenario involves three steps. First, we project growth at country level based on factor accumulation, demography and migration, educational attainment and efficiency gains, and discuss uncertainties related to our main drivers. Second, we impose this framework on the CGE baseline. Third, we implement trade policy scenarios (tariffs as well as non-tariff measures in goods and services), in order to get factor allocation across sectors from the model as well as demand and trade patterns.
F02|Value Added in Motion: Macroeconomic Implications of Energy Price Trajectories|Taking a 2035 horizon, we examine how world energy consumption and emission patterns will be shaped by the changing demand and technological capabilities of different regions. We combine a convergence model fitting three production factors (capital, labour and energy) and two factor-specific productivities, along with a dynamic CGE model of the world economy. We consider three possible â€œworldsâ€ with very different energy scarcity, and how Copenhagen pledges change economic agentsâ€™ calculus in each of these three situations. We find that the most dramatic changes in terms of location of value added are to be expected from the intrinsic differences among the three considered â€œworldsâ€ , not so much in terms of economic impact of environmental pledges.
F02|Chinaâ€“Australia Economic Cooperation and the Belt and Road Initiative|Chinaâ€™s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) relates to the overarching agenda for cooperation between Australia and China based on their shared interest in an open global economic system and reforms that promote the effectiveness of participation in the international market. These interests should guide the approach to regional and global cooperation. The BRI offers a framework for deepening cooperation through a process of open regionalism that promotes : policy cooperation on economic issues of importance to both countries; the exploration of priorities for investment to enhance connectivity; trade and direct investment; the deepening of financial links; and the expansion of people-to-people exchanges.
F02|Home sweet home: the home bias in trade in the European Union|This study examines the home bias in trade in goods and services within the European Union. Using the newest release of the World Input Output database, available for the years 2000-2014, the effect is estimated using gravity regressions. The trade-reducing effect of borders is found to be sizeable. It is greater for trade in services than for goods, though the former declined more markedly throughout the period. The paper extends current literature by demonstrating and analysing the variation in the bias across Europe. The border effect is larger in Central and Eastern Europe than in other parts of the continent. The differences in the effect can be largely explained by the depth of a country’s integration with the European Union. The number of years passed since a country joined the EU has a signiﬁcant impact on the bias. The longer a country has been in the EU, the lower its home bias, with the ﬁrst years of membership having the largest (in absolute terms) effect. JEL Classification: F02, F15, F14
F02|The Impact of Macroeconomic, Oil Prices and Socio-economic Factors on Exchange Rate in Pakistan: An Auto Regressive Distributed Lag Approach|The study examines the linkages among the nominal exchange rate, oil prices, terrorism and three selected macroeconomic variables: Real growth rate, inflation rate and interest rate. The paper employed auto regressive distributed lag to test the long run and short run dynamics over the period 1980-2015 in the context of Pakistan. A novel technique to this research is that we demarcate the relationship among macroeconomic variables, financial variable and socio-economic variable. The findings of the research depict a robust long run relationship among variables. Furthermore, the results showed that the adjustment process is slow and short run adjustment indicating that the discrepancies adjust completely in the same period. Hence, the efficient monetary and fiscal policy should keep into consideration before devising policies that have a greater influence on the variability of exchange rate.
F02|The impact of unsuccessful pirate attacks on financial markets: Evidence in support of Leeson's reputation-building theory|This paper examines the effect of unsuccessful Somali pirate attacks on financial-market returns in the Arabian Peninsula. Specifically, it tests Leeson's (2010a) reputation-building theory of pirate signaling behavior postulating that unsuccessful pirate attacks may trigger subsequent future attacks by pirates as pirates attempt to maintain and build their reputation for effective piracy. We test this theory empirically by studying the relationship between pirate attacks and financial-market returns in the Arabian Peninsula. The result of our empirical test supports Leeson's theory: unsuccessful pirate attacks are associated with lower financial-market returns, suggesting that market participants expect unsuccessful pirate attacks to be followed by future pirate attacks.
F02|Does patriotic vigilance make any sense in the transnational arena? A cosmopolitan alternative to the globalization paradox|We address the issue of the relevance in the transnational arena of the concept of patriotic vigilance, as expressed by French Minister Arnaud Montebourg in 2014. Firstly, we examine the globalization paradox with its underpinnings in the literature and its illustration through the recent Alstom saga. Secondly, we review the idea of a paradigm shift in world monetary affairs signaled by the recent crisis. Finally, drawing on Kant’s ideas on cosmopolitism, we sketch out an alternative to the globalization paradox.
F02|Mind the Gap: Analyzing the Impact of Data Gap in Millennium Development Goals’ (MDGs) Indicators on the Progress toward MDGs|This paper analyzes the impact of data gap in Millennium Development Goals’ (MDGs) performance indicators on actual performance success of MDGs. Performance success, within the MDG framework, is quantified using six different ways proposed in the existing literature, including both absolute and relative performance and deviation from historical transition paths of MDG indicators. The empirical analysis clearly shows that the data gap in performance measurement is a significant predictor of poor MDG performance in terms of any of the six progress measures. Larger the data gap or weaker the performance measurement system, lesser is the probability of MDG performance success. The empirical methodology used in the paper combines a Heckman correction and instrumental variable estimation strategies to simultaneously account for potential endogeneity of the key data gap variable and bias due to sample selection. This result holds true even after controlling for overall national statistical capacity and a variety of socioeconomic factors. The paper underlines the need to strengthen the performance measurement system attached to the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the associated Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This paper is the first attempt at empirically evaluating the value of data in the context of international development goals and gives empirical evidence for the need to harness the “data revolution” for sustainable development.

Regional economic development has been long conceptualized as a non-linear, interactive and socially embedded process: these features were traditionally regarded as spatially mediated and highly localized. However, unprecedentedly fast technological change coupled with the intensification of global economic integration has spurred the need to place regional development in a truly open and interdependent framework. Despite substantial progress in the academic literature, rethinking regional development in this perspective still presents a number of challenges in terms of concepts, empirical evidence and policy approaches. Following an interdisciplinary assessment of how openness and connectivity – proxied by one of the many cross-border flows, i.e., global investments – interact with regional economic development trajectories, this paper presents a picture of the geography of foreign investments from and to the European regions and its change after the financial and economic crisis in 2008. This simple exercise sheds some initial light on how the operationalization of regional connectivity can improve one’s empirical understanding of the evolution of regional economies and the policy approach needed to support their reaction to change.
F02|Bhaduriâ€“Marglin meet Kaldorâ€“Marx: wages, productivity and investment|Higher real wages provide macroeconomic benefits in terms of increased demand if the economy is wage-led (as in most European economies) and of higher labour productivity growth and more rapid technological progress. Taking these benefits into account, we show that a wage-led economy becomes less strongly wage-led. The impact of higher real wage growth on employment growth becomes ambiguous. But for model parameter values which are realistic for the wage-led eurozone, higher real wages reduce employment growth. Contrariwise, real wage restraint in a weakly wage-led economy generates jobs â€“ as recent European experience underscores. This internal contradiction in wage-led economies can be overcome if a high wage regime is complemented by supportive fiscal and monetary policies.
F02|Will the 21st Century Be an Asian Century?: A Global Perspective|This paper discusses the issue of whether the 21st century will be an “Asian century.” According to a study commissioned by the Asian Development Bank, Asia 2050: Realizing the Asian Century, Asian countries will keep growing and eventually account for more than half of global GDP by 2050. The study, however, cautions that developing Asia may fall into the “middle-income trap” where growth stagnates due to the lack of productivity growth. This paper provides baseline projections for the world economy up to 2050 and argues that the “Asian century” scenario may be interpreted as one of the high growth cases for the model, and Asia may face the risk of stagnation due to the middle-income trap and/or “Asian conflict” resulting from political, security, and military tensions in Asia. The paper argues that in order to realise an “Asian century,” developing Asia needs to focus on technological progress, inclusive growth, environmental sustainability, institutional and governance quality, and regional cooperation and integration. It also points to possible global governance structures which are alternatives to an Asia-centric world, such as those of a “China century,” “American century 2.0,” “G-2,” “G-0,” and a “multi-polar” world. As the two major powers in this region, China and Japan need to cooperate with each other to maintain regional peace and security, and help realise the “Asian century.” The paper concludes that even when the “Asian century” arrives and Asia dominates the world in terms of economic size, it does not necessarily mean that Asia will dominate the world politically, institutionally, militarily, or in soft power. The 21st century will likely be a “multi-polar” world where the traditional powers of the West (the United States and European Union countries), Japan, and new rising powers (China, India, and other major emerging economies) collectively manage global economic and political affairs.
F02|New Scenarios of Joint Crises Fighting in Socio-Economic Sphere of Russia and Greece|The purpose of the article is to verify this hypothesis and to determine the newest scenarios of joint overcoming of crises in socio-economic sphere of Russia and Greece. The work uses the method of statistical analysis, with the help of which the authors study the dynamics of socio-economic development of Russia and Greece in 2008-2014 and determine common tendencies and regularities. As a result of the research, the authors found out that Russia and Greece are peculiar for common socio-economic problems which cause similar crises, which leads to expedience of unification of efforts of both countries for their joint effective solution. This research distinguishes three most perspective directions of fighting crises in socio-economic sphere and offers three possible scenarios of joint crisis fighting in socio-economic sphere of Russia and Greece: innovations-oriented, business-oriented, and institution-oriented scenario, with development of the authors’ concept of joint crises fighting in socio-economic sphere of Russia and Greece.
F02|Financial Integration and Valuation Effects: Globalisation or Americanization?|"The paper studies the international financial integration of the G20 economies, including the underlying valuation effects. We find that international financial integration is a salient phenomenon across advanced economies, dominated by the US as the historical financial hegemon. Furthermore, we identify positive valuation effects across advanced economies, at times as large as 75% of their cumulative GDP. After the crisis, these effects have been mainly the result of large positive valuations on the US stock of foreign liabilities driven both by structural as well as cyclical factors of the US economy. Our analysis also suggests that the international financial integration may not be as ""global"" as perceived, but a limited number of advanced economies hold the greater amount of external assets and liabilities, and thus, are most exposed to the identified valuation effects in the US. In this context, a balanced policy mix in the US, aimed at lifting productivity and potential growth, could strengthen the contribution of the structural drivers to the US valuation effects, therefore minising the likelihood and potential impact of any cyclical corrections."
F02|Externalities, Institutions and Public Perception: The Political Economy of European Integration Revisited|This paper develops a politico-economic model of the joint dynamics of economic interaction and political integration. Based on the theoretical model, we derive several hypotheses on how to explain the recently observable decline in popular support for European integration. These hypotheses are matched with data from various sources in order to scrutinize their empirical validity. The paper proposes a five pillar approach to prevent a counterproductive process of disintegration. Accordingly, (i) common policies must better fit voter preferences, reduce inequality and unemployment, (ii) policy processes must become more efficient, (iii) institutions must enable voters to properly attribute policy outcomes to political actors, (iv) policies should foster cross border political debates, and (v) any further deepening or enlargement of the Union should be based on European wide popular support. We discuss a series of specific policy measures that help to achieve these goals.
F02|Finance and income inequality: A review and new evidence|Using a panel fixed effects model for a sample of 121 countries covering 1975–2005, we examine how financial development, financial liberalization and banking crises are related to income inequality. In contrast with most previous work, our results suggest that all finance variables increase income inequality. The level of financial development conditions the impact of financial liberalization on inequality. Also the quality of political institutions conditions the impact of financial liberalization on income inequality, in contrast to the quality of economic institutions. Our main findings are robust for using random effects, cross-country regressions and legal origin as instrument for financial development.
F02|International Agreements And Trade In Agricultural Produce Between The European Union And Israel-Palestine|This article analyses international law, international agreements and EU legislation pertaining to the process of agricultural production on the West Bank and its subsequent export to the European Union (EU). First, we shall analyse the peculiarities of economic relations in the agricultural sector in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with particular attention to the production of Israeli settlements on the West Bank. Subsequently, the study deals with the conditions governing agricultural production and its export to the European Union. Both processes are marked by the existence of Israeli agricultural settlements on the West Bank as well as by a loose interpretation of the Agreements signed with the European Union. We continue by assessing observance (or otherwise) of international law, bilateral agreements and Community law throughout the production chain in the agricultural sector in Palestine. The study concludes with a number of conclusions.
F02|Comparative Analysis of Human Development in Kazakhstan and other Eurasian Economic Union Countries|In this paper, we consider issues of human development in Kazakhstan and in the states of the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU). The article analyzes the differences in achievements between EEU states on the human development index (life expectancy, gross domestic product per capita, education level) and the income and standard of living (average size of salaries, pensions, minimum subsistence level, GINI coefficient and other indicators). The author noted the similarity of many problems in the field of human development, which should be taken into account in each EEU member state, and the level of integration association
F02|Understanding China's Belt & Road Initiative: Motivation, framework and assessment|The Belt & Road Initiative is China's greatest international economic ambition, aiming at stimulating economic development in a vast region covering sub regions in Asia, Europe and Africa, which accounts for 64% of world population and 30% of world GDP. The Initiative is devised to reconfigure China's external sector in order to continue its strong growth. While infrastructure development plays a central role, the Belt & Road Initiative is a comprehensive one, including also policy dialogue, unimpeded trade, financial support and people-to-people exchange. It is too early to assess the impact of this ambitious Initiative. It certainly has the potential of turning the underdeveloped “Belt & Road” region into a new vibrant economic pillar and contributing to economic policy thinking by incorporating successful experiences of emerging market economies. However, the Initiative also faces very high barriers, including lack of central coordination mechanism, potential clash of different political regimes and beliefs and financial viability of cross-border projects.
F02|How does the sensitivity of consumption to income vary over time? International evidence|This paper studies how the sensitivity of consumption to income has changed over time as the degree of financial integration has risen. In standard theory, greater financial integration facilitates international borrowing and lending, helping to reduce the sensitivity of consumption growth to fluctuations in income. We examine the empirical validity of this prediction using an array of indicators of financial integration for a large sample of advanced and developing countries over the period 1960–2011. We report two main results. First, the sensitivity of consumption to income has declined over time as the degree of financial integration has risen. The decline has been more pronounced in advanced economies than in developing ones. Second, our regression analysis indicates that a higher degree of financial integration is associated with a lower sensitivity of consumption to income. This finding is robust to the use of a wide range of empirical specifications, country-specific characteristics and other controls, such as interest rates and outcome-based measures of financial integration. We also discuss other potential sources of the temporal changes in the sensitivity of consumption to income.
F02|Core and Periphery in the European Monetary Union: Bayoumi and Eichengreen 25 years later|Bayoumi and Eichengreen (1993) establish a EMU core–periphery pattern using 1963–1988 data. We use same methodology, sample, window length (1989–2015), and a novel over-identifying restriction test to ask whether the EMU strengthened or weakened the core–periphery pattern. Our results suggest the latter.
F02|The internationalisation of the RMB: New starts, jumps and tipping points|We investigate the process of currency internationalisation of the Chinese Renminbi (RMB). Aggregated cross-border data provided by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) allows better measurement of the role played by a currency in trade and settlement. RMB transactions are significant and increasing but remain concentrated in key financial centres. Analysis using an asset pricing framework shows that the footprint of Chinese corporations in international markets has at times been significant, with the size of these transactions prompting many to reassess the likely pace of RMB internationalisation and its usage as an alternate vehicle currency.
F02|Financial and real sector returns, IMF-related news, and the Asian crisis|We investigate how investors trading in financial and real sectors of a stock market react to IMF announcements during abnormal times, such as a financial crisis. To do so, we examine the impact of IMF-program and negotiation news on financial and real stock sectors in Indonesia, Korea and Thailand during the Asian crisis using time-varying models. The results indicate that IMF actions affect sector returns differently suggesting different wealth effects of IMF programs on investor wealth.
F02|Benchmarking macroprudential policies: An initial assessment|In recognition of the severe consequences of the recent international financial crisis, the topic of macroprudential policy has elicited considerable research effort. The present study constructs, for 46 economies around the globe, an index of the capacity to deploy macroprudential policies. Building on elements that have been the subject of recent research, we develop an index that aims to represent the essence of what constitutes a macroprudential regime. Specifically, the index quantifies: (1) how existing macroprudential frameworks are organized; and (2) how far a particular jurisdiction is from reaching the goals established by the Group of Twenty (G20) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The latter is a benchmark that has not been considered in the burgeoning literature that seeks to quantify the role of macroprudential policies.
F02|Determining global currency bloc equilibria: An empirical strategy based on estimates of anchor currency choice|The study presents an empirical strategy for determining global currency bloc equilibria. The procedure includes, first, a nested logit estimation of the combined determinants of currency regime and anchor currency choice; second, a test for a welfare-maximizing regime decision, in which estimates of the relative welfare of alternative regimes are inferred from the results of the first step estimation; and third, taking the path dependency of regime choice into account, a currency bloc equilibrium is derived. In equilibrium, the dollar bloc is somewhat smaller and the euro bloc larger than at present. Counterfactual exercises assess among others the potential for a renminbi bloc.
F02|Globalization and inflation: A threshold investigation|We use a threshold methodology to investigate the importance of non-linear effects in the analysis of the inflation globalization hypothesis. Accounting for potential non-linearities in the Phillips Curve, we show that trade openness is not rejected as a threshold variable for the effects of domestic and foreign slack on inflation in many advanced economies, and we find a switch of the output gap slopes from one regime to the other that is consistent with the key predictions of the inflation globalization hypothesis. For some countries the threshold Phillips Curve model also leads to improvements in out-of-sample forecast over the linear Phillips models, especially at longer horizons. Contrary to most of the previous literature which ignores such non-linearities, our new approach provides some interesting empirical evidence supportive of the effect globalization has on a country’s inflation dynamics.
F02|The macroeconomic effects of public investment: Evidence from advanced economies|This paper provides new evidence of the macroeconomic effects of public investment in advanced economies. Using public investment forecast errors to identify the causal effect of government investment as well as model simulations, the paper finds that increased public investment raises output, both in the short term and in the long term, crowds in private investment, and reduces unemployment. Several factors shape the macroeconomic effects of public investment. When there is economic slack and monetary accommodation, demand effects are stronger, and the public-debt-to-GDP ratio may actually decline. Public investment is also more effective in boosting output in countries with higher public investment efficiency and when it is financed by issuing debt.
F02|Immigration into the EU: Possible macroeconomic implications|EU is facing an unprecedented influx of migrants, with around 1.2 million asylum applications expected in 2015, compared to the 550,000 applications received in 2014. This influx mirrors global development. According to UNHCR, displacement from wars, conflict, and persecution worldwide is at the highest levels ever recorded, and it is accelerating fast, reaching 60 million people in 2014. This paper estimates the possible macroeconomic impact of the larger-than-usual migration flows to the EU in the short- to medium term. Our estimates suggest that likely the impact is set to differ across EU countries that are not all directly affected. For the time being the economic impact of the immigration wave will be limited. Except for the frontline countries as well as Austria, Germany and Sweden, most EU countries face negligible macroeconomic impacts. Following upfront costs, likely the impact of migration will be positive, although likely will be modest in size, for growth and public finances. For example, in Germany an increase in public spending means a slight stimulus of about 0.2% to GDP in 2015. The medium-term impact could be more pronounced, especially given rapidly ageing workforce in many EU countries. However, noteworthy supply-side effects will only emerge to the extent that countries are able to integrate the newcomers into the labour market and will also crucially depend on the characteristics of the migrants.
F02|International monetary policy with commodity buffer stocks|This proposal argues in favor of commodity price stabilization via international commodity buffer stocks and the tying of these stocks to the creation of a new international reserve currency. Financing commodity buffer stocks through the issuance of an international reserve makes commodity price stabilization financially viable and offers a countercyclical issuance of international reserves to fight global deflation. Both measures address the volatility of commodity prices due to a lack of private sector storage and macroeconomic demand factors. This proposal urges the reader to look back to the global Keynesian policies of the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s for inspiration in solving today's commodity price instability and secular stagnation.
F02|COP 21 and Economic Theory: Taking Stock|The texts of the COP?21?Decision and its Annex are scrutinized from the particular point of view of the extent to which economic theoretic concepts can be considered to inspire them. While this is shown to be partially the case in some of the intentions, the texts themselves contain more diplomatically formulated promises than effective implementation of relevant mainstream well established economic concepts.
F02|A Critical Assessment Of The Eu Monetary, Fiscal And Financial Regulatory Framework And A Reform Proposal|Europe is at a critical crossroads for the evolution of its overall political and institutional design. Its founding goal, the creation of the internal single market, is consistent neither with the existing setup, nor with the direction recently impressed to that evolution. The inconsistency between the fiscal, monetary and financial regulatory framework and the construction of the single market cannot be solved by reforming the EU treaties simply because there is no agreement on the new design. Following Minsky’s analysis, we single out the weaknesses and fragilities of that framework when the heterogeneous reality of the EU is taken into account. While constraints on fiscal and monetary reforms derive from the existing treaties, for financial regulation they come from mixing the international approach, which makes financial stability dependent on the financial morphology freely determined by financial markets, with the belief that the EU integration will come from the operation of private interests. We show that the current approach to financial regulation fails on both regards. Complying with the existing EU treaties, we propose a reform of ECB operations that would create the single financial market, at least for the euro area, and allow a reform of the existing fiscal rules capable of converting the current deflationary stance into a reflationary one. To complete the strengthening of the systemic cushions of safety, following the Minskyan approach a radical reform of financial regulation is presented that would combine higher financial resilience with finance more closely serving national economies. The three reforms would critically contribute to the consistency of the euro area design and make its membership attractive for the non-euro EU countries that currently strongly oppose entering into it, at least for those that do not want to go on playing the inshore-offshore game.
F02|The experience of financial markets reforms in the countries – competitors of Russia in the global capital market|This paper examines the experience of successful reforms of the financial markets in countries that are rivals Russia in the global financial market. We study the main directions of these reforms, the results are evaluated. Success factors of the financial market development programs (or the formation of an international financial center programs) compared to Russian conditions to implement similar strategies.
F02|A step further in the theory of regional integration: A look at the Unasur's integration strategy|Although economic literature about regional integration is substantial, its definition remains controversial. For instance, it is common nowadays for the terms regional integration and regional economic integration to be used interchangeably in spite of the importance accorded by literature to non-economic factors of integration, particularly to political ones. Inspired on the South American integration project, this paper revisits the theory of regional integration and proposes a novel approach for evaluating regional integration initiatives that include not only political but also physical aspects. More specifically, this article proposes to analyze any regional integration project from three complementary angles: economic integration, political integration, and physical integration. Moreover, it argues that political and physical integration constitute a preliminary, or contemporaneous, step toward economic integration, and not a final stage, as the current debate suggest. In other words, it is argued that a zero-stage in (Balassa, 1961)'s theory of economic integration is needed to enable the long-term sustainability of a regional bloc.
F02|Simulating World Trade in the Decades Ahead: Driving Forces and Policy Implications|The geography and composition of international trade are changing fast. We link a macroeconomic growth model and sectoral CGE framework in order to project the world economy forward to the year 2035 and assess to what extent current trends in trade are expected to continue. Constructing fully traceable scenarios based on assumptions grounded in the literature, we are also able to isolate the relative impact of key economic drivers. We find that the stakes for developing countries are particularly high: The emergence of new players in the world economy, intensification of South-South trade and diversification into skill-intensive activities may continue only in a dynamic economic and open trade environment. Current trends towards increased regionalization may be reversed, with multilateral trade relationships gaining in importance. Hypothetical mega-regionals could slow down, but not frustrate the prevalence of multilateralism. Continuing technological progress is likely to have the biggest impact on future economic developments around the globe. Population dynamics are influential as well: For some countries, up-skilling will be crucial, for others labour shortages may be addressed through migration. Several developing countries would benefit from increased capital mobility; others will only diversify into dynamic sectors, when trade costs are further reduced.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F02|Economic diplomacy: The “one–China policy” effect on trade|Chinese foreign policy is mainly characterized by the Beijing consensus and the one-China principle in international relations. More precisely, the situation faced by Taiwan is a “core interest” in China's economic diplomacy strategy. We investigate whether the “one-China policy” (OCP) has had visible effects on bilateral trade flows. In other words, does the compliance of diplomatic commitments with China undermine Taiwanese trade and enhance China's trade position? Using a structural gravity model based on worldwide panel data for the period 1948–2012, we approximate the OCP through two dummy variables: the vote by countries of the UN resolution about China's recognition in 1971 and the existence of diplomatic ties with China. The first component of the OCP drastically increased on average in trade flows with China regardless of the vote of trading partners concerning this UN resolution as well as that for Taiwan. On average, results suggest that diplomatic relations with China improve bilateral trade flows for China, but a trade-deteriorating effect appears for Taiwan with certain ex-colonies. We also find that the effects of these economic diplomacy components confirm previous results reported for the period studied.

F02|Globalisation and inequality: A dynamic general equilib- rium model of unequal exchange|A dynamic general equilibrium model that generalises Roemer's [23] economy with a global capital market is analysed. An axiomatic analysis of the concept of unequal exchange (UE) between countries is developed at general dynamic equilibria. The class of UE definitions that satisfy three fundamental properties - including a correspondence between wealth, class and UE exploitation status - is completely characterised. It is shown that this class is nonempty and a definition of UE exploitation between countries is proposed, which is theoretically robust and firmly anchored to empirically observable data. The full class and UE exploitation structure of the international economy is derived in equilibrium.
F02|Exchange Rate And Determinants Of Exports In Periods Of Financial Volatility In The North America Free Trade Agreement Zone,Tipo De Cambio Y Determinantes De Las Exportaciones En Periodos De Volatilidad Financiera En La Zona Del Tratado De Libre Comercio De Norteamerica|Ever since the implementation of the North America Free Trade Agreement or NAFTA, the nations that comprise it have experienced adverse economic and financial shocks. Starting with the 2008 financial crisis, there is an observable increase in the volatility of the real exchange rate in several nations, followed by an increasing amount of literature regarding the role of depreciation as a source of export competitiveness. The objective of this non-experimental, quantitative, descriptive and correlational research focuses on a methodological approximation to assess whether there is a statistically meaningful relationship between exchange rate and other variables that could affect the exports of NAFTA member countries, for which a GARCH (p, q) model is used. The results suggest that the real exchange rate of the Chinese Yuan, the income of the US and Chinese imports made by the region are the variables that best explain the behavior of exports of NAFTA members.
F02|The Impact Of The Real Exchange Rate And Other Macroeconomic And Microeconomic Variables On The Competitiveness Of Mexican Manufacturing Exports, El Impacto Del Tipo De Cambio Real Y Otras Variables Macro Y Micro En La Competitividad De Las Exportaciones Manufactureras Mexicanas|The competitiveness of Mexican manufacturing exports plays a leading role, as the bridge to reach prosperity and economic growth. This work examines the impact of the real exchange rate and other macro and microeconomic variables on competitiveness. We use a model of multivariate regression, where the values of the variables are contrasted with international competitiveness indices provided by the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness (IMCO). The results suggest that the real exchange rate is not a significant element that affects the competitiveness of manufactured exports. However, economic activity of the country is highly dependent on the US economy. This gives motivation to promote policies to diversify markets, increase productivity and consummate recently adopted structural reforms to improve economic growth
F02|Some Aspects Regarding Romanian Exports Competitiveness, in the Period 2001-2014|The paper presents another metrics of Romaniaâ€™s export competitiveness, based on the evolution of international export rankings (positions) of our country, in the period 2001-2014, according to SITC (2 digits).We consider that increasing or decreasing number of won or lost positions in the world positions rankings by Romanian exports in the world hierarchy can indicate respectively an increase or decrease in competitiveness. The change of Romania's position in the hierarchy worldâ€™s exports by countries in 2006, 2010 and 2014, as compared to 2001, constitutes a sui generis indicator of its export competitiveness, according to the number of positions (ranks) won/lost in the framework of export world ranking. If Romania climbs in the world export hierarchy we consider an improvement of export competitiveness. Conversely, a loss of positions in the hierarchy means a diminishing in the competitive strength of exports. This indicator provides a new means to assess the investment of a country, for a specific category of exported goods in the world market, has improved/worsened its competitive position, surpassing or, on the contrary, remaining behind some other competitors. The main conclusion is that the number of win ranks in the analysed period was much higher than that of lost positions in Romania, respectively 68 positions gained as compared with 28 lost positions. This conclusion is corroborated with the economic, social, environmental, technological importance and share of each SITC export group.
F02|Economic And Geostrategic Implications Of The Last G20 Summit|The article analyzes the results of the 11th G20 summit under China’s presidency against the backdrop of the far-reaching transformations in the world economy. All participants have shown their determination to chart the course for global economic recovery and give a new impetus to the world economy, to improve global economic and financial governance, and revitalize international trade and investment, the two engines of economic growth, as well as to achieve an open world economy and promote interconnected and inclusive development, with benefits to the whole world. The main conclusions arising from the summit are related to the need for change by: addressing tax evasion; fostering international trade and investment and fighting protectionism; enhancing innovation to boost growth; strengthening support for refugees. After the Hangzhou Summit, all parties will continue to make efforts to implement its outcome, and jointly promote strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth worldwide.
F02|Nation-state coming back on the scene of international relations|This paper is trying to present the hypothesis of nation-stateâ€™s return as a relevant actor in foreign relations. Globalization, together with pax Americana, as a main nuclei of globalization, have extrapolated the idea of natural order and market economy, as it seemed that any discussion related to the role of state becomes obsolete. The recent events, with political and economic resonance, the market failures and instability, which required interventionist measures of the state for recovery and stability, major changes and trends of political spectrum, especially in the Western world have contradicted the prospect of natural order. Nevertheless, the discussion surrounding the role of state in economy, the invigoration of nation-state in international relations with possible future implications is regaining momentum.
F02|An assessment of the EU-Chinese bilateral relationship under the current economic and geostrategic context. Romania's position|"China stands out as a rising economic power. Its leap in international hierarchies is remarkable both in terms of GDP, international trade and investment flows and qualitative indicators. Based on these developments, China is increasingly assertive, both regionally and internationally. At the global level, China's assertiveness is revealed by the largest project ever launched by a single country: One Belt, One Road (OBOR). It represents ""a strategic priority"" of the Chinese leaders, motivated by economic and geopolitical factors, internal and external determinants. This initiative includes cooperation with over 70 countries and international organizations from Asia to Europe and Africa. At the same time, it involves growing coordination among the countries in terms of policies, increasing financial integration, promoting trade and investment, fostering connectivity through infrastructure projects, and encouraging the movement of people and cultural exchanges. This initiative, as well as the platform for cooperation with 16 countries in Central and Eastern Europe (16+1) have opened on the one hand new ways of enhancing the bilateral EU-China, but on the other hand an unjustified competition between EU countries for financial resources Chinese, although the EU-China strategic partnership, OBOR and 16+1 can benefit all countries involved, given their competitive advantages. Romania, as a member country of the EU and participant at the platform 16+1 should take into account both such new opportunities and the need for an active cooperation with all countries."
F02|The Russian Federation and China: a brief review of the history of bilateral relations|The article has the purpose to review the main historical events that have marked throughout history the relations between the Russian Federation and China. These two global players have passed through periods of equilibrium and colonization, civil wars and revolutions, friendship, confrontation and normalization, culminating by a strategic partnership that is considered one of the most intense form of cooperation ever known in the history of Sino-Russian relationship. The research is supported by a qualitative analysis based on the official bilateral treaties, agreements and declarations signed between the two countries since 1689 to the present. The analysis has highlighted the role of border and territorial disputes between the Russian Federation and China, which negatively marked their bilateral relations. The completion of the legal delimitation process of Sino-Russian border on its entire length is declared by the Russian authorities to be one of the most important achievements of the foreign policy towards China. Border demarcation has eliminated the potential threat of a territorial conflict and the last point of contention between Russia and China.
F02|Decision Making And Saint Petersburg Paradox: Focusing On Heuristic Parameters, Considering The Non-Ergodic Context And The Gambling Risks|The Saint Petersburg Paradox is still a contemporary issue because of the great impact on the probabilistic theory and decision-making. This article proposes some hints on avoiding the trap of the infinite expected value (EV). The highly stochastic mechanism and its EV have always to be contextualized in the limited period where we take our choices taking into account all possible limitations deriving from the theory (including the non-ergodic features and some inappropriate consequences we may attribute to the EV). This contextualisation is one of the most important factors to consider especially when we deal with infinite quantity coming from models that may misrepresent our field of application and therefore generate paradoxes.
F02|Integrated Macroeconomic Production Function for Open Economies: A New Schumpeterian Solow Model for Globalization|The macroeconomic production function is a traditional key element of modern macroeconomics, as is the more recent knowledge production function which explains knowledge/patents by certain input factors such as research, foreign direct investment or international technology spillovers. This study is a major contribution to innovation, trade, FDI and growth analysis, namely in the form of a combination of an empirically relevant knowledge production function for open economies – with both trade and inward FDI as well as outward foreign direct investment plus research input – with a macro production function. Plugging the open economy knowledge production function into a standard macroeconomic production function yields important new insights for many fields: The estimation of the production potential in an open economy, growth decomposition analysis in the context of economic globalization and the demand for labor as well as long run international output interdependency of big countries; and this includes a view at the asymmetric case of a simple two country world in which one country is at full employment while the other is facing underutilized capacities. Finally, there are crucial implications for the analysis of broad regional integration schemes such as TTIP or TPP and a more realistic and comprehensive empirical analysis.
F02|The Transatlantic Blue Diplomacy|The international diplomatic environment has reached to an unprecedented development, involving one of the newly specialized diplomatic types, namely the economic diplomacy. At the core of the fast movements in the diplomatic spheres across the Globe are the international agreements like the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) that determined diplomacy to dissolve into new subtypes, evolving from ground to the ocean and implementing new ways of achieving economic and climate sustainability. One of the newly created diplomatic spheres, is the blue ocean diplomacy that acts mainly in accordance with the rules and regulations that are being applied to the transatlantic economy. Even though TTIP encourages the increase of trade flows across the Atlantic, it will also ease the foreign investment procedures that, under the approach of keeping a sustainable environment, will represent one of the most important initiatives in implementing the blue economy concept within the framework of the transatlantic diplomacy.
F02|Globalisation and Inequality : A Dynamic General Equilibrium Model of Unequal Exchange|A dynamic general equilibrium model that generalises Roemer's [23] economy with a global capital market is analysed. An axiomatic analysis of the concept of unequal exchange (UE) between countries is developed at general dynamic equilibria. The class of UE definitions that satisfy three fundamental properties - including a correspondence between wealth, class and UE exploitation status - is completely characterised. It is shown that this class is nonempty and a definition of UE exploitation between countries is proposed, which is theoretically robust and firmly anchored to empirically observable data. The full class and UE exploitation structure of the international economy is derived in equilibrium.
F02|Monitoring the International Monetary System: Its Development in the West, and Future in the East|The “gold standard” is frequently mentioned in text books, but few without an economics background can fully understand it. This paper thus begins in 1896, when U.S. Presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan declared, “You shall not crucify mankind on a cross of gold.” Since going back to the middle ages, the world has had numerous monetary systems, which are here explained in comprehensible terms. A modern reoccurring idea is to return to some form of the gold standard, while some argue for switching to the Chinese yuan or another international reserve currency, which the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will adopt in their Special Drawing Rights starting in October, 2016. This paper is normative in that it comments on the current international structure, but uses economic principles to support its argument in favor of an internationally strong dollar. It thus traces the history of a topically contentious subject, with a basic regression indicating important predictive factors for the future. It offers that a new gold standard would not be in the world’s interest, interfering with monetary policy, while emerging market countries would be best to import more and financially deepen, which the regression shows was why the Chinese yuan was adopted by the IMF, then looking ahead to other parts of Asia and towards bitcoins.
F02|The Political Economy of Free Trade, WTO and the Developing Countries|This paper examines the existing literature on trade liberalisation and itseffect on the economies of developing countries. It will also briefly examine the theory of comparative advantage which is seen as justification for global trade liberalisation under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation. This process is also associated with greater openness, economic interdependence and deepening economic integration with the world economy. The study is important because once again the international institutions strongly advocate trade and financial liberalisation in developing countries. The proponents of trade liberalisation argue that multilateral trade negotiations would achieve these goals, and poor countries particularly would benefit from it. However, such policies may increase vulnerability and make developing countries further hostages of international finance capital. Adoption of open market policies in agriculture would also mean the abandoning of self-reliance and food sovereignty, which may have wider consequences in terms of food shortages, food prices and rural employment.
F02|Mapping public support for futher European unification: a multilevel analysis|Using individual-level data from the European Social Survey, a multilevel analysis involving 21 countries was conducted to identify contextual preference formation. We show that individual predictors such as education work differently in different institutional contexts. Contrary to previous finding in the literature we find that the higher the percentage of tertiary education, the smaller the education gap in public support for the EU
F02|The European Payments Union and the origins of Triffin’s regional approach towards international monetary integration|Robert Triffin (1911-1993) played an important role in the international monetary debates in the postwar period. He was known as one of the main advocates of a multipolar international monetary system. In this paper we analyse the origins of riffin’s “regional” approach towards international monetary integration. We argue that Triffin’s experience with the European Payments Union (EPU)played hereby a crucial role. Triffin was not only an “architect” of the EPU, but the EPU also led to an important shift in Triffin’s view of the geography of the international monetary system. Before his work on the EPU, Triffin thought of the international economy as composed of two geographical entities: national economies and the world economy. With his work on the EPU he introduced a third geographical entity: the region. The EPU would so be at the basis of Triffin’s advocacy of a regional approach towards international monetary integration. Moreover, while Triffin was initially quite positive on the IMF, he became, through his EPU experience, more critical of the IMF and its worldwide approach.
F02|Bank capital (requirements) and credit supply: Evidence from pillar 2 decisions|We analyze how time-varying bank-speci_c capital requirements a_ect banks' balance sheet adjustments as well as bank lending to the non-_nancial corporate sector. To do so, we relate Pillar 2 capital requirements to bank balance sheet data, a fully documented corporate credit register and _rm balance sheet data. Our analysis consists of three components. First, we examine how time-varying bank-speci_c capital requirements a_ect banks' balance sheet composition. Subsequently, we investigate how capital requirements a_ect the supply of bank credit to the corporate sector, both on the intensive and extensive margin, as well as for di_erent types of credit. Finally, we document how bank characteristics, _rm characteristics and the stance of monetary policy impact the relationship between bank capital requirements and credit supply.
F02|The response of euro area sovereign spreads to the ECB unconventional monetary policies|We analyse variations in sovereign bond yields and spreads following unconventional monetary policy announcements by the European Central Bank. Using a two-country, arbitrage-free, shadow-rate dynamic term structure model (SR-DTSM), we decompose countries'yields into expectation and risk premium components. By means of an event study analysis, we show that the ECB's announcements reduced both the average expected instantaneous spread and risk repricing components of Italian and Spanish spreads. For countries such as Belgium and France, the ECB announcements impacted primarily the risk repricing component of the spread.
F02|The Interdependence of Monetary and Macroprudential Policy under the Zero Lower Bound|This paper considers the interdependence of monetary and macroprudential policy in a New Keynesian business cycle model under the zero lower bound constraint. Entrepreneurs borrow in nominal terms from banks and are subject to idiosyncratic default risk. The realized loan return to the bank varies with aggregate risk, such that bank balance sheets are affected by higher-than-expected rm defaults. Monetary and macroprudential policies are given by an interest rate rule and a capital requirement rule, respectively. We first characterize the model's stability properties under different steady state policies. We then analyze the transmission of a risk shock under the zero lower bound and different macroprudential policies. We finally investigate whether these policies are indeed optimal.
F02|The Design of Trade Agreements|"What does economics have to say about the design of international trade agreements? We review a literature on this question, providing detailed coverage on three key design features of the GATT/WTO: reciprocity, nondiscrimination as embodied in the MFN principle, and tariff bindings and binding ""overhang."" Each of these features is central to the design of the GATT/WTO, and we argue that an economic perspective can go a long way toward revealing a consistent logic to the inclusion of these design features in trade agreements."
F02|Preferential Trade Agreements|A large and growing number of countries participate in multiple preferential trade agreements (PTAs), which increasingly entail broad cooperation over policies extending far beyond trade barriers. I review the traditional and non-traditional motives for PTAs and their empirical determinants as well as their impacts on trade and on multilateral liberalization. I argue that the broad nature of modern PTAs, their substantial creation of bilateral trade and their modest effects on members’ tariffs, require us to augment the economic and policy structure of traditional models of PTAs as a static preferential tariff reduction. Throughout I draw lessons from the existing literature and point towards many interesting paths for future research, to advance our understanding of the causes of modern PTAs and their impacts on trade related outcomes and beyond.
F02|A Model of the International Monetary System|We propose a simple model of the international monetary system. We study the world supply and demand for reserve assets denominated in different currencies under a variety of scenarios: a hegemon versus a multipolar world; abundant versus scarce reserve assets; and a gold exchange standard versus a floating rate system. We rationalize the Triffin dilemma, which posits the fundamental instability of the system, as well as the common prediction regarding the natural and beneficial emergence of a multipolar world, the Nurkse warning that a multipolar world is more unstable than a hegemon world, and the Keynesian argument that a scarcity of reserve assets under a gold standard or at the zero lower bound is recessionary. Our analysis is both positive and normative.
F02|Multilateral Trade Bargaining And Dominant Strategies|Motivated by General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade bargaining behavior and renegotiation rules, we construct a three‐country, two‐good general‐equilibrium model of trade and examine multilateral tariff bargaining under the constraints of nondiscrimination and multilateral reciprocity. For a general representation of government preferences, we identify the bargaining outcomes that can be achieved using dominant strategy proposals for all countries. In our analysis, dominant strategy outcomes emerge when tariff proposals are followed by multilateral rebalancing. The resulting bargaining outcome is efficient relative to government preferences if and only if the initial tariff vector positions the initial world price at its “politically optimal” level.
F02|Long-Term Trends in Income Distribution|Income and wealth inequalities in most countries - in the West, the former communist economies and in many developing states - have been growing in the last three decades. Inequalities in the late XIX century were much higher than before the rise of workers' movements in the West and the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, the strong inequalities of the previous century declined for over half a century until the 1980s as the threat of communism spreading inspired welfare redistributive reforms, giving capitalism 'a more human face'. But these checks and balances have greatly weakened in recent decades, especially after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the growth of inequalities resumed in most developed and many developing countries with some notable exceptions (Latin America). This article discusses long term past and possible future trends in inequality. High inequalities are associated with an array of negative consequences, which lower the competitiveness of societies and countries, especially at higher stages of development. Inequalities cannot grow endlessly, there is probably a critical level of inequality, and if it is exceeded, national states descend into turmoil of social conflicts and fall apart. If the growth of income inequalities continues, then countries can get into the bad stable equilibrium trap that reproduces itself: poor quality of state institutions, low growth, low social mobility, high social tensions. Gradual reforms could help overcoming the trap, but if they are delayed, the further growth of inequalities could lead to social revolution.
F02|The Flow of Refugees and International Terrorism – Primarily a European Problem, but with Historical Roots and Geopolitical Dimensions|It is indisputable that the issue of refugees and terrorism is becoming more and more topical and most of all – a European problem, but with much broader dimensions that already have a geopolitical nature. However, it gains even larger topicality and significance after the two tragic terrorist attacks that were carried out in Paris and Brussels in November 2015 and March 2016 respectively. Unfortunately, however, when analyzed and commented upon, and during the attempts to counteract, solve and overcome these tragic events, some historical roots and the fundamental reasons that provoke them are underestimated and even downright ignored. This is precisely the purpose of the present study: first, to pay attention to their historical “roots”; and second, to attempt to reveal their fundamental prerequisites, motives and reasons, but in the most synthesized way possible, because the subject matter and the problems are quite extensive and complex.
F02|The legal framework applicable to joint interpretive agreements of investment treaties|Governments have been examining the potential role of joint government interpretations of investment treaties at OECD-hosted intergovernmental investment roundtables. Now well-established in the model BITs and treaty practice of the NAFTA governments, express provisions for such joint interpretations have recently been included in an increasing range of treaties and investment policies around the world. But while a significant number of major recent treaties contain such express provisions, most investment treaties do not expressly address joint interpretations and thus leave the issue to more general rules. This paper addresses the general legal framework applicable to joint agreements by treaty parties about the interpretation of treaties. It outlines some key concepts and distinctions in treaty interpretation, and then considers the effects of treaty interpretations and amendments on third parties and in particular on investors covered by a treaty. Joint government interpretation can be binding or non-binding on investment arbitration tribunals. The paper concludes with brief consideration of possible criteria that could affect the persuasiveness of non-binding guidance.
F02|State-to-State dispute settlement and the interpretation of investment treaties|Many governments have expressed concerns about the uncertainty linked to the perceived inconsistency of treaty interpretation in Investor-State dispute settlement (ISDS). An OECD-hosted intergovernmental investment roundtable has been considering a range of tools through which governments can take action to improve the interpretation of investment treaties and some participants suggested consideration of the potential role of State-to-State dispute settlement (SSDS) in this area. This paper responds to this interest. The first part sets forth a rough typology of possible SSDS claims under investment treaties. The second part outlines policy issues relating to a possible type of SSDS claim which would be most relevant to the question of interpretation, for so-called “pure” interpretation of an investment treaty. The analysis seeks to identify policy reasons why governments might wish to provide for or exclude the power to obtain pure interpretations of investment treaties from SSDS tribunals or to make it broad or narrow. The final section examines SSDS cases under investment treaties addressing claims for interpretation.
F02|Cardiac Arrest or Dizzy Spell: Why is World Trade So Weak and What can Policy Do About It?|World trade growth was rapid in the two decades prior to the global financial crisis but has halved subsequently. There are both structural and cyclical reasons for the slowdown. A deceleration in the rate of trade liberalisation post 2000 was initially obscured by the ongoing expansion of global value chains and associated rapid emergence of China in the world economy. Post the financial crisis global value chains started to unwind and, possibly associated with this, Chinese and Asian trade weakened markedly. These structural changes were compounded by insipid demand due to anaemic growth of global investment, as well as intra-euro area trade, both of which are trade intensive. The slowdown in world trade growth post crisis, if sustained, will have serious consequences for the medium-term growth of productivity and living standards. Trade policy has significant potential to reinvigorate trade growth but the political environment for reforms is difficult, with a growing polarisation of OECD electorates into pro- and anti- globalisation supporters. Further trade and investment policy liberalisation should be introduced as part of a wider package of structural reforms to spread the benefits of freer trade and investment more widely. Arrêt cardiaque ou crise passagère : Pourquoi le commerce mondial est-il si faible et que peut faire la politique économique pour le relancer ? Le commerce mondial a cru rapidement au court des deux décennies qui ont précédé la crise financière de 2008. Mais sa croissance a été divisée par deux depuis. Des facteurs à la fois structurels et conjoncturels expliquent ce changement. Le ralentissement de la libéralisation du commerce mondial après 2000 a été masqué par l’expansion des chaines de valeur mondiale et l’insertion rapide de la Chine dans le commerce international. Après la crise, les chaines de valeur mondiale se sont détendues et le commerce Chinois et asiatique a ralenti, les deux phénomènes étant peut-être liés. Ces changements structurels ont été aggravés par une faible demande due à une croissance anémique de l’investissement international et du commerce intra-européen, les deux étant une source importante d’échanges commerciaux. S’il perdure, ce ralentissement de la croissance du commerce mondial aura des conséquences fâcheuses pour la croissance de la productivité et du niveau de vie. La politique commerciale dispose d’un potentiel pour relancer cette croissance, mais l’environnement politique actuel est peu favorable du fait d’une polarisation croissance au sein de l’électorat des pays de l’OCDE entre partisans de la globalisation et ceux plus sceptiques sur ses bienfaits. Une politique plus volontariste en matière de libéralisation des échanges et de l’investissement devrait être mise en place dans le cadre d’un plan global de reformes structurelles.
F02|The Cohesion Policy of the European Union and Its Role in the Development of Romania [Politica de coeziune a Uniunii Europene şi rolul acesteia asupra dezvoltării României]|Quoting Sir Winston LS Churchill, “However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results”, we tried an analysis of the influence the cohesion policy of the EU has on Romania’s development. We took account of the specific literature, of the existing economic theories and legal framework, the result being directed to discovering – rather than on confirming or denying – hypotheses.
