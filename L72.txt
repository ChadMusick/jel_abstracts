L72|The Death Spiral of Coal in the USA: Will New U.S. Energy Policy Change the Tide?|The Trump administration has promised to stop the spiraling down of the U.S. coal industry that has been going on for several years. We discuss the origins of the decline of the U.S. coal industry and new policy interventions by the Trump administration. We find that a further decrease of coal consumption in the U.S. electricity sector must be expected because of the old and inefficient U.S. coal-fired generation fleet. By contrast, we adapt the EIA’s overly optimistic view and analyze three potential support schemes to assess whether under such assumptions they can turn the tide for the U.S. coal industry: i) revoking the Clean Power Plan (CPP); ii) facilitating access to the booming Asian market by developing West Coast coal export terminals; and iii) enhanced support for the Carbon Capture, Transport and Storage (CCTS) technology to provide a long-term perspective for domestic coal use while mitigating climate change. We investigate the short-term and long-term effects for U.S. coal production using a comprehensive partial equilibrium model of the world steam coal market, COALMOD-World (Holz et al. 2016). Revoking the CPP will stop the downward trend of steam coal consumption in the U.S., but will not lead to a return of U.S. coal production to the levels of the 2000s with more than 900 Mtpa. Even when assuming a continuously strong global coal demand and expanding U.S. coal export capacities, U.S. coal production will not return to its previous production highs. When global steam coal use, including U.S. consumption, is aligned with the 2°C climate target, U.S. steam coal production drops to around 100 Mtpa by 2030 and below 50 Mtpa by 2050, respectively, even if CCTS is available and exports via the U.S. West Coast are possible.
L72|Russia’s oil and gas sector in 2018|The oil and gas sector is among the basic ones of the Russian economy and is playing an important role in the income generation for the state budget and Russia’s trade balance. Implementation of the OPEC+ agreement regarding the production restriction has resulted in the world crude oil prices growth. In 2018, the volumes of crude oil production peaked for the entire post-Soviet period and the extraction and export of the natural gas hit all-time high. Under the first stage of tax maneuver in force in the oil industry, the refining depth and increased volumes of export of petroleum products observed before its implementation were replaced by contraction of production and export of fuel oil and by the reduction of crude oil refining and export of petroleum products. Oil refining depth moved up markedly. It was decided to gradually complete tax maneuver in the oil sector and introduce the additional profits tax (windfall tax).
L72|Interdépendance complexe et hybridation des modèles institutionnels nationaux : le cas des relations énergétique UE-Russie|Ce cahier de recherche vise à appliquer les problématisations des nouvelles approches de l’interdépendance (New Interdependence Approches – NIA selon l’acronyme anglais) aux enjeux relatifs à la régulation internationale de l’énergie et ce à partir d’un cas d’étude : la relation gazière entre l’UE et la Russie. Les interdépendances entre l’UE et ses fournisseurs extérieurs en matière de gaz naturel, au premier rang desquels figure la Russie, posent la question de la confrontation de préférences contradictoires des acteurs impliqués dans l’échange. L’interdépendance conflictuelle recèle un « effet transformatif » sur les régulations, les systèmes institutionnels et les politiques énergétiques de la Russie et de l’UE. Les deux modèles institutionnels font l’objet de changements incrémentaux porteurs de conséquences importantes. Dans l’interdépendance, la politique énergétique russe et les stratégies des acteurs russes se transforment pour faire place à un certain degré de concurrence. A l’inverse, il semble que de manière croissante celle de l’UE intègre des préoccupations d’ordre stratégique et d’économie politique qui ne se justifient pas par les seules considérations de création d’un marché unique et concurrentiel.
L72|Good mine, bad mine: Natural resource heterogeneity and Dutch disease in Indonesia|We analyse the local effect of exogenous shocks to the value of mineral deposits at the district level in Indonesia using a panel of manufacturing plants. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to model and estimate the effect of heterogeneity in natural resource extraction methods. We find that in areas where mineral extraction is relatively capital-intensive, mining booms cause virtually no upward pressure on manufacturing earnings per worker, and both producers of traded and local goods benefit from mining booms in terms of employment. In contrast, labour-intensive mining booms drive up local manufacturing wages such that producers of traded goods reduce employment. This source of heterogeneity helps to explain the mixed evidence for `Dutch disease' effects in the literature. In addition, we find no evidence that fiscal revenue sharing between sub-national districts leads to any spillovers.
L72|El sector minero antioqueño en la segunda mitad del siglo XIX: construcción hacia una economía modernizadora|Con el fin de realizar un aporte a la teoría del desarrollo local, este trabajo pretende responder a la pregunta de cómo se articula el desempeño económico de Antioquia con la minería decimonónica. A partir de un análisis cualitativo entre las investigaciones que han tratado el tema, las fuentes primarias recolectadas y el estudio llevado a cabo en la empresa minera El Zancudo, enfocado en su impacto económico regional, se ha encontrado que la minería, como respuesta a los intereses extractivos de los empresarios y favorecida por el contexto político y económico, dinamiza los sectores productivos e impulsa la industrialización y formación de capital humano regional, promoviendo los elementos para el despegue económico antioqueño de la segunda mitad del siglo XIX.
L72|Market Timing with Moving Averages for Fossil Fuel and Renewable Energy Stocks|The paper examines whether the moving average (MA) technique can beat random market timing in traditional and newer branches of an industrial sector. The sector considered is the energy sector, divided into balanced stock portfolios of fossil and renewable energy companies. Eight representative firms are selected for both portfolios. The paper finds that MA timing outperforms random timing with the portfolio of renewable energy companies, whereas the result is less clear with the portfolio of fossil energy companies. Thus, there seems to be more forecastable stochastic trends in sunrise branches than in sunset branches.
L72|Russian oil and gas sector in 2017|The oil and gas sector is playing an important role in the income generation for the state budget and Russia’s trade balance. In 2017, the volumes of crude oil production somewhat fell owing to Russia’s commitments to curb production as a result of the oil output cut agreement between some OPEC and non-OPEC countries. Under the so-called tax maneuver in force in the oil industry, refining depth went up, production and export of fuel oil moved down and export of crude oil, a highly lucrative source of state budget revenues, increased. In 2017, natural gas production and export hit an all-time peak. Despite the plunge of oil and gas world prices, the oil and gas sector continues to constitute over a half of Russian exports.
L72|Impacto económico de los 26 principales proyectos de cobre del Perú, en los siguientes 20 años|En el 2016 y 2017, Perú se consolidó como segundo productor de cobre en Latinoamérica y en el mundo. La presente investigación tiene como objetivo cuantificar el impacto que tendría en la economía peruana la puesta en marcha de los 26 principales proyectos mineros de cobre que forman parte de la cartera estimada de inversión minera del Ministerio de Energía y Minas. Es importante mencionar que el monto total de inversión para los 26 proyectos suma US$ 44,229 millones. El impacto de la ejecución de dichos proyectos se cuantifica con los siguientes indicadores: monto estimado de producción de cobre, impuestos (impuesto a la renta y canon minero, impuesto especial a la minería y regalías mineras), exportaciones y generación de empleo.
L72|How effective is lithium recycling as a remedy for resource scarcity?|We investigate to what extent recycling can remedy resource scarcity, and whether market intervention is desired. For doing so, we develop a dynamic model of the global lithium market. An efficient market for resource waste allows consumers to internalize the waste value when they buy the resource. In the analytical part of our paper, we show that the efficient market can alternatively be realized through a proper set of worldwide subsidies to either buyers or sellers of both virgin and recycled lithium. In our numerical simulations, we find that optimal subsidies may become quite substantial in the second half of this century. The size of these subsidies depends, however, on a number of uncertain assumptions such as technological progress in both extraction and recycling, quality-grade of recovered lithium, and demand elasticity.
L72|Market Structure and Supply Shocks: Evidence from Mining Disasters|This paper provides new evidence on how imperfectly competitive markets with excess capacity mitigate the adverse impact of supply shocks on prices. We study the potash market, which is controlled by a syndicate that assigns output quotas in proportion to production capacity of its members. This sharing rule creates incentives for excess capacity investment. Hence, it insulates the market from the impact of extreme events. Using a novel data set of potash mine disasters, we show that permanent or long-term loss of up to 4% of global or 20% of country production capacity does not affect the production levels and the commodity prices.
L72|Integrating renewables in mining: Review of business models and policy implications|Mining activities are energy-intensive and rely largely on fossil fuels to meet their energy demands. This exposes the mining sector to potential policy and regulatory risks, stemming from government efforts to shift the global economy to a low-emission development pathway, as envisaged by the Paris Agreement. At the same time, renewables have become an increasingly cost-competitive source of power generation. This has resulted in a business case for the adoption of solar and wind energy solutions in the mining sector, to reduce costs as well as carbon footprint of operations. The sector’s energy transition also presents an opportunity for resource-rich countries, including developing economies, to foster the synergistic development of higher value added domestic activities in the renewable energy sector. The shift of the mining industry to low-carbon energy has the potential to contribute to advancing the climate and sustainable development agenda, while also pursuing economic diversification objectives. However, the integration of new technologies into conventional power systems comes with risks and challenges. This paper aims to enhance the understanding of the key drivers for, and obstacles to, renewable energy integration in mining operations, based on a review of over 30 existing projects worldwide. The analysis identifies a need for an enabling policy environment, encompassing among others a competitive energy market structure and adequate energy infrastructure, to overcome current challenges and support the synergies between the development of the mining and renewable energy sectors.
L72|Mapping support for primary and secondary metal production|Public support for metal extraction and processing has received little attention relative to that for the agriculture, energy, or fisheries sectors. That is perhaps surprising given the potentially environmental harmful character of metal extraction and processing, and the emerging interest in transitioning to a more resource efficient and circular economy. This report addresses this knowledge gap by mapping out the most common forms of support provided for primary metals (produced from mineral ores) and secondary metals (produced from scrap).
L72|Exploiting a natural resource in a poor country: The good, the bad and the ugly sides of the Kyrgyz Republic’s gold mine|What is required for a poor country to turn a valuable resource endowment into a driver of development? The resource curse literature highlighted the importance of institutions and the nature of the resource, neither of which is a useful policy guide. A more recent literature views resource exploitation as a series of hurdles that must be negotiated: ensuring production, dividing revenues, and using the added public finance. The Kyrgyz Republic’s Kumtor gold mine is a useful case study in that the country cleared the first hurdle but over almost a quarter century was embroiled in negotiating the second hurdle. The paper assesses the extent to which such problems are inevitable for a small poor country, and the consequences of an extended conflictual process.
L72| Private Investment in a Mining Export Economy: A Model for Peru| This paper presents a theoretical model about investment in the mining sector and the housing sector. The demand for investment in mining, a demand derived from mining production, limited by a non-renewable production factor, is financed at the interest rate fixed by the world market. In the housing sector, the price and volume of investment are determined in the local market, by supply and demand. The model shows the strong dependence on mining investment and the housing of international conditions. Likewise, the existence of a non-renewable mining production factor implies that, with the passage of time, if new mines are not discovered, investment in mining and housing should be reduced.

L72| The determinants of private investment in a mining export economy. Peru: 1997-2017| Peru is an economy where about 60 percent of exports are mineral, of which copper, in turn, represents half. What is the weight of international factors and domestic factors in determining private investment in this mining export economy? In this paper, we identify the dominant influence of international conditions on the evolution of private investment in Peru, as well as the enormous individual weight of the price of exports in this evolution. In the period 1997-2017, external factors explained 54, 64 and 44 percent of the variance in the growth rate of total private investment, mining investment, and non-mining investment, respectively; while more than half of the weight of external factors was explained by the price of exports. On the other hand, internal factors explained 46, 36 and 56 percent of the variance in the growth rate of total private investment, mining investment. and non-mining investment; while about 40 percent of the weight of domestic factors was explained by public investment. These findings are important because they show the price of exports to be the main channel connecting private investment in Peru with the world economy, and public investment as the most effective policy variable affecting it.

L72|Evaluating the Kemess Stream sold by Centerra Gold in 2018|In a streaming contract, a mining company sells future revenues derived from a mine. Typically, the mining company sells the revenue for a secondary metal rather than the primary economic driver of the project. This paper considers a particular stream known as the “Kemess Stream”, where a public company called Centerra Gold Inc. sold future silver production from the Kemess Project to a private financial company. The Kemess Stream represents a typical streaming contract and provides an instructive example as a modelling exercise. This paper shows how to calculate the economics of the stream in detail based on economic reports published by Centerra Gold and discusses general principles reflected in the deal terms.
L72|Mining Pipe-Shaped Ore Deposits|This paper provides a rough comparison of two mine plans for a hypothetical, pipe-shaped ore body. The geometry for the ore body is based on stylized example of an auriferous tourmaline breccia pipes associated with porphyry deposits, which can have great vertical extent and relatively small surficial expression. I suppose the pipe outcrops on a hillside and can be accessed from the base of the hill, allowing the miner to enter the pipe at the midpoint of the vertical extent. Accessing the pipe in the middle allows the miner to either go up or downwards and this paper explores one mining method for each case. I calculate basic statistics associated with each method and compare the two models for mining method.
L72|Valuation Simulation for a Net Smelter Return Royalty on a Mining Project|This paper provides a rough calculation of the economic value of a hypothetical mining operation for a profitable of mineral deposit. I present simplifying assumptions for the deposit geometry and mine production constraints to calculate the value of a net smelter recovery royalty on the mine, which is due a small fraction of gross income from the mine. I calculate the value of the royalty with constant prices and conduct a simulation exercise where the metal price changes quarterly based on historical data for gold futures contracts.
L72|Application of Artificial Neural Networks in Cold Rolling Process|Rolling is one of the most complicated processes in metal forming. Knowing the exact amount of basic parameters, especially inter-stand tensions can be effective in controlling other parameters in this process. Inter-stand tensions affect rolling pressure, rolling force, forward and backward slips and neutral angle. Calculating this effect is an important step in continuous rolling design and control. Since inter-stand tensions cannot be calculated analytically, attempt is made to describes an approach based on artificial neural network (ANN) in order to identify the applied parameters in a cold tandem rolling mill. Due to the limited experimental data, in this subject a five stand tandem cold rolling mill is simulated through finite element method. The outputs of the FE simulation are applied in training the network and then, the network is employed for prediction of tensions in a tandem cold rolling mill. Here, after changing and checking the different designs of the network, the 11-42-4 structure by one hidden layer is selected as the best network. The verification factor of ANN results according to experimental data are over R=0.9586 for training and testing the data sets. The experimental results obtained from the five stands tandem cold rolling mill. This paper proposed new ANN for prediction of inter-stand tensions. Also, this ANN method shows a fuzzy control algorithm for investigating the effect of front and back tensions on reducing the thickness deviations of hot rolled steel strips. The average of the training and testing data sets is mentioned 0.9586. It means they have variable values which are discussed in details in section 4. According to Table 7, this proposed ANN model has the correlation coefficients of 0.9586, 0.9798, 0.9762 and 0.9742, respectively for training data sets and 0.9905, 0.9798, 0.9762 and 0.9803, respectively for the testing data sets. These obtained numbers indicate the acceptable accuracy of the ANN method in predicting the inter-stand tensions of the rolling tandem mill. This method provides a highly accurate solution with reduced computational time and is suitable for on-line control or optimization in tandem cold rolling mills. Due to the limited experimental data, for data extraction for the ANN simulation, a 2D tandem cold rolling process is simulated using ABAQUS 6.9 software. For designing a network for this rolling problem, various structures of neural networks are studied in MATLAB 7.8 software.
L72|Simulating Mine Revenues with Historical Gold Price Data from the Bank of England|This paper demonstrates a simulation method using historical prices for gold over a 40-year period. The simulation method can be used to assess variability in a mine plan. In this example, I use monthly gold data from the Bank of England. The total sample size is approximately 450 monthly data points, from which I consider 11 different continuous subsamples with length 100. Some of these blocks of data are overlap, but they are all different. For each block of data, I preform various calculations for a hypothetical mine plan that produces one ounce of gold per month. I report undiscounted total revenue over the 100-month period with real prices corresponding to different historical episodes and note how gold prices have changed over this 40-year period. I also use monthly price differences from each path to simulate gold price paths all starting with the same initial value, which allows for more apples-apples comparison. I show the Revenue Paths in such cases, report the present value for each path, and include a simple cost model in the mine plan to estimate net present value for each path with standardized initial prices.
L72|A New Resource Curse: How Externalities and Governance Shape Social Conflict|Natural resource extraction is increasingly important in many developing countries, but harmful externalities threaten the viability of the sector. This paper articulates and finds evidence for a new â€˜resource curse,â€™ whereby negative side effects from resource extraction increase social conflict in nearby communities. Using micro-level data on extractive commodities, water pollution, childrenâ€™s and livestock health, local government quality and mining-related social conflict in Peru, this study shows that rising international prices increase conflict, pollution and negative health effects, but not public spending in mining areas. These effects disappear when local government is high quality, indicating that good governance can temper the effects of this new resource curse.

L72|Modeling strategic investment decisions in spatial markets|Markets for natural resources and commodities are often oligopolistic. In these markets, production capacities are key for strategic interaction between the oligopolists. We analyze how different market structures influence oligopolistic capacity investments and thereby affect supply, prices and rents in spatial natural resource markets using mathematical programming models. The models comprise an investment stage and a supply stage in which players compete in quantities. We compare three models, a perfect competition and two Cournot models, in which the product is either traded through long-term contracts or on spot markets in the supply stage. Tractability and practicality of the approach are demonstrated in an application to the international metallurgical coal market. Results may vary substantially between the different models. The metallurgical coal market has recently made progress in moving away from long-term contracts and more towards spot market-based trade. Based on our results, we conclude that this regime switch is likely to raise consumer rents but lower producer rents, while the effect on total welfare is negligible.
L72|The impact of resource tax reform on China's coal industry|Contributing to approximately two-thirds of primary energy consumption, coal usage is the focus of China's energy policies. To regulate the resource taxation system and reduce the burden of coal enterprises, the Chinese government launched a reform of its resource tax system in 2014 for coal, introducing the ad valorem system to replace the volume-based system that had been in place for the preceding thirty years. To assess the impact of the tax reform, this paper constructs two-stage dynamic game models by taking the coal and coal-fired power industries as the players. The market situations of shortage and oversupply are investigated separately. Empirical data are collected to estimate the model parameters for numerical simulations. The model results suggest that the tax reform will reduce both coal prices and the coal industry profitability if the tax levied on each ton of coal is maintained at the same level as before the reform, regardless of whether the market is in a shortage or an oversupply situation. However, the increased buyer's power will amplify the effect of the tax reform. The numerical simulations also provide an estimation of the tax rate of the ad valorem system that maintains the profit of the coal industry. Considering the demand and supply situations in China's coal market, policy recommendations are provided to guide further reform of China's resource tax system.
L72|A historical perspective of the informational content of commodity futures|This article extends Chinn and Coibion (2014)'s work--Journal of Futures Markets 34-- on predictive content of commodity futures by considering a more comprehensive database and a longer time span, ranging from 25 to 65 years, and by presenting two extensions: multi-equation estimation of risk premiums and testing for the theory of storage.
L72|The global iron and steel industry: from a bilateral oligopoly to a thwarted monopsony|China’s growing urbanization and the speed of its manufacturing industry development led to a shock in steel demand at the beginning of the 2000’s and consequently to a shock across the iron and steel industry. In this paper, we carry out descriptive analysis of the evolution in the market structure and the related power market shifting. From a steady situation where few steelmakers negotiated with few mining firms in order to set up the annual price, the market evolved to a new price fixing process resulting from a supply-demand confrontation, like the move seen for most of the other materials a few decades ago. Moreover, the shock and the related events that occurred years after, led to a new composition of stakeholders in the iron and steel sectors, both on the demand and supply sides. In this new context, China has become an essential actor, modifying the industrial structure from a bilateral oligopoly to a thwarted monopsony.
L72|The effect of recycling over a mining oligopoly|In a view of switching from a linear to a circular economy, recycling plays a fundamental role. While the literature on the effect of recycling over the mining activity is focused on a monopoly, here we only deal with a mining oligopoly, which better reflects realistic market conditions. Our results show a decreasing mining output with the presence of recycling and unexpectidly a greater market power. Nevertheless, we point out the need for recylers to benefit from a minimum recycling efficiency technology to enter the market. A second technologic threshold also allows the recyclers to lower the oligopolistic market power. In this case of extreme foreclosure, since the mining output rises with the number of firms, a cooperation is necessary to prevent the entry of recycling. In terms of strategy, an horizontal integration could strengthen their position in the upstream industrial process and would also represent a good way to step forward to the so-called circular economy.
L72|Recycling of a Primary Resource and Market Power: The Alcoa Case|The purpose of this paper is threefold. First, it investigates the influence of the prospect of recycling on the per-period market power of an extractor, which can be associated with Alcoa when the recycling sector it faces is competitive. Second, it analyzes whether or not the extractor’s first period market power is affected when it is capacity constrained. Third, it explores whether the structure of the recycling sector affects the extractor’s per-period market power or not. Toward these ends, we study a two-period Cournot framework where the extractor produces aluminum over two consecutive periods. In the second period, it engages in competition with a recycling sector that can be competitive or not. Our results run as follows. (1) When the recycling sector is not competitive, recycling does not affect the extractor’s first period market power but increases its second period market power. (2) When the recycling sector is competitive, the extractor’s second period market power increases with the recycled output but becomes lower (compared to the non-competitive case), while its first period market power can be lower or higher (compared to the non-competitive case). Then, it can increase or decrease with the recycled output. (3) In either case, the extractor’s first period market power further increases when the primary resource constraint is binding. (4) We also show that the extractor’s market power can increase or decrease over time.
L72|Russian oil and gas sector in 2016|The oil and gas sector is among principal sectors of the Russian economy and is the driving force in shaping the state budget revenues and the trade balance. In 2016, Russia’s crude oil production hit an all-time peak since 1990, and crude oil exports were close to an all-time high. Under the so-called tax maneuver in force in the oil industry, refining depth went up noticeably, production and export of fuel oil moved down and export of crude oil, a highly lucrative source of the budget revenues, increased.
L72|Una aproximación al uso de opciones reales en la evaluación de proyectos mineros en un contexto de riesgo|La minería en el Perú está expuesta a muchos factores de riesgo que se oponen al desarrollo normal o el inicio de un proyecto. Por ello, se estudió el impacto de dichos factores en el desarrollo y ejecución de un grupo representativo de proyectos ubicados en distintas regiones; al mismo tiempo, se ha identificado cinco grupos de factores de riesgo, los cuales deben ser tomados en cuenta para la evaluación de proyectos al incorporarlos en la tasa de descuento. Se eligió seis proyectos mineros, tres de ellos en ejecución (Las Bambas, Toromocho, Constancia) y tres en suspensión indefinida (Tía María, Conga, Santa Ana), para medir el impacto de los factores de riesgo. Estos factores de riesgo se determinaron mediante una encuesta aplicada a 248 personas. Los factores son: Riesgo empresarial (RE), riesgo operativo (RO), riesgo de mercado (RM), riesgo social (RS) y riesgo político (RP). Para la aplicación numérica se eligió el caso del proyecto Tía María, en Arequipa.
L72|Evaluación del impacto de la accidentabilidad en la productividad de las minas peruanas: caso de estudio: empresas de la BVL en la gran y mediana minería|La salud y la seguridad de los trabajadores es un objetivo principal de las Empresas Mineras y el estado, su mejora logra disminuir las lesiones personales, reducir las pérdidas de tiempo, incrementar la productividad, disminuir perdidas de capital y disminuir los riesgos de conflictos sociales. La seguridad es necesaria para velar por el bienestar de los trabajadores y para mantener una seguridad adecuada en las minas, las empresas deben aplicar acciones permanentes y tener índices de siniestralidad bajos. Un trabajo seguro, es un desempeño bien hecho y productivo, por lo que se puede concluir que a mayor seguridad mayor será la productividad de la empresa. Una correcta gestión de los riesgos aportará a la productividad en el corto y mediano plazo, pero en el largo plazo será una base importante para mantener la sustentabilidad de la empresa. Debido a que la información sobre costos mineros no es fácilmente accesiblesible, los estudios sobre productividad minera no son muy frecuentes. El objetivo principal del estudio es evaluar el impacto de la accidentabilidad en la productividad de las minas peruanas, y probar estadísticamente que tiene un efecto negativo muy significativo sobre la productividad. El estudio se basa en el análisis estadístico de los índices de accidentabilidad y de productividad obtenidos, entre los años 2010 y 2014 de operación, por las diferentes minas metálicas peruanas tanto del tipo subterráneas como las del tipo superficiales y que cotizan en la Bolsa de Valores de Lima. Los datos e información básica se han obtenido de OSINERGMIN y de la Bolsa de Valores de Lima.
L72|Market Power, Production (Mis)Allocation and OPEC|This paper estimates the extent to which market power is a source of production misallocation. Productive inefficiency occurs through more production being allocated to higher-cost units of production, and less production to lower-cost production units, conditional on a fixed aggregate quantity. We rely on rich micro-data covering the global market for crude oil, from 1970 to 2014, to quantify the extent of productive misallocation attributable to market power exerted by the OPEC. We find substantial productive inefficiency attributable to market power, ranging from 14.1 percent to 21.9 percent of the total productive inefficiency, or 105 to 163 billion USD.
L72|Coal mining in Central-East Europe in perspective of industrial risk|Due to increasing economic and sector risk coal mining in Europe is treated as a declining industry. In post-transition economies such approach is a threat for energy security and local and regional economic development. Nowadays, coal mining survival in Central-East Europe is additionally threatened by accumulative global risk factors, especially by price differentiation and shale gas revolution in United States of America. Revealed circumstances require deepen research and diagnosis in the area of risk and corporate management in mining enterprises in Central-East Europe. The main aim of the article is to assess industrial risk in coal mining in Central-East Europe. The research is divided into three parts. In the first one the situation of coal mining in Central-East Europe is characterized. It is the basis for selection of the countries for the detailed analysis. In the second part the industrial risk factors are assessed and described. Finally, in the third part their influence on financial results in the examined mining enterprises is evaluated. In the summary the international comparison is made and general assumptions for risk and corporate management are formulated. In the article a risk checklist is used to identify the economic and industrial risk factors. To determine their influence on financial results on the first stage of research Pearson’s coefficients are used. Than regression functions are developed. The data are collected on the basis of public statistics and financial statements of the examined mining enterprises. On the basis of research results it may be stated that there are only a few countries in Europe in which mining enterprises still operate as separate economic units and all of them have experienced serious financial troubles in the last years. Risk intensification contributed mostly to revenues reduction and negative financial results.
L72|Mars: Economic Analysis of Constructing Sustainable Open-Air Human Settlements in The Martian Environment|With a high surface radiation, very low and fluctuating temperature and a windy but thin atmosphere, Mars seems an inhospitable place. The dangers on the Martian surface entail that humans stay within indoors habitats on Mars. But it may be possible to build open air settlements on Mars where a direct connection to the Martian atmosphere is feasible. In such a scenario, humans may be able to inhabit Mars with minimal external protection like pressurized suits. For this to happen, humans need to be in atmospheric conditions similar to that on Earth. To achieve these results we need to excavate deep into the Martian crust to depths where air pressures will be sufficient to allow humans to survive without pressurized suits. The paper discusses about the various aspects and economic analysis of such an exercise. The hurdles for implementing this plan are also analyzed. The paper concludes by summarizing the feasibility, benefits and difficulties in undertaking such an activity.
L72|Investment Appraisal of Mining Projects Employing the FAST Modeling Standard|In this study a project model is built to conduct an appraisal and sensitivity analysis of a gold mine. At the same time, the most up to date modeling standard, known as FAST (i.e., Flexible, Appropriate, Structured, and Transparent), is implemented. The purpose of choosing this standard is to identify the strengths and weaknesses that may result from the implementation of this methodology for the modeling project appraisals. The FAST standard noticeably reduces the rate of error, while the speed of modeling and the appraisal of investment projects increase noticeably. The results of the analysis using FAST also becomes more communicable after implementing this standard. An important conclusion of the appraisal is that the royalty rates charged by governments on the extraction of gold are found to be too insensitive to the magnitude of the financial surplus generated by a specific mine. In particular, our study suggests that even if the royalty rates are increased up to six times, the project still generates a positive financial net present value for the mine owners. According to this finding it should be a public finance priority to redesign the systems for setting royalty rates in mineral producing countries that would allow host countries to benefit more from high return investments while at the same time not damaging the financial viability of higher cost natural resource extraction projects.

La base de cualquier modelo de desarrollo para Chile es su estrategia económica y dentro de ella, la política respecto al cobre. En la primera sección se define el concepto de renta. En la segunda, se resumen estudios que cuantifican la sobre normal magnitud de las rentas económicas por parte del sector privado. En la tercera sección se justifica la necesidad de recuperar estas rentas para el Estado: no solo hay altas rentas, también hay bajo valor agregado y perspectivas de agotamiento de las altas rentas. En la sección cuarta se pregunta si los argumentos a favor de la nacionalización el cobre que se tomaron en cuenta en 1971 resisten el paso del tiempo. En la sección quinta, se propone que mientras ello no sea posible, al menos, se debe actuar sobre la tributación, especialmente corrigiendo la elusión y la evasión. Finalmente, se resume el artículo con alternativas de cómo implementar la nacionalización y de qué modo podría financiarse.
L72|The Role of Clusters for Sustainable Development: Socially Responsible Practices, Limitations and Challenges. Case study of a Bulgarian Industrial Cluster|The concept of sustainable development as a global and long-term philosophy of development is directed towards achieving a balance and interconnectedness between economic activities, social aspects and the environment and offers an overall approach to solving the growing and complex global problems.This paper examines the possibilities that clusters? main characteristics ? spatial proximity, strategic collaboration and competition; interaction between stakeholders (businesses, educational institutions, non-governmental organizations) - can provide for the implementation of responsible business practices and joint corporate socially responsible activities which contribute to sustainable development.Based on publications in academic literature regarding the relationship between clusters and corporate social responsibility (CSR), known as the ?cluster? approach to CSR, as well as the results from a practical study of an industrial cluster in Bulgaria, we outline the potential of clusters to bring about not only economic benefits but also social and environmental improvements. The conditions for successful implementation of CSR actions in the cluster are studied, which for some industrial clusters can be prerequisites for improvement of their actual capacity for contribution to sustainable development and for others, they can turn into significant limitations. The results of the practical study show that in order for industrial clusters to use their potential for contribution to sustainable development, based on the main cluster characteristics (according to cluster theory), in addition to cluster activity, the social-economic and environmental context and the state of development of CSR and clusters in the respective country are also of defining importance.
L72|At Africa's Expense? Disaggregating the Social Impact of Chinese Mining Operations|Qualitative studies and media reports suggest that the presence of Chinese oil or mining companies generates resentments among local extractive communities due to low wages, poor working conditions, environmental degradation, the employment of foreign labour, and perceived racial discrimination. At the same time, Chinese investment in the extractive sector appears to enhance local infrastructure. So far, these claims have not been empirically tested in a systematic way. Relying on novel data on the control-rights regimes of diamond, gold, and copper mines and geo-referenced information from Afrobarometer surveys, this paper examines whether Chinese-controlled mining promotes anti-Chinese sentiments among the local populations of sub-Saharan African countries. In addition, we test the effect of mining contractors' nationality on socio-economic indicators such as local employment rates and infrastructure levels. Our logistic regression analysis for the period 1997-2014 reveals that the effect of Chinese mining companies on African local development is ambiguous: while proximity to Chinese-operated mines is associated with anti-Chinese sentiments and unemployment, populations living close to Chinese mining areas enjoy better infrastructure, such as paved roads or piped water. Multilevel mixed-effects estimations using district-level data from the Demographic Health Survey for 20 sub-Saharan countries corroborate these findings.
L72|The Long-Run Effects of Labor Migration on Human Capital Formation in Communities of Origin|We provide new evidence of one channel through which circular labor migration has long-run effects on origin communities: by raising completed human capital of the next generation. We estimate the net effects of migration from Malawi to South African mines using newly digitized census and administrative data on access to mine jobs, a difference-in-differences strategy, and two opposite-signed and plausibly exogenous shocks to the option to migrate. Twenty years after these shocks, human capital is 4.8-6.9 percent higher among cohorts who were eligible for schooling in communities with the easiest access to migrant jobs.
L72|A Systemic Approach to the Development of a Policy Mix for Material Resource Efficiency| Increasing material use efficiency is important to mitigate future supply risks and minimize environmental impacts associated with the production of the materials. The policy mix presented in this paper aims to reduce the use of virgin metals in the EU by 80% by 2050. We used a heuristic framework and a systems perspective for designing the policy mix that combines primary instruments (aimed to achieve the 80% reduction target – e.g. a materials tax, technical regulations and removal of environmentally harmful subsidies) and supportive instruments (aimed to reduce barriers to implementing the primary instruments and to contribute towards the policy objectives – e.g. research & development support, and advanced recycling centers). Furthermore, instruments were designed so as to increase political feasibility: e.g. taxes were gradually increased as part of a green fiscal reform, and border-tax adjustments were introduced to reduce impacts on competitiveness. However, even in such a policy mix design ongoing ex-ante assessments indicate that the policy mix will be politically difficult to implement – and also fall short of achieving the 80% reduction target. Nonetheless, we suggest combining primary and supportive instruments into coherent and dynamic policy mixes as a promising step towards system reconfigurations for sustainability.
L72|Mining Matters : Natural Resource Extraction and Local Business Constraints|We estimate the impact of local mining activity on the business constraints experienced by 22,150 firms across eight resource-rich countries. We find that with the presence of active mines, the business environment in the immediate vicinity (<20 km) of a firm deteriorates but business constraints of more distant firms relax. The negative local impact of mining is concentrated among firms in tradeable sectors whose access to inputs and infrastructure becomes more constrained. This deterioration of the local business environment adversely affects firm growth and is in line with a natural resource curse at the sub-national level.
L72|Resource Agency Relationship with Privately Known Exploration and Extraction Costs|We analyze exploration and extraction under asymmetric information. The principal delegates the exploitation of a resource to an agent (a mining firm) who possesses private information about the cost of exploration and learns further extraction cost information once reserves have been established and constrain extraction. The principal can only commit to current period royalty contracts: one discovery-transfer menu; one extraction-royalty menu conditional on reserves discovered. Compared with the symmetric information first best, avoiding adverse selection in extraction requires the optimum mechanism to increase discoveries by the lowest cost type and possibly others. This is tempered by a countervailing effect stemming from information asymmetry in exploration which tends to reduce discoveries, especially by higher cost types. We further detail implications on the forms taken by the inefficiencies associated with asymmetric information: abandoned reserves, excessive use of low-cost exploration prospects, and inefficient levels of technological sophistication in exploration and extraction sectors.
L72|Non-Ferrous Exports Concentration And Global Investments|In the context of high-tech and telecommunication, non-ferrous sector has a crucial role in industries development. Cooper, nickel, aluminum, zinc, lead and tin are used, directly or indirectly, in most of the technologies, especially in high-tech production. The paper present a short index of the global investments for the non-ferrous transnational corporations listed on London Metal Exchange. The non-ferrous investment index presented in the paper refers to the most profitable corporation exports on world, European Union (EU28) and Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) level. The export concentration, estimated through Herfindahl-Hirschmann index on world, EU28, CEE and Romanian level, show that the non-ferrous industry is in full process of releasing. The cases presented in the article show that the non-ferrous companies invest intensively in equipment and technologies with superior production capacities, which combat pollution given by non-ferrous processes, research and development for the non-ferrous innovative technologies, and creating new markets. Sustainable and intelligent development is the inflexion point of the non-ferrous transnational corporation investments. The research is predominant in exploration of the transnational corporations’ internet pages and reports, and statistical calculus from international trade websites.

The paper points out Europe's position in the current world context. Research is an exploratory one, being supported by statistical interpretations made by the author based on analysis of the ""Global Trends in the renewable energy sector"" report (2016), United Nations Environment Programme in collaboration with Bloomberg under the auspices of the School of Finance and Management in Frankfurt. Conceptually, the paper presents the most important points of the oscillation investments in the renewable energy sector worldwide. The level of investment in the renewable energy sector offers an accurate picture of the extent of decarbonisation."
L72|Correlation Between Public Funding And Non-Ferrous Industry. Evidence From Cee And Romania|The paper aims at presenting important approaches of the influence of the public funding to industry, especially non-ferrous, in the Countries from Eastern Europe (CEE) and Romania. Studies presented in the paper show that the industry funding had been sustained by the European Commission in the community area, but particularly in CEE area. The impact of industry funding will never be exactly measured, but important data can be presented in order to foresee the future development of the European industry. Specific for non-ferrous industry, in the article there are presented important items, as turnover, value added cost, exports, production, which are correlated to EU funds absorption in order to measure the efficiency of the public funding for 2007-2013 period (national and EU funds) and the welfare of the CEE and Romanian non-ferrous sector.
L72|Análisis de la evolución de la inversión extranjera directa en el sector minero del carbón en Colombia de 2004 a 2013|En este artículo se analiza la evolución de nla invresión extranjera directa (IED) en el sector minas y canteras y en la extracción de carbón, lignito y turba en Colombia en el periodo de 2004 a 2013, utilizando Minero Colombiano. Se presenta un panorama del sector minero del carbón en Colombia y la evolución de la IED en el periodo descrito. Se concluye que el sector minero del carbón en Colombia posee un enorme potencial que favoreció la entrada de capitales foráneos durante el periodo, pero terminó siendo un indicador de la primarización de la IED en el país en el mismo periodo.
L72|Economía y política del modelo boliviano 2006-2014: evaluación preliminar|Bolivia sufrió un profundo cambio socioeconómico y político en el periodo 2006-2014, pasó de un modelo de crecimiento liberal a uno de economía mixta, donde el Gobierno juega un papel muy relevante en la economía. El Estado tiene un control completo de los recursos económicos y principales ingresos de la industria. El excedente generado por los commodities contribuyó a la política de distribución de ingreso y además fue utilizado para la lucha contra la pobreza a través de una mejor educación y salud. El modelo macroeconómico fue exitoso: la economía boliviana creció a una tasa promedio de 4.6 % anual durante el periodo 2006–2014 y registró un superávit fiscal, un blance comercial positivpo y un aumento en el volumen de reservas internacionales. Además, el país goza de estabilidad macroeconómica y baja inflación.
L72|Minería responsable: Mecanismos e incentivos en el caso del carbón en Colombia|Este artículo estudia los principales incentivos a la minería de carbón responsable en Colombia y en otros países. También presenta su estado actual y analiza críticamente los métodos y fuentes empleadas. Se parte de identificar las limitaciones del mercado para la absorción de minería responsable y su organización productiva. El resultado de la evaluación de las limitaciones del mercado muestra que la gran minería exhibe economías de escala con mayor margen de ganancia, al contar solo con prácticas de mitigación de impactos ambientales y sociales que exige la ley (planes de manejo), frente a la minería responsable que implementa este tipo de prácticas más allá de las exigencias legales. Por último, se examina el hecho de que los mecanismos o incentivos a la minería responsable se fundamentan en incentivos de mercado, incentivos gubernamentales e incentivos técnicos.
L72|Phasing out the U.S. Federal Helium Reserve: Policy insights from a world helium model|This paper develops a detailed partial equilibrium model of the global helium market to study the effects of the recently decided rapid phase out of the U.S. Federal Helium Reserve (FHR), a vast strategic stockpile accumulated during the 1960s. The model incorporates a detailed representation of that industry and treats both helium producers and the FHR as players in a dynamic non-cooperative game. The goal of each player is assumed to be the maximization of discounted profit, subject to technical and resource constraints. We consider two alternative policies aimed at organizing the phase out of the FHR: the currently implemented one and a less stringent one whereby the FHR would be allowed to operate as a profit-maximizing agent during an extended period of time. Evidences gained from a series of market simulations indicate that, compared to the current policy, a less stringent policy mandate systematically increases the financial return to the U.S. federal budget, always enhances environmental outcomes as it lowers helium venting into the atmosphere, and also augments global welfare in three out of the four scenarios considered in the paper.

L72|A Sustainability Accounting: Case Study on Exploration, Production and Midstream Activities at Maersk Oil|This paper gives a short introduction to sustainable accounting and its essential measurement problems. The greatest challenge seems to be how companies should create sustainability reports that achieve the demands for transparency and accuracy. Because the current frameworks vary considerably, the development of standards and guidance to report sustainability will most likely continue to evolve. This study proposes a model to Maersk Company allowing them to use a sustainability accounting framework as guidance for disclosure of material sustainability and accounting metrics to determine sustainability-related risks and opportunities it faces using the sustainability accounting standard for the oil and gas industries, particular to exploration, production and midstream activities.
L72|Ciclo económico y minería del cobre en Chile|En el presente artículo se “endogeniza” la oferta de cobre, incorporando la demanda de insumos del sector minero correspondiente a otros bienes de la economía —específicamente, bienes intermedios— y también energía, en un modelo de equilibrio general dinámico estocástico (dsge) para una muestra del período 2003-2013. La estimación del modelo revela que un aumento de un 1% del precio del cobre causa un incremento de un 0,16% en el producto interno bruto (pib) en cinco años. La principal contribución del estudio es mostrar que, si se considera al sector minero integrado al resto de la economía, en lugar de suponer —como es usual— que constituye un enclave, los efectos del precio del cobre en la economía chilena por lo menos se duplican.
L72|The business cycle and copper mining in Chile|This article “endogenizes” the copper supply, incorporating demand for mining-sector inputs represented by other goods in the economy (specifically, intermediate goods) and also energy into a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model for a sample of the 2003-2013 period. The model estimation reveals that a rise of 1% in the copper price leads to a 0.16% increase in gross domestic product (GDP) over five years. The main contribution of the study is to show that, if the mining sector is treated as integrated into the rest of the economy rather than being assumed to be an enclave, as it usually is, the effects of the copper price on the Chilean economy at least double.
L72|Optimal extraction policy when the environmental and social costs of the opencast coal mining activity are internalized: Mining District of the Department of El Cesar (Colombia) case study|Several articles have confirmed the social and environmental consequences of opencast coal mining. The main purpose of this study is to simulate the optimal extraction policy of coal mining with and without the internalization of the environmental and social monetary costs that occur in the Mining District (located in the central part of the Department of El Cesar) using discrete dynamic programming (backward recursion, discrete state Markov decision model and Bellman equation). Results indicate that the private optimal of the overproduction policy for the terminal phase of the resource extraction program can be reduced once the negative externalities produced by mining practices are internalized into the cost function of the mining investment companies in Colombia. This means that if there is an increase in the total cost of extraction to offset the environmental and social impacts generated, the negative externalities would be less than or equal to the current level. Likewise, profits would continue being positive for the mining firms at the Mining District.
L72|Economic impacts of debottlenecking congestion in the Chinese coal supply chain|The fast pace of development in China's coal industry created bottlenecks in its transportation infrastructure. These bottlenecks likely affected not only China's domestic coal market, but also global coal markets. In this paper, we estimate the costs and consequences of these bottlenecks using a production and multimodal transportation model. We find that coal transportation inefficiencies increased the price of Chinese domestic coal at coastal locations and thereby influenced global seaborne coal prices. According to our model results, the resulting extra costs of coal supplied to the Chinese economy totaled 228 billion renminbi (RMB) in 2011 and 105 in 2013. The subsequent debottlenecking, on the other hand, has reduced the price of Chinese domestic coal delivered to coastal regions and contributed to the reduction in global seaborne coal prices since 2011. Our analysis also suggests that current tariffs for coal transport, with their embedded taxes to cover investments in rail capacity, result in economic efficiencies similar to charging marginal transportation costs and that planners have not introduced distortions that impose significant additional costs on the Chinese economy. Many projects that expanded transport capacity delivered strongly positive rates of return. However, some have poor or negative rates of return, which can reflect either overinvestment or preinvestment in future needs.
L72|Futures markets and fundamentals of base metals|According to the theory of storage, the interest-adjusted basis equals the warehousing cost minus the convenience yield (i.e., benefit of holding a physical commodity) per time unit. By assuming that warehousing costs relatively constant at alternative stock levels, the interest-adjusted basis will be inversely associated with the convenience yield.
L72|National strategies for securing a stable supply of rare earths in different world regions|The rising imbalance between increased demand for minerals and their tighter supply has resulted in growing concerns about their criticality. This has in turn stimulated both resource-rich and resource-poor countries to take an active role in implementing mineral strategies. The present paper explains why different world regions responded differently to the global problem of securing stable supply of critical minerals, in particular of rare earths. The paper is based on a comparative political economy framework and examines the extent to which distinct national policy styles, national interests, resource endowment and historical experience in tackling supply risk shaped the different policy choices. The overall findings show that despite their similar objectives, strategies undertaken by various regions tend to differ in their foci. Whereas Europe opts for a policy dialogue with resource-rich countries, Japan and the United States have a more hands-on approach in research and development initiatives. Australia's and China's policies instead, focus on development of domestic mining activities and on resource protection.
L72|Further evidence on the relationship between spot and futures prices|Based on a theoretical model, Tiltonet al. (2011) concluded that spot and futures prices should be highly correlated during periods of strong contango and much less correlated during periods of weak contango and backwardation. More recently, Gulley and Tilton (2014) found empirical support of this hypothesis for copper data during the period of 1994–2011.
L72|¿Apropiación privada de renta de recursos naturales? El caso del cobre en Chile|Unexpected increases of natural resource prices can generate rents, value that should be recovered by the State to minimize inefficiencies, avoid arbitrary discrimination between citizens and keep a sustainable trajectory. As a case study about private appropriation of natural resource rent, this work explores the case of copper in Chile since 1990, empirically analyzing if the 12 main private mining companies have recovered in present value more than their investment during their life cycle. The results of this exercise, applicable to other natural resources, indicate that some actually have, capturing about US$40 billion up to 2012. Elaborating an adequate institutional framework for future deposits remain important challenges for Chile to plentifully take advantage its mining potential, as well as for any country with an abundant resource base to better enjoy its natural wealth. For that purpose, a concession known as Least Present Value Revenue (LPVR) is proposed.// Los aumentos de precio de un recurso natural pueden generar renta, cuyo valor debiese ser recuperado por el Estado para minimizar ineficiencias en la economía, evitar discriminaciones arbitrarias entre ciudadanos y mantener una trayectoria sostenible. Como tema de estudio sobre apropiación privada de renta de recursos naturales, este artículo explora el caso del cobre en Chile desde 1990, analizando empíricamente si las principales mineras privadas han recuperado en valor presente más que su inversión. Los resultados del ejercicio, aplicable a otros recursos naturales, indican que algunas mineras sí lo han hecho, captando unos 40?000 millones de dólares hasta 2012. Elaborar una institucionalidad idónea para futuros yacimientos es un importante desafío para que Chile aproveche su potencial minero, así como para que cualquier país con una abundante base de recursos goce plenamente de su riqueza natural. Para tal efecto, se propone la concesión conocida como Mínimo Valor Presente de Ingresos (MVPI)

L72|Oil and Gas Sector in Russia in 2015|Oil and gas industry remains the basic sector of Russian economy playing the key role in shaping the state budget revenues and the country’s trade balance. In 2015, the oil sector’s development was marked by positive dynamics. Due to investments made in the previous years, the crude oil production in Russia has reached peak levels since 1990 and crude oil export hit all time maximum. Restructuring of the oil sector taxation system has been launched. The reform envisages significant reduction of the economic role of export duties. Low global crude oil prices together with financial and technological sanctions imposed on Russia have hampered the development of this sector.
L72|Inter-Fuel Competition In Electric Power Generation: Coal Or Natural Gas|One of the most disputable aspects of Russia’s energy markets reform is the feasibility of achieving grid parity between diﬀerent energy sources, of their socalled inter-fuel compe on level indices. Thus, in particular, one of the possible future components of the Russian market for natural gas can be the inter-fuel compe on level reached by natural gas and coal in electric power generation. The results of a simpliﬁed analysis of current electric energy gen era on costs demonstrate that at present, natural gas has a huge competitive advantage over coal in electric power genera on. At the same me, medium-term moderate growth of prices of natural gas in the domes c market will not result in a switchover, by electric power producers, from natural gas to coal.
L72|Межтопливная Конкуренция В Электрогенерации: Уголь Или Газ|Одним из аспектов реформирования энергетических рынков в России, вызывающим наибольшие дискуссии, является целесообразность достижения определенных ценовых паритетов между различными источниками энергии, условно называемыми уровнями межтопливной конкуренции. В частности, одним из возможных будущих элементов российского рынка газа является достижение уровня межтопливной конкуренции между газом и углем в электрогенерации. Результаты упрощенного анализа текущих затрат на производство электроэнергии говорят о том, что в настоящее время природный газ значительно более конкурентоспособен, чем уголь при производстве электроэнергии. При этом умеренный рост цен на природный газ на внутреннем рынке в среднесрочной перспективе не приведет к замещению газа углем со стороны производителей электроэнергии.
L72|Identificación y análisis de los tiempos improductivos en equipos de las principales actividades operativas del ciclo de producción de una mina subterránea Sublevel Stoping (Tajeo por Subniveles)|El presente trabajo de investigación tiene como objetivo identificar, clasificar, cuantificar y analizar los tiempos improductivos presentados en las principales actividades del ciclo de minado de una mina subterránea y como estos impactan en los tiempos dedicados a actividades esenciales del proceso, a partir, principalmente, de la metodología de la “Gestión Lean (Gestión Esbelta) en la Industria Minera” en la operación Sublevel Stoping (Tajeo por Subniveles) de la mina subterránea Cerro Lindo, propiedad de la Cía. Minera Milpo. Como resultado de la aplicación de la metodología Lean (Gestión Esbelta) en una mina de fluorita se tuvo inicialmente una distribución de la siguiente manera: 45.5% de actividades esenciales, 39.4% de actividades auxiliares y 15.1% de desperdicios. Pero a partir de acciones de mejoras, se obtuvo la siguiente distribución: 60.7% de actividades esenciales, 33.5% de actividades auxiliares y 5.8% de desperdicios o inútiles. Los resultados obtenidos en el presente estudio, son alentadores y muestran una gran oportunidad de mejora para la Unidad Minera. A continuación se describen los resultados del análisis. Los equipos analizados en la mina subterránea Cerro Lindo fueron, en primer lugar, los equipos de perforación de taladros largos, cuyos resultados iniciales tuvieron la siguiente distribución: 36.2% de actividades esenciales, 38.8% de actividades auxiliares y 25% de desperdicios. Pero con las acciones de mejora adecuadas, se obtendría 55.3% para las actividades esenciales, es decir, un incremento del 19.1%. En segundo lugar, se tienen los equipos de carguío, acarreo y descarga, cuyos resultados iniciales tuvieron la siguiente distribución: 45.3% de actividades esenciales, 43.6% de actividades auxiliares y 11.1% de desperdicios. Pero con las acciones de mejora adecuadas, se obtendría 61.7% para las actividades esenciales, es decir, un incremento del 18.1%. Y en tercer lugar, se tienen los equipos de perforación horizontal, con la siguiente distribución inicial: 26.5% de actividades esenciales, 53.8% de actividades auxiliares y 19.7% de desperdicios. Pero con las acciones de mejora adecuadas, se obtendría 48.6% para las actividades esenciales, es decir, un incremento del 22.1%. Como producto del incremento de las actividades esenciales, se podría incrementar la capacidad de producción hasta en 24,000 tpd, para los equipos de taladros largos y hasta de 27, 000 tpd para los equipos de carguío, acarreo y descarga. Para llevar a cabo este trabajo, se tomó los reportes por equipo que fueron llenados por los mismos operadores; para un periodo de 4 meses.

Se busca averiguar cuánto de la accidentalidad puede ser explicada por medio de este factor, así como de otros 4 relacionados a las condiciones de trabajo: el tamaño de la empresa, el nivel de automatización de las operaciones, el tipo de mina (tajo abierto o subterránea) y el nivel de tercerización de la fuerza laboral. Para esto se han realizado tres tipos de de análisis: Un estudio cualitativo de casos de operaciones mineras de algunas empresas en el que se puso mayor énfasis a los sistemas de trabajo y su influencia en la accidentabilidad, Un análisis descriptivo cualitativo por medio de encuestas de campo a supervisores mineros a fin de conocer su opinión respecto de los diversos determinantes de la accidentalidad, con énfasis en los 5 factores mencionados, Y finalmente: Un modelo cuantitativo basado en un análisis de regresión múltiple que considera como variables a los 5 factores mencionados para definir su poder explicativo respecto de la accidentabilidad.
L72|The mining sectors in Chile and Norway, ca. 1870 - 1940: the development of a knowledge gap|Chile and Norway are two ‘natural resource intensive economies’, which have had different development trajectories, yet are closely similar in industrial structure and geophysical conditions. The questions of how and why Chile and Norway have developed so differently are explored through an analysis of how knowledge accumulation occurred and how it was transformed by learning into technological innovation in mining, a sector which has long traditions in Norway and has by far been the largest export sector in Chile for centuries. Similar types of ‘knowledge organisations’ with the direct aim of developing knowledge for mining were developed in both countries. Formal mining education, scientifically trained professionals, organisations for technology transfer and geological mapping and ore surveys are compared in search of differences which may explain the underlying reasons for variations in economic growth.
L72|Eu – Russia And The Energy Dimension Of The Eastern Partnership|The Energy Union Strategy, launched in February 2015, is a vast project aiming at identifying a set of common responses to a series of present and future challenges in the field of energy. The question of energy security occupies a central position in EU’s relationships with its neighbours. In this context, economic and political ties with the Russian Federation in its role of major supplier of energy resources to EU member states are of crucial importance. Acquiring a higher degree of independence from the Russian supply of natural gas has been proclaimed as a national priority by several ex-Soviet republics. Moldova, Ukraine and Georgia have recently signed Association Agreements with the EU. We look into the early stages of the implementation of AA’s and analyse their consequences on the EU – Russia relations in the energy field. A series of common characteristics and possible developments in the field of energy are analysed.
L72|Natural Resources and FDI in GCC Countries|Natural resources are a blessing for some countries to attract FDI but cursed for others. Existing literature argues the suggestion that resource-rich countries attract less FDI because of resource (oil) price volatility. This study examines that natural resources discourage FDI in GCC countries (the FDI-Natural resources curse hypothesis), using panel data analysis for six oil dependent countries during 1980-2013 and applying several econometrics techniques. The main findings of this paper is that natural resources measured by oil rents have a negative association with FDI inflows; this negative impact is robust even when other FDI determinates of FDI are included. FDI inflows decreased between 0.15 and 0.92% when oil rents increased by 1%. In addition, the empirical results show that trade openness and labour force are the main factors that encourage FDI, while political instability and corruption deter FDI inflows into GCC countries.

Entre los ejemplos de éxito hay regiones que desde hace tiempo emprendieron procesos de internacionalización, innovación y reconversión industrial, lo que les ha llevado a desarrollar nuevas alternativas de producción y se ha traducido en un repoblamiento paulatino, pero hay otras en peor situación, y por ello es muy probable que se hagan presentes efectos no deseados, derivados de la eliminación de las ayudas y subvenciones comunitarias y estatales y la liberalización del mercado a la entrada de minerales de terceros países, a partir del 31 de diciembre de 2018. La presente investigación propone una herramienta metodológica para conocer con precisión la situación socioeconómica de las localidades y regiones, resultado de las políticas adoptadas en el pasado, a partir de lo cual se pueden desarrollar nuevas políticas que garanticen su continuidad y el bienestar de quienes viven en ellas. || The socioeconomic situation of European coalelds is highly heterogeneous. On the one hand, successful examples comprise regions that long ago embraced internationalization, innovation and/or restructuring strategies. In those regions where the aforementioned strategies were fruitful, the development of new production methods led to gradual repopulation. Less successful examples, however, are likely to experience undesired effects as a consequence of both the suppression of aid (EU- and regional- level) and the liberalization of EU mining markets, starting on December 31, 2018. This papers aims to provide a method to accurately assess the socioeconomic situation of these regions. As such a method is rooted in previous policies, it enables the identification of welfare-enhancing policies for the inhabitants of European coalfield regions."
L72|Evaluating the effect of upside and downside slope on flow hydraulic in cylindrical overflows by using Flow 3D software|Features and behavior of flow in hydraulic structures is one of the complex phenomena. Cylindrical overflow is a simple hydraulic structure which is used for energy dissipation, control and flow measurement. Hereof the sharp, wide and climactic edges overflows are used commonly. In water transmission and distribution systems, cylindrical overflows and crest- circular overflows because of being affordable and ease of fabrication compared with other overflows can be used for measurement of flow rate, evacuation buildings of flow water and controlling the level of water in canals and reservoirs. The water flow on overflow of dams and used overflows in water supply and sewage networks are some cases that a design engineer is in contact with them.
L72|¿Perdimos la oportunidad con el cobre?|Specific Mining Tax (IEM) was established in Chile in 2005, after a failed legislative discussion process that sought to install the figure of a royalty for the extraction and sale of minerals. However, although due to the significant increase in the price of copper mining was obliged to pay taxes -which had not done in previous years- in practice what made this new IEM was to reduce the overall rate of taxes paid by mining. This paper discusses the mechanism by which this happened, showing the collection figures of IEM in the context of mining production between 2003 and 2012, and simulating what mining really should have paid in contexts where not happen evasion or avoidance that characterized this sector during the copper prices boom.
L72|Mining Matters: Natural Resource Extraction and Local Business Constraints|We estimate the impact of local mining activity on the business constraints experienced by 22,150 firms across eight resource-rich countries. We find that with the presence of active mines, the business environment in the immediate vicinity (
L72|Investment and uncertainty with time to build: Evidence from entry into U.S. copper mining|The standard real-options model predicts that increased uncertainty discourages investment. When projects are large and take time to build, however, that prediction can be reversed. We investigate the investment/uncertainty relationship empirically using historical data on opening dates of new U.S. copper mines – large, irreversible projects with substantial construction lags. Both the timing of the decision to go forward and the price thresholds that trigger that decision are assessed. In particular, we build upon a reduced form analysis to construct a structural model of entry. We find that, in this market, greater uncertainty encourages investment and lowers the price thresholds for many mines.
L72|Critical raw material strategies in different world regions|The rising imbalance between increased demand for minerals and their tighter supply has resulted in growing concerns about their criticality. This has in turn stimulated both resource-rich and resource-poor countries to take active role in implementing mineral policy strategies. This paper explains why different world regions responded differently to the global problem of securing stable supply of critical minerals, in particular of rare earths. The paper first provides an in-depth overview of development trajectories of critical mineral strategies through a historical case study analysis of major stakeholder regions - China, the United States, Europe, Japan and Australia. Next, it offers answers as to why they have responded the way they did: how national interest considerations, resource endowment circumstances, countries’ historical experience in tackling supply risk and their respective policy styles influenced the development of critical mineral policy choices within a comparative political economy framework. The overall findings show distinctive differences in policy strategies towards critical materials. Whereas Europe opts for a policy dialogue with resource-rich countries, Japan and the United States have a more hands-on approach in research and development initiatives. Australia and China instead, strive to promote domestic mining activities and to protect their resources through resource nationalist policies.
L72|Evaluating regulatory approaches to mine closure in Kenya, Western Australia and Queensland| Many countries have been burdened with a legacy of unplanned mine closure. Inadequate and ineffective regulatory approaches to mine closure have resulted in legacy of abandoned mine sites, which rehabilitation costs are substantial liabilities to governments and communities. Although governments have been reviewing mine closure regulations to enhance their effectiveness, achievement of successful closure outcomes still remains a challenge. The purpose of this study was to evaluate how well existing regulatory approaches for Kenya, Western Australia and Queensland incorporate various aspects of mine closure. This is the first study to do this type of evaluation for regulatory approaches to mine closure. This study reviewed published literature to identify characteristics of mine closure success, and subsequently developed an analytical framework based on this review. Regulatory documents such as Acts, Bills, regulations, policies, guidelines and government reports were then assessed for inclusion of these characteristics in each case study area. The study found that regulatory approaches in the three case study areas do not incorporate all the aspects identified as requirements for successful mine closure. The study found that Western Australia and Queensland regulations were more comprehensive than Kenya. In addition, requirements that address socio-economic impacts of mine closure need to be incorporated in regulatory approaches in all study areas. This study indicates there is need to improve the existing regulatory approaches to mine closure in each study area, particularly Kenya, so that the regulation is more likely to have the desired effect of improved mine closure outcomes and success.
L72|La industria de la pizarra española en perspectiva histórica|The article analyses the birth and growth of the slate industry in Spain from a long-term perspective. It takes into account the limitations of the public statistics, the time series of production and employment that have been gathered since the early 20th century to the present day, and the stages of the long-term evolution of the slate sector, and inserting it within the international framework. From modest beginnings in the 16th century under royal patronage, the industry started its development at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. During the first third of the 20th century, the upward supply shows figures lower than the world market leaders. The gap was reduced in the 1960s when the slate industry was modernized, thanks to the French demand. Spain then became the international leader in the production and export of slate.

L72|Extractive industries and local development in the Peruvian Highlands|During the last twenty years, the mining sector in Peru has been experiencing sustained growth. Using Census, administrative, nationally and regionally representative data we compare districts in the Peruvian Highlands with a recent mining development with suitable counterfactuals. We find that the new mining activities attract migration inflows, and have some positive effects over educational indicators and these impacts, on average, are smaller in districts with lower levels of corporate social expenditure However, the results of this study suggest that the local potential welfare impact of the mining boom is largely untapped and corporate social responsibility has had a limited role in improving this effect<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L72|Are They Predisposed to the Resources Curse? Oil in Somalia|In many developing countries, natural resources such as oil and gas have had negative impact on economic development. There is a myriad of literature on “the resource curse” which shows an austere relationship: countries endowed with huge deposits of oil and gas usually experience lower economic growth than countries that do not have these resources. As a modern ‘frontier region’ Somalia is one of the most promising countries blessed with oil and gas in the Eastern part of Africa. However, it is faced with political upheavals, weak state structures, physical insecurity, and property rights full of ambiguities; this makes it a challenge to exploit the country of its hydrocarbons. In addition to the present tense conditions within the region, the question that lingers, is whether or not Somalia is set to struggle with the common effect of the ‘resource curse’ and paradox of plenty disorder? Somalia was selected because it provides an ideal laboratory to ascertain if she is predisposed to the ‘resources curse’ disease. To this end, the study examines and also outlines the primary themes that guide the work using the case of Somalia as an addition to the body of empirical knowledge. The study recommends that new governance structures should be built, existing ones should be built, local content and local participation should be enhanced and the security and judicial agencies should be supported.
L72|A Test of the Market Efficiency of the Integrated Latin American Market (MILA) Index in Relation to Changes in the Price of Oil|The purpose of this paper is to study if there is a Granger causality relationship between the price of oil and the prices of the stocks that compose the Integrated Latin American Market (MILA) index. Our analysis found that from the perspective of the efficient market hypothesis, there is no empirical evidence that there is a Granger causality relationship between the price of oil and other commodities and the stocks that compose the MILA index. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that based on the evidence, it is not possible to create an arbitrage strategy based on the price of oil and copper to achieve abnormal returns in the MILA stock market. In order to test for the Granger causality between the underlying variables, we used a leveraged bootstrap test developed by Hatemi (2012).
L72|The financial economics of gold — A survey|We review the literature on gold as an investment. We summarize a wide variety of literature, including the papers in this special issue of International Review of Financial Analysis to which this survey acts as an editorial introduction. We begin with a review of how the gold markets operate, including the underresearched leasing market; we proceed to examine research on physical gold demand and supply, gold mine economics and move onto analyses of gold as an investment. Additional sections provide context on gold market efficiency, the issue of gold market bubbles, gold's relation to inflation and interest rates, and the very nascent literature on the behavioural aspects of gold.
L72|Environmental regulation and competitiveness in the mining industry: Permitting processes with special focus on Finland, Sweden and Russia|This paper investigates to what extent and under what circumstances environmental regulation can be designed and implemented to jointly achieve positive environmental outcomes and sustained competitive strength in the mining industry. First the paper provides a conceptual analysis of the impacts of environmental regulations on mining competitiveness, including a discussion of how the environmental-competitiveness trade-off can be affected by various regulatory design and implementation strategies. Methodologically we distinguish between the flexibility, predictability and stringency of the regulations, and in a second step these analytical concepts are illustrated in the empirical context of the environmental permitting processes in Finland, Sweden and Russia. An important result is that in these countries there has been a lack of timeliness and predictability in the environmental regulations (e.g., uncertainty about the interpretation of the legislation, delays due to appeals etc.). These problems can in part be addressed by, for instance: (a) allocating more resources to the regulatory authorities; (b) establishing more consensus-based regulatory interactions between the mining industry and the authorities; and (c) introducing more standardized procedures and road maps for environmental impact assessments, permit applications and not the least for how to interpret specific legal rules in the context of mining.
L72|Variance of graphite import–export volume and price in China for 2003–2012: A time-series analysis|Graphite is one of the most important raw materials in modern industry. China contains an abundance of this resource and is the largest graphite producer, importer/exporter and consumer of high-performance graphite products worldwide. In the present paper, 416 data points depicting the monthly volume and price of graphite imports and exports in China from 2003 to the first half of 2012 were collected for analysis. A time series econometrics method was used to investigate the variance and causality relationship between the graphite import and export volumes. The results show a significant increase in China׳s graphite export volumes from 2003 to the first half of 2012. The graphite export volumes of the first half of 2012 were 329 thousand tons, representing a 53% increase compared to the same period in 2003. The annual average price of graphite exports has increased 43.4% in the last decade. A significant decrease in export volumes was noted most years during the two major Chinese holidays: the Chinese Spring Festival in February and National Day in October. The global financial crisis in 2008 caused a dramatic reduction in the growth rate of graphite import volumes, and the European debt crisis in 2011 caused both a decrease in import volumes and a rapid increase in export prices. The volume of graphite exports in China was more than 5.6 times higher than the volume of imports, but 52.2–138.4% of export earnings were spent on the import bill. There is a unidirectional causality relationship between graphite export volume and export price in China, but no causality relationship was found between graphite import volume and import price. The phenomena and factors identified above have implications for China׳s graphite industry development and graphite import and export trade.
L72|Thorium: Crustal abundance, joint production, and economic availability|Recently, interest in thorium׳s potential use in a nuclear fuel cycle has been renewed. Thorium is more abundant, at least on average, than uranium in the earth׳s crust and, therefore, could theoretically extend the use of nuclear energy technology beyond the economic limits of uranium resources. This paper provides an economic assessment of thorium availability by creating cumulative-availability and potential mining-industry cost curves, based on known thorium resources. These tools provide two perspectives on the economic availability of thorium. In the long term, physical quantities of thorium likely will not be a constraint on the development of a thorium fuel cycle. In the medium term, however, thorium supply may be limited by constraints associated with its production as a by-product of rare earth elements and heavy mineral sands. Environmental concerns, social issues, regulation, and technology also present issues for the medium and long term supply of thorium.
L72|Green supply chain practices evaluation in the mining industry using a joint rough sets and fuzzy TOPSIS methodology|Environmental issues from the extractive industries and especially mining are prevalent and maleficent. An effective way to manage these pernicious environmental problems is through organizational practices that include the broader supply chain. Green supply chain practices and their role in mining industry strategy and operations have not been comprehensively addressed. To address this gap in the literature, and building upon the literature in general green supply chain management and environmental decision tools, we introduce a comprehensive framework for green supply chain practices in the mining industry. The framework is categorized into six areas of practice, with detailed practices described and summarized. The green supply chain practices framework is useful for practical managerial decision making purposes such as programmatic evaluation. The framework may also be useful as a theoretical construct for empirical research on green supply chain practices in the mining industry. To exemplify the practical utility of the framework we introduce a multiple criteria evaluation of green supply programs using a novel multiple criteria approach that integrates rough set theory elements and fuzzy TOPSIS. Using illustrative data we provide an example of how the methodology can be used with the green supply chain practices framework for the mining industry. This paper sets the foundation for significant future research in green supply chain practices in the mining industry.
L72|Physical versus economic depletion of a nonrenewable natural resource|The present paper explores the relationship between physical and economic depletion of a nonrenewable natural resource using a decomposition of mining costs akin to the one used in the literature on productivity and technical change. We argue that this decomposition can provide key insights on future availability of nonrenewable natural resources. Using data on slate mining in Galicia (Northern Spain), we provide quantitative evidence of the role played by physical depletion in economic exhaustion but also of the offsetting effects of technical change. Additionally, we provide a measure of the effects on economic depletion of input prices, output, fixed inputs and production scale. Input prices and fixed input misallocation contributes far more to economic depletion than physical depletion while technical change has a remarkable negative contribution to economic depletion. Policy implications are discussed, particularly, the importance of promoting technical change.
L72|What do we know about the sharing of mineral resource rent in Africa?|Governments that lack the capacity to mine resources themselves have to attract foreign direct investment. However, since resources are not renewable, countries need to capture a ‘fair’ share of mineral resource rent to promote their development. While the sharp rise of the world prices of most minerals multiplied the total natural resources rents by 2.3 between 2002 and 2008 (World Bank, 2015), tax revenue earned by African governments from the non-renewable natural resource sector only grew by a factor of 1.5 (Mansour, 2014).The sharing of mineral resource rent between governments and investors is often criticised for being unfavourable to African governments. But what do we really know about the sharing of mineral resource rent in Africa? The aim of this study is to review theoretical and empirical studies on rent sharing in Africa and to note their limitations regarding knowledge of the actual sharing of mineral rent.
L72|The rise and fall of an industry: Entry in U.S. copper mining, 1835–1986|The principal forces that led to the rise and fall of the U.S. copper industry are explored: cost-lowering technical change, formation of expectations, consolidation of the industry, and depletion of investment opportunities. I find that the introduction of the steam shovel, which enabled open-pit mining, was the most important technological breakthrough. Revisions of expectations of success were statistically significant but economically less important. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, concentration of ownership encouraged entry. Finally, depletion was primarily responsible for the decline in entry in later years. However, the same forces that led to success also contributed to decline.

However, since resources are not renewable, countries need to capture a ‘fair' share of mineral resource rent to promote their development. While the third raw materials super cycle increased the global turnover of the mining sector by a factor of 4.6 between 2002 and 2010, the tax revenues from the non-renewable natural resource sector earned by African governments only grew by a factor of 1.15. The sharing of mineral resource rent between governments and investors is often criticised for being unfavourable to African governments. But what do we really know about the mineral resource rent sharing in Africa? The aim of this study is to review theoretical and empirical studies on rent sharing in Africa and note their limits for the knowledge of the actual mineral rent sharing.

L72|World Copper Market Outlook: 2003-2014|This paper presents synthetically the copper market outlook (demand, supply, and prices) during 2003-2014, highlighting the impact of economic crisis of 2008-2009 on the world copper market. During the crisis, the decline in demand caused increases in excess supply of metal, as the supply has followed an upward trend, contributing to the imbalances of the copper market and putting pressure on stock prices at LME London Metal Exchange.
L72|Productivity, Safety, and Regulation in Underground Coal Mining: Evidence from Disasters and Fatalities|Underground coal mining is a dangerous industry where the regulatory state may impose tradeoffs between productivity and safety. We recover the marginal tradeoffs using disasters near a mine as shocks that increase future accident costs. We find that in the second year after a disaster, productivity decreases 11% and accident rates decrease 18-80% for mines in the same state, with some evidence that the number of managers increases. Using published “value of statistical life” and injury cost estimates, we find that the productivity loss following a disaster in the same state costs 2.51 times the value of the safety increases.
L72|The Mining for Development Framework for the Philippines|Mineral extraction alone is not sufficient to trigger sustainable development in developing countries. The mainstream paradigm on mining for development suggests that mineral-rich developing countries need to formulate a fiscal policy that can balance the need to maximize fiscal revenue while ensuring that the country has an attractive investment climate. The presence of mining companies in poor remote communities is sufficient to initiate development. In this discussion, it is suggested that the fiscal policy should take into account the state of governance where mining is being conducted, the extent of linkages mining creates in the local economy and whether the Regalian doctrine applies to ownership of minerals. The raise-to-the-bottom approach in designing fiscal policies does not necessarily benefit mineral-rich developing countries. In the case of the Philippines, a more comprehensive development framework is necessary to ensure that mining contribute to the sustainable development of the Philippines. The framework should include: (1) good governance of the public and extractive sectors which entails institutionalization of transparency and accountability mechanisms, implementation of the United Nations guiding principles on business and human rights and strengthening of government's regulatory capacity; (2) effective allocative capacity and capacity to effectively manage the returns from the sector by the government so that the proceeds from mining contribute to sustainable development and ensure intergenerational equity; (3) establishment of linkages between the extractive sector and the rest of the economy to maximize the benefit of the extractive activity; and (4) fiscal policy that reflects fair share in the extraction of resources, the state of mining governance and the environment where extraction is conducted. Fair share in mining includes payment for the minerals owned by the government on top of the regular taxes the government imposes to all industries.
L72|Nappe flow regime energy loss in stepped chutes equipped with reverse inclined steps: experimental development|With advances in technology and the invention of the Roller-Compacted Concrete (R.C.C) technique, stepped spillway construction has become much faster than in the past. Due to this, designers have become more interested in using this kind of chute as one of the best energy dissipaters. Along with the increasing use of stepped spillways, researchers have focused on increasing the efficiency of this hydraulic structure. They have proposed different methods to achieve this. Step geometry optimization, regarding flow regime type, is one of these efforts. In this experimental research, reverse inclined steps have been applied for three degrees (7o, 10 o, and 12o) to investigate their effect on the energy dissipation rate in the Nappe Flow Regime of stepped spillways. Energy loss rates obtained from the reverse inclined steps have been compared with the energy loss rate in a horizontal step. Results indicate a slight increase in the energy loss rate when the reverse inclined steps have been applied in the Nappe Flow Regime of stepped spillways.
L72|A Test of the Theory of Nonrenewable Resources - Controlling for Exploration and Market Power|Despite the central role of the Hotelling model within the theory of nonrenewable resources, tests of the model are rarely found. If existent, these tests tend to ignore two key features, namely market power and exploration. We therefore suggest an extension of the basic Hotelling framework to incorporate exploration activity and market power and propose an implicit price behavior test of the model to indicate whether ﬁrms undergo inter-temporal optimization. When applied to a newly constructed data set for the uranium mining industry, the null hypothesis of the ﬁrm optimizing inter-temporally is rejected in all settings. However, parameter estimates of the model still yield valuable information on cost structure, resource scarcity and market power. Our results suggest that the shadow price of the resource in situ is comparably small and may be overshadowed by market power, which may serve as an explanation for the ﬁrm failing to optimize inter-temporally.
L72|An industrial district around a mining resource: the case of marble of Macael in Almería|Marble quarries in Macael have been exploited since ancient times but its complex industrial district had to wait till the fifties to emerge. This industrial district includes extraction, processing and marketing activities. In the 1980s some development programmes were designed in order to modernize and boost the marble sector. Since then, it has become an international reference for ornamental stones. The sector has undergone a great transformation: from being a mining agglomeration to become an industrial district. This shift has provided the district with a great dynamism and resilience. Moreover, its competition position has considerably changed. It used to be based on comparative advantages but nowadays it is based on competitive advantages. In its heart a nodal enterprise Cosentino has emerged, which has become an international leader on a global scale.
L72|Supply Disruptions and Regional Price Effects in a Spatial Oligopoly—An Application to the Global Gas Market| Supply shocks in the global gas market may affect countries differently, as the market is regionally interlinked but not perfectly integrated. Additionally, high supply-side concentration may expose countries to market power in different ways. To evaluate the strategic position of importing countries with regard to gas supplies, we disentangle the import price into different components and characterize each component as price increasing or price decreasing. Because of the complexity of the interrelations in the global gas market, we use an equilibrium model programmed as a mixed complementarity problem (MCP) and simulate the blockage of liquefied natural gas (LNG) flows through the Strait of Hormuz. This enables us to account for the oligopolistic nature and the asymmetry of the gas supply. We find that Japan faces the most severe price increases, as the Japanese gas demand completely relies on LNG supply. In contrast, European countries such as the UK benefit from good interconnection to the continental pipeline system and domestic price taking production, both of which help to mitigate an increase in physical costs of supply as well as in the exercise of market power.

Finalmente, el estudio presenta una serie de recomendaciones de política con el fin de facilitar su aprovechamiento industrial y comercial.
L72|Definición y análisis de alternativas para desarrollar un plan de choque en el sector productor de carbón al interior del país|La minería del carbón en Colombia ha tenido un mayor dinamismo en los últimos años tanto porque los precios internacionales aumentaron hasta 2011 como porque se ha expandido la producción. Con la evolución reciente de los precios hacia abajo surgen preguntas sobre el comportamiento de este sector en el futuro y su incidencia en las cuentas fiscales, las exportaciones y las regalías, así como en la inversión extranjera. En particular, la situación de los productores carboneros a pequeña y mediana escala, en el interior del país, les ha llevado a pedir una atención especial de las autoridades. Por ello, la UPME solicitó a FEDESARROLLO un análisis de los instrumentos de política pública que podrían ser usados para estabilizar los ingresos de estos productores, tales como mecanismos para reducir las fluctuaciones de los precios al productor como medidas que contribuyan a mejorar la competitividad de este producto.
L72|L'évaluation comptable des réserves et ressources des entreprises de l'industrie extractive|This research contributes to the problem of economic and accounting valuation of the assets reserves and resources in the extractive industry. It aims to answer the following question: What are the economic values of reserves and resources that are recognized by corporate accounting and what are, in cas of a choice between several types of values, the reasons for these choices? It shows in the first part there is only partial matching between economic values and accounting values that favors neoclassical economic theory. It shows, in the second part, that different accounting methods coexist in the six countries studied, taking int consideration the interests of majors and juniors companies in this industry. The third part of the thesis analyzes the IASB's standard-setting process and underlines the influence of the majors power and the indirect influence of the juniors. This thesis is a continuation of research in critical accounting

Specifically, it proposes a socioeconomic rank of the regions, and it also builds a rank which identifies: i) the will of the firms to start processes of industrial reconversion; ii) the internationalization of at least one part of the processes; and iii), to know which are the regions that, given the circumstances, are most likely destined to disappear.
L72|A parsimonious model of tax avoidance and distortions in petroleum exploration and development|We present a simple model of petroleum exploration and development that can be applied to study the performance of alternative tax systems and identify potential distortions. Although the model is highly simplified, it incorporates many factors and some of the key tradeoffs that would influence an investor's investment behavior. The model recognizes the role of enhanced oil recovery and treats the impact of taxation on exploration and development in an integrated manner consistent with an investor's joint optimization of investments at both stages of the process. The model is simple and user-friendly, which facilitates application to a broad range of problems.

L72|Foresight as a tool for sustainable development in natural resources: The case of mineral extraction in Afghanistan|This subjective essay uses the six pillars approach of future studies to address the futures of mineral extraction in Afghanistan. The analysis through this methodology is directed at decision makers and stakeholders as they evaluate the role of minerals in the Afghan economy and intends to inform public policies regarding mineral extraction beyond sectoral silo focus. The future space is visualized through the six pillars approach with accompanying methods and by identifying patterns of change. There is a valid risk of greatly over-estimating the economic and strategic opportunities offered by Afghanistan's newly discovered mineral wealth. Afghanistan also risks being infected with the resource curse. The essay concludes with policy recommendations to realize the potential of this gift of nature, most efficiently and equitably and to also use them as a means of effective socio-economic development and prosperity.
L72|Business and development: Changing discourses in the extractive industries|This paper identifies how organisational field dynamics have changed over time within the field of business and development. Using the extractive industries as the empirical setting, development agency policy documents and corporate reports are analysed in order to identify convergence and divergence of discourses and changing institutional logics. The business-development organisational field became structured around a new variant of development managerialism in the early 2000s. Business became recognised as a core partner in devising and implementing market-driven development solutions. Thus, the logic of partnership for economic growth dominated this time period. In the late 2000s a divergence in the business and development organisational field is identified. Attempts by UNDP and other international organisations to temper market-driven development have given rise to the logic of good governance whereas the logic of partnership for development continues to drive that of the extractive industries. It will be interesting to explore in the future how these organisational fields compete or self-reinforce over time. The field of business and development, dominated by development managerialism, could become more fragmented or could move towards convergence and restructuration.
L72|The effect of a change in pricing regime on iron ore prices|This paper performs a quantitative analysis of iron ore prices. The analysis will focus on two general issues. First, are prices more volatile before or after the introduction of spot market pricing in 2008/2009? Second, has the change in pricing regime had a significant effect on the iron ore price? The quantitative analysis uses monthly data between January 2003 and August 2012. The overall results show that when including transportation costs to the price series we do not find that iron ore prices are more volatile after the introduction of spot market pricing. Furthermore, the change in pricing regime does not have a significant impact on the iron ore price in the econometric model. Iron ore prices, GDP growth in China, and the freight rates are found to be cointegrated (when regressed with a market dummy variable), and the short run results indicates that GDP growth in China has the strongest impact on the iron ore price series for the period tested.
L72|Institutional conditions for Swedish metal production: A comparison of subsidies to metal mining and metal recycling|This article examines and contrasts the level of Swedish governmental subsidies to two different ways of producing metal: the metal recycling sector and the metal mining sector. In 2010, the metal mining sector was subsidized by € 40 million and the metal recycling sector € 0.6 million. If the exemption from landfill tax is considered a subsidy, the level of subsidization to the metal mining sector changes drastically to approximately € 4000 million. Regardless of how the concept “subsidy” is defined, the metal mining sector in total and per tonne of metal produced is fundamentally more highly subsidized than the metal recycling sector. The value added per tonne of metal produced for the metal recycling sector appears to be higher than for the metal mining sector. The current dominant trend in the Swedish mineral strategy is nevertheless to increase the level of subsidization to the metal mining sector.
L72|Maintaining legitimacy of a contested practice: How the minerals industry understands its ‘social licence to operate’|Recent decades have witnessed growing concern among communities, governments and other stakeholders regarding the adverse social and environmental impacts of corporate activity. This concern has generated various interdiscursive notions, such as corporate social responsibility (CSR), corporate citizenship, the stakeholder concept, and sustainable development (SD), that purport to enable managers to manage business in a ‘responsible’ or ‘sustainable’ manner. This discursive landscape now commonly includes ‘social licence’ or ‘social licence to operate’, a term that has gained greatest currency in the minerals industry. Literature on social licence is sparse, but encapsulates a diversity of notions such as demands and expectations, legitimacy, credibility, and trust, and free, prior and informed consent. Perhaps most fundamentally, the concept of social licence suggests that stakeholders may threaten a company’s legitimacy and ability to operate through boycotts, picketing, or legal challenges. Yet this interpretation of legitimacy does not mean that stakeholders have the same capacity as regulators to grant or withhold an operation’s right to exist. How, then, do managers within companies under these pressures themselves understand social licence? We present findings of interviews with 16 managers in the minerals industry in Australia. We explore how these managers conceptualise social licence in relation to notions such as legitimacy, approval, and consent, how they interpret processes of social licence in practice, and how they differentiate it from concepts such as CSR. Managers’ conceptualisations can be categorised into four broad themes: legitimacy; localisation; process and continuum; and manageability. These findings suggest that, while social licence potentially represents a shift in power relations, this shift is constrained by discursive pressures to legitimise mining operations, to restrict social licence issues to the local level, to minimise regulatory impositions, to marginalise dissent, and to manage reputation. Opportunities for strengthening and adapting current understandings of social licence are considered.
L72|Uranium and nuclear power: The role of exploration information in framing public policy|As the importance of addressing climate change increases the future global role for nuclear power, the demand for uranium will increase. Expanded uranium reserves will be needed to meet this increased demand, highlighting the importance of future exploratory efforts. To shed light on the social desirability of future exploration levels I analyze a past expansionary period in the U.S. uranium industry. I find exploration levels were smaller than socially efficient during this period, resulting from a deviation between the private and social values of information. Looking forward, public policies can encourage optimal exploration levels by addressing this deviation.
L72|Additional market incentives for abatement: An analysis of flue-gas desulfurization by-products|Energy and environmental regulations often result in by-products that can reduce compliance costs. This research evaluates a unique case in which the marketability of gypsum by-product produced from sulfur dioxide (SO2) scrubbing operations at coal-fired electric plants has a theoretically ambiguous impact on pollution emissions. Intuitively, the ability to market flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) gypsum provides incentives for electricity generating plants to operate their scrubbers more efficiently by providing gypsum revenues, and lowering gypsum disposal costs. Gypsum marketability also creates incentives for plants to burn coal with higher sulfur content in order to increase their gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O) production. The overall impact of FGD gypsum marketability on boiler-level SO2 emissions is therefore the empirical question of interest. Electricity boiler-level fixed-effect estimations suggest annual SO2 emissions decline by 3494tons (39%) as a result of gypsum marketing. An upper bound on the total external benefits associated with the reduced SO2 emissions is estimated at $350.6 billion (2011$), or roughly 2.1% of the total benefits of the U.S. Clean Air Act (CAA) from 1990 to 2010.
L72|Russia’s Oil and Gas Sector in 2013|Oil and gas comprise the main sector of the Russian economy that continues to play a key role in shaping the state budget revenues and the balance of trade. In 2013, against the background of continuing high global prices for oil and gas, petroleum production in Russia reached its highest level since 1990, and the export of oil and petroleum products reached a historic high. However, there was then a slowdown in petroleum production and a worsening of conditions for its production. In 2013, in order to create appropriate conditions for the further development of the oil and gas sector legislative solutions were adopted involving tax incentives for the development of resources where oil recovery was difficult, the differentiation of gas production taxation and the application of a special tax regime for deposits being developed on the continental shelf, together with a liberalisation of the export of liquefied natural gas (LNG)?

L72|Mining and Indonesia’s Economy: Institutions and Value Adding, 1870-2010|Indonesia has long been a major producer of minerals for international markets. Starting in 2014, it implemented legislation banning exports of unprocessed minerals and requiring producers to invest in processing facilities to add more value before export. This paper establishes what light past experiences in Indonesia with mining sheds on this recent development. It quantifies and discusses the growth of mining production in Indonesia since 1870. It analyses the institutional arrangements that past governments used to maximise resource rents and domestic value adding. The paper finds that production and exports of mining commodities were long dominated by oil, but increased and diversified over time, particularly since the 1960s. The development of the mining sector depended on changes in market prices, mining technologies and the cost of production, but particularly on the institutional arrangements that guided the decisions of foreign investors to commit to mining production and processing in Indonesia.

L72|Oil Consumption and Economic Growth: Evidence from Nigeria|This study has examined the causality relationship between oil consumption and economic growth in Nigeria during the period of 1980-2011 . The Johansenâ€™s maximum likelihood cointegration technique and Granger causality tests are applied. Based on the cointegration test results, it was found that oil consumption has no long equilibrium relationship with economic growth. The Granger causality test revealed the unidirectional causality running from oil consumption to economic growth. Therefore, the results of this study showed clearly that oil consumption plays an important role in the economic growth of Nigeria as any efforts to conserve oil will have a negative repercussion on economic growth.

L72|Australia’s mining productivity decline: implications for MFP measurement|This paper investigates the mining sector’s poor productivity performance as measured by the growth accounting formula for multifactor productivity (MFP) index during the recent mining boom in Australia. We provide an alternative measure of productivity growth by estimating a translog variable cost function, with parameters that separate productivity growth due to technical change from that due to the effects of returns to scale, capacity utilisation and natural resource inputs. The results show that the average MFP growth in Australian mining based on the dual cost-function measure of technical change is 2 % over the sample period 1974–1975 to 2007–2008, rather than −0.2 % from the published index. The difference arises because declining natural resource inputs, the effects of capacity utilisation and returns to scale have all reduced the ‘true’ MFP growth.

L72|Investigating the influence of firm characteristics on the ability to exercise market power: A stochastic frontier analysis approach with an application to the iron ore market|This paper empirically analyzes the existence of market power in the global iron ore market during the period 1993-2012 using an innovative Stochastic Frontier Analysis approach introduced by Kumbhakar et al. (2012). In contrast to traditional econometric procedures, this approach allows for the estimation of firm- and time-specific Lerner indices and, therefore, the assessment of the influence of individual firm characteristics on the ability to generate markups. We find that markups on average amount to 20%. Moreover, location and experience are identified to be the most important determinants of the magnitude of firm-specific markups.
L72|Possibilities For Improvement Of Risk Management Practices In The Coal Mining Industry Of The Federation Of Bosnia And Herzegovina|"Current business environment and growing exposure to a wide range of risks require companies (especially the large ones) to raise a question of risk management, start treating it as a particular business function that needs special attention and for which they have to seek proper solutions within their organizational structure. This particularly affects the coal industry, where risk exposure is rather evident and makes risk management one of the key management issues in general. A central point of the analysis includes companies in the coal industry of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (F B&H), where the management needs to be greatly concerned about protection against risks that affect this industry much more than other industries, in particular pure risks (those that involve only the possibility of loss and no possibility of gain). And if we add the so-called emerging or ""newly developing"" risks, which are still unknown even to risk management experts, it is clear that management of large companies have to take care of risk management culture development and seek adequate organizational solutions. On the basis of the conducted empirical research, the paper will show and appropriately explain the descriptive analysis results, accordingly used for establishment of the level of risk management efficiency in the coal mines of the F B&H and identification of certain weaknesses, whose elimination could significantly improve the process and increase the level of economic protection for these companies."
L72|An introduction to the economics of rare earths|The aim of this paper is to examine the supply risk of rare earths and its impact on low carbon technologies deployment. Bringing together seemingly disconnected strands of scientific literature, this multidisciplinary approach allows to provide an overarching overview of the economics of rare earths. In terms of supply risk, as opposed to the common belief, it is not Chinas dominant position per se, but its industrial policies which distort the rare earths market. On the demand side, the results of this paper disprove the widespread allegation that availability risk impedes deployment of offshore wind. Contrary to this, a potential supply shortage of rare earths would disrupt the further development of the automotive industry and its electrification. Ultimately, uncertainty about volatile prices and threat of supply shortages induce manufacturers to shift away from technologies containing rare earths, and thus render innovation in these economically nonviable.
L72|When one country's land gain is another country's land loss...: The social, ecological and economic dimensions of sand extraction in the context of world-systems analysis exemplified by Singapore's sand imports|Singapore industrialised rapidly with continuously high growth rates since its independence in 1965 and its population during the same period of time almost tripled. With development at this scale, Singapore had to grow in number of industrial and residential buildings as well as in size through land reclamations; both requiring high amounts of sand. The country itself contains hardly any natural resources and, consequently, depends highly on other countries (mainly Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia and Vietnam) for its sand supply. All major sand supplying countries successively prohibited sand exports to Singapore beginning in 1997, since they were burdened with the social and economic costs that resulted from sand extraction. World-systems theory helps to explain the sand situation within the framework of the core/periphery hierarchy and the zero-sum game world-systems approach by arguing that Singapore, being an upper semi-peripheral country, could develop rapidly at the expense of the other countries which are found below Singapore in the core/periphery concept. Furthermore, it is shown that Singapore's resource strategy of importing large quantities of sand has helped its upward movement from a peripheral to an upper semi-peripheral country.

L72|Natural Resources and Local Communities: Evidence from a Peruvian Gold Mine|This paper examines the local economic impact of Yanacocha, a large gold mine in Northern Peru. Using annual household data from 1997 to 2006, we find evidence of a positive effect of the mine?s demand for local inputs on real income. The effects are only present in the supply market and surrounding areas, and reach unskilled workers in non-mining sectors. Consistent with a general equilibrium framework, we also find an increase in the local price of nontradable goods. Taken together, our results underline the potential of backward linkages from extractive industries to create positive spillovers in less developed economies. (JEL L72, O13, O18, Q32, Q33, R11)
L72|The Organizational Benefits Generated By The Membership To A Conglomerate Of Regional Clustering Type. The Implications Of ‘Rosia Montana Project‘ On Creating A Mining Cluster In The ‘Apuseni Mountains‘ Area From Romania|Starting from Michael Porter‘s statement, according to which the cluster, the simpleconcentration, pack or spatial, territorial agglomeration of SMEs, specialized in a field (service,product, knowledge) or interrelated areas, can generate sustainable competitive advantages in themarket (including global) in this sector of specialization, in this article I will try to address theissue regarding to the implementation of regional cluster concept and of sustainable regionaldevelopment in the ‘Apuseni Mountains‘ area, taking into account as nucleus the mining projectfrom Rosia Montana (Romania), which could represent a real lever and a good example forstimulating the mining industry competitiveness, both at regional and also at national level. Theidea of designing a regional cluster model, that has as ‘motor drive‘ the mining project from RosiaMontana, which otherwise should be like a point of ‘concentric radiance‘ in the purpose oflaunching of new economic activities and of developing of new specialized firms, could contributeto the increase of employment and of competitiveness of the companies in the region and implicitlyto the improvement of the life of communities in which the cluster will be implemented, bringingalso significant benefits to the Romanian state, both directly, but also indirectly through themultiplier effect and thus providing an example of good practice for other initiators of regionalclusters.
L72|Do SMEs' linkages with Large Mining Firms improve their performance? Evaluating heterogeneity among firms|In recent decades, several countries have proposed the promotion of mining clusters as a local development strategy. One of the expected results of this type of policy is the formation of a critical mass of local SMEs able to grow and export internationally. It is assumed that to achieve this result the vertical linkages between mining companies and SMEs favor the growth and competitiveness of local mining suppliers. This assumption, however, has not been verified. This paper analyzes whether the relationship between SME suppliers and large mining companies implies more growth in sales an labor. We study the case of the Antofagasta Region, one of the main miningareas in Latin America, where, since 2001, the government ha been promoting the formation of a mining cluster. We estimate an ordinal Probit model with random parameters, using panel data with a simple of more tan 500 SMEs from the Antofagasta Region, with information from the period 2003-2009. This methodology allows us to estimate whether first and second tier SME suppliers of the mining industry have, on average, better performance tan other SMEs and, also, which is the heterogeneity of results within each of these groups of SMEs.
L72|Best practices of the SME mining suppliers in the Antofagasta region of Chile|In regions whose industrial structure is organized around one or more large firm corporations, the best practices of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) depend on where firms are located in the supply chain. This paper studies 351 SMEs in the Antofagasta Region in Chile between 2007 and 2008, where multinational and public mining companies are the drivers of the local economy and the government is promoting the formation of a mining cluster. Structural equation model (SEM) is used to show that first-tier SME mining suppliers, directly related to large corporations, follow business practices that promote international certification, quality control and investment in innovation, while in contrast second-tier SMEs are more focused on avoiding insolvency and client orientation. These results cast doubt on the formation of a mining cluster in the region and suggest the need for differentiated policies in these two groups of SMEs, especially those related to knowledge transfer.
L72|Gold prices: Analyzing its cyclical behavior|ABSTRACT: Gold is a commodity that is seen as a safe haven when a financial crisis strikes, but when stock markets are prosperous, these are more attractive investment alternatives, and so the gold cycle goes on and on. The DJIA/GF (Dow Jones Industrial Average and Gold Fix ratio) is chosen to establish the evolution of gold prices in relation to the NYSE. This paper has two goals: to prove that the DJIA/GF ratio is strongly cyclical by using Fourier analysis and to set a predictive neural networks model to forecast the behavior of this ratio during 2011-2020. To this end, business cycle events like the Great Depression along with the 1970s crisis, and the 1950s boom along with the world economic recovery of the 1990s are contrasted in light of the mentioned ratio. Gold prices are found to evolve cyclically with a dominant period of 37 years and are mainly affected by energy prices, financial markets and macroeconomic indicators. RESUMEN: El oro es un bien básico que se ve como refugio cuando una crisis financiera acontece; pero cuando los mercados de valores son prósperos, las acciones son una alternativa más atractiva, y así se da el ciclo del oro. El DJIA/GF (relación entre el Índice Industrial Dow Jones y el precio del oro) permite establecer la evolución de los precios del oro en relación con el NYSE. Este trabajo tiene dos objetivos: demostrar que la relación DJIA/ GF es fuertemente cíclica usando análisis de Fourier, y establecer un modelo de redes neuronales para predecir el comportamiento de esta relación durante 2011-2020. Para ello, eventos económicos cíclicos como la Gran Depresión junto con la crisis de los años 70, y el auge de los años 50 junto con la recuperación de los 90, se contrastan a la luz de la relación DJIA/GF. Se encuentra que los precios del oro evolucionan cíclicamente con un periodo dominante de 37 años y están afectados principalmente por los precios de los energéticos, los mercados financieros e indicadores macroeconómicos.
L72|Gold mine feasibility study disclosure in Australia: Determinants and implications|This study investigates disclosure practices for gold development companies in their feasibility studies. The information environment around feasibility studies released by developmental stage enterprises in the Australian gold mining industry is characterised by little in the way of disclosure guidance or rules. This contrasts with Canadian disclosure requirements which are highly prescriptive. Using a sample of 85 Australian gold feasibility studies, we develop a new voluntary disclosure index and consider three problems. First, we examine the association between levels of voluntary disclosure in the feasibility study and external involvement. Second, we consider whether levels of voluntary disclosure are associated with successful debt financing. Third, we analyse the relationship between levels of voluntary disclosure and a successful project outcome. Voluntary disclosure is found to be driven by the presence of an external feasibility manager and the number of external consultants named in the feasibility release. Our evidence also finds that voluntary disclosure levels are positively related to debt financing availability and project success, suggesting voluntary disclosure levels are a useful signal of project quality.
L72|Lithium availability in the EU27 for battery-driven vehicles: The impact of recycling and substitution on the confrontation between supply and demand until2050|The adverse impacts of climate change are widely recognized as well as the importance of the mitigation of carbon dioxide (CO2). Battery driven vehicles are expected to have a bright future, since GHG emissions can be reduced. Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries appear to be the most promising, due to their high energy density. Recently, the discussion concerning adequate lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) resources is resolved. The current challenge is the needed increase in flow rate of Li2CO3 into society to foresee in forecasted demand. This research determines ten factors which influence the availability of Li-ion batteries for the EU27 in the coming decades. They are used in a system dynamics analysis. The results of this research show that undersupply can be expected in the EU27 until 2045 somewhere between 0.5Mt and 2.8Mt. Substitution of Li2CO3 in other end-use markets and recycling can relieve the strain on Li2CO3 supply to some extent. In 2050, 20% of the vehicle fleet in the EU27 can be battery electric vehicles (BEVs). The lack of resources in the EU27 and the geographical distribution of lithium in politically sensitive areas suggest that the shares of lithium available for the EU27 will be less than assumed in this research. The increase in flow rate shows to be the bottle-neck for a transition to (partly) battery driven vehicles in the EU27, at least when Li-ion batteries are used. Focusing on large-scale application of BEVs with Li-ion batteries in order to substantially mitigate CO2 emissions in transport is a futile campaign.
L72|An uncertainty based multi-criteria ranking system for open pit mining cut-off grade strategy selection|Cut-off grade strategy (COGS) is a concept that directly influences the financial, technical, economical, and environmental issues in relation to the exploitation of a mineral resource. Despite the simple definition of cut-off grade, the COGS problem is one of the complex and complicated problems in the mine planning process. From the optimization point of view, the COGS with an objective of maximizing the present value of future cash flows is a non-linear and a non-convex problem that even in its deterministic form can be solved using approximate optimization methods. This optimization problem will also be more complex and complicated under uncertainty conditions. This paper proposes an uncertainty based multi-criteria ranking system to investigate the problem of COGS selection considering metal price and geological uncertainties. The proposed system aims at selection of the best COGS among technically feasible alternative COGSs under uncertainty circumstances. Our developed system is based on integrating metal price and geological uncertainties as well as operating flexibility to close the mine early. We incorporate this operating flexibility into the proposed system using a Monte Carlo based real options (RO) valuation model. For this purpose, in addition to the expected value, other risk criteria are considered to rank the alternatives. These risk criteria include abilities of strategies in producing extra profits, minimizing losses, and achieving the predefined goals of the production. In this study, the technically possible COGSs are generated using the Lane comprehensive algorithm. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, we utilize data of an Iranian gold mine. Results show that the proposed system outperforms conventional methods in the sense that it shows significantly lower average mis-ranking than the other methods and also selects a strategy with a higher value. The sensitivity analysis of the proposed system relative to the gold price shows that the system is highly dependent on the parameters of the stochastic process used to model the evolution of the metal price. Therefore, special consideration should be given in estimating stochastic process parameters.
L72|An analysis of future platinum resources, emissions and waste streams using a system dynamic model of its intentional and non-intentional flows and stocks|Platinum is increasingly used intentionally and non-intentionally in several applications. This has raised the concern about its future resources, emissions and losses during its life cycle. On the one hand, increasing platinum emissions might affect human health. On the other hand, the accumulated platinum in mineral waste, soil, landfill sites and construction materials as a result of the emissions, losses and the utilization of secondary materials can be seen as potential resources for platinum. This paper is aimed at (1) analyzing the long term impacts of the use of platinum intentionally and non-intentionally on its future demand and supply, release to the environment and accumulation in mineral waste, soil, landfill sites and construction materials and (2) quantifying the amount of platinum in secondary materials that would be available for platinum future supply. The analysis is carried out on a global level using a system dynamic model of platinum intentional and non-intentional flows and stocks. The analysis is based on four scenarios for the introduction of fuel cell vehicles (FCVs). The results show that platinum demand is increasing overtime in all scenarios at different rates and its identified resources are expected to deplete before the end of the century with or without the introduction of FCVs. The release of platinum to the environment and the accumulation in soil are expected to decrease when conventional ICE vehicles is replaced by FCVs. The amount of platinum accumulated in mineral waste, soil, landfill sites and construction materials by the time platinum is depleted are more than double its identified resources and would be potential resources for platinum that are available in different parts of the world. The methodology presented in this paper can be used in the assessment of other technologies and other metals.
L72|New mercantilism: A perspective on how politics is shaping world metal supply|The major countries consuming metals tended historically to be also the major countries producing them. It was in their interest to promote mine development to provide low cost raw materials. Over the past fifty years, the share of global production accounted for by consuming countries has declined and producers and consumers of metals have been slowly moving into separate camps having distinct and differing interests. As a consequence of this, governments of producing countries have become more focused on how to maximise the benefit of metal extraction to their economies rather than on how to supply cheap raw materials; a tendency which has found expression in resource nationalism. Governments of consuming countries have in response become increasingly concerned about the implications of this tendency to their economic development and some countries, most notably China, have adopted robust policies to secure their supplies. Through their actions to influence capital flows within the mining industry and to force metals trade into channels which better serve their national interests (a process characterised here as ‘new mercantilism’), metal producing and metal consuming countries are reshaping global supply.
L72|How to evaluate raw material supply risks—an overview|Some strategic raw materials do have an extremely unsecure supply situation. Several working groups around the world have made criticality assessments for metallic raw materials to analyze the driving impact factors for this instability. However, the influences on raw material availability are manifold and therefore criticality assessment methods are very heterogeneous. Here we give an overview about the differences and similarities of supply risk evaluation in 15 criticality assessment methods. We take the example of Indium, which has been rated in 60% of these criticality studies, and show which data base is used for supply risk evaluation. Our results show a lack of consensus about which indicators give reliable information for raw material supply risk and how these indicators should be aggregated. We anticipate our essay to be a starting point for more justified indicator selection and weighting in criticality assessments.
L72|The forgotten resource curse: South Africa's poor experience with mineral extraction|Studies of the resource curse as it affects African states abound, yet few deal specifically with the experiences of South Africa. The inability of countries to convert natural resource wealth into income and improved development measures remains highly pertinent and is especially apparent in Africa's largest economy. This paper takes a unique approach to study the resource curse by comparing South Africa's political economy with the existing resource curse literature. Using data from international organisations, studies of poverty and qualitative evidence this paper examines South Africa's experience with mineral extraction. It is found that South Africa has experienced many of the symptoms outlined in the resource curse literature including relatively slow GDP growth, gross inequalities, entrenched poverty and the creation of a rentier state. Overall, it is concluded that South Africa has failed to benefit from natural resource wealth and can be classified as a resource cursed state. Not only has mineral wealth failed to benefit much of South Africa's population, sections of society have actually been harmed through the process of mineral extraction. This paper is the first to examine South Africa in light of the current resource curse literature and to conclude that the state far more closely resembles its sub-Saharan African neighbours than its upper-middle income peers.
L72|Russian Oil and Gas Sector in 2012|Oil and gas production remain the core sector of Russia economy, which has a leading role in generating federal budget revenue and this country’s balance of trade. The factors that exerted the most significant influence on the development of the oil and gas sector of the Russian economy in 2012 were the situation on the world oil market; the situation on the European gas market; and the objective deterioration of the conditions for the extraction of oil and natural gas, which is associated with a declining production at the ‘old’ deposits and the considerably higher costs of the development of new ones, especially in unpopulated areas with no infrastructure..
L72|Estimating the impact on efficiency of the adoption of a voluntary environmental standard: an empirical study of the global copper mining industry|This paper uses data on the world’s copper mining industry to measure the impact on efficiency of the adoption of the ISO 14001 environmental standard. Anecdotal and case study literature suggests that firms are motivated to adopt this standard so as to achieve greater efficiency through changes in operating procedures and processes. Using plant level panel data from 1992 to 2007 on most of the world’s industrial copper mines, the study uses stochastic frontier methods to investigate the effects of ISO adoption. The variety of models used in this study find that adoption either tends to improve efficiency or has no impact on efficiency, but no evidence is found that ISO adoption decreases efficiency.

L72|Gold prices: Analyzing its cyclical behavior|Gold is a commodity that is seen as a safe haven when a financial crisis strikes, but when stock markets are prosperous, these are more attractive investment alternatives, and so the gold cycle goes on and on. The DJIA/GF (Dow Jones Industrial Average and Gold Fix ratio) is chosen to establish the evolution of gold prices in relation to the NYSE. This paper has two goals: to prove that the DJIA/GF ratio is strongly cyclical by using Fourier analysis and to set a predictive neural networks model to forecast the behavior of this ratio during 2011-2020. To this end, business cycle events like the Great Depression along with the 1970s crisis, and the 1950s boom along with the world economic recovery of the 1990s are contrasted in light of the mentioned ratio. Gold prices are found to evolve cyclically with a dominant period of 37 years and are mainly affected by energy prices, financial markets and macroeconomic indicators.
L72|Cyclical and Secular Determinants of Productivity in the Copper, Aluminum, Iron Ore, and Coal Industries|Over the past decade both labor and multifactor productivity have fallen in copper, iron ore, coal, and many other mining operations, causing production costs to rise. This decline, following years of rising productivity, has led many to conclude that new technology can no longer offset the adverse effects of resource depletion. As a result, real mineral commodity prices will be permanently higher in the future. This article questions this hypothesis. It first provides a conceptual analysis that shows that much or perhaps even all of the recent drop in productivity could be due to the unanticipated growth in market demand and the sharp jump in prices it provoked. It then surveys a number of the available empirical studies of productivity trends. For copper, iron ore, and coal, it finds substantial support for the view that much of the recent drop in productivity can be attributed to higher prices. Aluminum on the other hand did not experience the same jump in real price over the 2000s. Nor did it suffer a significant drop in productivity. These findings have important implications. In particular, they suggest that new technology may well continue to offset most or all of the cost-increasing effects of resource depletion. If so, real commodity prices will be lower over the long run than many now assume. This possibility has important consequences for mineral producing firms making large investments in future capacity, for mineral producing countries dependent on revenues from mining, and for society as a whole in terms of the long-run availability of non-renewable commodities and the future threat of mineral depletion.
L72|Afganistan And Rare Earths|On our planet, over a quarter of new technologies for the economic production of industrial goods, are using rare earths, which are also called critical minerals and industries that rely on these precious items being worth of an estimated nearly five trillion dollars, or 5 percent of world gross domestic product. In the near future, competition will increase for the control of rare earth minerals embedded in high-tech products. Rare minerals are in the twenty-first century what oil accounted for in the twentieth century and coal in the nineteenth century: the engine of a new industrial revolution. Future energy will be produced increasingly by more sophisticated technological equipment based not just on steel and concrete, but incorporating significant quantities of metals and rare earths. Widespread application of these technologies will result in an exponential increase in demand for such minerals, and what is worrying is that minerals of this type are almost nowhere to be found in Europe and in other industrialized countries in the world, such as U.S. and Japan, but only in some Asian countries, like China and Afghanistan.
L72|Measures Supporting Minerals and Primary Metals Extraction and Processing: Case Study: Australia|Efforts to document government support benefiting specific sectors or industries have so far paid scant attention to support given to the non-energy minerals sector. In this paper the issue of support for this sector is explored by way of a case study of Australia, a leading producer and exporter of minerals. After describing the mining sector in the context of the Australian economy and the role of government in the exploitation of the country’s vast resources, the study identifies and document support measures based on the OECD’s framework for organising and analysing support to the fossil-fuel sector. The study finds that government support to the mining industry is relatively limited. Measures through which the Australian federal government assists the mining industry tax concessions related to corporate expenditure on R&D and on exploration and other expenditure, a fuel-tax rebate and the provision of geoscientific data at zero or minimal cost. The State governments provide preferential electricity prices to aluminium smelters. Monetary estimates of the cost to government of these measures are provided where available.
L72|Economics of Export Restrictions as Applied to Industrial Raw Materials|Governments intervene in non-renewable natural resources sectors more than in many others, including through the use of export taxes and quotas. Industrial raw materials sectors are characterized by a number of specificities: production is often geographically concentrated, firms are often large with substantial market power, production processes are highly capital intensive, products are relatively homogeneous and potentially substantial differences in costs of production are prevalent. This paper aims to increase understanding of the economic effects of export restrictions, in particular as they apply to the mining sector. It ascertains the prevalence of export restrictions on metals and minerals, proposes a Cournot-Nash model of export restrictions, suggests some of the economic effects due to the presence of export restrictions, and draws some implications for trade policy among producing and consuming countries of non-renewable natural resources.
L72|Mining Rehabilitation Planning, Mining Heritage Tourism, Benefits and Contingent Valuation|This article approaches the values underpinning derelict mining rehabilitation plans, their assessment in monetary terms, and reviews the empirical studies literature on this theme. The paper correspondingly contains four main aims. The first involves putting into perspective the thematic content on the rehabilitation of derelict and depressed mining areas, transforming them into mining heritage tourism products designed to trigger sustainable regional development. The second aim, concerns defining the range of benefits and values potentially arising. The third seeks to demonstrate and discuss why and how the theoretical frameworks of Total Economic Value (TEV) and economic valuation, taken together with the contingent valuation approach, enable the monetary estimation of the range of non-market individual values, through eliciting the individual’s willingness to pay (WTP) for the rehabilitation. And the fourth objective incorporates reviewing the literature on empirical studies estimating the monetary values of mining rehabilitation plans through recourse to the Contingent Valuation (CV) approach. We proceed by demonstrating that TEV, the economic valuation concept and CV are approaches appropriate to estimating the aforementioned benefits; we defend their utility as important inputs to raising the efficiency of political decision making processes and ensure local populations actively comply and participate in the rehabilitation process. Finally, we conclude that the empirical studies hitherto applied for estimating the monetary values of mining rehabilitation and remediation through recourse to CV remain very few despite the fact that this estimation type is increasingly recognised as an important tool in decision making processes on the rehabilitation of industrial cultural heritage in general, and mining heritage in particular.
L72|The economic integration of Europe and the problem of international specialized communities|This article focuses on the features and the working of the European Coal and Steel Community, seen as a first step in the ongoing process of European Integration. In Vito’s view the integration process would bear many economic advantages not only for the high concentrated sectors of Steel and Coal, but also in agriculture and transportation. While not ignoring the complex adjustment problem arising from the closure of less efficient firms and the unemployment costs arising from it, Vito underlines economic and social advantages of the 1952 Paris Agreement for the economy as a whole: cost reduction; better terms of trade; technical improvements; development of capital equipment; new outlays for export production and international migration. Moreover the establishment of a common market in Europe would strengthen the sense of solidarity and trust in a common heritage of culture and values, laying down the foundations of a durable peace in Europe.
L72|Optimal Tariffs on Exhaustible Resources: The Case of a Quantity Setting Cartel|We formulate a dynamic game model of trade in an exhaustible resource with a quantity-setting cartel. We compute the feedback Nash equilibrium and two Stackelberg equilibria under two different leadership scenarios: leadership by the strategic importing country, and leadership by the exporting cartel. We numerically show that as compared to the Nash equilibrium, both players are better off if the importing country is the leader. The follower is worse off if the exporting cartel is the leader. Among the three game-theoretic outcomes, the world welfare is highest under the importing country's leadership and lowest under the exporting country’s leadership.
L72|Kurz zum Klima: Bis zum letzten Tropfen|Der technologische Fortschritt, der in den letzten Jahren im Bereich grüner, also emissionsfreier und/oder nachhaltiger Biokraftstoffe erzielt wurde, reicht nicht aus, um den weltweit wachsenden Energiebedarf zu bedienen. Stattdessen ist absehbar, dass neben Kohle immer mehr unkonventionelle Ölvorkommen abgebaut werden. Der vorliegende »Kurz zum Klima«-Artikel gibt einen Überblick über die Entwicklung der weltweiten Produktion von konventionellem und unkonventionellem Öl und zeigt die Implikationen dieser Entwicklung sowohl für das Klima als auch für die Machtverhältnisse auf dem globalen Ölmarkt. Die Folgen für das Klima ergeben sich vor allem aus der wachsenden Bedeutung der Produktion von unkonventionellem Öl, das abgesehen von weiteren umweltschädlichen Externalitäten im Vergleich zu konventionellem Öl wesentlich höhere Emissionen aufweist. Neben den Klimaimplikationen ist auch mit Verschiebungen der Machtverhältnisse auf dem weltweiten Ölmarkt zu rechnen. So werden beispielsweise die USA bis 2035 ihre Ölproduktion deutlich steigern können, je nach unterstelltem Entwicklungsszenario sogar Länder wie Saudi-Arabien in der Produktion überholen.
L72|Optimal Tariffs On Exhaustible Resources: The Case Of Quantity-Setting|Constructing a dynamic game model of trade of an exhaustible resource, this paper compares feedback Nash and Stackelberg equilibria. We consider two different leadership scenarios: leadership by the importing country, and leadership by the exporting country. We numerically show that as compared to the Nash equilibrium, both countries are better off if the importing country is a leader, but that the follower is worse off if the exporting country is a leader. Consequently, the world welfare is highest under the importing country's leadership and lowest under the exporting country's leadership.

L72|Evidence of Market Power in the Atlantic Steam Coal Market Using Oligopoly Models with a Competitive Fringe|Before 2004 South Africa was the dominant steam coal exporter to the European market. However a new market situation with rising global demand and prices makes room for a new entrant: Russia. The hypothesis investigated in this paper is that the three incumbent dominant firms located in South Africa and Colombia reacted to that new situation by exerting market power and withheld quantities from the market in 2004 and 2005. Three market structure scenarios of oligopoly with a competitive fringe are developed to investigate this hypothesis: a Stackelberg model with a cartel, a Stackelberg model with a Cournot-oligopoly as leader and a Nash-bargaining model. The model with a Cournot oligopoly as leader delivers the best reproduction of the actual market situation meaning that the dominant players exert market power in a non-cooperative way without profit sharing. Furthermore some methodological clarifications regarding the modeling of markets with dominant players and a competitive fringe are made. In particular we show that the use of mixed aggregated conjectural variations can lead to outcomes that are inconsistent with the actions of rational profit-maximizing players.
L72|Chinaâ€™s Growth and Its Impact on Resource Demand and The Iron Ore Trade|The paper sets out what has been driving Chinese demand for resources and outlines the main features of the growth of Chinese resource consumption. It explains the impact of Chinese growth on the Australian economy and examines the future of Chinese resource demand. It reviews the potential to supply Chinese resource (and in particular, iron ore) demand and looks at some policy questions that confront China, as a major resource-procuring economy seeking resource security through foreign investment, and resource-supplying countries, such as Australia, in the context of the growth of Chinese demand. The paper argues that increased supply capacity in Africa and elsewhere in the world is likely to put downward pressure on iron ore (and potentially other resource) prices as new projects come on stream over the next five years.
L72|West and Central African Iron Ore: A Lesson in the Contestability of the Iron Ore Market|The paper briefly sets out factors behind Chinese demand for iron ore imports and the main features of China's medium term resources consumption growth path. It then outlines the potential of major iron ore export countries to meet China's medium term iron ore import demands. The focus of the paper in on the potential of iron ore supplies from west and central Africa to enter the export market over the short and medium terms. To assess this, three export capacity scenarios (low, medium and high risk) are constructed for 17 iron ore mines (over 27 production expansion phases) in west and central Africa. The result suggest the development of west and central African iron ore has the potential to create significant downward pressure on the price of iron ore exports over the short to medium term. The impact of the excess export capacity on iron ore price is estimated and it suggests that there would be significant knock-off effects for iron ore-centric economies such as Australia and Brazil.

L72|Economic risk and mineral taxation on Indigenous lands|Mining generates risk of environmental and social harm for Indigenous peoples but can also generate substantial revenues for them, creating opportunities for community development in a context where economic and social disadvantage is the norm. Especially as mining revenues should, in part, compensate for mining’s negative social and environmental impacts, it is vital that mineral taxation on Indigenous lands reflect a careful assessment of appropriate tax mechanisms and a matching of these with community priorities. Yet little has been written that could serve as a guide for Indigenous decision makers. This article contributes to an understanding of the issues and choices facing Indigenous communities in designing mineral taxation regimes, by focusing on the question of economic risk. Risk arises as a key variable in choosing or designing a mineral taxation regime in three ways. Different approaches to mineral taxation are inherently more or less risky, in the sense that they are more or less certain to generate tax revenues. A second aspect of risk involves the degree of economic certainty or predictability associated with different types of commodities and projects. Third, the risk tolerance of Indigenous peoples and communities can vary significantly. We show how Indigenous groups can integrate and address these different dimensions of risk, by recognising the ‘risk consequences’ associated with different approaches to mineral taxation and choosing an approach that reflects, as fully as possible, the group’s risk tolerance.
L72|Multiproduct mine output and the case of mining waste utilization|This article addresses the concepts of economies of scope and multiproduct production, subadditivity and transray convexity as it applies to the mining industry. The article goes on to expand these concepts to include the case of mining waste utilization. It discusses how the modification of mining wastes into a marketable product can develop a relationship across the cost functions of the modified mining waste and ore production and how this interrelationship affects the profit maximizing condition. It discusses four possible outcomes from mining waste modification and its development into marketable products on the profitability and production of ore by the firm. Finally, it discusses mining waste utilization effects on rehabilitation costs and the potential for a decrease in the adverse community effects due to mine closure.
L72|Is corporate social responsibility possible in the mining sector? Evidence from Catalan companies|This paper examines the role and diffusion of corporate social responsibility (CSR) management, especially in relation with the adoption of other management systems, in small and medium sized companies in the surface mining industry in Catalonia (Spain). Specifically, it identifies the most salient CSR practices, procedures and metrics and the profiles of companies more prone to adopt them. To fulfill this aim, a survey has been conducted. Results show that mining companies are familiar with CSR practices, but there is not much formalization of procedures and measurement systems of CSR yet. Results show that the majority of socially responsible practices are related to environmental issues and therefore there is a relation between CSR and the application of environmental management systems. The analysis reveals that the management of CSR activities improves with the diffusion of knowledge on CSR practices. A second survey collected the opinion of professional associations in the sector. Respondents indicate that an improvement in CSR management will lead to a better global competitive position.
L72|Some observations on copper yields and ore grades|The paper examines trends in the average copper content of mined ores over the years. It has tended to decline over the long term, but by no means evenly. US averages are not typical of global averages, at least in the past four decades. Those have been both higher, and less volatile than in the US. One reason for falling averages is a change in the type of deposit mined, with a rise in the share of relatively low grade porphyry deposits. The different nature of their deposits is reflected in marked differences in grades between the different continents. African and Australian average grades are higher than the global average, and changes in the share of Central Africa in global output have affected the global average grade. Yields are have been consistently lower in North America than elsewhere, and Latin American average grades have trended downwards, reflecting both the ageing of mines and the rising share of production from porphyry deposits. Typically the yield of mines declines over time as mining proceeds. The average copper content of ore deposits is usually below the average yield of the ore accessed in the early years of production. The initial grades of new mines have not declined over the past forty years, and there has been no perceptible tendency for the average grade of porphyry deposits brought into production to decline over time. There is no apparent correlation between average grade and deposit size, but mine operators tend to exploit economies of scale to offset low grades. The relationship between the annual percentage yields (the head grade) and the reserve grades of deposits is not static. In recent years head grades have fallen closer to reserve grades. The relationship may be affected by movements in metal prices. Although the evidence about the influence of prices is not clear-cut, it does suggest that prices and cut-off grades may be inversely related. As many ores contain other valuable metals besides copper, copper yields will sometimes be subordinated to the extraction of these other metals. Copper equivalent grades have not moved in the same way as copper grades alone.
L72|Corporate Social Responsibility in the extractive industries: Experiences from developing countries|This paper introduces a special issue on ‘Corporate Social Responsibility in the extractive industries: experiences from developing countries’. Drawing upon case study analysis from Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, the papers in this issue broaden understanding of how multinational mining and oil and gas companies have embraced the CSR challenge and responded to criticisms of their performance in developing countries. This paper provides an introduction to the debate on CSR in the extractive industries in developing countries, reviewing the key issues examined on this subject to date.
L72|Mission impossible?: Adopting a CSR-based business model for extractive industries in developing countries|Corporations in the extractive industries often state their commitment to “corporate social responsibility” principles, but their actual implementation of these principles, particularly in developing countries, is questionable. This contradiction between rhetoric and reality is attributable to the fact that these companies have not fully integrated CSR into their business models. This can been seen in assessments of projects' costs and benefits, project and technology selection, respect for community consent, and performance incentive structures. The Marlin gold mine in Guatemala provides a concrete example of these sharp contradictions between stated CSR commitments and actual performance.
L72|A clash of cultures (and lawyers): Anglo Platinum and mine-affected communities in Limpopo Province, South Africa|The human rights related controversies surrounding Anglo Platinum's Mogalakwena mine in South Africa's Limpopo Province hit the world stage in 2008, attracting public scrutiny and instigating much debate in the realm of international business and human rights discussions. We provide an in-depth analysis of the controversies at Mogalakwena, and Anglo Platinum's responses. This case study contributes to ongoing debates on mining company-community relations in the context of the emerging business and human rights agenda, specifically with respect to the notion of human rights ‘due diligence’. We argue that the Mogalakwena case study illustrates the risks of companies adhering to and emphasizing the technical and logistical facets of due diligence, without sufficient attention to the relational, communicative and emergent aspects, which are closely tied to corporate culture. We highlight the complexities of company-community relationships, with particular reference to the issues of legitimate community representation and participatory decision-making, and discuss the role that organizational culture plays in exacerbating or mitigating corporate-community conflict. The case study demonstrates how legal challenges often exacerbate rather than resolve the conflicts that arise due to a clash between corporate and community cultures. We suggest the need for corporate leaders to become more conscious of this cultural dimension of effective social management, particularly when interacting with communities whose cultures are markedly different from those of business corporations.
L72|Linkages in Ghana's gold mining industry: Challenging the enclave thesis|By 2009, Ghana was the second-ranked African producer after South Africa, and had become the world's ninth largest producer of gold, at some 3.8% of global production, up from 2.6% five years earlier. Gold production volumes and revenues rose significantly over the decade from 2000. Yet gold mining tends to be perceived negatively in Ghana, and is seen as providing far less than it should in terms of public revenue, employment, skills development and spillovers, and localised economic development. Gold mining is often depicted as having an enclave status, disconnected and isolated from the rest of the economy. In contrast, the research findings here demonstrate that after a period of strong investment and growth, gold mining can no longer be viewed as an enclave activity: it is in fact more deeply linked into the Ghanaian economy than hitherto understood, through a set of as yet under-researched but promising economic linkages, notably backward linkages, which can potentially be strengthened by policy and support measures.
L72|The view from below: ‘lock-in’ and local procurement in the African gold mining sector|Through linkage creation, commodity extraction has the capacity to support local industrial production and capabilities building. Drawing on the experience of supplying inputs into the East African gold mining industry, this paper examines the constraints experienced by local suppliers arising from the purchasing procedures of large mining corporations and specialist construction companies contracted to construct these mines. Lead firms become locked-in to particular ways of working which minimise the opportunities that local suppliers have in providing products and services. After reviewing the situation for local mining suppliers in East Africa, the paper examines ways in which lead firms, the suppliers themselves and others (governments and industry associations) can better support local supplier involvement.

L72|Long-term effects of public policy for displaced workers in Sweden: Shipyard workers in the west and miners in the north|Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study the long-term effects of policy measures for displaced workers. The focus is on the individuals affected by the closure of the Uddevalla Shipyard in western Sweden in 1985 and the cutbacks at the LKAB mines in northern Sweden in 1983. Design/methodology/approach - These workers not only experienced job loss, but were also target groups for extraordinary labour market policies. Using register data from Statistics Sweden (labour market status, earnings, education etc.), the authors follow those affected until 1999, comparing their experiences with the development of a large sample of other workers who lost their jobs because of plant closures in 1987-1988 but who did not receive extraordinary measures. Findings - Estimations of the net effect of the extraordinary measures find that they did have positive long-term effects for the displaced shipyard workers and miners. They have higher employment, not higher unemployment, and higher earnings than the comparison group. Originality/value - The authors are not aware of any previous research on the effects of labour market policy addressing displacement in the long term.
