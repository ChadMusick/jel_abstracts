O19|A Survey on the Washington Consensus and the Beijing Model: Reconciling Development Perspectives|Reconciling the two dominant development models of the Washington Consensus (WC) and Beijing Model (BM) remains a critical challenge in the literature. The challenge is even more demanding when emerging development paradigms like the Liberal Institutional Pluralism (LIP) and New Structural Economics (NSE) schools have to be integrated. While the latter has recognized both State and market failures but failed to provide a unified theory, the former has left the challenging concern of how institutional diversity matter in the development process. We synthesize perspectives from recently published papers on development and Sino-African relations in order to present the relevance of both the WC and BM in the long-term and short-run respectively. While the paper postulates for a unified theory by reconciling the WC and the BM to complement the NSE, it at the same time presents a case for economic rights and political rights as short-run and long-run development priorities respectively. By attempting to reconcile the WC with the BM, the study contributes at the same to macroeconomic NSE literature of unifying a development theory and to the LIP literature on institutional preferences with stages of development. Hence, the proposed reconciliation takes into account the structural and institutional realities of nations at different stages of the process of development.
O19|Chinese aid and local ethnic identification|Recent empirical evidence suggests that Chinese development finance may be particularly prone to elite capture and patronage spending. If aid ends up in the pockets of political elites and their ethno-regional networks, this may exacerbate grievances based in horizontal inequalities. Against this background, the present study investigates whether the implementation of Chinese development projects fuels local ethnic identities. A new geo-referenced dataset on the subnational allocation of Chinese development finance projects to Africa over the 2000-2014 period is geographically matched with survey data for 94,954 respondents from 18 African countries. The identification strategy consists in comparing sites where a Chinese project was under implementation at the time of the interview, to sites where a Chinese project will appear subsequently but where implementation had not yet started at the time of the survey. While suggesting substantial country variation, the empirical results indeed suggest that, on average, living near an ongoing Chinese project fuels ethnic identification. I consider two mechanisms possibly underlying this result. First, competition for the inflow of resources that aid constitutes could mobilize ethnic identities across the board. Second, perceptions of ethnically biased aid may fuel ethnic identities in groups perceiving themselves as disadvantaged. Two observations speak in favour of the latter mechanism. First, the estimated effect is not uniform across groups, but driven by people belonging to the out-group. Second, there is no indication of an equivalent pattern when considering development projects of other donors. Replicating the key analysis for World Bank projects as well as for other bilateral donors, the results in fact indicate the reverse, i.e. that living near an ongoing as opposed to a future project comes with weaker ethnic identification.
O19|Cross-border knowledge flows through R&D FDI: Implications for low- and middle-income countries|R&D related foreign direct investments represent a powerful mechanism for cross-border knowledge sharing that can stimulate the process of technological catch-up. However, low-income countries and smaller middle-income countries remain largely excluded from this kind of global flows of knowledge. In this chapter, we discuss the motivations and implications of this type of FDI for low and middle income countries, building on a critical review of the existing literature and analyse the trajectory of R&D FDI during the period 2003-2017 by region and industry. The data is used as a point of departure to discuss potential policies specially tailored for low and middle income countries and their capacity to attract and anchor R&D related FDI for technological catch up. The paper finalizes outlining a future research agenda.
O19|Measuring the Spatial Misallocation of Labor: The Returns to India-Gulf Guest Work in a Natural Experiment|‘Guest workers’ earn higher wages overseas on temporary low-skill employment visas. This wage effect can quantify global inefficiencies in the pure spatial allocation of labor between poorer and richer countries. But rigorous estimates are rare, complicated by migrant self-selection. This paper tests the effects of guest work on Indian applicants to a construction job in the United Arab Emirates, where a crisis exogenously influenced job placement. Guest work raised the return to labor by a factor of four, implying large spatial inefficiency. Short-term effects on households were modest. Effects on information, debt, and later migration were incompatible with systematic fraud.

O19|Higher multilateral development bank lending, unchanged capital resources and triple-A rating. A possible trinity after all?|This paper contributes to the literature on Multilateral Development Banks’ (MDBs) balance sheet optimization in two ways. First, it looks at solutions to alleviate the ‘trilemma’ faced by MDBs – stemming from G20 shareholders’ calls for increasing development lending while, simultaneously, keeping capital resources and triple-A credit ratings unchanged. The employment of rating methodologies that take into account MDBs’ peculiarities more appropriately represents one viable solution, as it would allow them to significantly increase available lending capacity for given rating levels and equity resources. Second, the econometric evidence suggests the existence of a rather narrow difference in the cost of funding between triple-A and AA+ rated institutions. Combining the two results, the paper concludes that applying an alternative rating methodology and opting for an AA+ credit rating (instead of triple-A), the four MDBs considered (IBRD, ADB, IADB and AfDB) could more than triple their spare lending capacity, from USD 415 bn to 1.370 bn, with a relatively limited impact on funding costs, estimated at between 40 and 50 bps.
O19|CO2-Steuer, Zertifikate-Handel und Innovationsförderung als Klimapolitik-Instrumente|Eine CO2-Steuer einzuführen für nicht vom CO2-Zertifkate-Handel erfasste Sektoren erscheint als ökonomisch-ökologisch vernünftig für Deutschland und andere OECDLänder. Die Steuer sollte weitgehend aufkommensneutral sein, könnte aber mit einem geringen Anteil zeitweise auch eine verstärkte emissionsmindernde Innovationsförderung finanzieren, die wiederum die ökonomischen Lasten von Zertifikatehandel und CO2-Steuer zu mindern hilft. Der Zertifikate-Handel ist grundsätzlich ökonomisch effizient, sofern man langfristig einen global einheitlichen Preis für Zertifikate erreicht – das ist angesichts der Zielmarke für eine weitgehende CO2-Neutralität des Wirtschaftens in der EU bis 2050 eine mittelfristig anzugehende Aufgabe, wobei zudem die CO2-Steuerhöhe nahe beim Zertifikatepreis liegen sollte. Hier gibt es eine wichtige Aufgabe bzw. Option für die deutsche EU-Ratspräsidentschaft in der zweiten Jahreshälfte 2020. Steueraspekte der Innovationsförderung und speziell auch klimafreundlicher Innovationsdynamik sind zu bedenken.
O19|Is favoritism a threat to Chinese aid effectiveness? A subnational analysis of Chinese development projects|Chinese aid comes with few strings attached, allowing recipient country leaders to use it for domestic political purposes. The vulnerability of Chinese aid to political capture has prompted speculation that it may be economically ineffective, or even harmful. We test these claims by estimating the effect of Chinese aid on subnational economic development - as measured by per-capita nighttime light emissions - and whether this effect is different in politically favored jurisdictions than in other parts of the country. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, we do not nd that the local receipt of Chinese aid undermines economic development outcomes at either the district level or provincial level. Nor does political favoritism in the allocation of Chinese aid towards the home regions of recipient country leaders reduce its effectiveness. Our results - from 709 provinces and 5,835 districts within 47 African countries from 2001-2012 - demonstrate that Chinese aid improves local development outcomes, regardless of whether such aid is allocated to politically consequential jurisdictions.

O19|Trade, Technology and the Great Divergence|"This paper develops a model that captures the key features of the Industrial Revolution and the Great Divergence between the industrializing \North"" and the lagging \South."" In particular, a convincing story is needed for why North-South divergence occurred so dramatically during the late 19th Century, a good hundred years after the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution. To this end we construct a trade/growth model that includes both endogenous biased technologies and intercontinental trade. The Industrial Revolution began as a sequence of unskilled-labor intensive innovations which initially incited fertil- ity increases and limited human capital formation in both the North and the South. The subsequent co-evolution of trade and technological growth however fostered an inevitable di- vergence in living standards - the South increasingly specialized in production that worsened their terms of trade and spurred even greater fertility increases and educational declines. Biased technological changes in both regions only reinforced this pattern. The model high- lights how pronounced divergence ultimately arose from interactions between specialization from trade and technological forces."
O19|Allocation of implementing power: Evidence from World Bank projects|In this paper we explore the factors that determine the level at which World Bank projects are implemented. In particular, focusing on the importance of informational asymmetry between levels of government, we empirically assess whether this choice is influenced by the relative importance of local information at the recipient country level. Using an AidData dataset that provides information on more than 5800 World Bank projects for the period 1995-2014, and controlling for characteristics at both country and project level, we find that transparency does influence the probability that a project is implemented locally rather than nationally. More specifically, a one standard deviation decline in transparency increases the probability that a World Bank project will be implemented locally by 3 percent.
O19|FDI, multinationals and structural change in developing countries|Economic development can be defined as a process in which output growth is accompanied by qualitative changes in the structures of production and employment. Can FDI affect this process? This paper looks for answers in two ways. First, it reviews the extant knowledge about the relationship between MNE activity and economic development in developing countries. Core theoretical and conceptual issues are presented and the key findings of both microeconomic (FDI linkages and spillovers) and macroeconomic (FDI-growth nexus) empirical studies are discussed. The main message of both streams of literature is that FDI has the potential to catalyse development, but actual outcomes are contingent on several factors, such as the absorptive capacity of domestic firms and the level of development of local financial markets. Second, the paper addresses the relationship between FDI and structural change more directly, in a cross-country context, using a two-step estimation approach that is consistent with both theoretical arguments and previous empirical findings which suggest that the FDI-development nexus is highly country-specific. The results confirm such heterogeneity and suggest that the interaction between the sectoral concentration of FDI and the development stage of the country plays a role in determining the development impact of FDI.
O19|Japan's productivity and GDP growth: The role of GBAORD, public and foreign R&D|We analyse the dynamic interaction of Japan's total factor productivity (TFP), GDP, domestic and foreign private and public R&D as well as mission-oriented R&D, GBAORD, in a cointegrated VAR for Japan with data from 1988-2014. Analysis of effects of permanent shocks shows that (i) public R&D, unlike GBAORD, encourages private R&D and TFP, and has high internal rates of return. (ii) Japan's public and private R&D have a statistically significant positive effect on foreign private and public R&D stocks and vice versa. (iii) After transitory GDP shocks, public and private R&D are counter-cyclical and GBAORD is pro-cyclical in Japan.
O19|Does the World Bank Move Markets?|This paper examines the impact of World Bank loans on borrowing country equity markets. We exploit a rich dataset with World Bank loan commitments and stock market returns at the monthly level, allowing us to study short run market reactions to news about loan commitments. Given ex ante uncertainty over the influx of resources, we expect a positive overall response to loan size in terms of the local stock market returns. To address potential endogeneity, we use a supply-push instrument based on countries' historic budget shares and the overall World Bank budget. Estimation results point to a sizable positive short run impact of World Bank loan commitments on local markets that may reduce the cost of capital for local entrepreneurs.

O19|Global Value Chains in economic development|Global Value Chains (GVCs) started to play an increasing and key role in the global economy from the 1990s on. The market mechanism in GVCs supports industrialisation in the Global South and under certain conditions product and process upgrading. But GVCs do not lead to the catching-up of countries in the sense of them approaching real GDP per capita levels comparable with developed countries. These arguments are supported by a critical interpretation of the traditional trade theory, the New Trade Theory and specific approaches to explain GVCs, especially different governance structures and power relationships. Several case studies support these arguments. For catching-up, countries need comprehensive horizontal and vertical industrial policy and policies for social coherence. The small number of countries which managed to catch up did this in different variations.
O19|Trade policies supporting women's economic empowerment: Trends in WTO members|This paper looks at the various trade policies WTO Members have put into place to foster women's economic empowerment. The analysis below is based on the information provided by WTO Members as part of their Trade Policy Review (TPRs) process from 2014 to 2018. Reports from the WTO Secretariat, governments as well as the question and answer sessions were examined for the purpose of this paper.1 In the last 4 years, the trade policies of 111 WTO Members were under review. About 70% of them have reported at least one trade policy targeting women's economic empowerment. Overall, in four years, almost half of the WTO membership has implemented trade policies in support of women (at least one). Most (about 70%) of the WTO Members2 under review have integrated women's empowerment in their national or regional trade strategy. They focused their policy activity to three main areas or sectors: * Financial and non-financial incentives to the private sector and women owned/led Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs): 30% of members3 have focused their trade policies in support of women owned/led companies. * Agriculture and fishery: 15.5 % of members4 under review have included policies in relations with agriculture and fisheries in support of women's empowerment. * Government procurement: 9% of members5 under review have included policies in relations with government procurement in support of women's empowerment.
O19|Women's economic empowerment: An inherent part of Aid for Trade|"Aid for Trade supports developing and least-developed countries in building their trade capacity and in increasing their exports by turning market access opportunities into market presence. It does so by addressing four key areas: trade policy & regulations; economic infrastructure; building productive capacity; and trade-related adjustment. The WTO-led Initiative works with a broad cross-section of stakeholders to: highlight needs (of developing and least-developed countries and regional organizations), mobilize resources (including donors, international financial institutions and other international organizations) and monitor impacts and effectiveness (with OECD and other international organizations). Through Aid for Trade, the WTO has been focusing on women with the aim of building their capacity to trade and using trade as a tool for their economic development. Gender equality is an inherent part of Aid for Trade. This has also been reflected in the Buenos Aires Declaration on Trade and Women's Economic Empowerment which identified Aid for Trade as a key instrument to assist members in ""analysing, designing and implementing more gender-responsive trade policies"". Three key facts on women's economic empowerment through Aid for Trade * Donors and partner countries have been devoting increasing attention to gender dimensions in Aid for Trade. Both groups have gradually and increasingly integrated gender into their Aid for Trade objectives. They are now at par. The 2019 Monitoring and Evaluation Exercise reveals that women's economic empowerment is now high on both donors and partner countries agendas. Today, 84% of donors' aid-for-trade strategy and 85% of partner countries national or regional development strategy seek to promote women's economic empowerment. * The main target group of gender related Aid for Trade is women entrepreneurs. * While gender is now fully part of members aid-for-trade objectives, it has not been fully integrated in their aid for trade priorities. This disconnection between objectives and priorities could explain the difficulty in assessing the real impact of aid for trade on women's economic empowerment. This also shows the challenges to translate objectives into effective programming. Aid for Trade flows confirm this trend"
O19|Social Policy in Mexico and Argentina|This paper is a comparison between two programs implemented to combat poverty in Latin America: Prospera (Prosper) in Mexico and AsignaciÃ³n Universal por Hijo (Universal Assignment for Child) in Argentina. The first section offers a review of the emergence of the welfare state, examining economic and urban development in both countries and the underlying trends of social policy instruments. The analysis is based on the political nature of social problems and the actions undertaken to confront them. The paper offers a theoretical perspective, often questioning the very foundation of the social policy that serves as the main framework for the social programs, in order to present the policies' scope, successes, and disadvantages with reference to social equity and the well-being of their participants.
O19|Value Chain Development as Public Policy: Conceptualization and Evidence from the Agri-Food Sector in Bangladesh|Value chain development (VCD) has become a popular policy instrument to help farmers in developing countries access markets. While VCD initiated by the private sector has received much attention in the literature, there is yet little research on public-led VCD. This paper provides a conceptualization of public-led VCD and discusses in what context it can be a relevant policy instrument. As an illustration, the paper then describes the project “SAFAL”, which directly intervenes in the aquaculture, horticulture, and dairy sector of South-West Bangladesh. Using a matched difference-in-difference methodology, it is estimated that SAFAL increased farmers’ output market participation, food production, and smallholder welfare, and reduced the number of days in which participating households were food insecure.
O19|Beyond Indonesia’s Sustainable Movement in South Paci?c Area: Study Case on Pilot Projects for Timor Leste and Fiji|This paper aims to review Indonesia’s breakthrough on providing technical assistance under South-South Cooperation (SSC) scheme in Paci?c countries. For years, Indonesia has been engaging with the main bene?ciary countries: Timor Leste and Fiji. From one-off technical assistance programs, Indonesia tried to shift into more sustainable design in the form of pilot projects. By the given two case studies namely Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) Timor Leste and Gender Responsive Planning and Budgeting (GRPB) for Fiji, this article articulated Indonesia’s national interests in term of economics and political level. Both countries also represented as a part of Indonesia’s strategic way in to the South Paci?c area.

O19|Collective Reputation in Trade: Evidence from the Chinese Dairy Industry|Collective reputation implies an important externality. Among firms trading internationally, quality shocks about one firm’s products could affect the demand of other firms from the same origin country. We study this issue in the context of a large-scale scandal that affected the Chinese dairy industry in 2008. Leveraging rich firm-product level administrative data and official quality inspection reports, we find that the export revenue of contaminated firms dropped by 84% after the scandal, relative to the national industrial trend, and the spillover effect on non-contaminated firms is measured at 64% of the direct effect. Notably, firms deemed innocent by government inspections did not fare any better than noninspected firms. These findings highlight the importance of collective reputation in international trade and the challenges governments might face in signaling quality and restoring trust. Finally, we investigate potential mechanisms that could mediate the strength of the reputation spillover. We find that the spillover effects are smaller in destinations where people have better information about parties involved in the scandal. New firms are more vulnerable to the collective reputation damage than established firms. Supply chain structure matters especially in settings where firms are less vertically integrated and exhibit fragmented upstream-downstream relationships.
O19|Blended Finance Evaluation: Governance and Methodological Challenges|There is an urgent need to better understand the role that the use of blended finance in development co-operation can play in achieving the SDGs. By adopting the “Blended Finance Principles for Unlocking Commercial Finance for the SDGs” in 2017, members of the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee have committed to “monitor blended finance for transparency and results”. The practical implications of monitoring and evaluating blended finance are currently being explored with a view to providing further policy guidance on the implementation of such Principles. This paper contributes to the ongoing consultation process s by discussing governance and methodological challenges in blended finance evaluation and proposing a few options to deal with them.In their review of the present practice of blended finance evaluation, as of end 2018, authors identify some key issues that need to be addressed and put forth initial ideas in order to ensure that evaluations improve the knowledge base on blended operations. The paper starts with a discussion of some key management and organizational challenges that influence how blending operations are monitored and evaluated. It continues with an overview of main evaluation methodologies that could be used for blended finance evaluation and challenges associated with applying them, and it outlines the challenges of assessing additionality. The paper concludes with a summary of identified issues from a review of a sample of completed evaluations of blended finance, highlighting the methodological challenges that they reveal.
O19|Learning from Results-Based Management evaluations and reviews|What have we learned from implementing results-based management in development co-operation organisations? What progress and benefits can be seen? What are the main challenges and unintended consequences? Are there good practices to address these challenges?To respond to these questions this paper reviews and analyses the findings from various evaluations and reviews of results-based management systems conducted by members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC), the OECD/DAC Results Community Secretariat and other bodies in the past four years (2015-2018). It also draws on emerging lessons from new methods for managing development co-operation results.This analytical work aims to: identify recent trends in results-based management, explore challenges faced by providers when developing their results approaches and systems, select good practices in responding to these challenges that can be useful for the OECD/DACResults Community, considering new approaches, new technologies and evolving contexts. This body of evidence will inform the development of a core set of generic guiding principles for results-based management in development co-operation.
O19|Managing environmental risks in development banks and development finance institutions – what role for donor shareholders?|How and where infrastructure is built – and how environmental and social risks related to infrastructure are managed – will have a direct influence on whether developing countries pursue more sustainable development pathways or not. Development banks and development finance institutions (DFIs) serve as important channels for infrastructure finance, have adopted safeguards systems to minimise and manage the environmental and social risks associated with their projects. This paper provides an overview of these systems and discusses the role of members of the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) in influencing these, in their capacity as shareholders of these institutions. It shows that donor governments influence the policies and activities of development banks, but that the level of engagement varies between bilateral and multilateral development banks and is often determined by internal capacity. The paper argues that donor shareholder governments must continue to play an important role in encouraging development banks to strengthen the implementation of safeguards, which will require continued collaboration within governments, across countries and between development banks and DFIs. Efforts to build the evidence base on the impacts of safeguards in projects will further support this agenda.
O19|Enabling Civil Society: Select survey findings|Civil society and civil society organisations (CSOs) are important to development co-operation, both as implementing partners for members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC), and as development actors in their own right. Agenda 2030 is clear on the necessity of mobilising CSOs to implement, and uphold accountability for, the Sustainable Development Goals. The Global Partnership for Effective Development Co operation has committed to ensuring effectiveness in relation to CSOs in development co-operation, inclusive of the provision of CSO enabling environments.Recognising that how DAC members work with CSOs is part of CSO enabling environments, in 2017 the OECD Development Co-operation Directorate (DCD) established a work stream on civil society to provide guidance on DAC member support for civil society and a strategy for engaging with civil society. Under the work stream, a study on how DAC members work with CSOs was launched to identify areas of DAC member support to and engagement with CSOs for which guidance is needed. This paper introduces a selection of key findings and recommendations from two 2018-2019 surveys complemented with DAC statistical data.The paper points to evidence of member effort to work with CSOs in ways that enable CSOs to maximise their contribution to development. However, evidence also shows that members need to continuously examine their practices to ensure coherence between objectives and the many advantages that CSOs are seen to bring to development, and the members’ means of support to and engagement with CSOs.
O19|Blended Finance Funds and Facilities: 2018 Survey Results|The OECD Survey on Blended Finance Funds and Facilities represents a major step forward to consolidate evidence and provide further policy guidance in support of the OECD DAC Blended Finance Principles, whose focus is unlocking commercial finance for the Sustainable Development Goals.This working paper presents findings from the 2018 survey edition relating to the management, capital structure, investment strategy and portfolio allocation of the surveyed blended finance funds and facilities. The quantitative analysis is complemented by the OECD statistics on private finance mobilised by official development interventions and by information provided by Convergence. It will be followed by another OECD Development Co-operation working paper discussing the development strategy, performance tracking and evaluation approach.The 180 responses received illustrate to what extent blended finance funds and facilities vary widely in characteristics and functioning. Collectively, the managing organisations reported over USD 60.2 billion invested in 111 developing countries at the end of 2017. This new evidence confirms trends observed on the broader blended finance market (priority sectors, geographical coverage, targeted SDGs), while shedding light on additional aspects (e.g. investors, clients and investment instruments).
O19|Measuring trade in value added: How valid is the proportionality assumption?|The validity of the ‘proportionality assumption’ made in estimating value added in exports using aggregate input-output tables is tested using separately compiled domestic- and imported-input matrices for Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Australia. The results show that the use of the proportionality assumption results in overestimation of value-added exports, and that the magnitude of the bias becomes amplified when the export composition of a country shifts from primary products to manufactured goods through integration into global production networks.
O19|Domestic value added, exports and employment: An input-output analysis of Indonesian manufacturing|The paper is motivated by the current emphasis on the share of domestic value added in exports (SVEX) as a policy criterion for export development strategy in developing countries. Our hypothesis is that, the policy emphasis on SVAD, which harks back to the import substitution era, is not consistent with the objectives of achieving economic growth with employment generation in this era of economic globalisation. We test this hypothesis by examining relationship of SVEX with both export-induced employment and the total domestic value added (TVAD) or the contribution of exports to GDP by applying the standard input-output methodology to data from the Indonesian manufacturing. Our findings do not support the widely held view in policy circles that industries characterised by higher SVAD have the potential to make a greater contribution to employment generation and TVAD. The policy inference is that in this era of economic globalisation, in designing export development policy, policy makers should focus on the export potential of industries rather than on the share of domestic value added of exports
O19|Terms of Trade Effects of Productivity Shocks and Economic Development|This paper studies the terms of trade effects from unexpected economy-specific productivity increases in both developing and advanced economies using a panel vector autoregression model with interactive fixed effects and the “max-share” approach developed by Francis et al. (2014). First, we find that the terms of trade of developing economies do not deteriorate after unexpected productivity increases and display similar dynamics to those of advanced economies. Second, studying these shocks in a more detailed classification of developing economies shows that the terms of trade worsen following an unexpected productivity increase in the least developed economies, implying that economic underdevelopment can result in unexpected productivity increases causing a deterioration in the terms of trade. However, this adverse effect of productivity increases disappears in the developing economies with some success in moving up the ladder of economic development, as implied by our finding that the terms of trade of these economies improve after an unexpected productivity increase.
O19|Implementation of wampac security and stability improvement of power grids with systems|In this paper, due to the importance of extensive monitoring, protection and control systems as well as the importance of hybrid systems, both the AC and DC sectors have been attempted to make the implementation of the WAMPAC system more transparent to these types of networks. As a general rule, the main purpose of using extensive monitoring, protection and control systems is to consider the stability and security of power systems. Therefore, in this paper, the above principles are considered and, with respect to the sample network, the relevant strategies have been implemented, and the simulation results point to improving security and stability in the power grid.
O19|Immigration and the economic performance of countries|Using a global dataset of over 100 developed and developing countries, we attempt to identify the nexus between immigration and the economic performance of countries, as proxied by export sophistication. To isolate causal effects, we use instruments obtained from a pseudo-gravity model of bilateral immigration in the spirit of Frankel and Rose (2002). Employing an extensive set of institutional, demographic, climate and disease controls, we find that countries with high immigrant concentrations tend to exhibit lower performance.
O19|Sustainability of the transport sector during the last 20 years: evidences from a panel of 35 countries|Between 1990 and 2015, the annual global amount of CO 2 emission generated by transport has increased by 68%, from around 4.6 GtCO 2 to around 7.7 GtCO2. Technological advances towards eco friendly vehicles and policy incentives promoting environmental friendly modes of transport have thus been offset by economic growth and increasing mobility. This study questions the relationship between economic growth and sustainability performance of transport sector. It adds to the literature new insights concerning recent trends in the relationship between gross domestic product and various aspects of transport sustainability such as carbon footprint, carbon intensity and transport safety. A particular attention is given to discussing the emerging issues of “carbon inequality” and the role of political entities that contribute most to global CO2 emissions, such China, USA and the EU. Finally, this study adds to the literature a composite index of transport sustainability performance and explores between country inequalities in terms of sustainability performance.
O19|Rules of Origin Liberalization with Multi-Product Firms: Theory and Evidence from Bangladeshi Apparel Exporters|I study how rules of origin in potential export destinations influence firm- and industry-level export behavior in least-developed countries (LDCs). Rules of origin restrict LDCs from taking advantage of preferential tariff rates in export markets, and this undermines market access for LDCs and reduces the efficacy of export-oriented industrialization. I develop a model of multi-product firms in which rules of origin influence the product scope and export revenue of final goods producers through their effect on input sourcing decisions. I test the model's predictions using the 2011 revisions to the EU's rules of origin for apparel products from LDCs. To control for the potential endogeneity of the policy change I use a triple-difference approach, exploiting variation in the input-cost differentials across apparel products and export destination, before and after the EU policy change. Liberalizing rules of origin results in revenue gains, expansion of product scope, and firm entry into the export market. Within firms, incumbents upgrade product quality. Across firms, market share is reallocated toward more productive incumbents.
O19|An Empirical Investigation on associated linkage between Human Development and ICT: A South Asian Perspective|In the wake of industrial revolution in the late 18th and 19th centuries, technology as a seminal force has impacted everything and its effects are much more beyond the pertinent human comprehension. Most of the studies use per capita GDP as a measure to map the economic well-being of any nation but it is a narrower indicator. Human development could be considered to be the key that acts as a binding force to absorb the technological driven advancements. Taking this perspective, we contemplate the emergent prerequisite of finding the association between human capital development and information & communication technology (ICT) framework. The current study attempts to analyze how advancement in ICT could promote human capital development with special reference to South Asian Region (SAR) over the period 2000-16 by employing panel fixed effects modeling. Where, social human capital is proxied by the Human Development Index (HDI) and the the ICT penetration is measured by the parameters like technological readiness, mobile cellular subscriptions, and internet penetration. This is supplemented by other key macroeconomic control variables like population growth, urbanization sprawl, etc. in order to obtain an umbrella view. In order to have an in-depth understanding, individual component level linkages of HDI such as per capita GDP, birth life expectancy and school enrollment rate with ICT and other macroeconomic demographic indicators are also tested separately.The empirical analysis results hint towards the strong positive associations of internet penetration, technological readiness, and mobile usage with the human development index. The overall results are found to be in sync with the key findings. Therefore, the study recommends a cohesive ecosystem that could amalgamate technological space with HDI in the contemporary framework. The study further concludes with the key policy implications.
O19|Chinese development assistance and household welfare in sub-Saharan Africa|By combining geocoded project-level data on Chinese development assistance with geocoded household-level data from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), we investigate the effect of Chinese project assistance on household welfare in 13 sub-Saharan African countries. We exploit the geographic proximity of household clusters across two different DHS survey waves (before and after the influx of Chinese aid) and use a difference-in-difference design in order to investigate the impact of Chinese aid on households' wealth and education. Our results consistently point to an overall positive effect of Chinese project assistance on household welfare: areas that receive Chinese projects are more likely to be wealthier, stay in school longer, and achieve a higher educational attainment than areas which did not receive such projects. Results are robust to various alternative model specifications.
O19|Japanese Knowledge Transfer via Training in Mexico?s Automotive Industry|The automotive industry has been considered a source for development because of its impact on employment, knowledge transfer capabilities and backward and forward linkages with other industries. However, only a handful of developing countries have achieved an internationally competitive automotive industry. This might be attributable to the industry requiring not only skilled labor but also a strong supporting industry able to provide from 20,000 to 30,000 parts and components. In an ideal setting, supplier firms and assembly plants work interconnected creating positive externalities to each other, but for developing countries, it has been shown that this is difficult to achieve. The case of Mexico stands out as a country that has successfully attracted major automotive assemblers but has not been able to develop a solid supplier base. Despite the increasing presence of Japanese firms in Mexico, local firms have not been able to enter automotive chains primarily due to the inability to meet technological and quality requirements. This study analyzes specific cases of knowledge transfer to local firms under a training project from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The results show improvements in quality and productivity measurements of participating firms. The knowledge acquired through training was internalized and diffused within the firm allowing for industry-specific certifications, market growth, and market diversification.
O19|Determinants of Developing Countries' Export Upgrading: The Role of China and Productive Investment|This paper explores the determinants of developing countries' export upgrading measured by export sophistication. In particular, as a response to the recent debate on China's impact on developing countries' industrialisation, we examine a new hypothesis that the considerable growth in developing countries' trade with China may serve as a source of productive investment for their export upgrading. Dynamic panel estimations based on HS 6-digit export data on 62 developing countries during 1995-2014 show the positive effects of human capital, productive investment, and absolute gains from trade with China measured by income terms of trade vis-Â®Â§-vis China. Mediation analysis finds that the positive effect of trade with China on export upgrading takes effect largely through its enhancing effect on productive investment, which supports our hypothesis. By contrast, China's direct export-downgrading impact is minor. Our findings suggest that, for developing countries, China serves more as a stimulator of capital accumulation for industrial development than a competitor in manufacturing market or a predator of natural resources. This provides an alternative to the widespread argument of China's crowding-out and re-primarisation impact on developing countries. The priority for developing countries is therefore the appropriate use of the gains from trade for productive purposes.
O19|The Microfinance Alphabet|Much has been learnt in microfinance over the last ten years. But there is yet so much to discover on how to improve financial inclusion and development. This paper offers an—evidently subjective—microfinance alphabet, hoping to so provide the microfinance scientific community with an opportunity to “read together” both where we stand and where we are heading.
O19|A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away… How microfinance evolved and how research followed|This article is the introductory chapter of the book A Research Agenda for Financial Inclusion and Microfinance, edited by Marek Hudon, Marc Labie and Ariane Szafarz, and forthcoming in 2019 with Elgar Research Publishing. This introductive article written by the editors explains how research in microfinance and financial inclusion evolved together with field practices. It identifies the four periods in the life of the microfinance sector that match four steps in research development: genesis, childhood, adolescence, and maturity. The article discusses whether this evolution could lead to a decline. Finally, it presents the monograph, which is organized along thematic groups of chapters. The titles of the four parts of the book are: “Framing research on microfinance and financial inclusion,” “Social, environmental and financial performance,” “Targets for financial inclusion,” and “Institutional and technological design.” Each chapter is written by scholars whose expertise on financial inclusion and microfinance is recognized internationally.
O19|Indonesian South-South Cooperation: Stepping Up the Institution and Strategy for Indonesias Development Assistance|This paper reviews Indonesiaâ€™s South-South Cooperation (SSC) efforts with an aim of providing policy recommendations to improve Indonesiaâ€™s management and implementation of its development assistance. The National Coordination Team on South-South Cooperation (NCT-SSC)â€”the current national institution mandated with SSC in Indonesiaâ€”is suffering from fundamental constraints in terms of coordination, organization, and institutionalization. Furthermore, the efforts to further the institutionalization by establishing a single agency for SSC have been progressing very slowly due to a lack of firm legal basis on one hand, and a proclivity for practical, business-as-usual approach on the other. To improve the institution and programming of Indonesian development assistance, a number of recommendations are suggested. First, a strong legal basis through the issuance of a Presidential Regulation on SSC management should be pushed to serve as a precursor to the single agency. Second, better public communication and outreach should be conducted to promote the SSC programs. Adequate monitoring and evaluation system should also be developed to measure program impacts. Moreover, Indonesia needs to have a strategy to promote the participation of business sector in SSC, such as by promoting firmsâ€™ participation as contractor or a source of fund for projects in beneficiary countries. Finally, expertise in specific fields, such as agriculture and tsunami and earthquake risk management, should be promoted as a niche branding of Indonesiaâ€™s assistance.
O19|Export and productivity in global value chains: Comparative evidence from Latvia and Estonia|This paper investigates the effect of export entry on productivity, employment and wages of Latvian and Estonian firms in the context of global value chain (GVC). Like in many countries, exporting firms in Latvia and Estonia are more productive, larger, pay higher wages and are more capital intensive than non-exporting firms. While this is partly because firms that are originally more productive and have better performances are more likely to enter export, Latvian and Estonian firms also realise more than 23% and 14% higher labour productivity level as the result of export entry. Export entry also increases employment and average wages. Gains in productivity and employment are particularly large when firms enter exports that are related to participation in knowledge-intensive activities found in the upstream of GVC. For instance, Latvian firms that start exporting intermediate goods or non-transport services (which include knowledge intensive services) enjoy significantly higher productivity gains than those starting to export final goods or transport services. These findings underscore the importance of innovation policies that strengthen firms’ capabilities to supply highly differentiated knowledge-intensive goods and services to GVC.
O19|N-S Trade with Weak Institutions|States with weak institutions can lose from trade with strong states when trade is subject to predation. The happy liberal idea of trade fostering better institutions and peace can be turned on its head. The Ricardian model of trade subject to predation offered here implies imperialism without capital, contra Marxists. Weak and poor South trades with strong and rich North. Poor South labor is attracted to predation. Labor market effects of predation and enforcement amplify opposing interests in the terms of trade, potentially obviating the standard gains from trade that allows bargaining solutions to surplus division.
O19|Out of the Frying Pan into the Fire? Migration from Fragile States to Fragile States|Fragile states contributed 18 million migrants and 8 million refugees in 2000. More than 20% of these migrants and more than half of the refugees settle in other fragile states. Thus, migration is likely to be both a consequence and a possible cause of conflict and fragility. This paper asks why people from fragile states would want to move to another fragile state. Is it simply a question of jumping out of the frying pan into the fire – that migrants from fragile states have no other options than to settle in another fragile state? To investigate this question I analyse a new set of global data on the sources and destinations of migrants. This analysis generates genuinely new research for INCAF, and reveals that economic factors, such as the pull of higher incomes in destination countries, are important. The paper concludes by discussing how migration from fragile states in search of higher incomes and greater wellbeing is an important development strategy that should be supported. The research suggests that a new concept of development may be needed which looks beyond national borders to the countries where the migrants end up. This will require policies to ensure public acceptability in the host countries, however, such as bilateral agreements, temporary status for immigrants and restricting immigration to specific jobs or perhaps regions.
O19|Financing for Stability in the post-2015 era|This study and its associated guidance contribute to advancing thinking and understanding about one of the most significant challenges that the international community faces in fragile contexts: how to provide the right financing.The paper summarises new and emerging instruments and approaches in financing stability and resilience, and points to some of the gaps and challenges that remain in the fragility, resilience and stability space. It is not intended as holistic policy guidance on “how to” engage effectively across international and domestic, public and private instruments in fragile contexts. Instead, the paper is complemented by separate guidance on financing strategies: approaches to better align financing to support the delivery of results at the country-level.The research acknowledges that there are many high-level strategic debates which have yet to be resolved, which concern the comparative advantage and future role of Official Development Assistance (ODA) within a more diverse division of labour in financing, as well as a huge range of technical and capacity challenges ahead. The analysis, observations and conclusions put forward in this study should be interpreted therefore as preliminary contributions to what is a live and dynamic process of debate and adaptation.
O19|Financing for stability: Guidance for Practitioners|This guidance outlines the process for developing financing strategies for fragile contexts: financing for stability. The process includes the concrete steps to take to deliver the financing strategy, accompanied by financing principles, and a range of tactical investments, that allow financing actors to use financing to incentivise certain behaviours and priority investments, and to invest in enabling conditions and public goods.
O19|The 2030 Agenda and Development Co-operation Results|Providers of development co-operation can benefit from the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), targets and indicators for use in their results frameworks. The paper examines the SDG outcome and performance targets and indicators that fit with the goals of individual providers. It presents a menu of 60 SDG targets and indicators that can strengthen providers’ results frameworks, facilitate data collection and use, and offer improved platforms for dialogues on development co-operation results. The concept of “menu” recognises that individual providers and their partners prioritise different aspects of the 2030 Agenda. They can select and apply SDG targets and indicators to their existing results frameworks in accordance with their respective priorities. Results information is used for accountability and communication and hence tied to political goals for development co-operation. With clearer links to the SDGs, results information can also be used for strategic direction and learning by providers.
O19|Going local: a regional perspective on how trade affects labour markets and inequality|"The increase of emerging market economies in international trade and rapid rise in global trade intensity over the past three decades has been accompanied by growing, regionally concentrated, discontent with trade in advanced OECD countries. One of the main concerns is the negative effects of growing import competition on employment. This paper focuses on manufacturing sector employment because of its high trade exposure and potential for wider spillovers. It finds that while trade appears to have only a minor association with manufacturing employment shares at the national level compared with technology, trade has an important role in regional labour market developments due to the geographical concentration of industrial activities. The ""sticky"" nature of manufacturing employment and sometimes inefficient inter-regional migration mean that trade shocks to local manufacturing can affect entire regional labour markets, leading to widening regional inequalities. Policies should, in particular, focus on boosting regional resilience to industry related shocks, whether they come from trade or technology by building local capacity, both in terms of people – more educated labour is more mobile across jobs – and innovation."
O19|The Fourth Industrial Revolution and its Implications for Regional Economic Integration in ASEAN|This paper explores the impact of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) on the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). It argues that technologies of the 4IR can bring huge benefits such as empowerment for small and medium sized enterprises and opportunities for countries to leapfrog traditional pathways of development. It will also bring tremendous challenges, such as deep disruption to labor markets and the potential of rising inequality. To address the challenges and seize the opportunities of the 4IR, ASEAN will need a new way of formulating policy and regulation that will require: (i) evolution of the ASEAN Secretariat to become a “platform organization”; (ii) greater delegation of key activities to affiliated functional bodies; (iii) a shift from long-term blueprints to three year rolling plans; (iv) democratize and decentralize; and (v)establish multi-country test beds.
O19|Loss Minimization through the Allocation of DGs Considering the Stochastic Nature of Units|Smart grid as the cleaner alternative to the legacy power system can improve technical, economical, and environmental aspects of the system up to a considerable degree. In smart grids, Distributed Generation (DG) units; which play an important role, should be optimally allocated. In this paper, DG placement is conducted with the goal of loss minimization of the grid considering the technical limitations associated with the voltage profile of the buses as well as the stochastic nature of the DGs. In this paper, three different kinds of DGs are included which are wind turbines, solar panels, and biomass generators. The results related to the case study which is IEEE standard 33 bus system reveals that the costs can be dramatically decreased.
O19|Lessons from a Survey of China’s Economic Diplomacy|Today, the West faces a considerable dilemma in their support for the Washington Consensus as a dominant approach for development because the Beijing model has grown to become an unavoidable process which can only be neglected at the cost of standing on the wrong side of economic history. The Washington Consensus, the hitherto dominant scheme, is being encroached on by the Beijing model. Many African nations are increasingly embracing this later method because the prevailing Western model has failed to deliver on a number of objectives. This is increasingly evident because China’s economic diplomacy has been politely and strategically coined to achieve it. A case study is used herein to articulate the different strands of the survey. The paper puts some structure on China’s economic diplomatic strategies and discusses lessons for Africa, China and the West. It contributes to existing literature by critically assessing why it is necessary for the West to modify the conception and definition of the Washington Consensus as a counterpart to the Beijing model. In order to remain relevant in the 21st century and beyond, the Washington Consensus should incorporate those ideas which are in conformity with Moyo’s (2013) conjecture. This postulates that, while the Beijing model is optimal in the short-run, the Washington Consensus remains the ideal long-term development model because it is more inclusive of the rights demanded by individuals at different income categories.
O19|Does Public Capital Influence Output Growth? Further Evidence from Nigeria|This study investigates the nexus between public capital and growth. The study made use of the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) which is a multi-equation framework to capture all plausible effects of public capital on output growth (measured by growth rate of real GDP) in Nigeria between 1980 and 2015. The results of the econometric estimations revealed that there exist a long run relationship between output growth, public capital, private capital, public consumption and labour. Although public capital was found to have the expected positive sign, it was insignificantly related to growth. This suggests a positive correlation between public capital and output growth. The results also indicate that private capital positively impact on output growth while public consumption negatively affects output growth in Nigeria. Furthermore, the results showed the presence of crowding-out effect, suggesting that public capital has not impacted meaningfully on private investment in Nigeria. The study therefore recommends that government should embark on public capital expenditure in sectors that would smoothen the function of the market to promote growth and development in a country.
O19|Improving the developmental impact of multinational enterprises: policy and research challenges|Abstract We summarize the key empirical evidence on the nexus between MNEs and development, focusing on issues that are relevant for the formulation, implementation and assessment of policies by host developing countries. We also delve into what we do not know, as well as topics for which the evidence is still quite blurred. We discuss the reasons for the absence of clear evidence, and potential avenues for future research to improve policies. Although most countries rely on MNEs/FDI as a central plank of their development strategy, the collective weight of academic research has not led to a fine-tuning of policy implementation. Countries still rely on policies for which evidence is sparse, or no longer valid in an era of globalisation. Much of the literature has focused on externalities and spillovers, and has deemphasised the other ‘effects’ of MNE activity, implicitly assuming that MNEs are almost always beneficial for development. Few rents are costless when the opportunity costs of scarce resources are considered, especially in the longer term. Despite the abundance of empirical studies (of increasing sophistication), most ignore the significance of structural change. Growth and the interaction with MNE activity is not linear or monotonic over time, because the economy itself is in a constant state of flux.
O19|Waqf Resource Mobilization for Poverty Alleviation Based on Maqasid Framework|This study adopts the framework practiced by various multilateral development banks (MDBs), particularly International Development Association (IDA), to explore the potential establishment of a global Waqf fund, as this framework is proven effective. The framework revolves around the IDA operations with replenishments, allocation of funds by implementing specific formulas and the determination approach, which is mainly to monitor effectiveness of the earlier processes. The study proposes to integrate Islamic vision of development based on Maqasid al-Shari’ah with IDA principles for the allocation of funds for a potentially global Waqf fund. The objective is to create more effective approach for raising and using resources for a global Waqf fund.
O19|The Effects Of Major Sports Events On Economic Growth And Foreign Direct Investment Inflows: The Results Of Empirical Estimation|In the modern literature there is no consensus on the effects arising in countries as a result of hosting major sports events, namely the Olympic Games, FIFA World Cup and UEFA European Championship. This paper focuses on two aspects of the major sports events effects in the hosting country: on economic growth and foreign direct investment inflows. The estimated database includes indicators for all countries that hosted major sport events during 1970?2015. This paper confirms the hypotheses of positive effects both on economic growth and foreign direct investment in the hosting countries. Positive significant effects are found not only during the period of preparation to the event, but (what is more important) during the 4 to 12 year period after the event.
O19|Aid diversion and the impact of Development Assistance for Health in a decentralized health system|The effects of foreign aid on a decentralised health system are analysed in a theoretical framework where the donor has imperfect information about the local health needs while the central and local governments do not engage in self-interested efforts upon receiving aid. I discuss the implications of conditionality of aid on local health expenditures, intergovernmental transfers and social welfare. I then examine these consequences in a health system with two levels of care when the donor restricts aid on Primary Health Care.
O19|Development in Africa|The purpose of the chapter is to analyze Africaâ€™s economic successes in the past half century, to understand not only what made it possible but also and more importantly what risk factors may eventually bring it to an end or compromise it. While it may not be possible for Africa to alter, for now, its position in the world system, it may nonetheless create the conditions for sustained economic growth and development by deepening democracy, enhancing the stability of political regimes and by reducing the incidence of tropical diseases.

O19|Efecto de la inversión extranjera en el dinamismo macroeconómico: un análisis empírico para Bolivia|En el presente trabajo se analiza los efectos de la Inversión Extranjera Directa (IED) en el dinamismo ma-croeconómico de la economía boliviana; para este propósito se utiliza la metodología de Vectores Auto-regresivos Estructurales (SVAR, sus siglas en ingles). Los resultados muestran signos esperados de acuer-do a la teoría económica, lo que implica efectos positivos de la inversión extranjera en el crecimiento económico e inversión nacional, este último conlleva a la complementariedad entre la inversión domés-tica y extranjera. También la IED juega un rol importante en la disminución de desempleo y aumenta las importaciones, principalmente los bienes intermedio y de capital que son destinados al sector industrial e infraestructura.

O19|Structural change, catching up and falling behind in the BRICS: A comparative analysis based on trade pattern and Thirlwall’s Law|The BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) have become more than an acronym as their governments have been engaging in international and political negotiations as if they were a regional economic group. The main goal of this paper is to compare the structural change of the BRICS using econometric evidence based on estimates of Thirlwall’s law for the period 1995-2013. Thirlwall’s equations have become powerful indicators to evaluate whether a country is in a catching-up or falling-behind long-term path. Our basic assumption is that the way in which each country engages in international trade and global capital flows affects, positively or negatively, structural change and the catching up trajectory. Though our results cannot confirm Russia’s long-term growth trajectory, they do confirm that China and India have shown a rapid catching up path, while Brazil and South Africa have entered into a falling behind path over the period analyzed.
O19|Analysis on the Openness and Economic Welfare of North Korea (in Korean)|"North Korea's trade volume in 2016 was three times higher than in the mid-1990s. North Korea's external openness seems to have considerably increased, but it still faces difficulties in expanding its external openness due to economic sanctions by the international community. This study uses Arkolakis, Costinot and Rodriguez-Claire's model (ACR model), which measures the economic welfare effects of various international trade models. In the ACR model, the ""import penetration ratio,"" which is the ratio of imports to domestic demand, indicates the degree of external openness, and ""gains from trade"" is a measure of the real income growth rate that occurs when switching from a closed to an open economy. We estimated the import penetration rate and gains from trade of North Korea during 1996-2016 using North Korean foreign trade data from UN Comtrade, IMF DOTS and KOTRA as well as inter-Korean trade data from the Unification Ministry of Korea. The main results of this study are as follows. North Korea's import penetration rate has shown a gradual increase, indicating an expansion of international openness. This trend has become especially clear since 2000 when the North Korean economy began stabilizing after the end of â€œthe Hardship March,â€ although it faltered slightly from 2014 to 2016. In addition, it is estimated that gains from trade is in the range of 1.5%-4.5% based on real income, and the annual change trend is similar to that of the import penetration rate."
O19|Funding for International Affairs Activities, Within and Outside Agenciesâ€™ Base Budgets|The Congress provides the State Department, the Agency for International Development (USAID), and other agencies a â€œbase budgetâ€ each year to fund ongoing activities related to international affairs. The agencies have received other â€œnonbaseâ€ funding in recent years, in the form of supplemental appropriations, emergency appropriations, and funding for overseas contingency operations. In this report, CBO analyzes the recent use of such nonbase appropriations for international affairs activities.
O19|Managing Trade: Evidence from China and the US|We present a heterogeneous-firm model in which management ability increases both production efficiency and product quality. Combining six micro-datasets on management practices, production and trade in Chinese and American firms, we find broad support for the model's predictions. First, better managed firms are more likely to export, sell more products to more destination countries, and earn higher export revenues and profits. Second, better managed exporters have higher prices, higher quality, and lower quality-adjusted prices. Finally, they also use a wider range of inputs, higher quality and more expensive inputs, and imported inputs from more advanced countries. The structural estimates indicate that management is important for improving production efficiency and product quality in both countries, but it matters more in China than in the US, especially for product quality. Panel analysis for the US and a randomized control trial in India suggest that management exerts causal effects on product quality, production efficiency, and exports. Poor management practices may thus hinder trade and growth, especially in developing countries.
O19|The not-so-generalized effects of the Generalized System of Preferences|We use an empirical gravity equation approach to study how nonreciprocal trade preferences (NRTPs), enacted mainly through the Generalized System of Preferences, affect the exports of the beneficiary nations. In line with existing studies, the average trade effect stemming from nonreciprocal preferences is highly unstable across specifications. However, once we allow for heterogeneous effects, results become robust and economically important. Specifically, NRTPs have a strong effect on the exports of beneficiaries when they are members of the World Trade Organization and are very poor. Not-so-poor beneficiaries also expand foreign sales, but only if they are not WTO members. For all others, the average export effects of NRTPs are mute.
O19|The effects of foreign aid on refugee flows|We investigate whether foreign aid affects refugee flows from recipient countries. Combining refugee data on 141 origin countries over the 1976–2013 period with bilateral Official Development Assistance data, we estimate the causal effects of a country’s aid receipts on both total refugee flows to the world and flows to donor countries. The interaction of donor-government fractionalization and a recipient country’s probability of receiving aid provides a powerful and excludable instrumental variable (IV) when we control for country- and time-fixed effects that capture the levels of the interacted variables. Though our IV results suggest that aid induces recipient governments to encourage the return of their citizens, we find no evidence that aid reduces worldwide refugee outflows or flows to donor countries in the short term. However, we observe long-run effects after four three-year periods, which appear to be driven by lagged positive effects of aid on growth.
O19|Buying Votes and International Organizations: The Dirty Work-Hypothesis|We show how major shareholders can exploit their power over international organizations to hide their foreign-policy interventions from domestic audiences. We argue that major powers exert influence bilaterally when domestic audiences view the intervention favorably. When domestic audiences are more skeptical of a target country, favors are granted via international organizations. We test this theory empirically by examining how the United States uses bilateral aid and IMF loans to buy other countries’ votes in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). Introducing new data on voting behavior in the UNSC over the 1960-2015 period, our results show that states allied with the US receive more bilateral aid when voting in line with the United States in the UNSC, while concurring votes of states less allied with the US are rewarded with loans from the IMF. Temporary UNSC members that vote against the United States do not receive such perks.
O19|The KOF Globalisation Index – revisited|Abstract We introduce the revised version of the KOF Globalisation Index, a composite index measuring globalization for every country in the world along the economic, social and political dimension. The original index was introduced by Dreher (Applied Economics, 38(10):1091–1110, 2006) and updated in Dreher et al. (2008). This second revision of the index distinguishes between de facto and de jure measures along the different dimensions of globalization. We also disentangle trade and financial globalization within the economic dimension of globalization and use time-varying weighting of the variables. The new index is based on 43 instead of 23 variables in the previous version. Following Dreher (Applied Economics, 38(10):1091–1110, 2006), we use the new index to examine the effect of globalization on economic growth. The results suggest that de facto and de jure globalization influence economic growth differently. Future research should use the new KOF Globalisation Index to re-examine other important consequences of globalization and why globalization was proceeding rapidly in some countries, such as South Korea, but less so in others. The KOF Globalisation Index can be downloaded from http://www.kof.ethz.ch/globalisation/ .
O19|Guyana’s REDD+ Agreement with Norway: Perceptions of and Impacts on Indigenous Communities|This report examines the impact of the REDD+ agreement between Guyana and Norway on indigenous communities in the country. Through literature review, analysis of secondary data, and interviews with indigenous chiefs and other informed stakeholders, it aims to understand the concerns, hopes, and fears of indigenous communities at the start of the agreement, and the effects, if any, that communities have faced from REDD+. Concerns at the inception of the agreement focused on long-standing issues with land rights, and a sense of lack of consultation. There were hopes, however, in the potential economic benefits that could accompany REDD+. Implementation of REDD+ in Guyana has proved slow, and the cash (or other benefits) received by communities has been small. Deforestation has risen—due to increased mining activity—and costs incurred by REDD+ have been minimal. This has created an overall air of scepticism regarding the future of the initiative. Future developments of REDD+ could be stronger through its indirect effect on changing donor actions, and broader policy thinking in Guyana; but major challenges exist in creating an opt-in mechanism that is fair for all indigenous communities, integrating REDD+ with the extractives industries such as mining, and keeping a focus on low-carbon development in the light of major new oil finds.
O19|Competing or Complementary Strategies? Protecting Indigenous Rights and Paying to Conserve Forests|In 2007, the UN General Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) endorsed the Bali Action Plan to pay for reductions in tropical deforestation. While many saw these initiatives as complementary, others considered the Bali Action Plan a threat to indigenous peoples’ rights. This paper reviews the history of efforts to protect indigenous rights and to pay for conserving forests and analyzes how they might be competing or complementary strategies. It then presents country experiences that show indigenous peoples have achieved tangible political benefits in many countries and internationally by using their leverage over and participation in Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation Plus (REDD+) negotiations. Nevertheless, these experiences also show that insisting on preconditions for REDD+ national performance payments may have inadvertently harmed indigenous peoples by contributing to delays in implementation. Today, the movements for indigenous rights and for slowing deforestation are inextricably entwined. Whereas critics fear implementation of REDD+ will harm indigenous peoples, it is the failure of REDD+ programs to influence national action to slow deforestation which represents the greater risk. In this way, the two movements face a common challenge to refocus attention on the national policies and actions that must change to protect both indigenous rights and tropical forests.
O19|Fighting Fire with Aid: Development Assistance as Counterinsurency Tool. Evidence for Colombia|I study the causal effect of the foreign aid for development assistance —implemented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)— on the intensity of municipality-level armed conflict in Colombia, for the period 2009-2013. To address potential endogeneity biases, I use a Bartik-like instrument which exploits the spatial persistence of aid from USAID in Colombia. Specifically, I instrument foreign aid with the interaction between the United States GDP and municipality-level intent-to-treat indicators for the Malaria Eradication Campaigns (circa 1957). The results point out that foreign aid reduces the insurgency associated with left-wing guerrillas, especially FARC. However, foreign aid does not affect the violence associated with criminal gangs from right-wing paramilitary origins (BACRIM). I provide both quantitative and anecdotic evidence on two potential mechanisms behind my results: (i) Development programs raise the opportunity cost of fighting and; (ii) foreign aid improves the trust, and the information flows between civilians and the government. Finally, I provide empirical evidence that casts doubt on two alternative channels whose predictions cannot be reconciled with the results: (i) that foreign aid increases the potentially- looted rents by the insurgents and; (ii) that development programs rise targeted assassinations committed by insurgents to sabotage and reestablish bargaining power.
O19|The not-so-generalized effects of the Generalized System of Preferences|We use an empirical gravity equation approach to study how nonreciprocal trade preferences (NRTPs), enacted mainly through the Generalized System of Preferences, affect the exports of the beneficiary nations. In line with existing studies, the average trade effect stemming from nonreciprocal preferences is highly unstable across specifications. However, once we allow for heterogeneous effects, results become robust and economically important. Specifically, NRTPs have a strong effect on the exports of beneficiaries when they are members of the World Trade Organization and are very poor. Not-so-poor beneficiaries also expand foreign sales, but only if they are not WTO members. For all others, the average export effects of NRTPs are mute.
O19|The Political Economy of Multilateral Aid Funds|When allocating foreign aid, donor countries face a problem of incentivizing recipient countries to invest in state capacity. Here, we show that donors can incentivize recipient countries by committing to collective decision-making: If aid allocation decisions are made ex post via bargaining between donors, then the negotiated outcome will be skewed towards aggregate efficiency, which induces the recipients to compete over ex ante investments. Our model links the fund's composition of membership and its decision rules to participation, investment and allocation decisions. We also find that majority rule induces stronger competition between recipients, resulting in higher investments in state capacity. The qualitative predictions of our model are broadly consistent with empirical findings on multilateral aid. In particular, the model rationalizes our novel empirical finding that, relative to organizations that use a consensus rule, organizations that use majority are more responsive to changes in recipient-country quality.
O19|: Blockchain et pays en développement : vers une technologie maîtrisée ?|"(english) Blockchain technologies are very popular, but the way they actually work is often not really understood. Expectations are sometimes disconnected from reality. This is true in the field of application of these technologies to developing countries. We show it by i) describing the details of the blockchain technologies ii) comparing their potentialities with the deter- minants of development and iii) showing the limitations of the blockchain technologies to boost development. We then present technological devices additional to blockchains better suited to the development process by introducing the notion of \blocks host"". _________________________________ (français) Les technologies liées à la blockchain sont omniprésentes dans les media mais leur fonctionnement est souvent peu compris et les attentes vis-à-vis de ces technologies sont parfois déconnectées de la réalité. Le domaine du développement ne fait pas figure d'exception, nous le montrons en décrivant tout d'abord plus en détails les technologies liées aux blockchains, puis nous comparons leurs possibilités vis-à-vis des besoins dans ce domaine et faisons apparaître les limites d'application. Enfin, sans revenir sur les limites de la vision technocratique en rapport des besoins réels, nous proposons des pistes technologiques complémentaires aux blockchains mais mieux adaptées au processus de développement, en introduisant la notion d'hébergeur de blocs."
O19|South Asia’s March Towards Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals|This paper, prepared by ESCAP South and South-West Asia Office, is based on the report of the Second South Asia Forum on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) organized by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), in collaboration with the NITI Aayog (successor of the Planning Commission in India) and a premier Indian think tank Research and Information System for Developing Countries (RIS), on 4-5 October 2018 in New Delhi, India. Senior government officials, international and regional experts, civil society representatives, think tanks, academia and other stakeholders discussed key challenges, progress and priorities for implementation of the 2030 Agenda in South Asia and opportunities that South Asian member States could pursue to increase regional cooperation for achieving the SDGs. This paper summarizes the highlights of the discussion at the event and the key conclusions and policy lessons. South Asian countries have an opportunity to tackle many of their common development challenges, and accelerate their progress towards the SDGs, through enhanced regional cooperation for building up productive capacities, strengthening statistical systems, enhancing market integration, improving connectivity, climate action, and tackling shared vulnerabilities and risks. Among the key takeaways from the Forum was the identification of potential areas for greater regional cooperation and articulating the need for a regional framework for achievement of SDGs in South Asia that will be prioritized and implemented as a mandate of ESCAP-SSWA and its work in the subregion.
O19|Korean Unification: Economic Adjustments under German Assumptions|This paper explores the impact of unification on North and South Korea under the hypothetical scenario that German‐type reunification occurs in the Korean peninsula. Simulation results using a global dynamic general equilibrium model show that with comprehensive market‐oriented reform and opening, the North Korean economy could capitalize on its growth potentials. Unification can reduce the growth rate in South Korea for a certain period following the unification shock due to the transfer of resources out of the South into the North and an increase in risk on the Korea peninsula. Due to the relative sizes in population and per capita gross domestic product of the two Koreas, unification can be more disruptive on North and South Korea, compared to the experience of Germany. The critical factors determining the economic effects of unification are the nature of wage‐adjustment, the size of resource transfers from the South to North, and exchange rate policy.
O19|Foreign-owned firms as agents of structural change in regions: the case of Hungary 2000-2009|A growing body of literature shows that related diversification in regions is more common but unrelated diversification also happens. However, we have little understanding of what types of firms induce related and unrelated diversification in regions. We investigate the extent to which foreign-owned firms induce structural change in the capability base of 67 regions in Hungary between 2000 and 2009. Doing so, we aim to connect more tightly the disparate literatures of Evolutionary Economic Geography and International Business. Using novel methodology developed by Neffke et al. (2018), we find that foreign-owned firms show a higher deviation from the region?s average capability match than domestic firms, and therefore, tend to contribute more to structural change in regions.
O19|Equal opportunity and poverty reduction: how aid should be allocated?|This paper proposes a model of aid allocation which aims to equalize the opportunity between recipient countries to reduce the poverty. The model takes into account the natural growth deviation which is defined by the gap between the growth rate required to reach a development goal and the growth rate observed in the recipient countries. The resulting optimal aid allocation is computed using the estimation of a growth equation. Said equation includes effects of aid and structural handicaps to growth in recipient countries (which are represented by the economic vulnerability index and lack of human capital). To illustrate the interest of our approach, we perform a simulation which shows a substantial difference between the aid allocation obtained with our multi-criteria principle and the observed allocation. Moreover, we also shed light on the impact of the donors' sensitivity with respect to the natural growth deviation on the optimal aid allocation.
O19|Short-run and long-run food import elasticities with persistent trading habits| This paper provides estimates and explores the role of own price import demand (Armington) elasticities between different source countries for five agricultural commodities in a framework that incorporates temporal dimension formulated as trading habit persistence. The estimations employ FAOâ€™s bilateral food commodity trade database, complemented with importer and exporter country characteristics from other data. The results support the hypothesis that trade patterns are persistent the adjustment following price changes takes effect with delays. Apart from the evidence for the presence of habit persistence and hence different short and long-term elasticities in general, significant differences between countries are also evidenced, in particular between high- and low-income countries and between main geographic areas. Consistently with the barriers for market entry considerations we also observe higher persistence downwards than upwards.
O19|Argentina’s “Missing Capital” Puzzle and Limited Commitment Constraints|Capital accumulation in Argentina was slow in the 1990s, despite high total factor productivity (TFP) growth and low international interest rates. A possible explanation for the “missing capital” is that foreign investors were reluctant to take advantage of the high returns to investment seemingly offered by that small open economy under such favorable conditions, on the grounds that previous historical developments had led them to perceive Argentina as a country prone to external debt “opportunistic defaults.” The paper examines this conjecture from the perspective of an optimal contract between foreign lenders and a small open economy subject to limited commitment constraints. Numerical experiments for a deterministic version of that analytical framework show that limited commitment constraints introduce an asymmetry to the capital accumulation process of small open economies: the responses of investment to positive TFP shocks are muted and shortlived, while those to negative TFP shocks are large and persistent. Furthermore, under some circumstances, a lower international interest rate environment can magnify the asymmetry. A quantitative implementation of the model economy to data from Argentina accounts, in line with asymmetry just described, for the rapid decline that that country’s capital stock experienced, along with a falling TFP during the 1980s, as well as for the lack of any visible recovery of that stock during the significant surges of TFP observed between 1992-1998 and 2002-2008. In the absence of the limited commitment constraint, Argentina’s capital stock in 2008 would have been 50% higher than it actually was.
O19|Why Aid-to-GDP Ratios?|Virtually all aid-growth regression studies normalize aid by dividing it by GDP. This paper questions the usefulness of this practice: First, there are no clear theoretical reasons for this practice unless one assumes that donors allocate aid-to-GDP ratios. Second, using aid-to-GDP ratios introduces econometric problems that most likely introduce a downward bias for the aid-growth relationship. We illustrate this point by running simulations in which aid does not affect growth by construction but find strong negative and in some cases also positive correlations when using aid-to-GDP ratios. Finally, we replicate the Burnside-Dollar study and show that there is a significant positive relationship between aid and growth when using total aid instead of the aid-to-GDP ratio. We present a similar finding when estimating aid-growth regressions using data for the last 20 years (1995--2014).

O19|Do the IMF’s structural adjustment programs help reduce energy consumption and carbon intensity? Evidence from developing countries|Although the number of countries under the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) programs have increased considerably since the 1980s, a research gap exists in regard to the impacts of these programs on both energy consumption and carbon emissions in countries where the programs have been implemented. Hence, the purpose of this study is to understand and explain what is reasonable to expect of the IMF on energy and the environment. Given that the global roadmap for the energy transition calls for structural changes in favor of reducing carbon emissions, this study suggests that the IMF may have a special role to play, that is, working in tandem with national governments and environmental-related organizations to support resilient economic development models to implement this global roadmap towards the energy transition. The results based on panel econometrics models presented in this paper indicate that the IMF has not, to some extent, played such a role so far. More precisely, the results show that although IMF programs help reduce energy consumption, they do not change the energy mix or technological structures in a way that would reduce carbon emissions per unit of energy use. The findings of this study have important implications for energy and climate policymaking in developing countries.
O19|Understanding processes of path renewal and creation in thick specialized regional innovation systems. Evidence from two textile districts in Italy and Sweden|The type of regional innovation system (RIS) strongly affects possibilities of paths of industrial transformation. This paper argues that traditional manufacturing districts, corresponding to specialized RISs and characterised by various nuclei of specialization and know-how, may foster different trajectories in combination with extra-regional networks. In particular, the paper analyses the interplay between regional and national innovation systems, providing an overview of the effect that different multilevel dynamics have on local trajectories. The cases of the textile districts in Prato (Italy) and Borås (Sweden) show SRISs can display not only path extension but also path renewal and creation strategies.
O19|Transformation paths and the multi-scalarity of knowledge bases under Industry 4.0 challenges|This chapter proposes a novel conceptual framework for understanding how different knowledge bases (analytic, synthetic and symbolic) can be accessed and combined at different territorial scales, looking at which mechanisms can be used to favor positive transformation paths in local productive systems. We apply such framework to the role of combinatorial knowledge for sustainable transformation under the impact of global challenges, such as those posed by Industry 4.0 (I4.0). Eventually, case studies reported in the MAKERS project illustrate the multi-scalarity of knowledge bases combined in different paths of industrial transformation addressing models of I4.0 including so-called I4.0+ alternatives.
O19|Management and Execution of Investment Projects, the Task Prior to the Measurement of Development Effectiveness: The Case of the Inter-American Development Bank|The literature on development effectiveness has traditionally focused on the ex-post analysis of projects. While this is the appropriate method of measuring benefits, a previous step must be taken as a forerunner to good ex-post evaluation: the measurement of the efficiency in the execution of investment projects. This document aims to identify the determinants of good execution. Unlike previous studies, the current study analyzes execution using a project life cycle approach. Using an Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) database with information from various departments, the authors identify the factors that are associated with faster or slower disbursement on several stages of the projects’ life cycle. The basic premise is that the duration of an investment project– that is, the days elapsed from its approval to its final disbursement– is associated with preparation and execution-related factors as well as exogenous country factors. There is evidence that a sound macroeconomic and fiscal environment in countries is important for the purposes of good execution. Moreover, the authors find that delays in project planning and execution substantially extend project lives. These findings suggest the need to continue to improve efficiency in these areas. Finally, the authors find differences in project life cycles that are associated with delays caused by the projects’ executing units.
O19|International R&D Spillovers, Innovation by Learning from Abroad and Medium-Run Fluctuations|Many developed economies experienced large and correlated fluctuations in the medium run during the postwar period. A good number of industrialized countries experienced high productivity growth during the 1960s and low growth between the early 1970s and the early 1980s. This paper develops a model of medium-run fluctuations incorporating research and development (R&D)-based endogenous growth and international R&D spillovers from a technologically leading country to a technologically lagging country. An important feature of the model is that a key role of the lagging country's R&D is innovation by leaning (IBL) from abroad. After calibration using U.S. and Japanese data, the model shows that changes in U.S.R&D expenditure alone can substantially explain Japan's medium-run fluctuations.The paper argues that the diffusion of U.S. innovations (generated by U.S. R&D) to Japan plays an important role in determining Japan's medium-run fluctuations
O19|The KOF Globalisation Index â€“ Revisited|In this paper we present and describe the revised version of the KOF Globalisation Index, a composite index measuring globalisation for every country in the world along the economic, social and political dimension. The original index was introduced by Dreher (2006) and updated in Dreher et al. (2008). This second revision of the index introduces the differentiation between de facto and de jure measures along the different dimensions of globalisation, the differentiation between trade and financial globalisation within the economic dimension of globalisation and time-varying weighting of the variables entering the index. Finally, the revised version incorporates several additional variables in the construction process. At the aggregate level, we show that a bidirectional relationship between de facto and de jure globalisation exists.
O19|Development cooperation to ensure that none be left behind|The development cooperation system is undergoing a dramatic process of change. New actors are on stage, new instruments (beyond ODA) are being used, and the fields of work have been clearly widened. The enlargement of the development cooperation system is in line with the ambitious and comprehensive 2030 Agenda. However, those changes also imply massive tensions and challenges to the current development cooperation system in terms of its objectives, procedures and narrative. This paper presents some of these challenges in light of the â€œleaving no-one behindâ€ mandate. The paper discusses, firstly, how the development cooperation system can be brought up to date, taking into account massive changes in the international landscape; secondly, it argues why development cooperation may be still useful and effective in supporting an Agenda that goes beyond ODA; and finally, it discusses some dilemmas around the way in which resources should be allocated in order to preserve the distributive purpose of development cooperation.
O19|Regulating the digital economy: Are we moving towards a 'win-win' or a 'lose-lose'?|The digital economy has been growing by leaps and bounds in recent years, mostly as a result of new digital technologies that are promoting a global transformation to industry 4.0. The resulting expansion of digital trade has sparked off a political and policy controversy on digital economy and e-commerce, where its boundaries stand and how best to regulate it. Policy discussions on the topic however do not take into account the true expanse of digital trade, which encompasses hardware, software, networks, platforms, applications and data as its core elements, and stretches the boundaries of e-commerce policy to trade in goods, services and intellectual property protection. This article focuses on the challenges in regulating the digital economy, with a particular focus on development, and offers a discussion of the interdependency between the economic, social, personal and developmental aspects of digital trade for developing countries. Section II opens with a detailed discussion on key digital technologies and their plausible impacts on employment globally and industrial catch-up of particular importance to developing countries, to highlight the divisive nature of digital technologies. Section III then analyses the unfulfilled promise of a pro-development perspective at the WTO looking at how multilateralism has currently failed e-commerce. In this section, the incoherence between digital realities and the policy debates at the WTO are presented to show how the institution might have become a means to legitimise national policies of industrialised countries on a universal level in this important area of policymaking. Norm-setting through FTAs is also analysed at length in section III of the article, which provides a comprehensive review of the plurilateral and bilateral policy developments in e-commerce. The ramifications for developing countries are discussed in the form of a couple of examples. Section IV presents some options for developing countries for the future at the national and international level.
O19|Global Value Chains and Upgrading: What, When and How?|This paper focuses on explaining how technological capabilities interact with trade and GVCs participation to foster upgrading. We analyse trade performance of 74 developing countries in 2000 and 2010 from a perspective of learning, to understand what variables account for technological diversification over time when countries trade, including through GVCs. We find that technological capabilities not only condition the initial determination of local firms in trade and GVCs, but they also determine the extent to which local firms in developing countries manage to leverage knowledge flows and move into activities of greater technological complexity from a dynamic perspective. Our results point to the critical role of national learning variables in countries' performance over time. While emerging economies have synergistic relationships between variables that explain technological capabilities and their trade and GVC performance, this is not the case for developing countries as whole in our sample.
O19|Asian Experiences with Global and Regional Value Chain Integration and Structural Change|This research report investigates the relationship between the growing integration into global and regional value chains (VCs) and structural change in the South and South East Asian (SEA) region. The analysis includes a sample of 60 developed and developing countries covered in the OECD’s Inter-Country Input-Output Tables. Focusing on the SEA region, we find the usual inverted U-shaped relationship between the manufacturing share and per capita income. With regards to the impact of growing VC integration, the econometric results suggest a small positive effect of the overall VC integration on the change in the manufacturing share at the global level. Very similar patterns are found for the South and South East Asian region, however, with a large degree of country heterogeneity. The main beneficiaries from VC integration in the region in terms of the relative importance of manufacturing in the economy include for example Korea and Thailand. Unexpectedly, no significant differences in the (manufacturing-related) structural impacts of regional and global VCs could be identified.
O19|Tax certainty: Proposals for the short term and the long term|Tax certainty aims at the stabilization of expectations of both, taxpayers and governments. Improving tax payer service, easing cooperation channels and clarifying legal framework are strategies already in place to increase tax certainty, even though to different extent depending on the countries level of development. For the short run, concrete measures can be recommended through which international cooperation can contribute to strengthening tax certainty. These measures concern the establishment of enhanced engagement programs, the development of model legislation as a tool for the implementation of international rules and standards, the alignment of bilateral treaties and domestic legislation to international good practices, using the country-by-country-report as an indicator for the adequacy of tax payments and setting up investment incentives. In the long run, a radical change in the international tax scheme is suggested since, amongst others, the current rules do not match with the emerging digital economy. A unitary taxation system might be therefore the appropriate response even if the implementation on an international level is complex.
O19|The new global agenda and the future of the multilateral development bank system|The authors assess the role of the multilateral development system and the reforms needed to support the new global agenda. There is an urgency to the reforms. The coming decades will see the largest urban expansion in history. More infrastructure needs to be built in the next 15 years than the existing stock of infrastructure in the world. Multilateral development banks (MDBs) are uniquely placed to support policy and institutional reforms and build institutional capacity, enhance the quality of projects and programs, and scale up for transformative change. They are the best mechanism today for leveraging public resources. By our calculations, each dollar of paid-in capital could reasonably translate into $50 of public investments if properly allocated. Despite these inherent strengths, MDBs are constrained by their financial and institutional capacities, effectiveness of instruments, and unclear mandates and governance shortcomings. The authors suggest MDBs do more in three client groups: (i) fragile states; (ii) high-debt countries; and (iii) upper middle-income countries, adjusting strategies and use of instruments in each case. With so many issues on the table, they believe that the greatest risk to the system lies in active inertia, a tendency to make changes on the margin that fall short of a collective response that is scaled to the task at hand. Individual MDBs each perform well, according to evaluation results, but their impact could be enhanced if they cooperated more as a system and developed scalable platform approaches. Major expansion is not feasible under current business and financial models. Shareholders need to reach consensus on capital and governance to unlock the financial potential and effectiveness of the MDB system.
O19|Reforming the migration governance system|This paper analyzes and identifies the deficiencies in the current migration governance system, delineates pressing and structural challenges to global governance of forced migration and recommends pathways through which the Group 20, which is an informal forum comprised of the 19 most influential economies in the world and the EU, could play a seminal role to mobilize reform in the current global refugee management system, advocate for better policy formulation and enhanced policy coherence, encourage equitable burden sharing and improve refugee transport and resettlement services in origin, first asylum, transition and destination countries.
O19|Technological justice: A G20 agenda|Technological justice can play an important role within the international system in resolving global challenges and creating a smart and more egalitarian society. Technological and scientific developments are generating huge opportunities for tackling societal challenges. However, the benefits of technology and innovation are unequally distributed, and they tend to cause economic and political disruptions in our societies that widen inequalities within states as well as between countries. Digitalisation and, especially, automation are challenges that must be faced if developing countries are to avoid premature de-industrialization, expulsion from global value chains of the world economy, and the serious damage to their growth paths that would result. The authors propose adopting the concept of 'technological justice' within our societies as a new paradigm for the international system to reconcile technological advances with the societal challenges facing our global society, especially poverty and sustainability; and propose a number of policies and measures by which the G-20 could take on a central role in pushing this major contribution onto the global agenda. The authors participate in the T-20 network of think tanks that facilitates interaction between its members, the public policy community and the general public, being its primary objective to add value to the G20 process with evidence-based public policy proposals on areas of interest for the international agenda.
O19|Monitoring agricultural productivity for sustainable production and R&D planning|Argentina's G20 presidency has emphasized the need to improve soil management and sustainably increase agricultural productivity to achieve an inclusive and resilient food future. While increased agricultural productivity can improve economic welfare and help address food security problems by benefiting both consumers and producers simultaneously, it also must address the depletion of already scarce natural resources. In the context of a changing climate, sustainable and resilient agricultural production forms a major cornerstone of both adaptation and mitigation strategies. The global community needs to have the proper tools with which to monitor sustainable agricultural productivity gains, identify countries and sectors lagging behind, and commit R&D efforts accordingly to address the challenges ahead. As such, it is suggested that 1) an international consortium should monitor agricultural total factor productivity (TFP) to provide international comparisons and track performance over time; 2) the G20 should acknowledge and address the issue of sustainable productivity measurement, and; 3) the G20 should support more in-depth research into the relationship between agricultural TFP and agricultural R&D.
O19|The new urban paradigm|This policy brief argues in favor of a new urban model that harnesses the power that cities have to curb global warming. Such a model tackles fundamental management challenges in the energy, building and transport sectors to promote the growth of diverse and compact cities. Such a model is essential for meeting complex challenges in cities, such as promoting a cohesive social life and a competitive economic base while simultaneously preserving agricultural and natural systems crucial to soil, energy, and material resources. With most of the population living in urban areas, the G20 should recognize the key role that cities play in addressing global challenges such as climate change. Improved measures taken by cities should be an indispensable solution. The G20 Development Working Group, Climate Sustainability Working Group, and Energy Transitions Working Group should incorporate an urban approach to discussions related to climate change.
O19|Regional integration and migration between low-and-middle-income countries: Regional initiatives need to be strengthened|Regional migration within Africa and other developing regions is vital for the economic development of countries of origin and destination and for the welfare of migrants and their families (as recognized by the Sustainable Development Goal 10.7). Going forward, regional migration will be a crucial tool for countries of origin and destination to adapt to demographic trends and environmental changes. Although regional organizations have invested increasing efforts in the promotion of orderly, safe and regular migration, they have received scant acknowledgment in international policies and processes. Yet, they are the most important and most promising entities to promote more liberal migration regimes. The international community, and G20 countries in particular, should support capacity building for these regional organizations and involve them fully in relevant policy dialogues.
O19|Democracy and aid donorship|Almost half of the world's states provide bilateral development assistance. While previous research takes the set of donor countries as exogenous, this article is the first to explore the determinants of aid donorship. We hypothesize that democratic institutions reduce poor countries' likelihood to initiate aid giving. On the contrary, the leadership of poor authoritarian regimes face fewer constraints that would hinder these governments to reap the benefits of a development aid program despite popular opposition. To test our expectations, we build a new global dataset on aid donorship since 1945 and apply an instrumental-variables strategy that exploits exogenous variation in regional waves of democratization. Our results confirm that the likelihood of a democratic country to start aid giving is more responsive to income than it is the case for authoritarian countries. Overall, democracies are - if anything - less rather than more likely to engage in aid giving.
O19|From planning to policy: Half a century of the CDP|The United Nations Committee for Development Policy (CDP) comprises 24 independent specialists from a variety of disciplines. It advises the UN Economic and Social Council on emerging economic, social and environmental issues relevant to sustainable development and international co-operation. The paper argues that since its launch in 1965 the CDP has at times struggled to make an impact, but that it has been most effective when it has been at its most creative and when it has broken with convention. It helped put into practice the target that developed countries should devote 0.7% of their gross national income to official development assistance. The Committee created the least developed countries category and continues to monitor and update membership of the group. Its members were prominent in the genesis of the human development approach and continue to conduct new work in the areas of governance, productive capacity and sustainable development.
O19|Testing the Growth Links of Emerging Economies: Croatia in a Growing World Economy|We estimate a dynamic simultaneous equation model for 16 variables of the Croatian economy in order to test the links of growth with education, R&D, trade, savings and FDI. In order to motivate the choice of variables we review the related theories of growth and look at the relevant data. Permanent shocks increasing the intercepts of the equations for education, R&D, trade, savings and FDI show that most of growth links work well in Croatia, but they also enhance foreign imbalances. Policies to balance the two aspects are briefly discussed. All results should be interpreted with caution due to the small data sample we have up until now.
O19|Neocolonialism or Balanced Partnership? Reframing Agricultural Relations Between the EU and Africa|The media narratives with respect to EU external policies and their effects on developing countries generally paint a picture of unequal power dynamics and negative externalities, particularly with respect to international trade and land grabbing. In this paper, I use trade data to argue that reality is more nuanced and aim to provide a preliminary sketch of the institutional dynamics between the EU and Africa. I focus on agricultural relationships to highlight the interplay between historical path dependencies, colonialism, trade policy and domestic institutions on the EU and African side. While trade is often portrayed in an overly simplified manner as the main factor hindering agricultural development, African countries are often plagued by a long history of extractive institutions, both politically and economically, which lead to a vicious cycle of unequally distributed resources, exploitation, insecure human rights and a lack of incentives for innovation. This becomes apparent when examining phenomena such as land-grabbing, which often involve African elites partnering with foreign investors to conclude controversial deals. Overall, this paper aims to highlight the necessity of building institutional capacity particularly in countries with a long history of extractive institutional continuity, and to underline the importance of state centralisation for agricultural development, so that African partners can fully take advantage of the preferential trade regime with the EU and improve their position with respect to power dynamics.
O19|Education, Governance, and Trade- and Distance-Related Technology Diffusion: Accounting for the Latin America-East Asia TFP Gap, and the TFP Impact of South America's Greater Distance to the North|This paper examines the impact of education, governance and North-South trade- and distance-related technology diffusion on TFP in the South, focusing on South America (SA), Mexico, Latin America (LA) and East Asia for the 32-year period preceding the Great Recession (1976–2007) in a new model that integrates models of trade-related and distance-related international technology diffusion. Our model's explanatory power is 38% (62%) greater than that of the main trade-related (distance-related) model. Findings are: i) TFP increases with education, trade, governance (ETG) and imports' R&D content, and declines with distance to the North; ii) an increase in LA's ETG to East Asia's level raises LA's TFP by some 100% and accounts for about 75% of its TFP gap with East Asia; iii) raising LA's education to East Asia's level has a larger impact on TFP and on the TFP gap than raising governance or openness; iv) the TFP impact on South America relative to Mexico due to its greater distance to US-Canada (Europe) (Japan) is -18.9 (-2.13) (-9.78)%, with an overall impact of -12.4%.
O19|A multi-religious consensus on the ethics of sustainable development: Reflections of the Ethics in Action initiative|"The challenges of sustainable development are primarily ethical in nature. Guided by a ceaseless quest for profit, today's global economy is synonymous with vast amounts of exclusion, indignity, and environmental devastation. To succeed, therefore, the Sustainable Development Goals require ""moral capacity"" as much as financial or technical capacity. In line with the recently-formed Ethics in Action initiative, the authors therefore propose a sequence of measures designed to better orient the global economy toward the common good, coherent with the values of the world's major religious traditions. These proposals are in the areas of financing, the pursuit of justice, and pedagogy."
O19|Bridging the digital divide in the G20: Skills for the new age|The digital divide in general, and between women and men in particular, is a manifestation of exclusion, poverty and inequality, and is likely to continue because of the effects of unemployment, poorly functioning digital skilling programmes and socio-cultural norms in some economies, and further depriving women equal access to digital services. Digital skills provide the poor a catalyst to break out of the cycle of poverty and empower themselves. This paper considers a three-pronged digital skills strategy that will be required for developing countries to break out of the digital divide trap: (1) Monitor the evolving set of digital skills required for employment (2) incorporate a holistic digital skills development strategy into national education programmes, and (3) contextualize skilling programs within prevailing socio-cultural norms that will shape the uptake and impact of digital skilling programs.
O19|Bridging the digital divide: Measuring digital literacy|To promote digital transformation, equal emphasis needs to be placed on digital skills development as to infrastructure development. Integral to investment in digital skills development is the subsequent management and evaluation of digital training programmes. This paper assesses mechanisms to ensure digital training programmes are adequately managed using a standardized data collection framework to measure an internationally accepted digital literacy index. Such an index must be defined by an agile definition of digital literacy responsive to the fluid nature of the digital economy. The paper also explores the extent to which a G20 advisory body may inform a nationally representative data collection strategy within the context of a data collection process that is cognizant of the evolving demands of businesses and users alike.
O19|Beyond wishful thinking: Explorative Qualitative Modeling (EQM) as a tool for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)|The UN's Sustainable Development Goals in their generalized form need to be further reflected in order to identify synergies and trade-offs between their (sub-)targets, and to apply them to concrete nations and regions. Explorative, qualitative cause and effect modeling could serve as a tool for adding crucial factors and enabling a better understanding of the interrelations between the goals, eventually leading to more informed concrete measures better able to cope with their inherent obstacles. This work provides and describes a model that could serve as a template for concrete application. The generalized model already points to some potential ambivalences as well as synergies that can be reflected on using some of the latest theories and concepts from economics and transition research, among other fields. Its first analyses cautiously raise doubts that some possible assumptions behind the original Sustainable Development Goals might overlook some systemic boundaries. For example, an undifferentiated increase of productivity contradicts a lessened environmental impact and need for resources in light of potential planetary boundaries.
O19|Foreign ownership and the export and import propensities of developing-country firms|This paper uses micro-data from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys 2002-2006 to investigate how foreign ownership affects the likelihood of manufacturers in developing countries to export and/or import. Applying propensity score matching to control for differences across firms in terms of labor productivity and other characteristics, we find that foreign ownership is an economically important and statistically significant determinant of the likelihood that a firm will export and/or import. Foreign ownership raises the propensity to export by over 17 and the propensity to import by more than 13 percentage points. The effects are even bigger for the lowest-income countries.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
O19|Nonparametric Counterfactual Predictions in Neoclassical Models of International Trade|We develop a methodology to construct nonparametric counterfactual predictions, free of functional form restrictions on preferences and technology, in neoclassical models of international trade. First, we establish the equivalence between such models and reduced exchange models in which countries directly exchange factor services. This equivalence implies that, for an arbitrary change in trade costs, counterfactual changes in the factor content of trade, factor prices, and welfare only depend on the shape of a reduced factor demand system. Second, we provide sufficient conditions under which estimates of this system can be recovered nonparametrically. Together, these results offer a strict generalization of the parametric approach used in so-called gravity models. Finally, we use China's recent integration into the world economy to illustrate the feasibility and potential benefits of our approach.
O19|Trying to Understand the PPPs in ICP 2011: Why Are the Results So Different?|Purchasing power parity exchange rates, or PPPs, are price indexes that summarize prices in each country relative to a numeraire country, typically the United States. These numbers are used to compare living standards across countries, by academics in studies of economic growth, particularly through the Penn World Table, by the World Bank to construct measures of global poverty, by the European Union to redistribute resources, and by the international development community to draw attention to discrepancies between rich and poor countries. The International Comparison Program (ICP) collects the detailed prices on which these indexes are based on an irregular basis. In 2014, the ICP published PPPs from the 2011 round that are sharply different from those that were expected from extrapolation of the previous round, ICP 2005. These discrepancies will eventually have important implications for the Penn World Table, and for international comparisons of living standards given that the PPPs are used to convert countries' national accounts--GDP and consumption, for example--from local currency to common currency units (international dollars.) The world according to ICP 2011 looks markedly more equal than the world according to ICP 2005. This paper investigates why this happened. We identify a likely source of the problem in the way that the regions of the ICP were linked in 2005. We use two different methods for measuring the size of the effect. Both suggest that the 2005 PPPs for consumption for countries in Asia (excluding Japan), Western Asia, and Africa were overstated relative to the United States by between 18 to 26 percent. Per capita consumption in international dollars of these countries was therefore too low in 2005 and more likely to be accurately estimated in 2011.
O19|Export Sophistication: A Dynamic Panel Data Approach| In this article, we analyze export sophistication based on a large panel dataset (2001–2015; 101 countries) and using various estimation algorithms. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we evaluate the bias properties of estimators and show that GMM-type estimators outperform instrumental-variable and fixed-effects estimators. Based on our analysis we document that GDP per capita and the size of the economy exhibit significant and positive effects on export sophistication; weak institutional quality exhibits negative effect. We also show that export sophistication is path-dependent and stable even during a major economic crisis, which is especially important for emerging and developing economies.
O19|Aid and Growth. New Evidence Using an Excludable Instrument|We use an excludable instrument to test the effect of bilateral foreign aid on economic growth in a sample of 97 recipient countries over the 1974-2013 period. Our instrument interacts donor government fractionalization with a recipient country’s probability of receiving aid. The results show that fractionalization increases donors’ aid budgets, representing the over-time variation of our instrument, while the probability of receiving aid introduces variation across recipient countries. Controlling for country- and period-specific fixed effects that capture the levels of the interacted variables, the interaction provides a powerful and excludable instrument. Making use of the instrument, our results show no significant effect of aid on growth. We also investigate the effect of aid on consumption, savings, investments, and net exports, and investigate heterogeneity according to the quality of economic policy, democracy, and the Cold War period. In no regression do we find that aid affects growth. However, we find that aid increases investment and consumption, while it decreases net exports.
O19|Towards a more efficient use of multilateral development banks’ capital|The increasing financing needs of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), coupled with factors likely to restrain in the near future the growth of multilateral development banks’ (MDBs) own resources, call for maximizing capital efficiency. Focusing on 7 major MDBs – the IBRD, IFC, AfDB, EBRD, EIB, ADB and IADB – this paper contributes to this debate by: (a) quantifying their aggregate available lending capacity(capital resources and ratings being unchanged); (b) providing a preliminary estimate of the impact on these banks’ lending capacity if rating agencies (in particular, Standard and Poor’s) were to refine their methodologies to take into account ‘preferred creditor status’ and ‘single name concentration’, as suggested by other researchers. The analysis is replicated assuming that MDBs target an AA+ rating. The paper shows that appropriately refining rating procedures may indeed increase MDBs’ current overall lending capacity significantly, under both ‘triple-A’ and ‘AA+’ scenarios. At the same time, it makes clear that MDBs alone cannot satisfy what are anticipated to be the very substantial financing needs of SDG-related investments.
O19|Global Collaborative Patents|We study the prevalence and traits of global collaborative patents for US public companies, where the inventor team is located both within and outside of the US. Collaborative patents are frequently observed when a corporation is entering into a new foreign region for innovative work, especially in settings where intellectual property protection is weak. We also connect collaborative patents to the ethnic composition of the firm's US inventors and cross‐border mobility of inventors within the firm. The inventor team composition has important consequences for how the new knowledge is exploited within and outside of the firm.
O19|Remittances, Spending and Political Instability in Ukraine|"This paper analyzes remittances sent by Ukrainian emigrants to their country of origin. It explores the dependence on remittances of a household's spending on human capital, savings and donations, against the backdrop of the political situation in Ukraine in 2004. The paper also explores the effect of the political instability in Ukraine on how the households receiving remittances used them. The results of a Ukrainian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (ULMS) are used to explore households' decision to spend on human capital development, save, or donate money; depending on their political views and future expectations. The main hypothesis tested is whether the individuals who supported and/or were involved with the Revolution (""pro-orange""), and who were optimistic about the future of Ukraine after the Orange Revolution, saved/donated more money than those who did not support the Revolution (""pro-blue-white""). In addition, the level of in uence of remittances received from relatives or friends outside Ukraine on decisions to save and donate money is analyzed. The results show that the political views of respondents do not have a significant effect on decisions to save and/or donate money. However respondents' political orientations do have a significant effect on the probability of receiving remittances those who voted for ""pro-orange"" have a lower probability of receiving remittances from outside the household."
O19|Remittances in Ukraine Using Household Data|This paper analyzes remittances sent by Ukrainian emigrants to their country of origin. It explores the main factors in uencing the probability of obtaining remittances from abroad as well as the amount of remittances. We investigate how theplanned future usage of remittances a ects the likelihood of receiving them. The results of a survey of households in Ukraine were used to investigate the main defining factors for obtaining financial in ows from abroad, in addition to exploring the expenditures financed by remittances. Although the results of our analysis show that few factors have a significant in uence on the probability of obtaining remittances and on their size, this topic warrants further investigation. The findings are important for policymakers as the Ukrainian government might design and implement policies that increase the development potential of remittances, while eliminating their negative side effects.
O19|Why Do Trade Finance Gaps Persist: Does it Matter for Trade and Development?|Trade finance shortfalls now appear regularly. Does this matter for trade expansion and economic development in developing countries? Global trade finance has resumed following the 2009 global financial crisis. However, the pattern of recovery has been uneven across countries and categories of firms. The recovery has been robust for the main routes of trade and for large trading companies. By contrast, access to trade finance remains costly and scarce in countries which have the strongest potential for trade expansion. The policy response to this problem depends on whether this represents a market failure, or a new global equilibrium. We introduce new data from a global survey of firms to argue that real shortfalls are exacerbated by perception gaps in a way that has enabled market failures to persist. This has troubling implications most directly through its effect on the ability for small firms to benefit from the reallocation of production and investment within global supply chains.
O19|Politicized trade: What drives withdrawal of trade preferences?|While it is well understood that industrialized countries use aid to grant political favors, little research covers alternative channels such as trade policy towards developing countries. We analyze eligibility investigations and revoking of U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) benefits to see whether political friends of the U.S. receive favorable treatment. While countries politically aligned with the U.S. are equally likely to be investigated, they are significantly less likely to have their benefits suspended.
O19|Testing for Repugnance in Economic Transactions: Evidence from Guest Work in the Gulf|Despite the large benefits to guest workers from poor countries in rich countries, agencies charged with global poverty reduction do little to facilitate guest work. This may be because guest work is viewed as a repugnant transaction--one whose harmful side effects might cause third parties to discourage it. This paper sets out six criteria for a transaction to be repugnant in consequentialist terms and uses the criteria to formulate several uncommon empirical tests for the repugnance of guest work by Indian construction workers in the United Arab Emirates. It separates the effects of guest work from its correlates using a natural experiment that quasi-exogenously allocates guest work among a group of several thousand job applicants. The effects offer little evidence that guest work in this setting is typically the cause of repugnant consequences.

O19|Engel's Law in the Global Economy: Demand-induced Patterns of Structural Change, Innovation, and Trade|Endogenous demand composition across sectors due to nonhomothetic demand (Engel's Law) affects i) sectoral compositions in employment and in value-added, ii) variations in innovation rates and in productivity change across sectors, iii) intersectoral patterns of trade across countries, and iv) migration of industries from rich to poor countries. This paper offers a unifying perspective on how economic growth and globalization affects the patterns of structural change, innovation and trade across countries and across sectors in the presence of Engel's Law. To this end, we develop a two-country model of directed technological change with a continuum of sectors under nonhomothetic preferences, which is rich enough to capture all these effects as well as their interactions. Among the main messages is that globalization amplifies, instead of reducing, the power of endogenous domestic demand composition differences as a driver of structural change.
O19|Institutions and firmsâ€™ internationalization: an empirical analysis on three Middle East countries|On the basis of a broad definition of firmsâ€™ internationalization, this paper provides an empirical analysis of this question using a two-stage model, which first estimates the determinants of international commitment and the factors explaining the different types of internationalization strategies. The empirical analysis relies on firmsâ€™ individual data covering three countries (Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey) in 2013. We show that the probability of being internationalized and internationalization types depend on a combination of factors such as firmsâ€™ characteristics, access to finance and institutional framework. The determinants of internationalization as well as the number and types of internationalizations are heterogeneous depending firms' size and sectors in which they operate.
O19|Tariff Overhang and Aid: Theory and Empirics|In this paper, we consider aid payments as a possible explanation for tariff overhangs. According to our hypothesis, rich countries may use development aid to pay for tariff concessions. Developing countries, in turn, may anticipate such a policy in the negotiations for tariff bindings. Setting the bound tariff rate at a relatively high level may then serve as a mechanism to incentivize rich countries to carry on with aid payments in the subsequent ``aid for trade’’ game. We empirically examine this hypothesis using detailed data (at the 6-digit HS level) on bound and applied tariff rates under the Uruguay agreement. Our results provide strong support for the view that aid recipients are more likely to adopt tariff overhangs, that they implement larger tariff overhangs than nonrecipient countries and that recipients of larger aid payments adopt tariff overhangs more frequently. We also find strong support of the theoretical model prediction that larger tariff overhangs are implemented by countries that receive more aid.
O19|The ‘China shock,’ exports and U.S. employment: A global input–output analysis|This paper quantifies the impact on U.S. employment from imports and exports during 1995–2011, using the World Input–Output Database. We find that the growth in U.S. exports led to increased demand for 2 million jobs in manufacturing, 0.5 million in resource industries, and a remarkable 4.1 million jobs in services, totaling 6.6 million. Two‐thirds of those service sectors jobs are due to the export of services themselves, whereas one‐third is due to the intermediate demand from manufacturing and resource—or merchandise—exports, so the total labor demand gain due to merchandise exports was 3.7 million jobs. In comparison, U.S. merchandise imports from China led to reduced demand of 1.4 million jobs in manufacturing and 0.6 million in services (with small losses in resource industries), with total job losses of 2.0 million. It follows that the expansion in U.S. merchandise exports relative to imports from China over 1995–2011 created net demand for about 1.7 million jobs. Comparing the growth of U.S. merchandise exports to merchandise imports from all countries, we find a fall in net labor demand due to trade, but comparing the growth of total U.S. exports to total imports from all countries, then there is a rise in net labor demand because of the growth in service exports.
O19|Emerging providers’ international co-operation for development|This paper shows that development co-operation from emerging providers – i.e. countries beyond the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) – significantly increased in recent years, reaching 17% of total global development co-operation in 2014. It also presents a rough estimate, of USD 300 billion, of broader international co-operation by emerging providers and it sets out what types of instruments are used to provide this broader international co-operation.Very little is known about broader international co-operation by emerging providers and the scarce information that is available on different countries cannot be compared. This paper concludes that more information on, and a global measure of, international co-operation for development are needed to enable developing countries to manage the external support they receive and to enable further analysis of the increasingly important role that emerging providers play in developing countries.
O19|Engaging the Private Sector for Green Growth and Climate Action: An Overview of Development Co-Operation Efforts|The private sector plays an important role in supporting green growth in developing countries. As a result, there is increasing emphasis for development co-operation providers to integrate private sector engagement (PSE) approaches into their programmes on green growth and climate change. This paper provides an overview of activities in this area, estimating that 22% of climate-related development finance supported PSE activities in 2013. It also presents a stock-taking of efforts to: mobilise private climate investment, promote green private sector development and harness skills and knowledge of private actors. The paper highlights some challenges and lessons learned, such as the need for PSE to target a wider range of environmental issues, the importance of investing in integrated approaches to enable the development of pipelines, and the need to align private sector approaches with national contexts. The findings in this paper contribute to the discussion on how development co-operation providers can improve the effectiveness of PSE approaches to promote green growth and climate action, and may be a useful starting point to guide evidence-based policy relevant research.
O19|Data for Development: DAC member priorities and challenges|The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development commits the international community to support the modernisation and strengthening of national statistical capacities and systems in developing countries and to increase significantly the availability of high-quality, timely, reliable and disaggregated data to measure their progress against the Sustainable Development Goals. This paper, informed by a survey circulated among DAC members between February and April 2017, presents DAC members’ policies and practices to support national statistical capacities and systems in developing countries. It highlights some of the main challenges that DAC members face in relation to making data work for sustainable development, notably in co-ordinating their support for statistics to avoid duplication and find synergies, in mobilising more resources, and in using quality data for development co-operation decision-making, programming, monitoring and reporting. The findings presented in this paper will inform the analysis of the 2017 Development Co-operation Report on Data for Development which will be published in October 2017. The report will provide guidance to providers of development assistance on how to best support developing countries to have and use quality and timely data for enabling delivery of the SDGs.
O19|Responding to Refugee Crises in Developing Countries: What Can We Learn From Evaluations?|Displacement is at a historic high, with over 65 million individuals currently displaced. The world is facing a refugee crisis that is unprecedented in scale. A large number of evaluations look at different aspects of programming in response to refugee crises in developing countries. This paper covers the key areas and priority topics related to forced displacement identified by the Development Assisstance Committee Temporary Working Group on Refugees and Migration. It draws from evaluation findings to highlight key lessons and recommendations for positive change going forward.Key topics covered in the paper include: lessons on bridging the gap between humanitarian and development programming; efforts to strengthen international response to protracted crises; lessons on whole-of-government approaches in refugee contexts; learning from work in urban settings; improving access to employment and quality education; new financing mechanisms for refugee crises in middle income countries; and lessons on financing in response to the Syria crisis. The paper highlights the evaluation work of DAC members and aims to help strengthen the evidence base to improve response to situations of displacement in developing countries.

The case study looks at the approaches adopted in Ethiopia and Uganda to promote refugee self-reliance and enable refugees to work to earn income. It compares outcomes in the countries, with a specific focus on access to employment and business creation, including legal and socio-economic barriers. The case study draws from a number of evaluations of efforts by the international community to support Ethiopian and Ugandan initiatives. The case study was undertaken as part of a wider research project on learning from evaluations to improve responses to refugee crises in developing countries and supports the synthesis paper ""Responding to Refugee Crises in Developing Countries: What Can We Learn From Evaluations?"""

O19|Dispelling the myths of triangular co-operation: Evidence from the 2015 OECD survey on triangular co-operation|Triangular co-operation features in the 2030 Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda as an instrument to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. It combines the comparative advantages of the different partners involved, creates synergies, promotes learning among all partners and builds relationships based on trust. However, several myths have developed about triangular co-operation projects 1) being small in scale and scope, operating only in niche areas; 2) lacking systematic planning and implementation mechanisms; and 3) having no clear value added. This report addresses these three “myths” by analysing the results from a survey of triangular co-operation that the OECD conducted in 2015. It provides evidence on the “reality” from over 400 projects that were reported by the 60 respondents. The report concludes that triangular co-operation is a highly relevant and strategic mode of co-operation with increasing numbers of projects, budgets and durations, established planning mechanisms and a clear value added.
O19|Strengthening the results chain: Synthesis of case studies of results-based management by providers|This paper presents an analysis of evidence from seven case studies of results-based management by development co-operation providers. Analysis of themes from the case studies reveal six interrelated challenges which providers face in their efforts to manage for the results of development co-operation. The six challenges are: linking results to development goals, ensuring the purpose of results systems is well-defined, weighing up the benefits of aggregating and attributing results from standard indicators, enabling country ownership, using performance information alongside results information, and building and embedding a results culture. Providers continue to adopt a range of approaches to pursue a focus on results and there are many examples of good practice. The case studies suggest that in a complex development landscape some providers are prioritising the use of aggregated results information for domestic accountability, communication, and performance management over their use for learning and policy direction. In this context, the paper argues that in agency-wide results frameworks development co-operation results are often detached (or de-contextualised) from development results and discusses the implications of this, including the use of standard indicators to measure aggregated outputs. The paper uses case study evidence to discuss and suggest practical ways providers can build and maintain a strong results focus which enables analysis, insights and learning, and has achievement of development outcomes as its objective.
O19|Climate Change Adaptation and Financial Protection: Synthesis of Key Findings from Colombia and Senegal|Developing countries are disproportionately affected by the rising trend of losses from climate-related extreme events. These losses are projected to continue to increase in future, driven by climate change and the accumulation of people and assets in high-risk areas. Effective climate change policies are needed to reduce the accumulation of risk, combined with instruments and tools to help retain, share or transfer financial losses if an extreme event occurs. These tools and instruments, collectively known as financial protection, can help people cope with the impacts of climate-related disasters, reduce costs of recovery and reconstruction, and encourage risk reduction. Linking financial protection and climate adaptation in development planning and policy has the potential to increase the resilience of affected communities.This paper uses case studies of Colombia and Senegal to examine how countries are using financial protection as part of their approaches to managing climate risks. The paper identifies emerging
O19|Estimating Publicly-Mobilised Private Finance for Climate Action: A South African Case Study|This study estimates and analyses publicly-mobilised private finance for climate action in South Africa, between 2010 and 2015. The mobilisation effect of public climate finance on private finance is first estimated through an analysis and attribution of project-level co-finance data. A pilot-methodology (the investor perspective) then expands the analysis to also incorporate the mobilisation effect of financial support provided by South African policies in two sectors: renewable energy and energy efficiency. Results suggest that, in the South African context, domestic public actors play the major mobilisation role by providing support through targeted policies, and to a lesser extent by committing project-level co-finance.
O19|Cross-border Co-operation Networks in West Africa|Long seen as artificial barriers inherited from decolonisation, West African borders now lie at the heart of policies designed to encourage regional trade and combat political instability. This rediscovery of the peripheries of the nation state has fostered a proliferation of institutional initiatives that aim to cultivate co-operation between countries, regions and municipalities while ensuring the protection and promoting the interests and rights of the people living in border regions. Despite these regional initiatives, the effective functioning of cross-border co-operation still remains largely unknown across West Africa. The purpose of this paper is to fill that gap, with an analysis of both the social structure and the geography of West African governance networks. On the basis of this structural and geographic analysis, policy recommendations are formulated aimed at implementing policies that are more place-based, more attentive to relations between the actors at play in co-operation, and more specifically adapted to the constraints and opportunities of the West African region.
O19|Les réseaux de la coopération transfrontalière en Afrique de l’Ouest|Longtemps considérées comme des obstacles artificiels hérités de la décolonisation, les frontières ouest-africaines sont aujourd’hui au cœur des politiques visant à favoriser les échanges inter-régionaux et à lutter contre l’instabilité politique. Cette redécouverte des marges de l’État a favorisé la multiplication d’initiatives institutionnelles destinées à favoriser la coopération entre États, régions et communes tout en assurant la protection et la promotion des intérêts et droits des populations frontalières. En dépit de ces initiatives régionales, le fonctionnement effectif de la coopération transfrontalière demeure encore largement inconnu en Afrique de l’Ouest. L’objectif de cette note est de combler cette lacune en analysant la structure sociale et la géographie des réseaux de gouvernance ouest-africains. Sur la base de cette analyse structurelle et géographique sont formulées des recommandations politiques visant à mettre en œuvre des politiques plus territorialisées, plus attentives aux relations entre acteurs impliqués dans la coopération, et plus spécifiquement ajustées aux contraintes et opportunités ouest-africaines.
O19|New Exporters and Continuing Exporters under Exchange Rate Fluctuations|In this paper we investigate the different behaviors between new and continuing exporters in response to exchange rate shocks. We establish a dynamic model, in which new exporters strategically charge a lower price than continuing exporters in order to increase their current sales and accumulate their consumer base in future periods. The model predicts that new exporters adjust their price more aggressively relative to their continuing counterparts in response to exchange rate fluctuations in order to build future demand stock. Using a transaction-level dataset containing all Chinese exporters over the 2000-2009 period, we find supporting evidence for the model's predictions: new exporters adjust their price 1.5 times more than the continuing exporter. Our findings imply different exchange rate pass-through between new and continuing exporters, and the various ratios of new exporters lead to different degree of exchange rate pass-through across countries at the aggregate level.
O19|The European Investment Bank: a new database (1958-2012)|This working paper presents an originally compiled database of European Investment Bank (EIB) lending based on the EIB Annual Reports and documents available at the Historical Archives of the European Union, covering all loans over the period 1958 – 2012. It describes the content of the database, which compiles more than 13,000 loans to 180 countries in a detailed project-by-project basis, the information sources utilized and the coding rules used to create an index of categories. It also includes the borrowings made by the EIB on the financial markets from 1961 to 2012 (with their respective term and nominal rate), exchange rates and subscribed capital. The paper compares the database with the information provided by the EIB webpage, provides descriptive statistics and discusses some possible applications. This database improves transparency and the understanding of the largest worldwide lender, contributing to close the existent gap within the literature concerning this public institution.
O19|Political Instability: The Neighbor vs. the Partner Effect|"This paper investigates the impact of geographical neighbors on the political instability of a country and the role of a country's international relations in shaping the impact of its geographical neighbors. First, we show that political instability in neighbor countries has a strong positive impact on a given country's political instability. Second, we test whether international relations can reduce this impact of geographical neighbors. We find that more active participation in international governmental organizations is associated with lower impact of neighbor countries' political instability on a given country's political instability. Moreover, a country's dependence on its neighbors can be reduced when six or more main trade partners are non-neighbors. Our results indicate that international relations can be an efficient counterforce to the so-called ""neighbor's curse."""
O19|Economics case study: Harvard Business School pedagogy techniques: From teaching entrepreneurship to influencing business policy through research|The case study explains the need for social entrepreneurship while remaining in the premise of mainstream economics. A detailed discussion is carried out on the vulnerabilities of economic policy making that has led to some of the new initiatives at Harvard Business School to promote such pedagogy practices at Business Schools that may eventually influence national and international policy making to the benefit of the society and not only the economies of developed and developing countries. Two brief cases are presented. First one takes evolution of HBS course at a Pakistani university to develop superior pedagogy for student learning towards social entrepreneurship. The other case maps the journey of bilateral relationships between China and Pakistan from Free trade agreement to CPEC as a matter of national policy to evaluate local business risks and potentials.

Since there are many actors involved in different stages and processes of a single LINCOS project, the paper analyses the bilateral and multilateral relationships among these actors to understand the factors that might affect the efficiency of the ICT project. In other words the paper looks at the actors involved in a LINCOS project in an effort to capture those circumstances under which a LINCOS project is exposed to principal- agent problems.
O19|Export Rivalry and Exchange Rate Pass-Through|In this paper we investigate the influence of market rivalry on firm-level exchange rate pass-through. Similar to Bloom et al. (2013), we define market rivalry as product market proximity, and expect the cross market spillovers, i.e., through leaked information or reputation, to affect firm-level export price. Using a dataset from comprehensive Chinese exporters during 2000-2007, we find supporting evidence of this influence. Firms that face a high degree of market rivalry are less responsive to exchange rate fluctuations, which suggests a higher exchange rate pass-through. The influence of market rivalry is stronger on firms that export consumption and heterogeneous products, and to developed countries. Our results are robust to different measures of market rivalry and specifications.
O19|When NGOs fail: A model of advocacy and services provision in weak democracies|We develop a theoretical model in which NGOs financed by foreign donors engage in two types of activities in a developing country: service provision and advocacy. In the model, service provision relieves poverty, but these aid resources risk embezzlement by corrupt authorities. Advocacy can encourage the local population to demand more transparency to the authorities, reducing embezzlement at the cost of investing fewer efforts in direct poverty alleviation. We find that in general advocacy will be underprovided because its benefit, improved governance, has the characteristics of a public good. NGOs can remedy to this under-provision by coordinating their actions, but because this coordination threatens the rents of the local authorities, officials will respond to coordination attempts by cracking down on NGOs. Full coordination is therefore undesirable: crackdown of NGOs will be too strong, which reduces service provision and hurts beneficiaries.
O19|From Final Goods to Inputs: The Protectionist Effect of Rules of Origin|Recent decades have witnessed a surge of trade in intermediate goods and a proliferation of free trade agreements (FTAs). FTAs use rules of origin (RoO) to distinguish goods originating from member countries from those originating from third countries. We focus on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the world's largest FTA, and construct a unique dataset that allows us to map the input-output linkages in its RoO. Exploiting cross-product and cross-country variation in treatment over time, we show that NAFTA RoO led to a sizable reduction in imports of intermediate goods from third countries relative to NAFTA partners.
O19|Intellectual Property Rights and Foreign Technology Licensing in Developing Countries: An Empirical Investigation|The paper addresses the question of whether expanded and strengthened protection of intellectual property (IP) fosters technology transfer to developing countries. Cross-sectional analysis of a representative sample of firms operating in 42 developing economies indicates that going from no IP protection to maximum IP protection is associated with a 65% increase in the predicted probability of licensing foreign technology for the subpopulation of affiliated firms, whereas the predicted probability is not significantly different from zero for unaffiliated firms. We also find evidence that the environment in which a firm operates moderates the relationship of IP protection and firm-level technology licensing: while going from no IP protection to maximum IP protection is associated with a 47% increase in the predicted probability of licensing foreign technology for firms operating in upper-middle-income countries, there is at best no significant correlation for firms operating in lower-middle-income and lowincome countries.
O19|Globalization and Unemployment in Pakistan|This study analyzes the impact of globalization on unemployment in Pakistan, using annual data for the period 1980 to 2013. Using the ARDL econometric framework, we find that the economic, political and social aspects of globalisation differ in their effects. The data suggest that political and social integration, whilst beneficial in the short run, increase the long run expected unemployment rate. Economic integration appears to be only marginally beneficial in the short run; it is significantly beneficial in the long run but cointegration with the other aspects of globalisation means that it cannot fully counteract their undesirable long-run effect.
O19|Integrating Africa: Some Trade Policy Research Priorities and Challenges|This paper discusses opportunities for trade policy research to contribute more to efforts to integrate African markets, a stated policy priority for African leaders. Much of the economic research in this area has sought to quantify aggregate trade costs and the potential welfare impacts of reducing such costs, including through regional integration. This is important, but we argue that more focus is needed on the ‘micro’ dimensions of regional integration. These center on the trade-restricting effects of nontariff measures and regulatory policies and their political economy underpinnings. Of particular importance is research on mechanisms to support market integration initiatives that recognize the multidimensional nature of the sources of trade costs in Africa, and the associated political economy forces within and between countries and regional economic communities.
O19|Green-oriented Knowledge Transfers in global markets: technologies, capabilities, institutions|The development of green technologies represents a key driver in the transition towards environmentally sustainable societies. Among environmental challenges, the implementation of national climate policies and international efforts to face the threat of climate change has been particularly effective at triggering the production of climate-friendly innovation in developed countries. This effectiveness has been acknowledged by several studies which observed that, for example, the production of patents related to renewable energy technologies has sharply increased over the last decades. However, the battle against climate change is far from being over. As the share of greenhouse gases emissions in developing countries is sharply growing, how to promote the transfer of available green technologies to these countries is one of the main challenges that policymakers are facing in recent years. Understanding the mechanisms behind technology transfer of “environmental” knowledge and how such transfer happens among countries with heterogeneous economic conditions and different capabilities is a complex exercise. In this report we provide an overview of the literature on green knowledge transfer and, more importantly, on how such literature can be strengthened to deepen the understanding of the interactions that are at stake. The conceptual analysis is aimed at offering a platform to set in-field projects with stakeholders (research/business oriented), to concretely implement the elaboration and general best practice identification for knowledge and technology transfers in the green economy transition.
O19|Growth, human development, and trade: The Asian experience|This study looks at the three-way relationship between economic growth, human development, and openness to trade in a large panel of developing Asian economies. Using a theoretically motivated simultaneous equations system, we find that although human development contributes positively to economic growth, in the case of our Asian sample growth does not appear to have had a positive influence on human development. Uneven growth accompanied by lagging institutional development, preventing human capital formation, might have inhibited human development in the short to medium run. Complementary to the literature showing that growth is sustainable only when accompanied by human development, we confirm a role for trade liberalisation policies in achieving higher growth as well as human development.
O19|Global value chains, large-scale farming, and poverty: Long-term effects in Senegal|This paper presents panel data evidence on the impact of expansion of global value chains and large-scale export-oriented farms in developing countries over almost a decade. We estimate the income effects of wage employment on large-scale farms in the horticultural export sector in Senegal, using data from two survey rounds covering a seven-years period of rapid expansion of the sector. We estimate average income effects as well as heterogeneous income effects, using fixed effects and quantile fixed effects regressions. We find that poverty and inequality reduced much faster in the research area than elsewhere in Senegal. Employment in the horticultural export sector is associated with higher household income and the income effect is strongest for the poorest households. Expansion of the horticultural export sector in Senegal has been particularly pro-poor through creating employment that is accessible and creates substantial income gains for the poorest half of the rural population. These pro-poor employment effects contrast with insights in the literature on increased inequality from rural wage employment.
O19|On the conditional effects of IMF program participation on output growth|The empirical evidence currently available in the literature regarding the effects of a country’s IMF program participation on its output growth is rather inconclusive. In this paper we propose and estimate a panel data sample selection model featuring state dependence. As in this model the output growth effects of program participation can be conditional on the realization of a state variable (conditional pooling), our framework may reconcile previous empirical evidence based on models without state dependent effects. We find that the effects of IMF program participation on output growth vary systematically with an index reflecting a country’s institutional record, and that output growth effects of program participation are significantly positive only if the IMF program is coupled with sufficient improvement of the institutional record.
O19|How to Take into Account Vulnerability in Aid Allocation Criteria and Lack of Human Capital as Well: Improving the Performance Based Allocation|This paper considers why and how the Performance Based Allocation (PBA) used in multilateral development banks and in particular at IDA, could be improved by taking the structural handicaps of eligible countries into account. The PBA relies on a debatable definition of performance. It does not meet the equity concern raised by the existence of structural handicaps to growth. It neglects the lessons of the aid effectiveness literature. Finally, it suffers from some opacity. We show how it is possible to increase the share of specific groups of countries, such as Sub-Saharan Africa or post-conflict states, in a transparent manner.
O19|Mind the Gap: Analyzing the Impact of Data Gap in Millennium Development Goals’ (MDGs) Indicators on the Progress toward MDGs|This paper analyzes the impact of data gap in Millennium Development Goals’ (MDGs) performance indicators on actual performance success of MDGs. Performance success, within the MDG framework, is quantified using six different ways proposed in the existing literature, including both absolute and relative performance and deviation from historical transition paths of MDG indicators. The empirical analysis clearly shows that the data gap in performance measurement is a significant predictor of poor MDG performance in terms of any of the six progress measures. Larger the data gap or weaker the performance measurement system, lesser is the probability of MDG performance success. The empirical methodology used in the paper combines a Heckman correction and instrumental variable estimation strategies to simultaneously account for potential endogeneity of the key data gap variable and bias due to sample selection. This result holds true even after controlling for overall national statistical capacity and a variety of socioeconomic factors. The paper underlines the need to strengthen the performance measurement system attached to the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the associated Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This paper is the first attempt at empirically evaluating the value of data in the context of international development goals and gives empirical evidence for the need to harness the “data revolution” for sustainable development.
O19|Modeling the Economic Impacts of Korean Unification|This paper explores the economic impacts of Korean unification on North and South Korea. It presents a new consistent database on macroeconomic, sectoral and trade data, and an input–output table for the North Korean economy, and then incorporates it in a global intertemporal multi‐sector general equilibrium model. Assuming hypothetical scenarios such as North Korea's reform and gradual convergence, its sudden collapse and immediate unification, and chaos and crises in both Koreas, we quantify the consequences of Korean unification on economic activity, trade and capital flows in the two Koreas. The results highlight the importance of the unification processes and of alternative policy responses in both Koreas to the economic impacts of unification.
O19|Nationalism and economic openness: The cross-country evidence revisited|In this paper we examine the empirical relationship between economic openness and nationalism. We replicate and extend the cross-country analysis of Lan and Li (2015) using additional measures of nationalism and additional years of data from the World Values Survey. We fail to find the negative relationship between economic openness and nationalism that Lan and Li (2015) find, even when using the same data sources, years and sample of countries. When we expand the sample of countries and years of the data, we find no statistically significant relationship between economic openness and nationalism.
O19|Global investments and regional development trajectories: the missing links| Global investments and regional development trajectories: the missing links. Regional Studies. Regional economic development has been long conceptualized as a non-linear, interactive and socially embedded process: these features were traditionally regarded as spatially mediated and highly localized. However, unprecedentedly fast technological change coupled with the intensification of global economic integration has spurred the need to place regional development in a truly open and interdependent framework. Despite substantial progress in the academic literature, rethinking regional development in this perspective still presents a number of challenges in terms of concepts, empirical evidence and policy approaches. Following an interdisciplinary assessment of how openness and connectivity – proxied by one of the many cross-border flows, i.e., global investments – interact with regional economic development trajectories, this paper presents a picture of the geography of foreign investments from and to the European regions and its change after the financial and economic crisis in 2008. This simple exercise sheds some initial light on how the operationalization of regional connectivity can improve one’s empirical understanding of the evolution of regional economies and the policy approach needed to support their reaction to change.
O19|Economic growth and escaping the poverty trap: how does development aid work?|This paper introduces a theoretical framework for studying the effectiveness of aid for a recipient country, receiving aid to finance its public investment. It contributes to the debate on the nexus between aid and economic growth and in particular on the conditionality of aid effects. Focusing on autonomous technology, government effort, corruption in the use of aid, fixed cost and efficiency in public investment, we can distinguish 4 levels of circumstances following which, the same aid flows may have very different effects. Given donor’s rules, we determine conditions under which the foreign aid can generate economic growth in the long run for the recipient. We also discuss the conditions leading to an economic take-off and an escape from the poverty trap. Analyses of the dynamics of capital also give conditions for a convergence towards a middle income trap or endogenous fluctuations around it.

O19|Trade Related Institutions and Development|The paper focuses on the role played by Trade Related Institutions (TRIs) in shaping trade flows and their development impact in low-income countries and how these TRIs are shaped by international trade. Three types of TRIs are examined: i) trade agreements; ii) trade promotion organizations; and iii) private TRIs, i.e. fair trade labelling, trading platforms and reputation mechanisms. Recent research reviewed for each type of TRI is then followed by suggestions for further work.

O19|Export Tax Rebates and Resource Misallocation: Evidence from a Large Developing Countr|The export tax rebate (ETR) policy is one of the most frequently used policy instruments by Chinese policy makers. This paper therefore provides a vital analysis of its allocation effects. To motivate our empirical analysis for the allocation effects of the ETR policy, we first add a tax rebate to the Melitz and Ottaviano (2008) model and examine the impact of this policy on firms' markup size and resource allocation between eligible and non-eligible firms for the rebates. We use customs transactions, tax administration, and firm-level data to measure the effect of variation in export tax rebates, taking advantage of the large policy change in 2004. A difference-indifference approach allows us to compare the production and pricing decisions of eligible versus non-eligible firms and the distributional implications. We find that an increase in tax rebates shifts production to eligible firms and that tax rebates increase allocative efficiency.
O19|Product quality and sustainability: The effect of international environmental agreements on bilateral trade|This paper addresses the impact of sustainability in production on international trade. In particular, it examines the effect of the International Tropical Timber Agreement (ITTA) on tropical timber trade. The empirical analysis is based on a gravity equation in a difference‐in‐difference setting, which is estimated by a panel Heckman's selection model. This accounts for the potentially systematic selection of trading partners into timber trade activity. We then conduct a comprehensive comparative static analysis solving the structural gravity model with and without the ITTA. This allows us to determine the trade impact of an ITTA‐induced increase in sustainability for participating as well as for third countries. We find that countries participating in the ITTA exhibit a significant and substantial increase in trade values ranging from 4% to 6%. Furthermore, we observe that this effect is more pronounced for smaller member countries. Non‐ITTA countries are confronted with reduced values of tropical timber trade flows.
O19|Microfinance for poverty alleviation: Do transnational initiatives overlook fundamental questions of competition and intermediation?|Numerous microfinance initiatives around the world aim to alleviate poverty in developing countries. However, debate persists about their effectiveness and sustainability – a concern for transnational corporations and the international business community, which contribute about $9.4 billion to microfinance funding. In this policy-oriented article we aggregate findings from two studies in Indonesia that help explain why moneylending can still thrive when low-interest microfinance is widely available and why the poorest borrowers benefit less than the less-poor. To avoid methodological debates about validity, we interview market participants and triangulate the perspectives of borrowers with those of formal and informal lenders. Importantly, our research includes current and past borrowing from formal and informal sources, prompting participants to draw comparisons. We find that the importance to borrowers of key characteristics of informal lending is insufficiently recognized and that inappropriate human resource management and informal intermediation are significant problems. The latter can be an unintended consequence of formal microfinance: The availability of formal low-interest microfinance creates informal intermediation opportunities for entrepreneurs, often developing from casual intermediation into systematic deception. We discuss implications for microfinance policy with reference to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and offer suggestions for further research.
O19|Partenaires émergents : quels enjeux pour la soutenabilité de la dette africaine ?|(english) After debt cancellations, in particular MDRI (Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative) debt ratios in Low Income Country dropped to historic lows. They are now getting into debt again, because of Bretton Woods Institutions (BWI) new loans, of emerging countries’ (namely China) loans, and sometimes because they are able to borrow from international financial markets. BWI try to slow this new debt cycle by putting limits on the non-concessional borrowing of the country that have an agreement with IMF and by better assessing the debt sustainability (IDA-IMF Debt sustainability framework). The lack of transparent data is a major problem. Nevertheless, some convergence between China and traditional donors may be seen, namely in the field of debt relief. This is consistent with the rise of emerging countries in international financial institutions. _________________________________ (français) Après les réductions de dette, notamment l’initiative d’allégement de la dette multilatérale de 2005 (IADM), beaucoup de pays à faible revenu se sont retrouvés avec des niveaux d’endettement extrêmement bas. Leur réendettement progresse à des rythmes variables sous l’effet de nouveaux prêts des Institutions de Bretton Woods (IBW), mais aussi des pays émergents (notamment de la Chine), et parfois même des marchés financiers internationaux. Les IBW cherchent à freiner le réendettement de ces pays en conditionnant leurs prêts à la limitation des financements non concessionnels et en posant des limites aux ratios d’endettement (Cadre de Viabilité de la Dette). Il est difficile de bien analyser le rôle spécifique des pays émergents, car les données ne sont difficiles à réunir précisément. Il apparaît cependant une certaine convergence des positions chinoises envers les pays africains avec celles des autres bailleurs de fonds, visible notamment en matière de réduction de dette. Ceci est cohérent avec la montée en puissance des pays émergents dans les institutions financières internationales.
O19|Supervision and Project Performance: A Principal-Agent Approach|This paper extends and applies principal-agent theory to the performance of donor projects. There is variation in the degree of divergence between the interests of the donor (the principal) and the recipient government (the agent). Further, the effort expended on observation of the agent is a control variable. We show that in a wide range of circumstances an implication of principal-agent theory is that the principal should put greater effort into observation the wider is the divergence of interest with the agent. We then test this prediction using data on World Bank project performance. We measure the degree of divergence between donor and recipient interests, as perceived by the donor, through a donor classification system of recipient governments. Consistent with the theory, we find that donor supervision of projects is significantly more effective in improving project performance where interests are widely divergent. However, donors do not put more effort into the supervision of projects in such cases.________________________________ Cet article étend et applique la théorie Principal-Agent à la performance des projets d’aide. Les intérêts du donneur (le principal) et du gouvernement receveur (l’agent) peuvent différer de manière importante. Dans le modèle, l’effort mis en oeuvre pour observer l’agent est une variable de contrôle. Nous montrons qu’une implication du modèle principal-agent est que le principal devrait faire d’autant plus d’effort pour observer l’agent quand ses intérêts divergent de ceux de l’agent. Nous testons ensuite ces prédictions en utilisant les données de performance des projets d’aide de la Banque mondiale. Nous mesurons le degré de divergence entre les intérêts du donneur et du receveur, telle que perçue par le donneur, par la classification des receveurs comme ‘partenariats difficiles’. Comme prédit par le modèle, nous trouvons que la supervision des projets d’aide par le donneur permet d’autant plus d’assurer le succès des projets que les intérêts du donneur et du receveur diffèrent. Toutefois, le donneur ne semble pas faire plus d’effort de supervision dans les partenariats difficiles.
O19|Losing concentration? Lessons from a Swedish aid policy reform|Sweden is one of the donor countries that signed up for the Paris Agenda, which among other things advocated reducing aid dispersion. It also adopted its own geographical concentration policy in 2007. My empirical analysis shows that Sweden managed to achieve this goal only for two years following the reform and that this was followed by backsliding. Moreover, its current aid policy framework barely mentions the topic. I argue that a major reason was the failure to institutionalize the policy. This left it vulnerable to the regular politics of aid, which tend to generate both geographic and thematic spread. Reduced peer pressure, as the international community has moved away from the Paris Agenda, might also have contributed.
O19|Help not needed? Optimal host country regulation of expatriate NGO workers|Motivated by interventions in poor countries to increase the use of local labor in foreign nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), we address the behavior of these organizations under host government regulation. We extend existing NGO models by distinguishing between local workers and expatriates. The model covers both NGO monopoly and competition in the market for donations. Assuming that NGOs maximize output, we show that regulations in the form of a quota on the number of expatriates or a work permit fee for foreigners reduces NGO output, but increases employment of locals. The optimal quota is more likely to bind in the market structure generating the highest total fundraising surplus. An optimal work permit fee is equivalent to an optimal quota in both the monopoly and duopoly cases. For both instruments, the optimal tightness of regulation is decreasing in the weight the government attaches to the public good relative to domestic incomes and in the importance of NGO output to the supply of the public good. Aggregate NGO output and the level of the public good produced could be higher with a monopoly NGO.
O19|Does The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Add Anything New To Multilateral Finance In Asia?|This paper analyses the AIIB; its mandate, resources, governance and how it compares to the other multilateral development banks operating in Asia. When China proposed a new multilateral development bank in Asia devoted to infrastructure, there were numerous questions raised. These included whether there was really a need for another development bank, whether the new bank would have sufficiently high environmental and social safeguards and be as transparent as the existing ones. This examines the AIIB in comparison to the existing multilateral development banks in Asia and in particular the ADB with its emphasis on infrastructure. The paper finds that there is certainly a need for more funding but it isn’t clear that it is best met by another multilateral.
O19|Who Benefits from Fairtrade? Evidence from the Swedish Coffee Market|This paper analyses how the premium customers pay for Fairtrade-labelled coffee is distributed in the Swedish market, using information on costs of production and scanner data on almost all roasted and ground coffee products sold by retailers. A key finding is that roasters and retailers get 43–70%, while producer countries, in this paper comprising coffee farmers, cooperatives, middlemen, exporters and Fairtrade International, get 24–51%. Fairtrade Sweden gets 5–8%. These values are upper and lower bounds that reflect assumptions made about the additional costs of producing roasted and ground Fairtrade coffee, given the cost of beans and the Fairtrade license, and whether conventional coffee is compared with organic or non-organic Fairtrade coffees. Since roasters’ and retailers’ margins are higher for Fairtrade than conventional coffee, there is evidence that Fairtrade retail prices are higher than the level attributable to costs. However, producer countries receive a significantly larger share of the premium paid than reported in earlier studies, which are either dated or analyse very small samples of coffees.
O19|Regional Innovation Systems and Global Flows of Knowledge|The literature on regional innovation systems emphasizes the role of the region as locus for interactive learning and knowledge exchange, stressing the importance of (geographical) proximity for innovation (Asheim and Gertler 2005). Even though the importance of extra-regional knowledge is widely acknowledged (Trippl et al. 2015), there has been only little emphasis on the particular role and the nature of global knowledge flows. The aim of this chapter is to explore the differentiated nature of global knowledge flows in regional innovation systems. We provide an overview of the different ways firms can gain access to global knowledge sources. Identified knowledge sourcing channels include international R&D collaborations, foreign direct investments, personally embedded relationships, international mobility of skilled labour, virtual communities and online platforms, and the participation in temporary clusters such as fairs, exhibitions, and conferences (Maskell et al. 2006, Aslesen and Sardo 2016). Depending on regional innovation system preconditions, firms use and combine different knowledge sourcing channels to access global knowledge. Firms in organisationally thick and diversified regional innovation systems have a geographical advantage in accessing knowledge globally, but even firms in peripheral areas can exchange knowledge worldwide, due to improved means of transport and communication at distance. Furthermore, not only multinational companies that are dominated by analytical or synthetic knowledge bases, but even small and medium sized enterprises in symbolic industries are often deeply involved in global knowledge sourcing activities. We illustrate our arguments with interview data collected among New Media firms in southern Sweden and in the Oslo Region in Norway.
O19|Earnings, savings, and job satisfaction in a labor-intensive export sector: Evidence from the cut flower industry in Ethiopia|While labor-intensive export-oriented industries typically bring positive economic benefits to countries through employment generation, the effects of employment in these industries on various aspects of workers’ welfare are less well-studied. This paper considers the case of the cut flower industry in Ethiopia to provide such quantitative evidences. We collected workers’ primary data and conducted incentivized experiments to measure their cognitive abilities, risk preference, and other behavioral characteristics. Based on propensity-score matching and doubly robust estimations to facilitate rigorous comparisons, we find that production workers in the cut flower sector earn significantly more than similar workers in other sectors, most probably due to the flower farms’ interest to reduce costly worker turnovers. In addition, workers in the sector save more regularly than workers in other sectors who have similar characteristics, and the amount saved relative to the income level is also higher, after controlling for the frequency of wage payment and employment status. The subjective valuation of their jobs is also higher in the cut flower sector, particularly in terms of the income level, stability, and future prospect, but workers in the sector are not necessarily more satisfied with the type of work they do. Unlike other sectors where wage payment decreases with worker’s age, wage in the flower sector does not vary with age. Risk-averse individuals are more satisfied in the cut flower sector, while work experience reduces the satisfaction level on future prospect more in this sector relative to other sectors.
O19|Organizational Efficency or Bureaucratic Quagmire: Do Quality at Entry Assessments Improve Project Performance?|Do quality at entry assessments enhance the delivery of development projects? In this paper we take advantage of approval and execution systems in place at the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to examine whether projects that have higher quality at entry--captured through grading scores provided by a checklist--perform better in terms of project implementation performance indicators. Implementation indicators include measures based on actual versus planned schedule of activities and cost outlays, as well as percent of loan disbursed. The analysis suggests higher scores on project logic and economic analyses at entry have had a positive impact on project performance. However, monitoring and evaluation and impact assessment scores had limited impacts on performance. The evidence supports the hypothesis that the use of a checklist can be an effective framework for assessing quality at entry for IDB projects, though there is scope to improve the checklist for certain indicators.
O19|Education, Governance, and Trade- and Distance-related Technology Diffusion: Accounting for the Latin America-East Asia TFP Gap, and the TFP Impact of South America’s Greater Distance to the North|This paper examines the impact of education, governance and North-South trade- and distance-related technology diffusion on TFP in the South, focusing on South America (SA), Mexico, Latin America (LA) and East Asia for the 32-year period preceding the Great Recession (1976-2007) in a new model that integrates models of trade-related and distance-related international technology diffusion. Our model’s explanatory power is 38% (62%) greater than that of the main trade-related (distance-related) model. Findings are: i) TFP increases with education, trade, governance (ETG) and imports’ R&D content, and declines with distance to the North; ii) an increase in LA’s ETG to East Asia’s level raises LA’s TFP by some 100% and accounts for about 75% of its TFP gap with East Asia; iii) raising LA’s education to East Asia’s level has a larger impact on TFP and on the TFP gap than raising governance or openness; iv) the TFP impact on South America relative to Mexico due to its greater distance to US-Canada (Europe)(Japan) is −18.9 (−2.13) (−9.78)%, with an overall impact of −12.4%.
O19|Better management practices and their outcomes in shrimp farming : evidence from small-scale shrimp farmers in Southern Vietnam|Despite the growth of aquaculture exports from developing countries in recent years, a high percentage of these products are rejected at developed countries' ports because of non-compliance with international standards. This paper presents a case study of the shrimp aquaculture sector in Vietnam to examine the factors behind the persistence of such port rejections. In particular, we focus on why the so-called Better Management Practices (BMPs) are not appropriately adopted by many farmers and examine whether the number and types of information sources matter in farmers' decisions on BMP adoption and whether BMP adoption actually leads to better performances. On the basis of our estimation using primary data collected in Southern Vietnam, we find that information sources and training experiences indeed matter in the adoption of a higher number of BMPs and that BMP adoption indeed reduces the possibility of disease outbreaks. These results prove the effectiveness of BMPs and suggest the importance of disseminating knowledge regarding them to farmers through experts.
O19|Long-Range Growth: Economic Development in the Global Network of Air Links|We study the impact of international long-distance flights on the global spatial allocation of economic activity. To identify causal effects, we exploit variation due to regulatory and technological constraints, which gives rise to a discontinuity in connectedness between cities at a distance of 6,000 miles. We show that improving an airport’s position in the network of air links has a positive effect on local economic activity, as captured by satellite-measured night lights. We find that air links increase business links, showing that the movement of people fosters the movement of capital. In particular, this is driven mostly by capital flowing from high-income to middle-income (but not low-income) countries. Taken together, the results suggest that increasing interconnectedness induces links between businesses and generates economic activity at the local level but also gives rise to increased spatial inequality locally, and potentially globally.
O19|Relative Winners and Losers from Efficiency Spillovers in Africa with Policy Implications for Regional Integration|Studies that have analyzed the efficiency of developing countries have estimated non-spatial frontier models. We extend this approach by accounting for spatial dependence among African countries. In particular, we estimate a spatial Durbin stochastic production frontier model. We also make novel use of the efficiency scores from our spatial model to suggest a direction for regional integration policy for Africa that policy makers can consider. A previous suggestion to promote regional integration in Southern Africa has been to use South Africa as a regional integration hub and to encourage other countries in the region to improve economic links with the hub. We continue with this line of enquiry and although we conclude that there are currently no African countries that are ideal candidates to be a regional integration hub, we suggest three other countries that policy makers may consider using as hubs in the future. We therefore suggest that it would be prudent to consider implementing policies to expedite the readiness of these countries to act as integration hubs.
O19|El comercio Sur-Sur y Sur-Norte: ¿cuál contribuye más al desarrollo de Asia y América del Sur? Ideas a partir de la estimación de elasticidades-ingreso de la demanda de importaciones|La experiencia de la crisis económica mundial indujo a los países en desarrollo a intensificar la diversificación de las fuentes de crecimiento buscando modelos alternativos de desenvolvimiento económico. La expansión del comercio Sur-Sur se fue afianzando en esta búsqueda. Pero ¿cuán prometedora es esta estrategia? Procurando dar respuesta, aquí se documenta la evolución del comercio Sur-Sur, ofreciendo algunas consideraciones teóricas. Luego se realiza un análisis econométrico para estimar las elasticidades-ingreso de la demanda de importaciones en las relaciones comerciales bilaterales entre países en desarrollo de Asia y América del Sur y dos mercados clave del Norte. Al aplicar un modelo ardl, el análisis produce variados resultados sobre si el comercio Sur-Sur presenta mayores elasticidades-ingreso que el Sur-Norte, revelándose que el primero puede ser una fuente alternativa de crecimiento, especialmente si persisten las diferencias en el aumento de las importaciones y el ingreso entre el Norte y el Sur.
O19|South-South trade and South-North trade: which contributes more to development in Asia and South America? Insights from estimating income elasticities of import demand|The experience of the global economic crisis led developing countries to intensify the diversification of sources of growth, seeking alternative models of economic development. The expansion of South-South trade assumed greater significance in the context of this search. Yet how promising a strategy is this? In attempting to answer this question, this paper documents the evolution of South-South trade and puts forward some theoretical considerations. It then undertakes an econometric analysis to estimate the income elasticities of import demand in bilateral trade relationships among developing Asian and South American countries and two key Northern markets. On applying an ARDL model, the analysis yields mixed results in terms of whether South-South trade presents higher income elasticities than South-North trade. Still, the findings show that South-South trade can be an alternative source of growth, especially if South-North income and import growth differentials persist.
O19|Understanding China's Belt & Road Initiative: Motivation, framework and assessment|The Belt & Road Initiative is China's greatest international economic ambition, aiming at stimulating economic development in a vast region covering sub regions in Asia, Europe and Africa, which accounts for 64% of world population and 30% of world GDP. The Initiative is devised to reconfigure China's external sector in order to continue its strong growth. While infrastructure development plays a central role, the Belt & Road Initiative is a comprehensive one, including also policy dialogue, unimpeded trade, financial support and people-to-people exchange. It is too early to assess the impact of this ambitious Initiative. It certainly has the potential of turning the underdeveloped “Belt & Road” region into a new vibrant economic pillar and contributing to economic policy thinking by incorporating successful experiences of emerging market economies. However, the Initiative also faces very high barriers, including lack of central coordination mechanism, potential clash of different political regimes and beliefs and financial viability of cross-border projects.
O19|Too much and too fast? Public investment scaling-up and absorptive capacity|A recent trend in several low-income developing countries has been a rapid scaling-up of public investment. It is argued that in the presence of limited absorptive capacity countries are not able – in terms of skills, institutions, and management – to translate additional public investment into sustained output growth. We test for the presence of absorptive capacity constraints using a large dataset of World Bank investment projects, approved between 1970 and 2007 in 80 countries. Our results indicate that projects undertaken in periods of public investment scaling-up are less likely to be successful, although this effect is relatively small, especially in poor and capital scarce countries. We also verify that this effect is unrelated to large aid flows and donor fragmentation.
O19|With a little help from my friends: Global electioneering and World Bank lending|This paper investigates how World Bank lending responds to upcoming elections in borrowing countries. We find that investment project loans disburse faster when countries are aligned with the United States in the UN. Moreover, disbursement accelerates in the run-up to competitive executive elections if the government is geopolitically aligned with the U.S. but decelerates if the government is not. These disbursement patterns are consistent with global electioneering that serves U.S. foreign policy interests but jeopardizes the development effectiveness of multilateral lending.
O19|The interaction and sequencing of policy reforms|In what order should a developing country adopt policy reforms? Do some policies complement each other? Do others substitute for each other? To address these questions, we develop a two-country dynamic general equilibrium model with entry and exit of firms that are monopolistic competitors. Distortions in the model include barriers to entry of firms, barriers to international trade, and barriers to contract enforcement. We find that a reform that reduces one of these distortions has different effects depending on the other distortions present. In particular, reforms to trade barriers and barriers to the entry of new firms are substitutes, as are reforms to contract enforcement and trade barriers. In contrast, reforms to contract enforcement and the barriers to entry are complements. Finally, the optimal sequencing of reforms requires reforming trade barriers before contract enforcement.
O19|Is tied aid bad for the recipient countries?|This paper examines the welfare effects of the exclusivity of foreign aid taking consideration of donor countries' strategic and self-interested economic motivations. Based on an oligopolistic model with strategic interactions between firms and governments providing foreign aid, we demonstrate that a higher exclusivity of foreign aid, taking the form of tied aid, increases the equilibrium amount of aid and the social welfare of the recipient country when the foreign aid policies are decided in a non-cooperative fashion between donor countries. However, when donor countries coordinate aid policies to maximize joint-welfare including recipient country's welfare, the lower exclusivity of foreign aid, taking the form of untied aid, will increase the equilibrium amount of aid and the global social welfare. The results implicate that when a credible enforcement mechanism for the cooperative regime for foreign aid is not available, tied aid is welfare dominant policy for both donor and recipient countries than untied aid.
O19|Interpreting bargaining strategies of developing countries in climate negotiations. A quantitative approach|Despite the efforts made during the last climate conferences (COPs), countries participating in the negotiation process are still far from reaching an agreement on the implementation of a new Post-Kyoto climate regime. The growing role played by developing countries in negotiations is one of the main causes behind the deadlock. Further attention should therefore be paid to the composition of the alliances formed by developing countries in order to better understand the key structural features driving their bargaining positions. By applying a cluster analysis, this paper aims to investigate the role played by heterogeneity in specific characteristics of developing countries in explaining divergent costs and benefits associated with alternative climate negotiation outcomes. By clustering developing countries according to their economic, geographic, environmental, energy, and social characteristics, the paper presents some considerations on climate political economy strategies in these countries with respect to existing bargaining coalitions.
O19|The composition of trade flows and the aggregate effects of trade barriers|A widely used class of quantitative trade models implicitly assumes that patterns of comparative advantage take a specific form such that they have no influence over the effect of trade barriers on aggregate trade flows and welfare. In this paper, I relax this assumption, developing a framework in which to analyze the role of interactions among countries' patterns of comparative advantage in determining the aggregate effects of trade barriers. My model preserves much of the tractability of standard aggregate quantitative trade models while allowing for the effects of any pattern of comparative advantage, across many products and countries, to be taken into account. After fitting my model to product-level trade data, I find that the composition of trade flows is quantitatively important in determining the welfare gains from trade and the aggregate effects of trade barriers. A key finding is that the welfare gains from trade tend to be larger and more skewed in favor of low-income countries than an aggregate model would suggest.
O19|Your development or mine? Effects of donor–recipient cultural differences on the aid-growth nexus|Development aid from the West may lead to adverse growth effects in the global South due to the neglected cultural differences between development aid (paradigm) providers and recipients. I test this hypothesis empirically by augmenting an aid-growth model with proxy variables for cultural differences between donors and recipients. First, I use donor–recipient genetic distance, i.e., blood types, to capture the traditional way of cultural transmission. Second, I use western education of recipient country leaders to capture resource-based transmission of culture. Results of the OLS panel estimation in first differences show that a one unit increase in donor–recipient genetic distance reduces the main effect of aid on growth by 0.2 percentage points when aid is increased by one percentage point. In turn, a one percentage point increase in aid yields on average a 0.3 percentage point increase in growth after a decade for countries with western educated leaders.
O19|Quantitative easing and the post-crisis surge in financial flows to developing countries|This paper examines gross financial inflows to developing countries between 2000 and 2013, with a focus on the potential effects of quantitative easing (QE) policies in the United States and other high-income countries. We find evidence for potential transmission of QE along observable liquidity, portfolio balancing, and confidence channels. Moreover, we find that QE had an additional latent effect over and above these observable channels, one that survives an array of robustness tests, retains its significance across different types of financial flows, and which cannot be attributed to changes in expectations or elasticity. Our baseline estimates place the lower bound of a QE effect at around 5 percent of gross inflows above trend, for the average developing economy, which is a magnitude comparable to a one standard deviation change along the traditional channels. We also find evidence of heterogeneity among different types of flows; portfolio (especially bond) flows tend to be more sensitive than FDI to our measured QE effects.
O19|Trade partner diversification and growth: How trade links matter|We analyze the effects of a country’s export connections on its income growth using trade partner diversification (TPD) measures that capture the country’s relative importance in the international trade network. On top of the standard trade openness measures, TPD measures are shown to enter growth regressions positively and significantly, where one standard deviation increase in TPD is associated with a 1–1.5 percentage point increase in the annual growth rate. Threshold analyses show that TPD measures are positively and significantly correlated with growth in countries that have low financial depth, high inflation, low levels of human capital, or high trade openness.
O19|Trade liberalization, FDI inflows, environmental quality and economic growth: A comparative analysis between Tunisia and Morocco|The aim of this research is to investigate the possible economic impacts of the trade liberalization on the environmental quality in Tunisia and Morocco. Specifically, the paper inspects whether or not liberalization of the trade sector has harmed the quality of the environment in both countries. To this end, we conduct various econometric models: a VECM and cointegration techniques for single country case study and a Panel VECM and Panel cointegration when using data of both countries as a group. We also include a dummy variable in each model to see the real impact of trade liberalization for both countries. In the empirical section, we found bidirectional causality between FDI and CO2. This implies that the nature of FDI inflows to Morocco and Tunisia are not clean FDI. These results show that trade liberalization has a negative impact on the environment. The paper concludes that although trade liberalization boosted the economies of both countries by creating new employment opportunities, liberalization has harmed the environment.
O19|Does the trade gravity model depend on trading partners? Some evidence from Vietnam and her 54 trading partners|This paper finds that the influence of trade gravity variables is dependent on trading partners. For instance, trade with rich nations is more sensitive to distance, economic size, and trading partners, openness of trading partners, and exchange rate, than trade with low income nations. Nonetheless, the paper suggests that the trade policy should not ignore the importance of the level of development, maintenance of close economic ties, and the influence of the ASEAN, APEC, and the WTO on trade in the long and short run. This is found for the bilateral trade relations between Vietnam and her top 54 trading partners over the period 1986 to 2010.
O19|Productivity, firm size and trade liberalization in a partner country: Evidence from Korean firm-level data|In this paper, I study the impact of partner-country tariffs on Korean firm-level productivity for the period from 2005 to 2009. I start by documenting that the rates at which total factor productivity, spending on technology, number of exporting firms, and exports grow are increasing with firm size. My results show that a reduction in China's tariffs induces Korean firms above median size to increase their productivity. Also, I find that the effect of any given tariff reduction is highest in the uppermost quartile of the firm-size distribution.
