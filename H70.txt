H70|Planificación urbana en América Latina: el caso de Valledupar (Colombia)|Los estudios de caso sobre desarrollo urbano en Colombia se han concentrado en dos de las ciudades más pobladas: Bogotá y Medellín (Salazar, 2007; Beuf, 2012). Mientras tanto, el éxito en la planificación de otras ciudades con menor población ha sido menos visible. Este es el caso de Valledupar en la región del Caribe: a pesar de que ha sido destacado como un proceso exitoso de planificación urbana (Rojas y Daughters, 1998; Maldonado, 2004), permanece en gran parte sin explorar. El objetivo de este documento es reconstruir las diferentes etapas de la planificación urbana en Valledupar utilizando cartografía, archivos históricos, periódicos, entrevistas, documentos e imágenes.

Meanwhile, the success of other smaller cities remains less visible. This is the case of Valledupar in the Colombian Caribbean region: although it has been highlighted by many authors as a case of successful urban planning, it remains largely unexplored (Rojas y Daughters, 1998; Maldonado, 2004). The aim of this paper is to reconstruct the different stages of urban planning in Valledupar using cartography, historical archives, newspapers, interviews, documents, and images. The period analyzed comprises from the beginning of the twentieth century to the first decades of the twenty-first century. In the aggregate, the experience of Valledupar points out the importance of formulating and enforcing urban development plans. In addition, strengthening of institutions appear to be of outmost importance for local progress.
H70|Overcoming History through International Organizations - Historical Roots of EU Support and Euroscepticism|There is little causal evidence about deep-rooted sources of support for shifting power from nation-states to international organizations. Focusing on the European Union, this paper develops the hypothesis that citizens appreciate the role of international organizations in constraining member state’s the more, the more negatively their region was historically affected by the actions of nation-states. For identification, I use the historically homogeneous regions of Alsace and Lorraine in France as a natural experiment. A municipal level geographical regression discontinuity design documents that more negative exposure led to persistently higher EU support in three important referenda and less success of Eurosceptic parties in parliamentary elections. This effect is not driven by linguistic differences, migration, socioeconomic factors or public good provision, but linked to a stronger European identity. This stronger identity is neither explained by perceived economic benefits, nor comes at the expense of a weaker national or regional identity.
H70|Setting the Stage for RMB Internationalisation - Liberalizing the Capital Account and Strengthening the Domestic Bond Market|Internationalizing the Renminbi pertains to the new era of China’s reform, starting at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party. It is not a technical reform, but a political one. The objective is threefold: to match China’s autonomy in economic policy, to further Asian integration, and to safeguard worldwide multilateralism against by the rise of protectionist forces. The challenge has been aggravated by the protectionist policies pursued by the US, degrading ipso facto the functions assumed by the dollar in the international payment system. China’s authorities have drawn lessons from the Asian crisis of 1997-98 and the systemic crisis of 2008-09. They are now searching for a second-best option in advocating a multilateral international payment system based on the SDR. The process of currency internationalization is linked to the modernization of domestic capital markets. Studying the progress in both dimensions makes the first two parts of the paper We ask the following questions. In the first part: which steps has China taken, and should take in the future, to complete the gradual process of currency internationalization currently under way? In the second part: how can China build the deep and resilient bond market required to attract international investors? A shorter third part examines why emerging market countries are incentivized to issue their government debt in their own currencies to attract foreign investors in the lingering context of ultra-low interest rates in the main convertible currencies. The status of a freely usable currency, already reached by the Renminbi in its prudent internationalization, together with a reform of the huge domestic bond market, should make China able to attract foreign saving. This is compatible with the Belt and Road Initiative, which is bound to mobilize massive capital exports in the form of long-term loans.

H70|La Guajira: caracterización departamental y municipal|En este documento se describen los activos con que cuenta el departamento de La Guajira en cuanto a sus recursos naturales y talento humano, así como su infraestructura y sus instituciones. De igual forma, se analizan sus indicadores económicos y sociales y se identifican sus brechas internas y con respecto del resto del país. Esta región estratégica para el país, que es parte del Gran Caribe y que tiene frontera con Venezuela, tiene un gran potencial de desarrollo, pero también grandes desafíos en cuanto a ofrecer a su población condiciones dignas de vida y oportunidades para la reducción de la desigualdad, el reconocimiento de su diversidad cultural, el fortalecimiento de sus instituciones y la diversificación de su economía. A las acciones ya emprendidas por el Gobierno Nacional, en el marco de las órdenes dadas por la Corte Constitucional para asegurar la protección de la infancia y la adolescencia wayuu, hay que sumar un plan de inversiones que garantice el desarrollo productivo del departamento, concertado en un contrato plan o en un nuevo Pacto territorial.
H70|Well-being, Political Decentralisation and Governance Quality in Europe| European nations allocate public sector resources with the general aim of increasing the well-being and welfare of their citizens through a fair and efficient distribution of these public goods and services. However, “who” delivers these goods and services and “how well” they are delivered are essential in determining outcomes in terms of well-being. Drawing on data from the European Social Survey database, this paper uses Amartya Sen’s social welfare index framework—accounting for the trade-off between the maximization of public sector resources and an equitable distribution of these resources—to examine the influence of political decentralisation (“who” delivers the resources) and whether this influence is moderated by governance quality (“how well” they are delivered) on individual subjective well-being. The findings of the econometric analysis reveal that decentralisation does not always lead to higher well-being, as the benefits of political decentralisation are highly mediated by the quality of national governance. In countries with high governance quality, political decentralisation results in a greater satisfaction with health provision, while in lower quality governance countries, a more decentralized government can increase the overall satisfaction with life, the economy, government, democracy and the provision of education, but not necessarily with health-related services.
H70|Building consensus: Shifting strategies in the territorial targeting of Turkey's public transport investment|A growing amount of research explores how the allocation of regional development monies follows electoral reasons. Yet, the existing literature on distributive politics provides different and contrasting expectations on which geographical areas will be targeted. We focus on proportional representation (PR) systems. While in such settings governments have incentives to target core districts and punish foes', we suggest that when incumbents attempt to build a state-party image they may broaden the territorial allocation of benefits and even target opposition out-groups. We exploit data on Turkey's public transport investment for the period 2003-2014 and in-depth interviews to provide results in support of our hypothesis.
H70|Affordable Housing and City Welfare|Housing affordability has become one of the main policy challenges for the major cities of the world. Two key policy levers are zoning and rent control policies. We build a new dynamic equilibrium asset pricing model to evaluate the implications of such policies for house prices, rents, production and income, residential construction, income and wealth inequality, as well as the spatial distribution of households within the city. We calibrate the model to New York City, incorporating current zoning and rent control systems. Our model suggests large welfare gains from relaxing zoning regulations in Manhattan, and more modest gains from reducing the size of the rent control program. The former policy is progressive and a Pareto improvement, while rent control reform is regressive in nature and hurts the current beneficiaries.
H70|Can ATMs Get Out the Vote? Evidence from a Nationwide Field Experiment|"We report on a large-scale field experiment to assess ATMs (automatic teller machines) capacity to ""get out the vote"". This is a heretofore unexploited method. Our experimental design used the universe of functioning ATMs in Portugal. We randomly selected a set of treatment civil parishes, where a civic message took over the totality of ad time, which we compare with a set of control areas. The campaign we follow was active for three days before and during the 2017 local elections. Although we do not achieve statistical significance on a stable but small average treatment effect, when we consider the intensity of treatment, results show a statistically significant increase in the likelihood of voting. Placebo tests using turnout rates in previous elections strengthen our interpretation. We ran a post-treatment survey around ATMs located in two neighbouring civil parishes, one treated, the other not. We found a sizeable difference in recall."

H70|North Caucasus in 2018: factors of changes|This article deals with a brief evaluation of developments in the regions of North Caucasus in 2018 as they can be regarded as indicators of significant changes in that part of the country. Such developments include personnel changes in the government of Dagestan where for the first time in the post-Soviet period key positions in the region were taken by officials who never worked in that republic, as well as large-scale public activities in Ingushetia over the issue of the region’s borders.
H70|Kommunal medfinansiering og kampen for at forebygge indlæggelser: Viden om effekt / Municipal co-financing of regional health services and the fight to prevent hospital admissions: Knowledge about effects|Municipal co-payment is an arrangement where municipalities pay a variable amount to the regions whenever municipal citizens utilize regional health services, e.g. hospital services og GPs. The 5 Danish regions provide somatic and mental health services while municipalities mainly provide home nursing, home help, health visitors, rehabilitation, and child and youth dental services. Municipalities cannot employ physicians who actively treat patients. Municipal co-payment was introduced in 2007 in connection with the structural reform of municipalities and counties. The main idea was that economic incentives in the form of potential savings on co-payment would lead municipalities to look for alternatives to (some) regional health services. The municipalities have developed, among other things, acute beds (usually in conjunction with nursing homes) staffed by experienced home nurses that GPs can refer patients to instead of hospitalizing them, acute nursing teams that provide services in the homes of citizens, follow-home-service where home nurses follow discharged hospital patients to their homes (occasionally together with a GP) and evaluate care needs – in the hope of avoiding rehospitalizations. To the extent that these arrangements have been evaluated they are discussed in this paper. None have shown clear-cut indications of preventing or postponing hospitalizations. The paper services two aims: A literature review of above reports and an econometric analysis of panel data for 2007-2016/17. The econometric analysis did not show any significant effects on hospital admissions.
H70|Term Length and Public Finances: The Case of U.S. Governors|This paper studies how a politician’s term length affects public finances. I test whether the gradual increase fromtwo- to four-year terms for American governors affects state finances using a rich state-year panel stretching back almost a century. The results show that adopting four-year terms decreases annual expendituresand revenues by 6 %. The effect of the reform is present immediately after voters approve the ballot measure, when the last two-year-term governor is still in office, which suggests that the mechanism at work is stronger re-election incentives for the incumbent. The effect is larger among electorally ’at risk’ governors. Democratic governors respond to longer terms by increasing public employment instead of decreasing expenditures.
H70|Towards an Institutional Interpretation of TFP Changes in China|This research note reiterates the productivity theory in the Solow growth accounting framework to explore an institutional interpretation of changes in total factor productivity. In theory, total factor productivity or TFP growth is a costless gain in output, which captures the effect of positive externalities caused by spillovers of technological and organizational changes in a perfect market system. This provides a yardstick to gauge institutional effect on output in an imperfect market system if all inputs are properly measured. Using the Chinese case, I show that an integrated approach a la Jorgenson and Griliches (1967) that ensures a consistency between theory, methodology and measurement can facilitate empirical exercises even with data problems, and a so-constructed TFP index for China can satisfactorily reproduce China's post-reform productivity path with institutional interpretations.
H70|The Flat Tax: What Degree of Simplification Does It Imply?|According to its creators, the principal purpose of the original Flat Tax (FT: HALL AND RABUSHKA, 1985-1995) was to simplify the graduated PIT. This claim was broadly accepted, and the debate has since focused on other aspects of the proposal (single rate, redistribution effects, the tax treatment of corporations, and so on). The aim of this paper is therefore simply to analyse the simplification effects of the Flat Tax (FT). We shall be examining the criticisms made by the FT’s supporters in regard to the complications of a standard graduated PIT, the alleged simplifications ascribed to the introduction of the FT, and the robustness of such claims. We conclude that several reservations may be raised with regard to the claimed simplification that would result from the introduction of a FT. Such reservations, together with other weaknesses of the FT, may help explain why to date its diffusion has been limited to a small, specific group of countries (mainly former communist countries in Eastern Europe).
H70|Searching for the optimal territorial structure: The case of Spanish provincial councils|Modern states are organized in multi-level governance structures with economic and political authorities dispersed across them. However, although there is relatively widespread consensus that this form of organization is preferable to a centralized authority, the same cannot be said about its jurisdictional design, that is, how to transfer authority from central states to both supranational and subnational levels. This lack of consensus also exists in contexts with explicit initiatives to strengthen political ties such as the European Union (EU), and even within EU member countries, a situation that is aggravated by the relative scarcity of contributions that measure the advantages and disadvantages of different territorial organizations. We explore these issues through a study of one EU country, Spain, whose provincial councils (diputaciones) are often the subject of debate and controversy due to their contribution to increasing public spending and their purported inefficiencies, corruption, and lack of transparency. Specifically, we combine a variety of activity analysis techniques to evaluate how they impact on local government performance. Results suggest that, in general, the presence of a provincial council has a positive impact on local government performance, but when their activity levels are too high the effect can become pernicious.
H70|The impact women's leadership in local Governments: The case of Spain|The main objective of this paper is to analyse whether the gender of the mayor and the municipal council members affects compliance with the principles of budgetary stability and financial sustainability contained in Organic Law 2/2012 on Budgetary Stability and Financial sustainability. We find that in Spanish local governments during the period 2013–2016, the leadership of women mayors contributes to improving the financial situation of the local government. In particular, the presence of women mayors governing with a high proportion of female councillors increases the probability of compliance with regulations on budgetary stability, financial sustainability and the legal debt limit. Thus, the Law for Effective Equality of Women and Men favours compliance with the Law on Budgetary Stability and Financial Sustainability. In addition, the results show that in pre electoral periods, women mayors are less likely to employ strategies designed to enhance their re election chances.
H70|Occupy Government: Democracy and the Dynamics of Personnel Decisions and Public Finances|We study the causes and consequences of patronage in Brazilian cities since the country’s re-democratization. We test key mechanisms – fiscal rules, accountability, political ideology, and rent-seeking – and estimate the consequences of patronage for public finances. Our data consist of the universe of public sector employees merged with their party affiliations, and a dynamic regression discontinuity design is applied to disentangle patronage from the growing political participation. The short-term patronage effect is large, with winning political coalitions increasing their shares of public sector workers and wages by 4 and 6 percentage points, respectively, during a mayoral term. Part of this effect lasts longer than a decade, with winning coalitions also occupying civil servant jobs that perform service-oriented tasks. This political occupation of government jobs is not associated with ideology, though. Instead, lack of accountability and rent-seeking are the primary driving forces, while reliance on intergovernmental transfers only increases patronage for smaller cities. Higher patronage does not affect the size of local governments, but it changes the composition of expenditures: hiring politically connected workers crowds out, almost one-to-one, non-affiliated employees. Overall, patronage accounted for more than half of the dramatic increase in public sector political employment since the Brazilian re-democratization.
H70|Factions, Local Accountability, and Long-Term Development: Theory and Evidence|We develop a theoretical model of how factional affiliation and local accountability can shape the policy choices of local officials who are concerned about political survivals, and subsequently affect the long-term local development. We provide empirical evidence in support of the theoretical predictions using county-level variations in development performance in Fujian Province in China. When the Communist armies took over Fujian Province from the Nationalist control circa 1949, communist cadres from two different army factions were assigned as county leaders. For decades the Fujian Provincial Standing Committee of the Communist Party was dominated by members from one particular faction, which we refer to as the strong faction. Counties also differed in terms of whether a local guerrilla presence had existed prior to the Communist takeover. We argue that county leaders from the strong faction were less likely to pursue policies friendly to local development because their political survival more heavily relied on their loyalty to the provincial leader than on the grassroots support from local residents. By contrast, the political survival of county leaders from the weak faction largely depended on local grassroots support, which they could best secure if they focused on local development. In addition, a guerrilla presence in a county further improved development performance either by intensifying the local accountability of the county leader, or by better facilitating the provision of local public goods beneficial to development. We find consistent and robust evidence supporting these assumptions. Being affiliated with weak factions and having local accountability are both associated with sizable long-term benefits that are evident in terms of a county’s growth and level of private-sector development, its citizens’ education levels, and their survival rates during the Great Chinese Famine. We also find that being affiliated with the strong faction and adopting pro-local policies are associated with higher likelihood of a local leader’s political survival.
H70|Who Becomes a Member of Congress? Evidence From De-Anonymized Census Data|We link future members of Congress to the de-anonymized 1940 census to offer a uniquely detailed analysis of how economically unrepresentative American politicians were in the 20th century, and why. Future members under the age of 18 in 1940 grew up in households with parents who earned more than twice as much as the population average and who were more than 6 times as likely as the general population to hold college degrees. However, compared to siblings who did not become politicians, future members of Congress between the ages of 18 and 40 in 1940 were higher-earners and more educated, indicating that socioeconomic background alone does not explain the differences between politicians and non-politicians. Examining a smaller sample of candidates that includes non-winners, we find that the candidate pool is much higher-earning and more educated than the general population. At the same time, among the candidate pool, elections advantage candidates with higher earnings ability and education. We conclude that barriers to entry likely deter a more economically representative candidate pool, but that electoral advantages for more-educated individuals with more private-sector success also play an important role.
H70|Local labor impact of wind energy investment: an analysis of Portuguese municipalities|Investment in wind power has grown remarkably in the past decades in Portugal. Although economic development is an argument for investment incentive policies, little evidence exists as to their net impact on local-level unemployment. Using a panel of all 278 Portuguese mainland municipalities for the years 1997-2017, we assess the existence, distribution and duration of local level labor impacts of wind power investment. Our results show there are short term effects during the construction phase. We estimate a decrease of 0.05 percentage points in the total unemployment rate for each KW per capita installed. These effects are confined to unskilled labor and male workers. Further analysis of spatial interaction finds positive spatial spillovers for municipalities that are 30km or less away but not farther, implying workers are willing to commute but not migrate. We find no evidence of sustained effects or impact during the operations and maintenance phase, despite both short and long term impacts in municipalities' revenues.
H70|School spending and extension of the youth voting franchise: Evidence from an experiment in Norway|Changes in population age composition is challenging in modern welfare states. Intergenerational conflicts may have important consequences for provision of services directed towards specific age groups as schooling and care for elderly. A relevant question is to what extent the supply side responds to changes in the age composition of the electorate in terms of actual spending policies. This paper exploits a novel experiment that took place in Norway in the 2011 local elections to estimate the causal relationship between local government school spending and the age composition of the electorate. We exploit that the voting age was reduced from 18 to 16 years in local elections in selected local governments (experimental governments), while voting age was kept at 18 in the rest (control governments). Using a difference in differences strategy, we find that compulsory school spending decreased by approximately 2% in the experimental governments. The results are robust across a number of econometric specifications and robustness checks. Since all the newly enfranchised voters had just finished compulsory school and receive no direct benefits from local government school spending, the result is consistent with selfish voter behavior.
H70|Rural study of Korea|This paper examines the role of rural regions in the economic transformation of Korea. The analysis at regional level reveals that, while having experiencing continued urbanisation and rapid demographic shift of aging and depopulation, the Korean rural areas performs well in terms of productivity growth thanks to the relatively higher share of tradable sectors in rural economies. It also provides the overview of how the rural policy in Korea, which has evolved in response to the socio-economic changes and growing well-being concerns. With the balanced national development at the centre of the national agenda for decades, regional policy approaches have diversified from state-led large projects to flexible policy packages and functional approaches to enhance rural economies and well-being. Finally, the paper presents a number of international policy approaches that can be useful for Korea, including the case of France, Italy and Sweden.

H70|Improving Subnational Government Development Finance in Emerging and Developing Economies: Toward a Strategic Approach|Considerable attention has been given to enhancing subnational development finance in response to the 2008 global financial crisis and recent global development agendas, including the Sustainable Development Goals, Financing for Development, and Habitat III/New Urban Agenda. Much work on this topic is fragmented, focusing on specific elements of development finance: fiscal transfers, capital market access, public-sector lending agencies, or public–private partnerships. Most countries, however, have a range of subnational governments with varying needs and capacities that require different and evolving mixes of development finance mechanisms. Enabling greater subnational borrowing is often desirable but requires adoption of other reform policies to improve the fiscal capacity and creditworthiness of subnational governments over time. We review the rationale and potential for improving subnational development finance, outline the overall landscape of institutional arrangements available for this purpose, and consider broad challenges involved. Based on a review of global practice and experience in selected Asian developing countries with a range of special entities and innovations to enhance subnational investment, we propose a more integrated, strategic approach to building subnational development finance.
H70|How Local Economic Conditions Affect School Finances, Teacher Quality, and Student Achievement: Evidence from the Texas Shale Boom|Whether improved local economic conditions lead to better student outcomes is theoretically ambiguous and will depend on how schools use additional revenues and how students and teachers respond to rising private sector wages. The Texas boom in shale oil and gas drilling, with its large and localized effects on wages and the tax base, provides a unique opportunity to address this question that spans the areas of education, labor markets, and public finance. An empirical approach using variation in shale geology across school districts shows that the boom reduced test scores and student attendance, despite tripling the local tax base and creating a revenue windfall. Schools spent additional revenue on capital projects and debt service, but not on teachers. As the gap between teacher wages and private sector wages grew, so did teacher turnover and the percentage of inexperienced teachers, which helps explain the decline in student achievement. Changes in student composition did not account for the achievement decline but instead helped to moderate it. The findings illustrate the potential value of using revenue growth to retain teachers in times of rising private sector wages.
H70|Democracy and inequality: The case of Mexico|Democracy and inequality: The case of MexicoIt might seem contradictory to talk about democracy and inequality. We cannot forget that one of the principles defining a democratic regime is equality. Nevertheless, history shows that in many democratic States, at least in their definition, inequality remains a challenge and at the same time and in consequence, to keep democracy or consolidate it are challenges too. This paper would try to respond to this research question: how inequalities impact the quality of democracy in the Mexican case?.We choose that country because it has been considered, theoretically speaking, a democratic regime since 1917, and a young democratic regime in its practice since 2000, but the quality of its practice remains poor without being able to talk about its consolidation in terms of Schmitter. Another characteristic of that country is its economic, social, and political gaps among citizens. How can democracy remain in a country where people are living with food, housing, and educational shortcomings? Has democracy allowed those inequalities? What has been the price that democracy has paid for keeping those inequalities? Are those inequalities that allow the political regime to be in place? These are some of the questions to be answered. Our work hypothesis is that the social and economic inequalities have damaged the quality of democracy. They delay its consolidation, with consequences reflected in poor citizenship participation in State?s affairs, since it presents difficulties to improve active citizenship, because of the conditions of some people, making them unable to be considered as agents in their State and the decisions-making process. We would also consider how identity, inclusion and recognition are taking place in Mexico and how could those elements take place to improve democracy, increase social cohesion and reduce insecurity, illegal practices and violations to human rights.
H70|Applying green public procurement to food supply and catering services:Case study in Latvia|Green public procurement (GPP) is a process whereby public and municipal authorities seek to procure goods and services with the lowest environmental impact throughout their entire life cycle, taking into account also the life cycle costs compared to products with the same primary function. GPP can reduce not only the environmental impact, but also promote social benefits and budget savings. The requirements for GPP and the procedure for its application in Latvia are determined by governmental regulations. That requires mandatory application of the GPP to seven groups of goods and services, among them food and catering services. In 2017, the share of total procurements that self reported application of GPP was 11.8% in financial expression, but in 2018 - 18.4%. In 2017, according to self reports 54% of all food product tenders and 79% catering services were marked as GPP tenders. In 2018 already 90% of all food product tenders and 99% catering services are marked as GPP tenders. However, to what extent we can rely on self reports? To evaluate application of GPP requirements for food products and catering services, we screened in total 106 tenders (73 tenders for the supply of food products and 33 for catering services), which were published from July 1, 2017 till July 1, 2018, comparing the tender documents with the governmental regulations. We found that the terms in the Technical Specifications and other tender documents were often unclear. The most common included criterion was requirement that the food products supplied may not contain or be produced from genetically modified organisms (97%). While the second most frequently used criterion is so called higher quality food (28%) e.g. certified as organic, national quality schemes or from integrated agriculture. However, only 4% of the tender documents gave higher priority exclusively for organic food compared to local quality schemes or integrated agriculture. Considering that organic foods are usually higher priced, it can be assumed that only in 4% of cases procurements result in delivering organic food. 18% of the tenders require foods from the national food quality scheme, and 16% of the tenders require products from either organic farming or integrated agriculture. In order to promote organic food, purchasers should more clearly require organic products.
H70|The Northern Ireland Economy: Problems and Prospects|This paper examines the performance of the Northern Ireland economy in recent decades and shows that it has suffered from very low productivity growth. This has meant that the regional economy has grown very slowly and this performance compares badly with that of other regional economies, such as Scotland and East Germany. The key factor behind the poor productivity performance in Northern Ireland has been the low investment in physical and human capital. The failure to reform the education system to reduce the number of early school leavers and increase the numbers of graduates is the single most important factor in the low growth. Large transfers from central government have ensured that the standard of living in Northern Ireland is close to the UK average and above that of Ireland. However, the dependence of Northern Ireland on these transfers leaves it very vulnerable to shocks. Brexit will, undoubtedly, have serious negative consequences for the Northern Ireland economy. Possibly more serious for Northern Ireland are the changes taking place in the politics of the UK which could see a reduction in transfers in the future. The best economic outcome for Northern Ireland is one where future UK governments commit to providing continuing large transfers to Northern Ireland for at least a further decade in return for a change in regional economic policy aimed at promoting economic growth. Public expenditure needs to be reallocated from sustaining consumption, especially public services, to investing in education and infrastructure. While painful initially, it would move the Northern Ireland economy onto a sustainable growth path. Another option, Irish unity, if it involved ending transfers to Northern Ireland, would produce a dramatic fall in the standard of living there. Alternatively, unification, where Ireland took over responsibility for the transfers to Northern Ireland, would necessitate a major cut in the standard of living in Ireland of 5% to 10% in order to allow Northern Ireland to maintain a standard of living between 10% and 20% above the Irish standard of living. Whatever form Irish unity took there would be a heavy economic cost for both Northern Ireland and Ireland.
H70|Your vote is (no) secret! How low voter density harms voter anonymity and biases elections in Italy|Italian voters are assigned to a specific polling station according to their address. After an election, candidates know how many votes they received in each polling station. When the number of voters per polling stations is low and candidates are many, this jeopardises the secrecy of voting and candi- dates can more easily detect deviations from pre-electoral pledges. Exploit- ing variation in the number of voters per polling station across cities and over time, combined with rich data on politicians in office in all Italian mu- nicipalities between 1989 and 2015, we estimate the effect of voter density on the probability of re-election for local politicians. We find that when the number of voters per polling station is lower (and secrecy is at greater risk), incumbents have a higher probability of re-election. The analysis addresses the potential endogeneity of voter density. The results are stronger in regions with lower social capital and worse institutions.
H70|Local labor impact of wind energy investment: an analysis of Portuguese municipalities|Investment in wind power has grown remarkably in the past decades in Portugal. Although economic development is an argument for investment incentive policies, little evidence exists as to their net impact on local-level unemployment. Using a panel of all 278 Portuguese mainland municipalities for the years 1997-2017, we assess the existence, distribution and duration of local level labor impacts of wind power investment. Our results show there are short term effects during the construction phase. We estimate a decrease of 0.05 percentage points in the total unemployment rate for each KW per capita installed. These effects are confined to unskilled labor and male workers. Further analysis of spatial interaction fi nds positive spatial spillovers for municipalities that are 30km or less away but not farther, implying workers are willing to commute but not migrate. We find no evidence of sustained effects or impact during the operations and maintenance phase, despite both short and long term impacts in municipalities' revenues.
H70|Subnational government finances and capabilities for regional economic development in Uruguay: 1990-2016|The purpose of this work is to reflect on the relationship between subnational finance and the capabilities for regional economic development in Uruguay. It presents rigorous evidence of recent work on the relationships between fiscal decentralization, intergovernmental transfers and regional disparities in Uruguay. This is analyzed together with new available information on the evolution of subnational finances and a critical analysis of the productive policies developed in the country. It seeks to contribute to the current debate on the relationships between territorial development, decentralization and the role of public policy to reduce regional disparities. In this regard, it is concluded that these challenges require a better financing scheme for local development, with greater management capacity for decision-making at the local level. For this, as a prerequisite, it is urgent to improve the technical and management capacities of subnational governments.
H70|Subnational government investment and dynamic fiscal rules|The paper tries to deal with issue how to increase local government investment finance without jeopardizing fiscal position of local government as well as overall macroeconomic stability. One of the key challenges is to resolve an everlasting conflict between central and subnational government tier related to different perspectives of each jurisdiction. Namely, central government level is more concerned for macroeconomic position and usually is more inclined to centralise debt management and limit borrowing powers of subnational government. On the other hand, subnational government utilizes borrowing for large local communal infrastructure needs but faces short-term perspective of political mandate, which demands control aimed for prevention of excessive borrowing. In addition, heterogeneity of local governments in terms of fiscal capacity and fiscal position makes general deficit sharing mechanisms as poor solution to intergovernmental fiscal management. General deficit sharing mechanisms usually base on fixed budgetary limits, which do not enable control for weak subnational government units and exert too high limitations for more progressive ones. Introduction of more precise dynamic fiscal rules, which account for specific fiscal standing of each local government and fiscal system, would provide incentive for more productive borrowing policies. Such mechanism overcomes short-term financing perspective that comes from short-term political horizon and mid-term focus of budgetary documentation. The results of the research brings clear policy recommendations. It is possible to replace existing deficit sharing mechanisms by more productive and efficient dynamic system. This would bring not just improved debt management control but provide incentive for more efficient borrowing.
H70|Challenges Of The Romanian Decentralization System- In The Light Of The European Administrative Space|This paper is intended to identify and assess with a critical eye some of the challenges that lie ahead on the road to decentralization in the Romanian administrative space. The article offers a look into the mechanisms and instruments of Romanian decentralization system and outlines the gap between a syncopeted decentralization system and the public administration activities. The diversity of concepts and skills, related to decentralization launched in the European Administrative Space, results in decreased rigidity of existing state organizations, encouraging local government to explore new forms of decentralization and cooperation. The analysis of the local government allowed us to identify the place of the community in relation to the central apparatus of the state, meaning its inclusion in the local government sub-system, in terms of territorial structure. The research aimed the way local government were built and configured, focusing on the principle of decentralization and local autonomy, which is the basis of these institutions and reveals local democracy. A final section covers the study on the complexity of legal relations established between the state, local government and Governors. In summary, the purpose of the paper is to stimulate the reflection on how the local government change their position in the administrative space, within a complex process that increases the role of local government, the inter-institutional changes and democratization of the local administrative system.
H70|An assessment of local fiscal autonomy: facts and myths|"The presentation deals with the problem of shaping the decentralized system of public finance and interpretation of fiscal autonomy indicators. The analysis is theoretical and empirical. In the theory we can discuss two extreme scenarios: decentralised (60% own revenue, 40 % external revenue) and centralised system of public finance (40% own revenue, 60 % external revenue). If we assume only 40% share of own revenue, taxes, in the structure of financing sources for local government units, the consequence of this is low budget resilience to unfavourable external and internal factors and high probability of occurrence of broadly understood negative income shocks. The aim of the discussion is to analyse the trends in the practice of local government finances in Poland and selected countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The literature of the subject, studies by international institutions as well as data from Eurostat and EC are used in the deliberations. The discussed countries differ significantly in the scope of fiscal decentralisation. Latvia, the Czech Republic and Poland seem to be most advanced in the process. However the example of Poland shows limits and difficulties with interpretation of statistical measures. It is necessary to look at the categories of revenues which belong to the so-called ""own revenues"". It is questionable that in Poland we treat in the statistics the shares in Personal Income Tax and Corporate Income Tax as own revenues. Local government units do not exert any influence on the structure and amount of PIT and CIT (category of shared taxes). The autonomy in expenditure without real fiscal autonomy and responsibility leads to fiscal illusions and undermine the local democracy."
H70|Determinant of Income Inequality in Indonesia: Study Case 33 Provinces in 2011-2016|This study intends to determine whether factors of income inequality in Indonesia based on regional data. Economic growth, unemployment, and inflation represent macroeconomic factors, whereas regional expenditure is deemed as a factor of the fiscal side. In the term of the financial, the study used the share of tradable sector credit to the total credit of commercial bank. By applying, the fixed effect panel framework, the study concluded that the factors of the macroeconomic and credit impact on income inequality, while the regional expenditure is not significant. However, the study also found that the impact of economic growth on inequality is positive which is different from previous studies. This suggests that the impact of economic growth tend to serve more middle and upper-income groups than lower income. Furthermore, the regional expenditure is mainly dominated by the personnel expenditure that has limited impact on income inequality. In addition, the disbursement of capital budgets is relatively low for roads, irrigation, and networking.
H70|Application Of The Positional Pot-Topsis Method To The Assessment Of Financial Self-Sufficiency Of Local Administrative Units|In this paper we propose new approach to the construction of synthetic measure, where the objects are described by the characteristics with strong asymmetry and outliers. The aim of the paper is to present the application potential of the tools of the Extreme Values Theory (EVT) i.e. Peaks over Threshold Model (POT) in constructing a synthetic measure based of positional Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), that utilize the spatial median of Weber. POT model has been used for identification of outliers and to determination of the positive and negative ideal solutions of financial self-sufficiency of local administrative units (LAUs). This approach is used in the assessment of financial self-sufficiency of LAUs in Poland in 2016.
H70|Assessing the development status of local administrative units with the use of a modified quantifiable SWOT method|The purpose of this paper is to assess the development status of local administrative units (LAUs) with the use of a modified quantifiable SWOT analysis based on Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The proposed method was used for assessing the socio-economic development status of municipalities located in the Pozna? district (Poland) in 2016. Based on research, four main types of development status were identified: the aggressive, competitive, conservative and defensive type. Also, the level of exogenous and endogenous socio-economic development was assessed. The study was based on statistical data from the Central Statistical Office in Poland. The method presented in this paper is of a universal nature and may be used as well for SWOT analyses of other spatial and economic units.
H70|The mainstream economics interpretation of the local state and central-local relations in Post-Mao China: a critical review|Decentralization and the role of local governments have long been touted as key factors in the Chinese economic miracle. This paper intends to critically assess the chief theories advanced by mainstream economics in its attempt to make sense of these aspects of ChinaÃ­s growth story. Firstly the theoretical underpinnings of fiscal federalism, new institutional economics, and market-preserving federalism approaches will be presented, as these theories offer the bedrock for most of the applied insights in which China is framed through the lenses of the central-local relations debate. Secondly, the idea of Ã«market-preserving federalism, Chinese-styleÃ­ will be critically appraised, highlighting its shortcomings. Thirdly, the paper proceeds by bringing in the mainstream response to these problems, relying on the notion of political incentives and career concerns faced by local cadres. It will be argued that the continual adherence to some core tenets dear to the new institutional economics literature in all previous explanations prevents this broad camp of knowledge to properly grasp the complex dynamics of ChinaÃ­s decentralization drive and the role of local governments in the process. Finally, and in closing, an alternative approach will be offered.
H70|To the Victor Belongs the Spoils? Party Membership and Public Sector Employment in Brazil|We analyze how political discretion affects the selection of government workers, using individual-level data on political party membership and matched employer-employee data on the universe of formal workers in Brazil. Exploiting close mayoral races, we find that winning an election leads to an increase of over 40% in the number of members of the winning party working in the municipal bureaucracy. Employment of members of the ruling party increases relatively more in senior positions, but also expands in lower-ranked jobs, suggesting that discretionary appointments are used both to influence policymaking and to reward supporters. We find that party members hired after their party is elected tend be of similar or even higher quality than members of the runner-up party, contrary to common perceptions that political appointees are less qualified. Moreover, the increased public employment of members of the ruling party is long-lasting, extending beyond the end of the mayoral term.
H70|El sistema de transferencias fiscales sociales en Uruguay: un análisis de su composición y comportamiento cí­clico|In this paper, we analyze the performance over the economic cycle of different items of social-type fiscal expenditures in Uruguay during the period 1988:1 to 2015:4. The study is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a descriptive analysis of the regulations and composition governing the current system of public transfers in Uruguay. Section 3 analyses the performance of the structure of the tax-transfer system in Uruguay. Section 4 details the behavior of the different tax transfers for Uruguay, identifying their pro- or countercyclical nature. In section 5, we analyze how the way in which fiscal transfers have been updated or indexed has been able to influence the cyclical behavior of public transfers. Finally, section 6 outlines conclusions and policy recommendations.
H70|Regional Risk Sharing and Redistribution - The Role of Fiscal Mechanisms in Switzerland|This paper analyses the importance of fiscal mechanisms for regional risk sharing and redistribution in Switzerland. Switzerland is a particularly interesting setting in this context because it features both a high level of fiscal autonomy for Swiss cantons and explicit fiscal transfers between the federal government and the cantons. Based on panel-data analysis we study the redistributive and stabilizing properties of fiscal equalization transfers, federal government transfers in general, direct federal taxation, the unemployment insurance scheme and the first pillar pension scheme. We find a combined redistributive effect of these mechanisms of about 20%. This means that long-run income differentials of 1 Swiss Franc between cantons translate into differences of long-run disposable income after taxes and transfers of about 80 cents. The combined contemporary stabilization effect with respect to short-term income fluctuations amounts to less than 10%, which is a small effect compared to previous findings for other countries.
H70|Equalization transfers and the pattern of municipal spending: An investigation of the flypaper effect in Germany|"We investigate how lump-sum equalization transfers affect expenditures and taxes in the municipalities of the largest German state North Rhine-Westphalia. In general, those general-purpose transfers cannot be treated as exogenous variables. Thus, for the identification of causal effects, two exogenous adjustments in the transfer allocation formula are used as instrumental variables. Findings suggest the existence of the ""flypaper effect"" - municipalities use transfers to increase expenditures but do not reduce tax rates. Extra money from transfers is mainly used to finance social expenditures and public facilities. A set of robustness checks, including a spatial dependence model, confirm the results."
H70|Öffentliche Betriebe<BR>[Public Firms]|Öffentliche Betriebe weisen einige Besonderheiten gegenüber privaten Betrieben auf. Dazu werden nach dem Zweck öffentlicher Betriebe und ihren unterschiedlichen Rechtsformen in Deutschland die betrieblichen Teilfunktionen Beschaffung, Produktion, Absatz, Personal, Finanzierung und Rechnungswesen näher betrachtet. Außerdem werden die Besteuerung und Reformen von öffentlichen Betrieben sowie Hybridformen zwischen öffentlichen und privaten Betrieben untersucht.
H70|Appointed Public Officials and Local Favoritism: Evidence from the German States|We study the local favoritism of appointed German state ministers. Matching hand-collected data on ministersâ€™ place of residence to a sample of more than 8,000 west German municipalities during the period 1994â€“2013, we ï¬ nd that the home municipality of a state minister experiences higher employment growth than control municipalities. Given the institutional context, this effect is ostensibly due to apolitical favoritism (home bias) rather than electoral considerations. We conclude that favoritism may lead to a distortion in the allocation of public resources even in contexts with strong political institutions.
H70|One Billion Euro Program for Early Childcare Services in Italy|In 2007 the Italian central government started a program by transferring funds to regional governments to develop both private and public early childcare services. Exploiting the different timing of program implementation across regions, we evaluate its effectiveness in boosting the public supply of early childhood educational services. We find that the ratio between the available slots in public early childhood education and the population of those aged 0-2 increased by 18.1% three years after the start of the program, with respect to the pre-program level. The program impact was however nil in the South and totally driven by the Center-North.
H70|Fiscal stability during the great recesion: Putting decentralization design to the test|There is a longstanding debate in the economics literature on whether fiscally decentralized countries are inherently more fiscally unstable. The Great Recession provides a fertile testing ground for analyzing how the degree of decentralization does actually affect countries’ ability to implement fiscal stabilization policies in response to macroeconomic shocks. We provide an empirical analysis aiming at disentangling the roles played by decentralization design itself and several recently introduced budgetary institutions such as subnational borrowing rules and fiscal responsibility laws on country’s fiscal stability. We use OECD countries’ data since 1995, which includes both a boom period of worldwide economic growth and the Great Recession. Our main finding is that well-designed decentralized systems are not destabilizing. But, in addition, sub-national fiscal and borrowing rules should be at work to improve the overall fiscal stability performance of decentralized countries.
H70|The Effect of Council Size on Municipal Expenditures: Evidence from Italian Municipalities|"I study the effect of council size on municipal expenditures by using a rich data set providing information on Italian municipal budgets over the period 2001-2007. By implementing a Sharp Regression Discontinuity Design, I find a negative relationship between local government size, as measured by total expenditures per capita, and the council size. Similar results are found when I consider expenditures that are more directly under the control of bureaucrats, such as current expenditures per capita. Finally, I test the ""law of 1/n"" on pork barrel policies, finding again a negative effect of council size on capital expenditures per capita."
H70|Las finanzas autonómicas en 2017 y entre 2003 y 2017|En este informe se analiza la evolución de los ingresos y gastos autonómicos y el saldo presupuestario del sector desde 2003 hasta el presente. En la primera parte del trabajo se presta especial atención al comportamiento del gasto por habitante a precios constantes. Seguidamente se analizan en cierto detalle las cuentas de los últimos ejercicios, destacando el efecto que sobre ellas han tenido algunos factores atípicos. El análisis sugiere que la situación presupuestaria actual de las CCAA es menos cómoda de lo que podría parecer a primera vista porque la caída del déficit que se observa en los últimos ejercicios refleja en parte una fuerte reducción de los intereses debida a acciones discrecionales del Gobierno central que podrían no mantenerse en el futuro, así como unas liquidaciones muy favorables del sistema de financiación en un momento de cambio de ciclo. Si eliminamos el impacto de estos factores, el déficit de las CCAA habría sido en 2017 de 0,85 puntos de PIB, un cuarto de punto por encima del objetivo fijado para ese año. De cara al futuro, la experiencia del complicado ciclo económico y fiscal que ahora se cierra apunta a la conveniencia de mantener la regla de gasto como mecanismo esencial de disciplina fiscal, reforzándola para acelerar la reducción del peso de la deuda en el PIB hasta niveles más moderados y complementándola con la introducción de un Fondo de Reserva. La misión de este Fondo ha de ser la de facilitar el alisado del gasto a lo largo del ciclo – y no la de intentar blindar una senda de necesidades de gasto calculada sin referencia alguna a la evolución de la renta nacional, que podría muy bien no ser factible.
H70|Is there strength in unity? Some preliminary evidence on inter-municipal cooperation in Italy|This paper focuses on municipal unions, the most structured form of inter-municipal cooperation in Italy. Using information from multiple sources, we have built up an administrative database covering more than 500 municipal unions over the period 1998-2015. By cross-checking the information on the municipalities participating in each union with the figures from their financial statements, we have been able to follow the trend in their expenditure both before and after joining the union, acknowledging that time is needed for the effects of the cooperation to manifest themselves. We have replicated this analysis for single municipal functions in order to detect potential heterogeneity in the resulting economies of scale. The results show that belonging to a union has led to a reduction in expenditure only for some municipal functions (such as general administration, local police, roads and traffic) and over a certain time period. The main contribution of our work is that we have studied the effects of inter-municipal cooperation from a temporal perspective largely unexplored in previous studies of the Italian case.
H70|Ciclo político en las finanzas de los gobiernos regionales de Colombia 1998-2014|Este artículo busca comprobar la presencia de ciclos políticos sobre las finanzas de los gobiernos regionales de Colombia durante el periodo 1998-2014. A partir de una base de datos que contiene información detallada de la situación fiscal y los resultados electorales de una muestra representativa de municipios y departamentos, se estiman modelos de panel dinámicos mediante el Método Generalizado de Momentos –MGM-. Los resultados de las estimaciones muestran evidencia del ciclo político en las finanzas territoriales, al corroborar la existencia de aumentos de los gastos y el déficit fiscal durante los años electorales. De forma complementaria, se realiza un análisis con la información de finalidad de gasto, donde se revela que en los periodos de elecciones los gobernantes tienden a incrementar los gastos de inversión más visibles, dentro de los cuales se destacan la inversión en carreteras, infraestructura y servicios públicos. **** This article evaluates the presence of political cycles on the finances of Colombian local governments during the period 1998-2014. Based on a database, which contains detailed information about the fiscal situation and the electoral results of a representative sample of municipalities and departments, we estimate dynamic panel models using the Generalized Method of Moments –GMM-. The results of the estimations show evidence of the political cycle in the subnational finances. The estimates corroborate the existence of increases in expenditures and fiscal deficit during electoral years. Complementarily, we carry out an analysis with information about the purpose of the expenditure, which reveals that during the election periods the governments tend to increase the most visible investment expenditures, among which are the investment in roads, infrastructure and public services.
H70|Do Higher Wages Produce Career Politicians? Evidence from Two Discontinuity Designs|Wages paid to politicians affect both the selection of candidates into electoral races and the on-the-job performance incentives of incumbents. We differentiate between selection and incentive effects using two regression discontinuity designs based on: 1) population thresholds shifting politicians' wages and 2) electoral seat thresholds splitting candidates into those who narrowly won or lost. We find that higher wages do not increase the electoral incumbency advantage, suggesting that the incentive effect of higher wages does not impact re-election rates. We further show that higher wages motivate narrowly elected incumbents to run again much less often than past narrowly non-elected candidates.
H70|The Political Cycle of Road Traffic Accidents|Road traffic accidents often mean lost productivity and medical expenditures. We explain trends in traffic accidents as a function of the political cycle using municipal data from Italy. We show that during municipal election years, the accident rate increases by 2.2%, with a 2.5% increase in the injury rate but no effect on the fatality rate. The effects are stronger in the two quarters prior the quarter in which the election is held, when the electoral campaign is intense, and in the second quarter after the election, when the elected mayor takes office. We argue that this is the result of a decrease in ticket rates during election years, as the expenditures on traffic police increase. Our results are robustly driven by the municipal political cycle defined in different ways, and their magnitude and direction are not explained by spillover effects between municipalities. Proximity to a national police station reduces the impact of local elections on injury rates.
H70|Regional risk sharing and redistribution: The role of fiscal mechanisms in Switzerland|This paper analyses the importance of fiscal mechanisms for regional risk sharing and redistribution in Switzerland. Switzerland is a particularly interesting setting in this context because it features both a high level of fiscal autonomy for Swiss cantons and explicit fiscal transfers between the federal government and the cantons. Based on panel-data analysis we study the redistributive and stabilizing properties of fiscal equalization transfers, federal government transfers in general, direct federal taxation, the unemployment insurance scheme and the first pillar pension scheme. We find a combined redistributive effect of these mechanisms of about 20%. This means that long-run income differentials of 1 Swiss Franc between cantons translate into differences of long-run disposable income after taxes and transfers of about 80 cents. The combined contemporary stabilization effect with respect to short-term income fluctuations amounts to less than 10%, which is a small effect compared to previous findings for other countries.
H70|Large and Influential: Firm Size and Governments' Corporate Tax Rate Choice|Theory suggests that large firms are more likely to engage in lobbying behaviour and are geographically more mobile than smaller entities. Conditional on jurisdiction size, policy choices are thus predicted to depend on the shape of a jurisdiction’s firm size distribution, with more business-oriented policies being enacted if jurisdictions host large firms. The paper empirically tests this prediction using local business taxation in Germany as a testing ground. Exploiting rich and exogenous variation in localities’ firm size structures, we find evidence for an inverse relationship between the size of hosted entities and communities’ local business tax choices. The effect is statistically significant and quantitatively relevant, suggesting that the rising importance of large businesses may trigger shifts towards a more business-friendly design of (tax) policies.
H70|Corporate Taxes, Patent Shifting and Anti-Avoidance Rules: Empirical Evidence|We empirically assess international corporate tax avoidance by strategic location of innovative output. The analysis draws on the universe of patent applications to the European Patent Office linked with data on multinational entities (MNEs) in Europe. Four findings emerge: Firstly, patent holdings are distorted towards low-tax countries. Secondly, patent location in low-tax countries is correlated with a geographic separation of R&D output and input. Thirdly, MNEs systematically sort high-value (low-value) patents to low-tax (high-tax) countries. Fourthly, the propensity to locate patent ownership in low-tax countries is significantly decreased if controlled foreign company rules are enacted in the MNE’s parent country. The tightening of transfer pricing legislations, in turn, exerts a weak negative effect on the location of patent ownership only.
H70|The Origins of Common Identity: Division, Homogenization Policies and Identity Formation in Alsace-Lorraine|We exploit the fact that disagreements in the German leadership after the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 led to a quasi-exogenous division of Alsace and Lorraine to provide rare evidence of group identity formation within historically homogeneous regions. In line with the rejection-identification hypothesis, people in the treated area which experienced a change in nation-status and were exposed to repressive homogenization policies express a stronger regional identity and support more regional autonomy today. On average, subjects with a stronger regional also express a stronger European identity, which we exploit in a regression discontinuity design at the municipal level to reveal whether these identity differences are causal. We find that support for the European Union is significantly stronger in two crucial referenda, a result that is robust across different specifications and bandwidths, and not driven by language differences, large agglomerations or distance to foreign countries. The effect seems to be the strongest for the first two age cohorts after World War II and diminishes for later generations.
H70|Do Electoral Rules Matter for Female Representation?|How do electoral rules affect the representation of women? We collect panel data on the universe of Italian politicians from all levels of government over the period 1987-2013 and obtain a complete picture of the career paths of male and female politicians across the whole arc of their careers in public office. We use our unique dataset to analyse the effects on female political representation of an Italian reform which, in 2005, changed the electoral rule for national elections from (mostly) majoritarian to proportional, but did not affect sub-national level elections. We find that proportional electoral rules favour the election of women. We propose a new channel through which this result is obtained, related to the different nature of political competition in the two electoral systems: under proportional rules, parties place women less frequently in competitive seats. This is consistent with the fact that proportional systems value gender diversity more than majoritarian ones, while majoritarian systems rely on head-to-head electoral races, which are not gender neutral. We also find that electoral rules have weaker effects on female representation in geographical areas where traditional gender roles are dominant.
H70|Combatting Tax Evasion: Evidence from Comparing Commercial and Business Tax Registry|In 2008 and 2014, the South African Revenue Service (SARS) did snapshot synchronizations of its business tax registry with the country’s commercial register in an attempt to identify firms that are non-compliant with their obligation to register with SARS for business tax purposes. We analyse these interventions drawing on SARS’s business tax registry and the population of business tax returns between 2009 and 2014. Several findings emerge. First, in both years, the comparisons resulted in the identification of around 300,000 non-compliant taxpayers, providing prima facie evidence of significant extensive-margin tax evasion. The interventions significantly raised South African business tax revenues in the following years despite the fact that the identi-fied ‘extensive-margin evaders’ exhibit a lower propensity to submit tax returns and, conditional on return submission, report less income than comparable entities that voluntarily registered with SARS. The analysis further suggests that the observed gap in reported taxable income relates to underlying differences in firm size and corporate profitability rather than intensive-margin tax evasion. In line with ‘missing middle theories’, extensive-margin evaders that submit tax returns are, moreover, found to exhibit increased sales and asset growth after their forced registration with SARS.
H70|Backlash in Attitudes after the Election of Extreme Political Parties|Far-right and far-left parties by definition occupy the fringes of politics, with policy proposals outside the mainstream. This paper asks how public attitudes about such policies respond once an extreme party increases their political representation at the local level. We study attitudes towards the signature policies of two radical populist parties in Sweden, one from the right and one from the left, using panel data from 290 municipal election districts. To identify causal effects, we take advantage of large nonlinearities in the function which assigns council seats, comparing otherwise similar elections where a party either barely wins or loses an additional seat. We estimate that a one seat increase for the far-right, anti-immigration party decreases negative attitudes towards immigration by 4.1 percentage points, in opposition to the party's policy position. Likewise, when a far-left, anti-capitalist party politician gets elected, support for a six hour workday falls by 2.7 percentage points. Mirroring these attitudinal changes, the far-right and far-left parties have no incumbency advantage in the next election. Exploring possible mechanisms, we find evidence that when the anti-immigrant party wins a marginal seat, they experience higher levels of politician turnover before the next election and receive negative coverage in local newspapers. These findings demonstrate that political representation can cause an attitudinal backlash as fringe parties and their ideas are placed under closer scrutiny.
H70|Overlapping Climate Clubs under Transaction Costs|We examine the formation of multilateral, hub-and-spoke and bilateral international R&D strategic alliances (overlapping climate clubs) to reduce CO2 emissions. R&D provision in clubs produces two types of positive externalities: a global public good (i.e., reduction of CO2 emissions) and knowledge spillovers in joint R&D agreements. The latter is a club good. It is perfectly excludable. Its (direct) benefits are enjoyed by the club members only. Trust plays a central role in the type of alliance formation, if any at all. Lack of trust generates transaction costs, which increase with the number of R&D collaborators. We utilize the perfectly-coalition-proof-Nash equilibrium (PCPNE) concept to refine the set of Nash equilibria. Multilateral and hub-and-spoke coalitional structures are PCPNE, even in large economies containing all nations in the globe, in the absence of income transfers, for different values of transaction costs. With income transfers, fully participated multilateral coalitional structures are not stable; however, the size of the stable coalition increases as the economy expands.
H70|The Origins of Common Identity: Evidence from Alsace-Lorraine|The quasi-exogenous division of the French regions Alsace and Lorraine after the Franco-Prussian War allows us to provide evidence about group identity formation within historically homogeneous regions. Using several measures of stated and revealed preferences spanning over half a century, we show that being exposed to occupation and repression for many decades caused a persistently stronger regional identity. The geographical RDD results are robust across all specifications. We document two mechanisms using data on regional newspapers and regionalist parties. The differences are strongest for the first two age cohorts after WWII and associated with preferences for more regional decision-making.
H70|Term Limit Extension and Electoral Participation: Evidence from a Diff-in-Discontinuities Design at the Local Level in Italy|We study the effect of term limits on voter turnout in local Italian elections. Since 2014 the Italian law allows mayors in municipalities with a population size lower than 3,000 inhabitants to re-run for a third term, whereas mayors in cities with a number of residents above the cutoff still face a two-term limit. The introduction of the reform permits us to implement a difference-in-discontinuities design exploiting the before/after with the discontinuous policy change. We find that voters negatively react to the introduction of the reform and in particular electoral participation decreases by about 5 percentage points in municipalities eligible to the treatment compared to municipalities in the control group. This negative effect is essentially driven by a decrease in the political competition. We also find that relaxing term limits does not improve the quality of politicians running for election.
H70|Desarrollo regional reflexiones y propuestas desde la economía|Las personas en los diferentes territorios de un país aspiran al desarrollo de su región, localidad, o espacio geográfico en donde viven, trabajan y sueñan. Probablemente los motiva conocer su retraso relativo que se traduce en menor bienestar y calidad de vida frente al que se disfruta en otras regiones. Ese atraso tiene que ver con niveles reducidos de productividad pero también con falta de competitividad de las unidades productoras ubicadas en el territorio. Las razones son múltiples incluyendo las carencias de infraestructura y de acceso a bienes meritorios como educación y salud. El desarrollo regional no ocurre por casualidad sino es consecuencia de la aplicación de determinadas políticas públicas. Estas son responsabilidad del Estado, nacional, regional o local según sus competencias. A partir de políticas diferenciadas se esperaría que las diferentes regiones y localidades del país, en particular las áreas rurales, converjan con las más desarrolladas en sus niveles de ingreso per cápita para la gran mayoría de su población.

H70|¿Cómo evaluar y mejorar las políticas de subsidios públicos en la era de la medición del desempeño y la rendición de cuentas por resultados?|El criterio de validación de los subsidios cambió en los últimos treinta años. El enfoque económico de las políticas y los programas que se apoyan en subsidios públicos a los particulares no ha cambiado sustancialmente desde mediados del Siglo pasado. Desde el ángulo de la economía política, la discusión académica sobre los subsidios ha estado dominada por posiciones ideológicas que se remontan a los clásicos de la economía capitalista. El debate ideológico-­?estratégico entre los partidarios más acérrimos del libre mercado y los defensores de la intervención estatal en el comportamiento de la oferta, la demanda y los precios, se reduce en la práctica a una cuestión de grado. En el fondo todos aceptamos un cierto grado de intervencionismo en el mercado, sea mayor, sea menor. Y tirios y troyanos reconocen en los subsidios a precios, ingresos, ahorro, consumo o inversión una palanca legítima de orientación del comportamiento.

H70|La financiación de las grandes ciudades: revisión de la literatura, comparación internacional y experiencias exitosas|Este capítulo se enfoca en revisar las alternativas de financiación para las grandes ciudades. Este objetivo se busca a través de diferentes aproximaciones para extraer algunas recomendaciones interesantes para el caso de Bogotá, que ya es de gran tamaño dado el número de habitantes y que será considerada como una de las 41 megaciudades del mundo en el año 2030. Este capítulo consta de cinco secciones incluyendo esta introducción. En primer lugar, después de esta introducción, en la sección II se describen las actuales proyecciones de población en las ciudades para el año 2030 que realizan las Naciones Unidas. La sección III presenta una revisión de la literatura sobre las fuentes de financiamiento de las ciudades, las cuales no se limitan a los impuestos y las transferencias, sino que incluyen otros tipos de financiación como son los cargos al usuario, el endeudamiento, las asociaciones público-privadas, y de manera importante, la captura de plusvalía. También se analizan el tamaño y composición de los ingresos de diez grandes ciudades: Madrid, Barcelona, Berlín, Londres, Nueva York, Santiago de Chile, Ciudad de México, Lima, Buenos Aires y Sao Paulo. Estas comparaciones se hacen a nivel muy agregado debido a las dificultades metodológicas pero está basado en la construcción de una base de datos elaborada a partir de los presupuestos publicados por los gobiernos de estas ciudades.

H70|Desarrollo regional reflexiones y propuestas desde la economía|Las personas en los diferentes territorios de un país aspiran al desarrollo de su región, localidad, o espacio geográfico en donde viven, trabajan y sueñan. Probablemente los motiva conocer su retraso relativo que se traduce en menor bienestar y calidad de vida frente al que se disfruta en otras regiones. Ese atraso tiene que ver con niveles reducidos de productividad pero también con falta de competitividad de las unidades productoras ubicadas en el territorio. Las razones son múltiples incluyendo las carencias de infraestructura y de acceso a bienes meritorios como educación y salud. El desarrollo regional no ocurre por casualidad sino es consecuencia de la aplicación de determinadas políticas públicas. Estas son responsabilidad del Estado, nacional, regional o local según sus competencias. A partir de políticas diferenciadas se esperaría que las diferentes regiones y localidades del país, en particular las áreas rurales, converjan con las más desarrolladas en sus niveles de ingreso per cápita para la gran mayoría de su población.
H70|Do Electoral Rules Matter for Female Representation?|How do electoral rules affect the representation of women? We collect panel data on the universe of Italian politicians from all levels of government over the period 1987-2013 and obtain a complete picture of the career paths of male and female politicians across the whole arc of their careers in public office. We use our unique dataset to analyse the effects on female political representation of an Italian reform which, in 2005, changed the electoral rule for national elections from (mostly) majoritarian to proportional, but did not affect sub-national level elections. We find that proportional electoral rules favour the election of women. We propose a new channel through which this result is obtained, related to the different nature of political competition in the two electoral systems: under proportional rules, parties place women less frequently in competitive seats. This is consistent with the fact that proportional systems value gender diversity more than majoritarian ones, while majoritarian systems rely on head-to-head electoral races, which are not gender neutral. We also find that electoral rules have weaker effects on female representation in geographical areas where traditional gender roles are dominant.
H70|Are local public services better delivered in more autonomous regions? Evidence from European regions using a dose‐response approach|"Does regional autonomy lead to better local public services? We investigate this issue using measures of public service performance and autonomy at the region level in 171 European regions. We introduce a novel dose‐response approach which identifies the pattern of the effect of regional autonomy on the performance of public services. The relationship between the level of regional autonomy and the provision of local public services exhibits a u‐shape: both low and high autonomy lead to better local public services. This speaks against the presence of one optimal level of autonomy and policy recommendations based on the view that more decentralisation is always desirable. It shows that different institutional settings can be economically viable and efficient. ¿Conduce la autonomía regional a mejores servicios públicos locales? Este artículo investiga este tema utilizando medidas de desempeño y autonomía del servicio público a nivel regional en 171 regiones europeas. Se introduce un nuevo enfoque de dosis‐respuesta que identifica el patrón del efecto de la autonomía regional en el desempeño de los servicios públicos. La relación entre el nivel de autonomía regional y la prestación de servicios públicos locales presenta una forma de""u"": tanto la baja como la alta autonomía conducen a mejores servicios públicos locales. Esto contradice la presencia de un nivel óptimo de autonomía y de recomendaciones políticas basadas en la opinión de que siempre es deseable una mayor descentralización. Se demuestra que diferentes marcos institucionales pueden ser económicamente viables y eficientes. 地域の自主性は、地域の公共サービスの改善を導くだろうか? 本稿では、ヨーロッパの171の地域における、地域レベルでの公共サービス実施と自主性を測定して、この問題を検討する。新しい用量反応アプローチを導入し、これにより公共サービスの実施に対する地域の自主性の効果のパターンを確認する。地域の自主性のレベルと地域の公共サービスの実施との関連性はU字型曲線を示し、自主性が高いレベルでも低いレベルでも、いずれも結果的に公共サービスは改善されている。これは、最適な自主性のレベルは一つであることや、自律分散を進めることが絶対的に好ましいという見方に基づいた政策勧告に異を唱えるものである。背景にある制度上の違いは、経済的に実行可能であり、効果的であることを示している。"
H70|Redistributive effects of regional transfers: a conceptual framework|This paper presents a conceptual framework to analyse the redistributive impact of transfers in the context of a decentralized economy. The framework is illustrated by means of a numerical example that describes an economy with three regions and two levels of government —the central level and the regional level—. With this set up, the paper analyses a variety of transfer systems and considers its effects on redistribution using as benchmark a centralized version of this economy, in which tax capacity is unevenly distributed across the three regions and central government public expenditure is distributed across regions according to their population.
H70|Las finanzas autonomicas en 2017 y entre 2003 y 2017|En este informe se analiza la evolucion de los ingresos y gastos autonomicos y el saldo presupuestario del sector desde 2003 hasta el presente. El analisis sugiere que la situacion presupuestaria actual de las CCAA es menos comoda de lo que parece a primera vista porque la caida del deficit observada en los ultimos ejercicios refleja una fuerte reduccion de los intereses.
H70|Effects of Municipal Mergers on Voter Turnout| We study the effects of municipal mergers on voter turnout in a difference-in-differences framework, using data from a wave of municipal mergers in Finland in 2009. Analysing two pre-merger elections and three post-merger elections, spanning a total of 17 years, we find that municipal mergers decrease voter turnout by 4 percentage points in the long run in the relatively small municipalities compared to similar small municipalities that did not merge. As the average turnout rate prior to merging in this group was around 69%, this is a substantial effect. We also find that virtually nothing happens to turnout in the municipalities that were relatively large within their merger. Furthermore, mergers are associated with a decrease in votersâ€™ political efficacy and turnout decreases more in those municipalities that experience larger decreases in efficacy.
H70|The North Caucasus in 2017: major development trends|In 2017, the social and economic development of the North Caucasian regions was proceeding amid introduction by the federal center of some new forms of regional economic support. A change in economic policy priorities in the North Caucasus was taking place amid sluggishness of the health resort sector, growing debt accruals for gas- and power supply and prevailing land-related conflicts.
H70|Fiscal Stability during the Great Recession: Putting Decentralization Design to the Test|There is a longstanding debate in the economics literature on whether fiscally decentralized countries are inherently more fiscally unstable. The Great Recession provides a fertile testing ground for analyzing how the degree of decentralization does actually affect countries’ ability to implement fiscal stabilization policies in response to macroeconomic shocks. We provide an empirical analysis aiming at disentangling the roles played by decentralization design itself and several recently introduced budgetary institutions such as subnational borrowing rules and fiscal responsibility laws on country’s fiscal stability. We use OECD countries’ data since 1995, which includes both a boom period of worldwide economic growth and the Great Recession. Our main finding is that well-designed decentralized systems are not destabilizing. But, in addition, sub-national fiscal and borrowing rules should be at work to improve the overall fiscal stability performance of decentralized countries.Length: 29 pages
H70|Corporate Governance, State Ownership and Firm Performance: An Empirical Study of State-Owned Enterprises in Indonesia|Objective – The purpose of this research is to determine the effect of good corporate governance (GCG) on Indonesia's SOEs and the influence of state ownership on company performance. Methodology/Technique – This study examines State Owned Enterprises in Indonesia that were listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange between 2011 and 2015. Findings – The empirical results show that GCG and state ownership both have a positive influence on the company's financial performance (in this case, Return On Assets). However, the percentage of state ownership has a negative effect on the relationship between Good Corporate Governance and Return On Assets. Novelty – One agency cost is monitoring expenditure by the principal. Privatization is one way to improve the performance of SOEs. Privatization is believed to improve the performance of SOEs, as a result of increased supervision of the performance of SOEs in Indonesia.
H70|Understanding Norwegian Commons|he paper reviews the development of the legal status of Norwegian commons from the first known legislation on commons. The development can be divided into 5 periods. The first period lasted until about 1300. In this period, the commons changed from being a local matter for the chiefs and the local thing to become a national resource where also the King had rights to resources for defence of the realm. The second period is the big population decline 1350-1550 where Norway lost 60% of its population and the King and his bureaucracy moved to Copenhagen. The commons reverted to a local issue. The third period lasted from about 1550 to 1814. The powers of ownership were now seen to reside in the Crown. It had moved from the local community to the state. The rights of common were respected and should remain as they had been from old on. Limitations on the commoner's exploitation were introduced. Rights of common were held by active farms and stinted to the needs of the farm. At the same time, the Crown started large-scale exploitation of the forest resources and selling off forestland to sawmill owners and timber merchants. In the period 1814 to 1857/ 1863 the state’s ideas about the commons were recast into 3 types of commons and one type not mentioned in the legal texts that here is called hamlet commons. In the period after 1863 the limitations and regulations of the exploitation of the commons continued. By the end of the 20th century, the rights of common were reduced to rights of forests and pasture tailored to the needs of the farm. However, the development in farming and recreation activities of the population changed the usage of the commons. The rights of fishing and hunting in state commons came close to an all men’s right. The national community expanded its use of the commons by defining much of their areas to be protected lands providing landscapes for recreational activities and production of ecosystem services.
H70|Smart City Indicators: Can They Improve Governance in Croatian Large Cities?|The focus of this research is to implement the smart city methodology and develop smart city indicators for twenty-five large Croatian cities in order to develop a reference model for monitoring the success of Croatian large cities. Starting from the fact that only two Croatian cities have prepared a smart management strategy and that only thirty cities have developed smart projects in various sectors, the purpose of this research is to show the development of smart city indicators for the large cities through six dimensions of the smart city model: smart economy, smart people, smart governance, smart mobility, smart environment and smart living. The smart city indicators are based on publicly accessible data and easily available sources. In addition, web scraping techniques were used to obtain data that are not available from public sources. After data collection, all variables were standardized, allowing the comparison of indicators of different measuring units. Twenty-nine indicators were identified and used to compare the twenty-five large Croatian cities and evaluate their comparative advantages. The main results of the research include an assessment of the smart urban development index and ranking of cities according to the degree of urban development. The smart city indicator is above average in only eleven large cities. Measures for promoting smart development have been proposed to city policy-makers. The research results have implications for increasing rationality in the use of local public resources.
H70|Sex working and taxation in European countries|The paper aims to give a picture of the present nature of taxation of sex working in a large number of European countries. Sex working is widespread, and yet it is only taxed in a few countries. There is a move to extend the taxation of sex working to other countries. Consequently, a number of different tax regimes are applied to this field of activity. Following an overview of such taxation, particularly in Europe (its origins, entity and social acceptance), the paper then discusses the classification of general countries’ “models” of sex working taxation. The corresponding regimes of each country are then examined in greater depth. Finally, the paper considers the main “sex industry taxes” applied in a number of countries, as well as the current proposals to enlarge that number.
H70|One billion Euro program for early childcare services in Italy|In 2007 the Italian central government started a program by transferring funds to regional governments to develop both private and public early childcare services. Exploiting the different timing of program implementation across regions, we evaluate its effectiveness in boosting the public supply of early childhood educational services. We find that the ratio between the available slots in public early childhood education and the population of those aged 0-2 increased by 18.1% three years after the start of the program, with respect to the pre-program level. The program impact was however nil in the South and totally driven by the Center-North.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H70|Backlash in Attitudes After the Election of Extreme Political Parties|Far-right and far-left parties by definition occupy the fringes of politics, with policy proposals outside the mainstream. This paper asks how public attitudes about such policies respond once an extreme party increases their political representation at the local level. We study attitudes towards the signature policies of two radical populist parties in Sweden, one from the right and one from the left, using panel data from 290 municipal election districts. To identify causal effects, we take advantage of large nonlinearities in the function which assigns council seats, comparing otherwise similar elections where a party either barely wins or loses an additional seat. We estimate that a one seat increase for the far-right, anti-immigration party decreases negative attitudes towards immigration by 4.1 percentage points, in opposition to the party’s policy position. Likewise, when a far-left, anti-capitalist party politician gets elected, support for a six hour workday falls by 2.7 percentage points. Mirroring these attitudinal changes, the far-right and far-left parties have no incumbency advantage in the next election. Exploring possible mechanisms, we find evidence that when the anti-immigrant party wins a marginal seat, they experience higher levels of politician turnover before the next election and receive negative coverage in local newspapers. These findings demonstrate that political representation can cause an attitudinal backlash as fringe parties and their ideas are placed under closer scrutiny.
H70|Term Limit Extension And Electoral Participation. Evidence From A Diff-In-Discontinuities Design At The Local Level In Italy|We study the effect of term limits on voter turnout in local Italian elections. Since 2014 the Italian law allows mayors in municipalities with a population size lower than 3,000 inhabitants to re-run for a third term, whereas mayors in cities with a number of residents above the cutoff still face a two-term limit. The introduction of the reform permits us to implement a difference-in-discontinuities design exploiting the before/after with the discontinuous policy change. We find that voters negatively react to the introduction of the reform and in particular electoral participation decreases by about 5 percentage points in municipalities eligible to the treatment compared to municipalities in the control group. This negative effect is essentially driven by a decrease in the political competition. We also find that relaxing term limits does not improve the quality of politicians running for election.
H70|Electoral cycles in MPs’ salaries: evidence from the German states|Abstract Members of parliament (MPs) often set their own salaries. Voters dislike self-serving politicians, and politicians are keen to please voters. In line with political business cycle theories, politicians thus may delay giving themselves a salary increase until after elections. We investigate electoral cycles in the salary increases of German state MPs. Using data for 15 states over the period 1980–2014, we find no evidence that increases in MP salaries are influenced by election cycles. Politicians can increase their salaries at any point during the legislative period without negative consequences. We posit that this may be because even those voters who are most disenchanted with politics likely understand that all politicians benefit from a salary increase and thus do not punish the governing party at the polls.
H70|A sequential panel selection approach to cointegration analysis: An application to Wagner’s law for South Africa|This study extends the recently introduced sequential panel selection method (SPSM) to a cointegration framework which is particularly used to investigate Wagner’s law for 9 South African provinces between 2001 and 2016. We note that when applying single country/region estimates we fail to find evidence of cointegration whereas within panel regressions, cointegration effects are present for the entire dataset. In further applying the SPSM we observed significant Wagner’s effects for panels inclusive of Gauteng, Eastern Cape and Kwazulu-Natal provinces and when these provinces are excluded from the panels, cointegration effects are unobserved.
H70|Sustainable finance for inclusive growth in Thailand|The Partnerships pillar of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development cuts across all the goals focusing on the mobilisation of resources needed to implement the agenda. Thailand’s “sufficiency economy philosophy” encourages the prioritisation of long-term sustainability over short-term benefits. As such, Thailand has a long history of fiscal prudence that has served the country well in times of economic and political instability. However, relying on current fiscal buffers to finance foreseeable expenditure pressures is not sufficient or sustainable. A rapidly ageing population and shrinking workforce will weigh on future public finances and on the ability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. To ensure that Thailand is well placed over the medium term to meet growing social, environmental and infrastructure requirements, the government should: (i) increase tax revenues by broadening the tax base and enhancing collection efficiency; (ii) facilitate greater private sector investment in productive infrastructure; and (iii) reform the healthcare and pension systems to increase their efficiency and effectiveness. This Working Paper relates to the Initial Assessment report of the Multi-dimensional Country Review of Thailand. (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/multi-dimensional-review-thailand.htm)
H70|Enhancing governance in Thailand|The Peace pillar of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development encompasses a diverse range of issues including stability and effective governance. Reforming the public sector is high on the government’s agenda, but involves a number of challenges: the gap between planning and implementation of policy objectives remains large; insufficient public participation in policy making is undermining the efficient allocation of resources toward public needs and development goals; under-development of evidence-based regulations is hampering the creation of a business-friendly environment essential to high value-added activities; and high levels of perceived corruption are weakening business confidence and public trust in the government. Thailand’s 12th Economic and Social Development Plan emphasises the importance of public sector reform. It sets out measures to strengthen co-ordination across ministries and agencies aimed at improving implementation of policy programmes, boosting public participation in policy making, improving online access to government services and combating corruption by strengthening integrity measures. The upcoming 20-year National Strategy and the accompanying National Reform Plan are expected to pave the way for future development. However, an inclusive and consultative process will be essential to ensure the success of reform efforts. This Working Paper relates to the Initial Assessment report of the Multi-dimensional Country Review of Thailand. (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/multi-dimensional-review-thailand.htm)
H70|Poverty, Politics and the Socially Marginalised – a state level analysis in India|Activities of the Government are mostly influenced by the political party or combinations of political parties are in the Government. Variation in the nature of the political rule can lead to differential effectiveness in the pursuit of the anti-poverty programmes the variations in the political rule at the state level allow us to make a comparative analysis among the different political ideas or regime in the alleviation of poverty among the socially marginalized in rural India. In this paper an attempted has been made to access whether variations in the political regimes across the states do have a different impact on the poverty reduction among the different social groups viz SCs, STs and others and whether the rate of reduction over the time varies among the different social groups with varying political regimes. This analysis found that the political affiliation is a significant determinant of poverty and it has been found that the odds of poverty decline most in the Left-ruled states. Further, the performance of the left ruled states are impressive in terms of steady decline in odds among all the social groups and between all the social groups over the time compare to Right and Other ruled states.
H70|Investigating the Relationship between Work-Life-Balance and Motivation of the Employees: Evidences from the Local Government of Jakarta|This paper examines the relationship between work-life-balance and employees' motivation in the public sector of Jakarta, Indonesia. Through motivational theories and work-life-balance theories, the conceptual framework is developed to explore research variables. This is a descriptive research following qualitative inductive method. The total sample size for this research is 86 respondents working in the local government of Jakarta. Data was gathered through self-administered survey questionnaire. Findings revealed that personal life significantly affect the work. Majority of the respondents prefer flexible work and operating from home. Interestingly, females are more eager to work from home in comparison to males. Furthermore, the findings revealed that females in contrast to males are much more organized in managing professional commitment and personal life agendas. Additionally, all employees seek taking holiday in contrast to extra money or bonus. Lastly, working for longer hours is the most de-motivating job attribute.
H70|Changes in the Attitudes of Y Generation Members towards Participation in the Activities Municipalities in the Years 2008-2017|The presented research results cover a comparative analysis of cyclical surveys about attitude to social participation conducted among students (members of Y generation) of Wroclaw's economic universities in 2008, 2013 and 2017. The basic purpose of the study is to compare the attitudes to social participation of students at similar stages of life (students) and at similar age over the years 2008-2017. The second aim is to answer the question whether these attitudes have changed with the introduction of active participation of citizens through the use of the participatory budget. The survey included 40 problematic questions. In the majority of them a five-step Likert scale was applied. The results of the survey show that the dating analysed period surveyed groups of questioned young Poles had very low interest in gmina financial activity but it was slightly rising. The feeling of real influence on local issues among the respondents is slowly rising what may result, among other things, from the fact that the processes of participatory budget in municipalities became widespread. Additionally, the percentage of people who do not feel the need to increase their impact on municipal affairs continues to raise what can be caused by existing more satisfactory possibilities for citizens to participate in the activities of municipalities.
H70|Der Wohlfahrtstaat als Grundbestandteil des modernen demokratischen Staatsgefüges<BR>[The welfare state as a basic component of the modern democratic state structure]|Defining the welfare state is not a simpleminded task. Actually, there are numerous definitions which try to reflect at least some of the basic characteristics of the welfare state or its objectives and its functions. For some, there is primarily an institutional parameter, for others there are functional issues which have to be firstly indicated and for others, the ideological and political factors determine the definition and the attitude towards the welfare state. Apart from all these crucial ascertainments, there are some basic fundamental characteristics and values of the welfare state which render it as a precondition of the existence of the modern state. Unquestionably, it reflects a distinct part of the state but most importantly, it comprises a prerequisite for its existence. This is the exact aim of this paper; to surpass the theoretical diversifications and to find the fundamental common ground which forms the indispensability for the existence of the welfare state.
H70|Explaining Differences In Efficiency: A Meta‐Study On Local Government Literature|This paper reviews the literature on local government efficiency by meta‐reviewing 360 observations retrieved from 54 papers published from 1993 to 2016. The meta‐regression is based on a random‐effects model estimated with the two‐step random‐effects maximum likelihood (REML) technique proposed by Gallet and Doucouliagos. Results indicate that the study design matters when estimating a frontier in local government. We find that studies focusing on technical efficiency provide higher efficiency scores than works evaluating cost efficiency. The same applies when using panel data instead of cross‐section data. Interestingly, studies that use the Free Disposal Hull (FDH) approach yield, on average, higher efficiency scores than papers employing the data envelopment analysis (DEA) method, thereby suggesting that in this literature the convexity hypothesis of the production set is a matter. Finally, the efficiency of local government increases with the level of development of the analysed countries and is positively related to the national integrity of the legal system. The opposite holds when considering the corruption.
H70|A Sequential Panel Selection Approach to Cointegration Analysis: An Application to Wagner’s Law for South African Provincial Data|The main aim of this study is to extend the recently introduced sequential panel selection method (SPSM) to a cointegration framework which is particularly used to investigate Wagner’s law for 9 South African provinces. We particularly apply the SPSM to the PMG and ARDL cointegration frameworks which we apply to annual data spanning from 2001 to 2016. The main findings show that when applying single country/region estimates we fail to find evidence of cointegration whereas within panel regressions, cointegration effects are present for theentire dataset. In further applying the SPSM we observed significant Wagner’s effects for panels inclusive of Gauteng, Eastern Cape and Kwazulu-Natal provinces and when these provinces are excluded from the panels, cointegration effects are unobserved.
H70|The North Caucasus: the main trends of 2016|This section analyzes the main new trends that became visible in the North Caucasus during the past year. Bearing in mind the specific features of this region of the Russian Federation, it is important that our analyst should not be confined to examining only the changes that occurred in the economic realm, but also pay attention to those that took place in the sphere of regional politics and regional security.
H70|Decentralization and Accountability in Authoritarian Regimes: Evidence from Rural China|Can political decentralization and the introduction of local elections improve government accountability and public goods provision in a non-democratic regime like China? Political decentralization reforms in China have only been implemented at the village level, and have been implemented unevenly across villages. Villages differ substantially in terms of the quality of their elections and the amount of power given to (or taken away from) their popularly elected village committees. In light of these differences, this paper investigates the relationship between political decentralization processes and government performance in the rural Chinese context, by addressing the question of whether democratically elected village committees are more responsive to villagers’ demands for better infrastructure in their communities, when given the power to govern. To explain differences among villages in terms of whether and how much they invest in new infrastructure, a tobit model of village-financed investment is estimated using cross-sectional survey data collected from over 100 villages. Results from the regression analysis indicate that variation in the degree of political decentralization is positively associated with variation in the level of public goods investment across villages: villages governed by democratically elected village committees tend to invest more in new infrastructures. These results are robust to the endogeneity between governance and public goods provision. Our findings from rural China illustrate the potential and limitations of political decentralization reforms to enhance government accountability in non-democratic regimes. In some communities, they have improved government performance, but in many others they have failed to make elected local governments accountable to citizens because they have failed to devolve authority and resources to them in the first place. The challenge thus is not only to make decentralization work but, more fundamentally, to make decentralization happen.
H70|Can increased education help reduce the political opportunity gap?|It is well documented that voter turnout is lower among persons who grow up in families of low socio-economic status compared to persons from high-status families. This paper examines whether reforms in education can help to reduce the socio-economic gap in voting. We distinguish between reforms of two types that may lead to differences in the exercise of voting; (a) changes in the resources allocated to education between different socio-economic groups (reform effects) and (b) changes in return which relate to the impact of education on turnout in different groups. We use this framework to analyze a reform of the Swedish upper secondary school system in the 1990s. This reform increased the length and amount of social science education on vocational training programs. We find that the reform reduced the gap in voting mainly by means of its stronger influence among individuals from families of low socio-economic status.
H70|The Political Economics of Growth, Labor Control and Coercion: Evidence from a Suffrage Reform|In this paper, we analyze how a suffrage reform in 1862/63 that shifted the de jure distribution of political power from landowners to industrialists affected Sweden’s industrialization and economic and social development from the 1860s to the 1910s. Using a newly constructed, comprehensive historical data set of the universe of approximately 2,400 Swedish local governments, we document that the change in suffrage affected a very large number of development and social outcomes at the local level, such as labor coercion, factor price manipulation in the form of entry barriers including investments in local public goods (i.e., schooling) and transportation (i.e., local railways), the real wage structure, technology adoption in both agriculture and industry, labor productivity in both agriculture and industry, changes in the composition of employment and the structure of production, demographic transition, organized labor, and persistence in dysfunctional local political institutions. Our findings are consistent with the idea that political institutions are a key determinant of long-run development and growth. Specifically, our results suggest that politically powerful landowners can block economic development using labor coercion and factor price manipulation, i.e., using entry barriers and other distortionary policies.
H70|Defragmenting resource management on the Southeast Arm of Lake Malawi: Case of Fisheries|The Southeast Arm of Lake Malawi catchment has a wide range of natural resources that require prudent management for sustainability and maximisation of benefits. The current management practice is government sector based, with individual Departments and Ministries using their own policies, legislations and management approaches, yet dealing with the same composite resource and user communities. This has resulted in fragmentation of management leading to the lack of alignment between formal and informal institutions, and competition for power and authority for management. Fragmentation is also leading to loss of resource rent. This paper analyses how and why management is fragmented in the Southeast Arm of Lake Malawi catchment and suggests how management could be defragmented, with special interest on fisheries. Activities with high negative impacts on fisheries include: overfishing; soil erosion resulting in siltation and turbidity of the lake; chemical and organic pollution; loss of access to land and beaches; and habitat loss. There is need for a better and more holistic understanding of how human activities represent both livelihood benefits and a threat to sustainability of natural resources in order to find ways for balancing these two aspects. We suggest that to increase the efficacy of management of Lake Malawi’s Southeast Arm will require ‘defragmented decentralization’, an approach whereby devolution of authority and responsibility are ceded to the district and local levels, respectively.
H70|Distributive politics inside the city? The political economy of Spain's Plan E|We study distributive politics inside cities by analysing how local governments allocate investment projects to voters across neighbourhoods. In particular, we ask whether politicians use investment to target their own supporters. To this aim, we use detailed geo-located investment data from Plan E, a large fiscal stimulus program carried out in Spain in 2009–2011. Our main empirical strategy is based on a close-elections regression-discontinuity design. In contrast to previous studies – which use aggregate data at the district or municipal level – we exploit spatial variation in both investment and voter support within municipalities and find no evidence of supporter targeting. Complementary results indicate that voters may be responding to investment by increasing turnout.
H70|Concurrent elections and political accountability: Evidence from Italian local elections|This paper analyses the effects of holding concurrent elections in multi-tiered government structures on turnout decision and voting behaviour, based on municipal and provincial electoral data from Italy during the 2000s. When the less salient provincial elections are held concurrently with the highly salient municipal elections, we observe three main effects: (1) turnout increases significantly by almost ten percentage points; (2) issues that are specific to the more salient (mayoral) contest affect the less salient (provincial) contest, with mayors’ fiscal decisions impacting on the vote share of provincial incumbents; (3) issues that are specific to the less salient (provincial) contest stop affecting provincial elections outcomes. These findings shed light on how voters acquire information on incumbent politicians, and suggests that the effectiveness of an election as an accountability tool may be hindered by the concurrence with higher-stakes elections.
H70|Reluctant to Reform? A Note on Risk-Loving Politicians and Bureaucrats|From a political economy perspective, politicians often fail to implement structural reforms. In this contribution we investigate if the resistance to reform is based on the differences in the risk preferences of voters, politicians, and bureaucrats. Based on three surveys among the German electorate, 175 members of the Federal German Parliament and 106 officials from German ministries, this is not the case. Since both politicians and bureaucrats have a higher risk appetite than the voters, their risk preferences cannot be seen as an explanation for the resistance to structural reform. Hence, it must be caused by other reasons. These could be interventions by veto players, wars of attrition by powerful interest groups, or reform logjams initiated. However, as during times of populist campaigns, the election process can put forth candidates with very high risk appetites, the constitutions of democracies turn out to be rather effective if hazardous actions and measures by political rookies and gamblers are inhibited by checks and balances.
H70|Evaluating local government performance in times of crisis|In the recent years of international economic crisis, Spanish local governments have come under increasing pressure to accommodate severe economic restrictions while maintaining (or even increasing) their provision of local public services. This paper aims to analyse overall cost efficiency in Spanish local governments during the period of the economic crisis (2008–2013) which has scarcely been examined to date. To this end, we measure efficiency, for which we consider four different non-parametric methodologies. Moreover, given how problematic it is to precisely define the bundle of services and facilities that municipalities must provide, we compare three different output models in which we consider measures of quantity as well as quality. Our results suggest that Spanish local government efficiency improved over the crisis period 2008–2013 since budget expenditures (inputs or costs) fell while local public services and facilities (outputs) were maintained. We also find evidence of the possible implications of service quality when measuring local governments’ cost efficiency, and of structural differences in the average efficiency between municipalities located in different Spanish regions and provinces. Finally, our results confirm that the level and variation of efficiency scores are affected by the approach taken.
H70|Which estimator to measure local governments’ cost efficiency? An application to Spanish municipalities|We analyse overall cost efficiency in Spanish local governments during the crisis period (2008–2013). To this end, we first consider some of the most popular methods to evaluate local government efficiency, DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) and FDH (Free Disposal Hull), as well as recent proposals, namely the order-m partial frontier and the non-parametric estimator proposed by Kneip, Simar and Wilson (2008), which are also non-parametric approaches. Second, we compare the methodologies used to measure efficiency. In contrast to previous literature, which has regularly compared techniques and made proposals for alternative methodologies, we follow recent proposals (Badunenko et al., 2012) with the aim of comparing the four methods and choosing the one which performs best with our particular dataset, that is, the most appropriate method for measuring local government cost efficiency in Spain. We carry out the experiment via Monte Carlo simulations and discuss the relative performance of the efficiency scores under various scenarios. Our results suggest that there is no one approach suitable for all efficiency analysis. We find that for our sample of 1,574 Spanish local governments, the average cost efficiency would have been between 0.54 and 0.77 during the period 2008–2013, suggesting that Spanish local governments could have achieved the same level of local outputs with about 23% to 36% fewer resources.
H70|Does the Election of a Female Leader Clear the Way for More Women in Politics?|Women remain underrepresented in politics and it remains unclear how this might change. In this paper, we investigate whether female council candidates receive more preferential votes when a female mayor has been recently elected into office. We hand collect data for 109,017 candidates in four open-list local council elections (2001-2016) in all 426 municipalities of a German state. Based on RDD estimations for close mixed-gender races, we show that female council candidates advance more from their initial list rank when the mayor is female. This effect spreads to neighboring municipalities and leads to a rising share of female council members.
H70|Non-cooperative and cooperative policy reforms under uncertainty and spillovers|When countries need to implement costly economic policy reforms, these often imply uncertainties about their effectiveness for the home country and their spillovers to other countries. We develop a model to show that under these circumstances countries implement too few or too many policy reforms. From a social perspective, too many reforms follow if the spillover effects of reforms become sufficiently uncertain. Since centralization of policies to correct inefficient policies is often not possible, we look for alternative instruments that can restore the efficient level of reforms. We compare subsidizing reform efforts with insuring against bad outcomes, and argue that subsidies are advantageous in terms of requiring less information for implementation.
H70|The Evolving Role of City Managers and Chief Administrative Officers|Ontario has benefited from well-functioning municipal government since Confederation, in large part because timely reforms have dealt with emerging problems. In response to recent issues, the Ontario government has decided that council-staff relations are sufficiently important to impose a legal requirement for a governing policy to be implemented in each of its 444 municipal governments. The often hidden, but very important, relationship between the municipal council and the public service is a key determinant of the success of any municipality. This paper explores how that relationship has changed over time with particular emphasis on the relatively recent ascendance in Ontario of the chief administrative officer (CAO) model. We believe that the CAO model performs better than either the council-committee model on which it was superimposed, or the U.S.-style â€œstrong mayorâ€ /political executive format that some favour. But the CAO model in Ontario is still relatively new and continues to evolve. This paper offers some suggestions for positive ways in which the CAO model can develop and warns of some clouds on the horizon that could harm the Canadian municipal government system.
H70|(Re)creating Boundary Lines: Assessing Toronto's Ward Boundary Review Process|When Toronto's Ward Boundary Review (WBR) began in 2013, the city's 44 wards varied widely in size, ranging from 45,000 to 90,000 residents. The WBRâ€™s multi-year process was designed by staff and led by consultants, with ample opportunity for involvement by councillors. The final ward boundaries were approved in November 2016 without significant deviation from those recommended in the consultantsâ€™ report. The result was the addition of three new wards. Assuming there are no successful appeals of the decision, the new ward boundaries will be in place for the 2018 election. The ward boundary review raised significant questions about the regularity by which such reviews should be held, the role of city councillors as participants and decision-makers in the process, and the relationship between the WBR and a future governance review. This paper sets out the contested legal terrain within which the City of Torontoâ€™s WBR took place and assesses possible next steps, including the grounds for a possible Ontario Municipal Board appeal. Ultimately, the paper concludes that wards are but one important component of municipal representation and governance.
H70|Signal and Political Accountability: Environmental Petitions in China|"Vertical accountability in China has long been considered as essentially indirect or informal. This paper provides evidence that direct local accountability may exist to a greater or lesser degree in China under current political institutions. By using provincial environmental petition data, this paper finds that the number of environmental petitions is positively associated with provincial governments' investments in pollution mitigation. The increased petitions serve as a signal to provincial leaders of the possibility of potential social instability. However, since ""local"" provincial party secretaries are better informed, the signaling effect of the petitions is lessened in these cases."
H70|Consequences of the Clean Water Act and the Demand for Water Quality|Since the 1972 U.S. Clean Water Act, government and industry have invested over $1 trillion to abate water pollution, or $100 per person- year. Over half of U.S. stream and river miles, however, still violate pollution standards. We use the most comprehensive set of files ever compiled on water pollution and its determinants, including 50 million pollution readings from 240,000 monitoring sites and a network model of all U.S. rivers, to study water pollution’s trends, causes, and welfare consequences. We have three main findings. First, water pollution concentrations have fallen substantially. Between 1972 and 2001, for example, the share of waters safe for fishing grew by 12 percentage points. Second, the Clean Water Act’s grants to municipal wastewater treatment plants, which account for $650 billion in expenditure, caused some of these declines. Through these grants, it cost around $1.5 million (2014 dollars) to make one river-mile fishable for a year. We find little displacement of municipal expenditure due to a federal grant. Third, the grants’ estimated effects on housing values are smaller than the grants’ costs; we carefully discuss welfare implications.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H70|Who Becomes A Politician?|Can a democracy attract competent leaders, while attaining broad representation? Economic models suggest that free-riding incentives and lower opportunity costs give the less competent a comparative advantage at entering political life. Moreover, if elites have more human capital, selecting on competence may lead to uneven representation. This article examines patterns of political selection among the universe of municipal politicians and national legislators in Sweden, using extraordinarily rich data on competence traits and social background for the entire population. We document four new facts that together characterize an “inclusive meritocracy.” First, politicians are on average significantly smarter and better leaders than the population they represent. Second, this positive selection is present even when conditioning on family (and hence social) background, suggesting that individual competence is key for selection. Third, the representation of social background, whether measured by parental earnings or occupational social class, is remarkably even. Fourth, there is at best a weak trade-off in selection between competence and social representation, mainly due to strong positive selection of politicians of low (parental) socioeconomic status. A broad implication of these facts is that it is possible for democracy to generate competent and socially representative leadership.
H70|The Effects of School Reform Under NCLB Waivers: Evidence from Focus Schools in Kentucky|Under waivers to the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act, the federal government required states to identify schools where targeted subgroups of students have the lowest achievement and to implement reforms in these “Focus Schools.” In this study, we examine the Focus School reforms in the state of Kentucky. The reforms in this state are uniquely interesting for several reasons. One is that the state developed unusually explicit guidance for Focus Schools centered on a comprehensive school-planning process. Second, the state identified Focus Schools using a “super subgroup” measure that combined traditionally low-performing subgroups into an umbrella group. This design feature may have catalyzed broader whole-school reforms and attenuated the incentives to target reform efforts narrowly. Using regression discontinuity designs, we find that these reforms led to substantial improvements in school performance, raising math achievement by 17 percent and reading achievement by 9 percent.
H70|School Performance, Accountability and Waiver Reforms: Evidence from Louisiana|"States that received federal waivers to the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act were required to implement reforms in designated ""Focus Schools"" that contribute to achievement gaps. In this study, we examine the performance effects of such ""differentiated accountability"" reforms in the state of Louisiana. The Focus School reforms in Louisiana emphasized school-needs assessments and aligned technical assistance. These state reforms may have also been uniquely high-powered because they were linked to a new letter-based school-rating system. We examine the impact of these reforms in a sharp regression discontinuity (RD) design based on the assignment of schools to Focus status. We find that, over each of three years, Louisiana's Focus School reforms had no measurable impact on school performance. We discuss evidence that these findings may reflect policy uncertainty and implementation fidelity at the state and local level."
H70|Signing Statements and Presidentializing Legislative History|Presidents often attach statements to the bills they sign into law, purporting to celebrate, construe, or object to provisions in the statute. Though long a feature of U.S. lawmaking, the President has avowedly attempted to use these signing statements as tool of strategic influence over judicial decisionmaking since the 1980s—as a way of creating “presidential legislative history” to supplement and, at times, supplant the traditional congressional legislative history conventionally used by the courts to interpret statutes. In this Article, we examine a novel dataset of judicial opinion citations to presidential signing statements to conduct the most comprehensive empirical examination of how courts have received presidential legislative history to date. Three main findings emerge from this analysis. First, contrary to the pervasive (and legitimate) fears in the literature on signing statements, courts rarely cite signing statements in their decisions. Second, in the aggregate, when courts cite signing statements, they cite them in predictably partisan ways, with judges citing Presidents’ signing statements from their own political parties more often than those of the opposing parties. This effect, however, is driven entirely by the behavior of Republican-appointed appellate jurists. Third, courts predominately employ signing statements to buttress aligned statutory text and conventional sources of legislative history, and seemingly never rely on them to override contrary plain statutory text or even unified traditional legislative history. This suggests that signing statements have low rank among interpretative tools and courts primarily use them to complement rather than substitute for congressional legislative history. In this sense, Presidents have largely failed to establish an alternative corpus of valid interpretive material.
H70|Improving the allocation and efficiency of public spending in Indonesia|Indonesia's fiscal position is generally sound and policy making prudent. However, the country still faces important challenges in terms of economic and social development. Infrastructure, education, health and social security are all spending areas that the government is trying to improve further, because the nation has yet to converge to the superior outcomes achieved by other countries at a similar level of development. The government's size is small, and raising more revenues will take time, which forces the authorities to get the most out of existing resources and prioritise enhancing the efficiency of public spending. To achieve such an improvement a whole-of-government approach is required, including in the budgeting process and in the establishment of medium-term goals. A key element of Indonesia's recent history lies in the tremendous efforts as from the late 1990s to go from a very centralised system of governance towards one with several nested levels of government. According to some metrics it was a success. Nonetheless, despite the considerable resources already devoted to decentralisation, there is still ample room for improvement in terms of coordination, transparency, accountability and service provision. More broadly, moving away from spending objectives and adopting performance-based incentives would lift outcomes. At the national level, Indonesia would also benefit from scrapping a certain number of inefficient expenditures, such as energy and fertiliser subsidies, and from concentrating on those policies with the highest payoffs, like filling infrastructure gaps and expanding conditional cash transfer schemes. While public employment, especially by some subnational governments, could be streamlined, improving its capacity should be the focus, including for teachers. The fight against corruption should continue by all available means, in particular with a more generalised use of electronic public procurement.
H70|Multi-objective local environmental simulator (MOLES 1.0): Model specification, algorithm design and policy applications|This paper describes MOLES 1.0, an integrated land-use and transport model developed with Object-Oriented Programming principles in order to combine selected characteristics from Spatial Computable General Equilibrium and microsimulation models.
H70|Natural Resource Extraction in a Federation|We analyze a natural resource extraction problem in a two-region economy with mobile labour. One region produces manufacturing goods while the other produces agriculture and extracts a non-renewable resource. Manufacturing production exhibits increasing returns-to-scale if the production level is sufficiently high. There are multiple long-run equilibrium labour allocations towards which the economy may converge. Under decentralized resource management, a tendency to over-extract the resource relative to the federal optimum makes convergence to a low-income equilibrium more likely. Optimal extraction from the federation's perspective satisfies a modified Hotelling's rule that takes into account the impact of resource extraction on manufacturing production.
H70|Does municipal mergers internalize spatial spillover effects? Empirical evidence from Japanese municipalities|This paper investigates whether municipal mergers could internalize spatial spillover effects by comparing mergers before and after they occur, especially focusing on local public library services in Japan. A spatial spillover effect occurs when the benefit of a local public service spreads across not only its own administrative district but also into neighboring ones. A free rider problem among municipalities might be caused when a municipality makes a policy decision regarding how much it supplies to its own local public service under a decentralization system, recognizing the existence of a spatial spillover effect. Under such circumstances, spatial spillover effects might be internalized through municipal mergers. In Japan, the boundaries of administrative districts—including those of municipalities—have been determined based on traditional or historical reasons. However, large-scale municipal mergers took place in FY2004 and FY2005 due to serious fiscal deficits and a rapidly aging population. Consequently, the number of municipalities in Japan has decreased from 3,232 to 1,820. In light of these facts, we examine whether municipal mergers internalize spatial spillover effects, focusing on Japanese local public library services, by applying cross-sectional spatial autoregressive models. As a result, we found that there are spatial spillover effects in public library services both in FY2001 (before) and in FY2008 (after). We also found that the impact of such spillovers in FY2008 is smaller than that in FY2001. The results imply that municipal mergers could at least partially internalize spatial spillover effects among municipalities.
H70|Tax Decentralisation, Labour productivity and Employment|Tax decentralisation should improve the efficiency of local governments and ultimately boost output growth. The empirical evidence is however mixed. The current work looks at two channels through which tax decentralisation may affect economic growth: labour productivity and employment rate. The empirical analysis conducted on 20 OECD countries over the period 1980-2010 shows that the ultimate effect of fiscal decentralisation on growth depends on which channel prevails, thus rendering the direct estimation of tax decentralisation on growth ambiguous. Tax decentralisation make the employment rate grow faster, while it has either no effect of reduces labour productivity growth. When the analysis is conducted using an IV approach with instruments based on institutional similarities and geographic distance, the positive and significant effect on employment rate growth is offset by the reduction of labour productivity growth, resulting in the absence of any statistically significant effect on output growth.
H70|Is There a 1033 Effect? Police Militarization and Aggressive Policing|Events in Ferguson and Baltimore in the United States in the past 3 years have brought to light issues related to the militarization of police and adverse police–citizen interactions. Through federal programs and grants, local law enforcement agencies have been able to acquire surplus military items to combat terrorism and drug activity. The acquisition of these items has accelerated over the past 10 years. These agencies acquired nearly $1 billion worth of property in 2014 alone through the Pentagon’s 1033 Program, a program that distributes excess military surplus to law enforcement agencies. This study seeks to determine whether the increased acquisition of these items has led to more police use-of-force incidents. We create a dataset merging administrative data from the Pentagon’s 1033 Program database and survey data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Using a binary treatment effects estimator, we show that there is little evidence of a causal link between general military surplus acquisition and documented use-of-force incidents. In fact, the acquisition of military vehicles leads to fewer use-of-force incidents. The results also show that more diverse departments have fewer incidents, while agencies with SWAT team have more incidents.
H70|Out-of-town Home Buyers and City Welfare|The major cities of the world have attracted a flurry of out-of-town (OOT) home buyers. Such capital inflows affect housing affordability, the spatial distribution of residents, construction, labor income, wealth, and ultimately welfare. We develop a spatial equilibrium model of a city with substantial heterogeneity among residents. We calibrate the model to the New York and Vancouver metro areas. The observed increase in OOT purchases is associated with 1.1% (5.0%) higher house prices and a 0.1% (0.34%) welfare loss in New York (Vancouver). Taxing OOT buyers can turn welfare losses into gains when tax revenues finance a local public good.
H70|The Local Effects of the Texas Shale Boom on Schools, Students, and Teachers|This study explores how the Texas shale boom affected schools, students, and teachers. Using variation in geology across school districts and oil prices over time, the evidence shows that test scores and attendance in the average shale district declined despite the boom tripling the tax base and creating a revenue windfall. Greater spending went to capital projects and servicing debt, not to teachers. Although higher wages may not have affected completion rates, a growing gap in wages between the private and education sectors contributed to greater teacher turnover and more inexperienced teachers, which help explain the declines in student achievement.
H70|How do ideas shape national preferences? The Financial Transaction Tax in Ireland|European countries have been required to formulate a national preference in relation to the EU Financial Transaction Tax. The two leading approaches to explaining how the financial sector makes its views felt in the political process – the structural power of the financial services sector based on potential disinvestment, and its instrumental power arising from direct political lobbying – fall short of providing a comprehensive account. The missing link is how and why policy-makers might be willing to adopt the priorities of key sectors of the financial services industry. We outline how two levels of ideational power might be at work in shaping outcomes, using Ireland as a case study. We argue firstly that background systems of shared knowledge that are institutionalized in policy networks generated broad ideational convergence between the financial sector and policymakers over the priorities of industrial policy in general. Secondly, and against that backdrop, debate over specific policy choices can leave room for a wider range of disagreement and indeed political and ideational contestation. Irish policymakers proved responsive to industry interests in the case of the FTT, but not for the reasons normally given. This work seeks to link literatures in two fields of inquiry. It poses questions for liberal intergovernmentalism in suggesting that the translation of structurally grounded material interests into national policy preferences is far from automatic, and argues that this is mediated by ideational considerations that are often under-estimated. It also contributes to our understanding of how constructivist explanations of policy outcomes work in practice, through a detailed case study of how material and ideational interests interact.
H70|L’Evoluzione Dei Tributi Locali In Italia Dall’Unificazione Al 1970: Politiche, Assetti Istituzionali E Gettito|Abstract. This paper looks at the role of tax decentralization in the Italian history of Public Finance from the beginning of the Italian Unification to the years before the set-up of Regional governments. The role of the benefit principles in the local tax assignments is discussed. The analysis also includes some updated data on local public expenditures and taxes from 1861 to 1970
H70|Direct Propagation of a Fiscal Shock: Evidence from Italy's Stability Pact|This paper documents: the channels through which local governments propagate a fiscal shock; and the corresponding reaction by firms in the affected upstream sector (municipal procurement). The shock is provided by an Italian fiscal rule, called Patto di stabilita' dei comuni, which was tightened unexpectedly in 2008 and applied only to municipalities with population greater than 5,000. Using a difference-indifference identification strategy, we estimate that this shock led to a 13-20% reduction of infrastructure spending in treated municipalities, or equivalently, an 80% reduction in the average municipality. In contrast, current expenditure was not affected. In the upstream sector, i.e., the infrastructure procurement sector, firms reacted to the demand shock by cutting capital rather than labor. In both cases, then, the capital/investment sector is found to be a pre-eminent channel of direct shock propagation. In addition, the fiscal demand shock is found to propagate disproportionately through those private-sector firms which are most exposed to the shocked sector. This finding suggests that direct shock transmission depends on the higher moments of the exposure distribution, beyond the average sectoral exposure that is represented by the input-output linkages. Using procurement-market data we rule out the possibility that our estimates are attenuated by spillover effects operating through competition in the procurement market.
H70|An Interdisciplinary View on Tax Revenue Estimates and Forecasts and its Impacts on a Multilevel Public Budget System|While tax revenue forecasts are required for the public budget planning and execution process, the frameworks and accuracy of tax revenue forecasts are crucial for economic analysis of public budgets in multilevel systems. Insufficient and defective tax revenue forecasts can lead to budget problems as well as budget interdependencies in multilevel systems. The determination of budget revenues amount, which can actually be carried out, needs to estimate the forecast of tax revenues reasonably and accurately. Adequacy and feasibility of relevant indicators depend on the assessment of the state, trends and forecasting of economic and social development, stability and progressiveness of the current legislation, the forms and methods of tax mobilization, the level of fiscal culture and other factors. The role of tax revenue forecasting is enhanced significantly. Fiscal equalization schemes, grant systems and bailout rules have to take into account in the case of problems with the accuracy of tax revenue forecasts. If tax revenues forecasts in the medium-term are upward biased, the institutional setting can be an explanation for forecasts errors (Breuer 2014). However, over-optimistic as well as under-optimistic forecasts influence budgeting and budget targets.The present paper deals with the conditions and institutional frameworks for accuracy of tax revenue forecasts, especially in a medium-income and a high-income country. First, we present a literature review on tax revenue forecast and the importance of institutional performance for accurate tax revenue forecasts. Thereby, empirical studies to explain forecasts errors will be analyzed. In a comparison of two countries, the second session describes the institutional setting for tax revenue forecasts and the procedures in the Ukraine and Germany and shows the methods, actors and institutional mechanisms in these different multilevel systems. The analysis focusses on the degree of decentralization in both countries and legal equalization schemes. We show some determinants of tax revenue forecast errors and discuss the impacts and consequences for budgetary planning and budget managing in multilevel systems. Our findings point out the importance of fiscal governance in multilevel systems if tax revenue forecasts are influenced by many determinants in specific ways that makes revenue forecast difficult. Multilevel fiscal governance is required to solve problems in tax revenue forecasts and budgeting in decentralized systems. Additionally, the knowledge on taxpayer´s behavior (households, employees, consumer, firms) under conditions of globalization of taxation is underestimated at the present, but is needed for the improvement of public budget managing processes.
H70|Innovating trainign practices in risk society. Assessing hybrid threats with multicultural (con)texts|Today?s risk society renders an acute sense that there exists a whole new range of tools of power advanced in the online environment that hybridize both understanding and behavior of the political actors. Therefore, one feels the need to develop an understanding of how such instruments operate, generate threats and destabilize the social fabric of democratic societies. The current paper advances in this context an experimental methodology for training aimed at facilitating the acquisition of skills required in the assessment of hybrid threats. Starting from the premise that (inter)active and experimental learning need to be regarded as fundamentals of successful training, the paper presents the philosophy and the practice of the exercise designed to serve as an interactive training tool for the participants in the Security in the Black Sea Region. Shared Challenges, Sustainable Future? Program. Entitled The new power kit. Policies of attraction, subversion and projection in the Black Sea Region, the exercise embraces the need to bring together practitioners, policymakers and stakeholders from a large variety of national backgrounds being therefore designed for multicultural formats and multi-purpose teams. Its potential for replication has been tested with great success in different formats and professional backgrounds, therefore we assess that with the current methodology it can be tailored and applied not only in the Black Sea context but regardless of the region/country of interest and socio-economic conditions that the trainer might like to apply.
H70|Addressing the safety trilemma: a safe sovereign asset for the eurozone|At the 25th anniversary of the Maastricht Treaty, this paper reviews the merits of introducing a safe sovereign asset for the eurozone. The triple euro area crisis showed the costly consequences of ignoring the ‘safety trilemma’. Keeping a national safe sovereign asset (the German bund) as the cornerstone of the financial system is incompatible with having free capital mobility and maintaining economic and financial stability in a monetary union. The euro area needs a single safe sovereign asset. However, eurobonds are only foreseen after full fiscal integration. To address the safety trilemma member countries must therefore act as the joint sovereign behind the euro and choose from two options. First, they could establish a credible multipolar system of safe national sovereign assets. For this purpose, they could all issue both senior and junior tranches of each national government bond in a proportion such that the expected safety of the senior tranche is the same across countries while the junior tranche would absorb any sovereign default risk. Additional issuance of national GDP-linked bonds could insure governments against a deep recession that might lead to a self-fulfilling default and thereby help to make the junior tranche less risky. The second option is that the member countries together produce a common safe sovereign asset for a truly integrated and stable monetary union by creating synthetic eurobonds comprising both a safe senior claim and a risky junior claim on a diversified portfolio of national government bonds. This appears a more effective solution to the safety trilemma – especially when euro area governments would also issue national GDP-linked bonds – but it requires flanking measures to control for moral hazard.

H70|Politics and crime in black & white|Does the race of a politician have an impact on the incidence of crime? I answer this question by focusing on large US cities, where active participation in the political life of the African-American candidates has undergone a strong upsurge since 1965. In order to deal with the endogeneity of black candidates to city characteristics, a regression discontinuity is used, exploiting the multi-racial elections decided by a narrow margin of victory. The results show that the number of motor vehicles stolen increases considerably the year after the election of an African-American candidate. I investigate, as a possible channel of influence, how police employment responds to the election of a black mayor, finding a negative effect the year after the electoral race.
H70|Balance sheet strength and the bank-lending channel: evidence from an emerging market|The bank lending channel view of monetary policy argues that bank loan supply should fall during periods of tight monetary policy. Employing a sample of over 122 Indian commercial banks for the period between 2005-17, we investigate the role of cross-sectional heterogeneity in bank balance sheet strength in the effectiveness of bank lending channel. We show that both small and large banks with liquid balance sheets are able to maintain their supply of loans during periods of tight monetary policy. Furthermore, we find that higher capital ratios can also enable banks to maintain their loan supply, in particular among smaller financial institutions. The mechanism at play is a time deposits insulation channel, whereby banks with strong balance sheets can raise time deposits during periods of contractionary monetary policy.
H70|How do ideas shape national preferences? The Financial Transaction Tax in Ireland|European countries have been required to formulate a national preference in relation to the EU Financial Transaction Tax. The two leading approaches to explaining how the financial sector makes its views felt in the political process – the structural power of the financial services sector based on potential disinvestment, and its instrumental power arising from direct political lobbying – fall short of providing a comprehensive account. The missing link is how and why policy-makers might be willing to adopt the priorities of key sectors of the financial services industry. We outline how two levels of ideational power might be at work in shaping outcomes, using Ireland as a case study. We argue firstly that background systems of shared knowledge that are institutionalized in policy networks generated broad ideational convergence between the financial sector and policymakers over the priorities of industrial policy in general. Secondly, and against that backdrop, debate over specific policy choices can leave room for a wider range of disagreement and indeed political and ideational contestation. Irish policymakers proved responsive to industry interests in the case of the FTT, but not for the reasons normally given. This work seeks to link literatures in two fields of inquiry. It poses questions for liberal intergovernmentalism in suggesting that the translation of structurally grounded material interests into national policy preferences is far from automatic, and argues that this is mediated by ideational considerations that are often under-estimated. It also contributes to our understanding of how constructivist explanations of policy outcomes work in practice, through a detailed case study of how material and ideational interests interact.
H70|Strength in diversity? Fiscal federalism among the fifty US states|Abstract Fiscal federalism in the USA has a distinctive structure that contrasts sharply with that in most other industrialized nations. Our purpose in this paper is to describe and explore the US “brand” of fiscal federalism. We demonstrate that there is a striking amount of variety in the 50 state fiscal systems and that these differences have prevailed in the face of potentially disruptive forces. The variety we find stems in large part from states having meaningful fiscal autonomy, in particular, the authority to levy taxes. The result is likely higher societal welfare than would ensue without this autonomy.
H70|Costly voting, turnout, and candidate valence|We build a model of voluntary and costly expressive voting, where the relative weight of ideology and valence issues over voting costs determines how people vote and if they actually turn out to vote. In line with the conventional rational calculus approach, the model predicts that the cost of voting depresses voter turnout. Against the conventional wisdom, though, high voting cost/low turnout elections tend to have a larger share of voters for whom the common value signal on candidates’ valence matches their private value views, thus raising the chances that high valence candidates are elected.
H70|Does the Strength of Incentives Matter for Elected Officials? A Look at Tax Collectors|In Pennsylvania local property taxes are collected by elected officials, known as tax collectors, whose compensation varies widely in both structure and level across municipalities. This paper analyses the existence of a pay-performance relationship for these officials. Using data on the percentage of real estate taxes that are actually collected at the municipal level, the paper finds that as the compensation tax collectors receive goes up, they collect more in taxes. This relationship is however true only for collectors who are compensated on a commission basis and not for collectors compensated on the basis of a flat salary. The paper also finds no relationship between the share of votes received by the tax collector and the percentage of property taxes collected during the previous term. This observation may account for the lack of a positive relationship between pay and performance for collectors compensated on the basis of a salary.
H70|To the Victor Belongs the Spoils? Party Membership and Public Sector Employment in Brazil|We analyze how political discretion affects the selection of government workers, using individual-level data on political party membership and matched employer-employee data on the universe of formal workers in Brazil. Exploiting close mayoral races, we find that winning an election leads to an increase of over 40% in the number of members of the winning party working in the municipal bureaucracy. Employment of members of the ruling party increases relatively more in senior positions, but also expands in lower-ranked jobs, suggesting that discretionary appointments are used both to influence policymaking and to reward supporters. We find that party members hired after their party is elected tend be of similar or even higher quality than members of the runner-up party, contrary to common perceptions that political appointees are less qualified. Moreover, the increased public employment of members of the ruling party is long-lasting, extending beyond the end of the mayoral term.
H70|The Economic Impact of City-County Consolidations: A Synthetic Control Approach|Although more rapid development is a primary motivation behind city-county consolidations, relatively few empirical papers explore the actual impact of consolidation on development. This study uses the synthetic control method (SCM) to examine the long-term impact of city-county consolidations on per capita income, population, and employment. The results from the three cases explored indicate that consolidation does not guarantee development and can actually have negative effects. Additionally, the effects vary based upon the county, time horizon, and development measure.
H70|Is owning your Home Good for your Health? Evidence from exogenous variations in subsidies in England|Little is known about the causal effects of home ownership on health. We exploit the 'Right to Buy' policy in England as a source of exogenous variation in the ownership decision. The policy gave secure long-term tenants of publicly rented housing a discount in order to encourage them to buy their home. We assess the health and well-being impacts of this ownership decision by considering a macro and micro level analysis. In both analyses, home ownership is associated with higher levels of health and well-being. At the macro-level, local authorities with higher ownership rates had lower rates of people reporting having a longstanding health condition and also lower average counts of the number of health conditions reported by individuals. At the micro-level, becoming a homeowner reduced the number of self-reported health conditions by 0.65, increased self-assessed health by 0.19 points on a ve-point scale, and increased General Health Questionnaire scores by 1.46 points on a 37-point scale. These results are robust to a number of assumptions. Further models suggest that the mechanisms through which home ownership aects health may operate via the labour markets with new job opportunities, extra time saved travelling and resources available for healthy leisure activities.
H70|Depressing dependence? Transfers and economic growth in the German states, 1975–2005| Depressing dependence? Transfers and economic growth in the German states, 1975–2005. Regional Studies. Most countries pay substantial intergovernmental transfers to poor regions with the aim of achieving regional convergence. Consequently, transfers should have a positive effect on economic growth. However, it is equally possible that transfers perpetuate underdevelopment. This paper studies empirically the effect of intergovernmental transfers on economic growth with a panel of West German states over the period 1975–2005. The findings suggest that transfers do not foster economic growth, presumably because the recipients use them to subsidize declining industries.
H70|A Situational Theory of Pork Barrel Politics: The Shifting Logic of Discretionary Allocations in India|A rich panel dataset on Indian states is used to propose a situational theory of distributive politics which states that incentives for exclusive targeting of affiliated states in dominant party systems drive national ruling parties towards particularism, while the shrinking opportunity to indulge in such a policy in multiparty coalition systems creates a universalisation effect. Additionally, the disaggregated analysis of discretionary grants brings to the fore the fact that the shift from particularism to universalism occurs for schematic grants, which provide an opportunity for credit claiming. The ad hoc grants, which are like side payments, remain subject to par ticularism. [GIGA Working paper No. 298].
H70|Federalism and Foreign Direct Investment: How Political Affiliation Determines the Spatial Distribution of FDI – Evidence from India|This paper links the foreign economic engagement of India's states with the literature on federalism, thereby contributing to an understanding of the political economy of FDI inflows in a parliamentary federal system. More specifically, it studies subnational governments' international engagements to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) and investigates whether the political affiliations of states' chief ministers and parliamentarians determine the spatial distribution of FDI across the Indian states, correcting for the influence of per capita income, population density, urbanisation, infrastructure, policy regime, and human development. Although the central government plays no direct role in determining the state to which FDI goes, the centre-state relations in a federal structure play a role in creating perceptions about the relative political risk involved in different investment destinations. Employing multiple linear regressions to analyse time-series (2000-2013) cross-sectional (12 states) data using the panel procedure, the study finds that affiliated states attract relatively more FDI per capita in comparison to states ruled by opposition parties or coalition partners. However, some exceptions do result, primarily due to two phenomena: first, the presence of a strong state leadership and, second, the presence of a significant share of members of parliament belonging to the prime minister's party in the non-affiliated states. Further, states ruled by outside supporters have been most successful in attracting FDI inflows during the coalition period.
H70|The effect of land consumption on municipal tax revenue: Evidence from Bavaria|This paper aims to quantify the municipal tax revenue effects of built-up area increases. The assumed existence of these effects is one of the key reasons for ongoing land consumption on the side of the municipalities. Some previous case studies however suggested that these effects might be not large enough especially in rural municipalities and would thus make land development not profitable. We estimate the effect of built-up industrial and commercial (BIC) area change on the business tax revenues in cross-sectional instrumental variable (IV) estimations. Based on detailed data for Bavaria, we find a significant and positive tax revenue effect of an increase in municipal BIC area. There exist strong differences in the size of this effect between urban and rural municipalities. The largest effects are generated by the BIC area in the large cities and become substantially smaller when these are dropped from the sample. Based on these findings, we reflect on the tradable planning permits (TPP) scheme recently discussed in the land use literature in the context of policies aiming to limit land consumption. Furthermore, we relate our estimates to the average municipal costs for land development and execute a number of robustness checks.
H70|Gridlock: Ethnic Diversity in Government and the Provision of Public Goods|How does ethnic diversity in government impact public good provision? We construct a novel dataset linking the ethnicity of California city council candidates to election outcomes and expenditure decisions. Using a regression discontinuity approach, we find that increased diversity on the council leads to less spending on public goods. This is especially true in cities with high segregation and economic inequality. Those serving on councils that experience an increase in diversity also receive fewer votes when they run for reelection. These results point towards disagreement within the council generating lower spending.
H70|Las finanzas autonómicas en 2016 y entre 2003 y 2016|En este informe se analiza la evolución de los ingresos y gastos autonómicos y el saldo presupuestario del sector desde 2003 hasta el presente. En la primera parte del trabajo se presta especial atención al comportamiento del gasto por habitante a precios constantes. Seguidamente se analizan en cierto detalle las cuentas de los últimos ejercicios, destacando el efecto que sobre ellas han tenido algunos factores atípicos. El análisis sugiere que las cuentas regionales todavía no han superado por completo los efectos de la crisis y continúan presentando factores significativos de vulnerabilidad. En particular, la mejora de los saldos presupuestarios registrada en los últimos ejercicios proviene en buena parte de la caída de las partidas de inversión desde niveles que ya eran insosteniblemente bajos, así como de una importante reducción del gasto en intereses que ha sido posible gracias a las muy favorables condiciones financieras que en estos años han ofrecido el FLA y los demás mecanismos estatales de liquidez.
H70|Legal conflicts of interest of the revolving door|This paper analyzes the conflicts of interest arising from the “revolving door”. The revolving door is a common phenomenon, and it is unlikely that most of it can be explained by ‘regulatory capture’, a practice that is unlawful. Therefore, there is a need for a new framework.
H70|Tenure in Office and Public Procurement|"We study the impact of politicians' tenure in office on the outcomes of public procurement using a dataset on Italian municipal governments. To identify a causal relation, we first compare elections where the incumbent mayor barely won or barely lost another term. We then use the introduction of a two-term limit, which granted one potential extra term to mayors appointed before the reform. The main result is that an increase in tenure is associated with ""worse"" procurement outcomes. Our estimates are informative of the possibility that time in office progressively leads to collusion between government officials and local bidders."
H70|The political economy of diagnosis-related groups|A well-established political economic literature has shown as multi-level governance affects the inefficiency of public expenditures. Yet, this expectation has not been empirically tested on health expenditures. We provide a political economy interpretation of the variation in the prices of 6 obstetric DRGs using Italy as a case study. Italy offers a unique institutional setting since its 21 regional governments can decide whether to adopt the national DRG system or to adjust/waive it. We investigate whether the composition and characteristics of regional governments do matter for the average DRG level and, if so, why. To address both questions, we first use a panel fixed effects model exploiting the results of 66 elections between 2000 and 2013 (i.e., 294 obs) to estimate the link between DRGs and the composition and characteristics of regional governments. Second, we investigate these results exploiting the implementation of a budget constraint policy through a difference-in-differences framework. The incidence of physicians in the regional government explains the variation of DRGs with low technological intensity, such as normal newborn, but not of those with high technological intensity, as severely premature newborn. We also observe a decrease in the average levels of DRGs after the budget constraint implementation, but the magnitude of this decrease depends primarily on the presence of physicians among politicians and the political alignment between the regional and the national government. To understand which kind of role the relevance of the political components plays (i.e., waste vs. better defined DRGs), we check whether any of the considered political economy variables have a positive impact on the quality of regional obstetric systems finding no effect. These results are a first evidence that a system of standardized prices, such as the DRGs, is not immune to political pressures.
H70|Commodity taxation and regulatory competition|Abstract The purpose of this paper is twofold. We first investigate whether product market regulations affect commodity taxation in open-to-trade economies, and second, we study the strategic interaction in regulatory measures between trading partner countries. We present a two-country general equilibrium model in which destination-based commodity taxes finance public goods, and product market regulation affects both the number of firms in the market and product diversity. Based on data for 21 OECD countries over the 1990–2008 period, we provide empirical evidence suggesting that product market regulations are strategic complement policies and that domestic regulations have a negative impact on domestic commodity taxation.
H70|Political agency and public healthcare: Evidence from India|The development of institutions of self-governance in India, and specifically the 2005 reformâ€”the National Rural Health Mission that introduced village health and sanitation committeesâ€”provide a unique opportunity to study the effects of the strengthening of the political agency on collective healthcare decision-making in rural areas. We use data from the District Level Household Survey and take advantage of the heterogeneity of maternal and child healthcare use, before and after the introduction of village health and sanitation committees. Specifically, we examine the effect of village health and sanitation committees on use of both public and preventive healthcare among children. Our results suggest that local democracy has increased access to preventive child healthcare services. Part of the effect is driven by an increase in the utilization of the public healthcare network. We find some evidence of an effect of village residence heads of a Panchayat on preventive healthcare use.
H70|Exposition to Corruption and Political Participation: Evidence from Italian Municipalities|The aim of this paper is to study the effect of local corruption on political participation which is mediated by the press. Focusing on Italy, we generate a daily measure of exposition to local corruption screening articles of main Italian press agency. Applying an event-study methodology on local elections, two results emerge. First, corruption exposition reduces citizens participation: voter turnout decreases but characteristics of elected politicians are not affected; second, politicians participation modifies: number of candidates lowers along with proportion of running freshmen. These results suggest that corruption exposition produces resignation rather than retaliation in terms of political participation.
H70|Local Border Reforms and Economic Activity|In this paper, we study how local border reforms affect economic activity. To do so, we make use of large-scale municipal merger reforms in Germany to assess the effect of local border changes on the distribution of activity in space, an issue that has not been addressed in existing literature. To allow for a comparison of economic activity within unique geographical units over time, we use geo-coded light data as well as local land-use data. Adopting a difference-in-differences approach, we find evidence that municipalities absorbing their merger partners and hosting the new administrative center experience a significant increase in local activity, while the municipalities that are being absorbed and are losing the administrative center experience a decrease in such activity. The difference between the gains in activity from absorbing municipalities and the losses from absorbed ones appears positive. These hitherto undocumented results point to the importance of distance to the administrative center as a determinant of the spatial distribution of economic activity.
H70|Can Regional Decentralisation Shift Health Care Preferences?|Uniform health care delivered by a mainstream public insurer – such as the National Health Service (NHS), seldom satisfies heterogeneous demands for care, and some unsatisfied share of the population either use private health care, or purchase private insurance (PHI). One potential mechanism to partially satisfy heterogeneous preferences for health care, and discourage the use of private health care, is regional health care decentralisation. We find robust estimates suggesting that the development of regional health services shifted both perceptions of, and preferences for, using the NHS, making it more likely individuals would use public health care and, consequently, reducing the uptake of PHI. These results are heterogeneous by income, education, and age groups; and are robust to placebo and other robustness and falsification checks.
H70|Essays on the Behavior of Firms and Politicians|Die vorliegende Dissertation besteht aus sechs eigenständigen Kapiteln, die vom Verhalten von Firmen und Politikern im weiteren Sinne handeln. Nach einer Einführung in die Thematik wird im ersten Teil der Dissertation ausgeführt, wie institutionelle und politische Rahmenbedingungen das Verhalten von Firmen beeinflussen. In Kapitel 2 werden die Einflussgrößen von Schenkungen von Betriebsvermögen in deutschen Familienunternehmen untersucht. Umfrageergebnisse zeigen, dass bei größeren Unternehmen und bei Unternehmen mit guter Geschäftslage die Schenkungswahrscheinlichkeit stieg. In Kapitel 3 wird untersucht, wie politische Unsicherheit Investitionsentscheidungen von Unternehmen beeinflusst, wofür Daten über realisierte Investitionsquoten, Investitionspläne und -revisionen verwendet werden. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die realisierten Investitionsquoten in den Jahren, in denen Landtagswahlen stattfanden im Durchschnitt niedriger waren als in Jahren, in denen keine Landtagswahlen stattfanden. Unternehmen schienen jedoch schon bei der Investitionsplanung die Wahlunsicherheit zu antizipieren, denn sie revidierten ihre Pläne kaum. In Kapitel 4 wird untersucht, ob politische Unsicherheit beeinflusst, wie Unternehmer ihre aktuelle Geschäftslage und zukünftige Geschäftsentwicklung wahrnehmen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass Unternehmer erwarteten, dass ihr Geschäft sich besser vor Landtagswahlen und schlechter nach Landtagswahlen entwickeln wird. Der zweite Teil dieser Dissertation untersucht, wie ideologische Orientierung und Eigeninteresse von Politikern ihr Ethos und Verhalten prägen. Kapitel 5 beschreibt, wie ideologische Orientierung Einstellungen und Handlungen von Politikern in Deutschland prägt. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass Worte und Taten deutscher Landespolitiker und -regierungen in Bezug auf Haushaltskonsolidierung und Schuldenbremsen voneinander abgewichen haben. In Kapitel 6 wird untersucht, ob Parteien Politiker, die in namentlichen Abstimmungen von der Parteilinie abweichen, bestrafen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen nicht, dass Parteien das Abstimmungsverhalten beachteten und Politiker bestraften, die gegen die Parteienlinie gestimmt haben. In Kapitel 7 wird untersucht, inwiefern unterschiedliche ideologische Orientierungen der deutschen Wirtschaftsforschungsinstitute die Politikberatung in der Gemeinschaftsdiagnose beeinflusst haben.
H70|Handelseffekte von Grenzkontrollen|Eine neue empirische Untersuchung des ifo Instituts zeigt, dass selbst bei einem vollständigen Zusammenbruch des Schengen-Raums das BIP in Deutschland lediglich zwischen 4 und 11 Mrd. Euro pro Jahr sinken würde; die weitaus realistischere Wiedereinführung von Kontrollen an den Flüchtlingsrouten würde zu Effekten zwischen 1 und 3 Mrd. Euro führen. Für Österreich liegen die Verluste bei 80 bis 210 Mio. Euro. Diese Kosten machen jedoch nur einen Bruchteil jener Belastungen aus, die durch fortgeführte ungeregelte Massenzuwanderung entstehen würden.
H70|Handelseffekte von Grenzkontrollen|Das am 26. März 1995 in Kraft gesetzte Schengener Abkommen hat einen Europäischen Binnenraum der Personenfreizügigkeit geschaffen und damit ein beispielloses kontinentales Integrationsziel erreicht. Die Bedrohung durch globalen Terrorismus sowie ein starker Anstieg der Flüchtlingszahlen in Europa seit Sommer 2015 haben eine Grundsatzdebatte darüber hervorgerufen, inwieweit offene Binnengrenzen politisch und ökonomisch haltbar sind. Diese Studie adressiert drei Fragestellungen: Wie stark wird die Reisezeit durch Grenzkontrollen beeinträchtigt? Beeinflusst die Abschaffung der Grenzkontrollen durch das Schengener Abkommen den grenzüberschreitenden Handel in Waren und Dienstleistungen? Welche Wohlfahrtseffekte sind aufgrund einer Veränderung internationaler Handelsvolumina in Folge einer Wiedereinführung von Grenzkontrollen im Schengen-Raum zu erwarten? Die Studie findet, dass die Überwindung von Ländergrenzen innerhalb des Schengen-Raumes um etwa 20 Minuten schneller gelingt als zwischen zwei Ländern, von denen mindestens eines nicht dem Schengen-Raum angehört. Eine Wiedereinführung der Grenzkontrollen im Schengen-Raum würde die bilateralen Warenexporte je Grenzübertritt um 2,7% reduzieren; entspricht einem Zolläquivalent von 0,54%. Die bilateralen Dienstleistungsexporte je Grenzübertritt würden um 4,2% reduziert; entspricht einem Zolläquivalent von 0,82%. Die deutschen BIP Einbußen durch einen vollständigen Zusammenbruch des Schengen-Raumes lägen zwischen 4 und 11 Mrd. Euro pro Jahr. Die weitaus realistischere Wiedereinführung von Kontrollen an den Flüchtlingsrouten würde für Deutschland zu BIP Effekten zwischen -1 und -3 Mrd. Euro jährlich führen. Ähnliche Analysen wurden für Bayern, Österreich und die Europäische Union durchgeführt.
H70|Föderalismus im Wunderland: Zur Steuerautonomie bei der Grunderwerbsteuer|Die Autoren nehmen die Entwicklung der Steuersätze seit 2006 zum Anlass, die Berücksichtigung der Einnahmen aus der Grunderwerbsteuer im Finanzausgleich zu untersuchen. Im Rahmen einer Simulationsanalyse wird die Entwicklung von 2006 bis 2016 nachvollzogen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass für viele Länder ein starker fiskalischer Anreiz besteht, den Steuersatz zu erhöhen, weil sie dadurch nicht nur höhere Steuereinnahmen sondern auch höhere Zuweisungen erhalten. Bei Ländern, die dennoch auf eine Erhöhung des Grunderwerbsteuersatzes verzichtet haben, zeigt sich verschiedentlich eine paradoxe Situation in dem Sinne, dass mit jedem zusätzlichen Euro an Grunderwerbsteuer ein Rückgang an Transfers einsetzt, der größer ist als der Zuwachs an Steuereinnahmen.
H70|Do Higher Corporate Taxes Reduce Wages? Micro Evidence from Germany|This paper estimates the incidence of corporate taxes on wages using a 20-year panel of German municipalities exploiting 6,800 tax changes for identification. Using event study designs and difference-in-differences models, we find that workers bear about one-half of the total tax burden. Administrative linked employer-employee data allow us to estimate heterogeneous firm and worker effects. Our findings highlight the importance of labor market institutions and profit-shifting opportunities for the incidence of corporate taxes on wages. Moreover, we show that low-skilled, young, and female employees bear a larger share of the tax burden. This has important distributive implications.

H70|La gruesa decimal en Michoacán y la creación de la contaduría de diezmos, 1824-1835|El presente artículo pretende analizar la actividad fiscal y administrativa del diezmo en Michoacán, a partir de la cesión del derecho de recaudación y usufructo de dicho impuesto por parte de la federación a las nuevas entidades. Asimismo, busca exponer la incursión de la autoridad civil del estado de Michoacán, cuyo propósito fue hacer eficiente la recolección del mencionado gravamen, por medio de la instauración de la oficina denominada Contaduría de Diezmos, encargada de administrar los recursos provenientes de rentas eclesiásticas durante los primeros años de la Primera República Federal. El trabajo corrobora la importancia del diezmo, impuesto de antiguo régimen vinculado directamente con las autoridades eclesiásticas, el cual también fue rentable para el gobierno michoacano en comparación con otros impuestos de carácter civil.
H70|Out-of-town Home Buyers and City Welfare|The major cities of the world have attracted a flurry of interest from out-of-town (OOT) home buyers. Such capital inflows in local real estate have implications for affordability through their effects on prices and rents, but also for construction, local labor markets, the spatial distribution of residents, and ultimately economic welfare. We develop a spatial equilibrium model of a city that features heterogeneous households that make optimal decisions on consumption, savings, labor supply, tenure status, and location. The model generates realistic wealth accumulation and home ownership patterns over the life-cycle and in the cross-section. An inflow of OOT real estate buyers pushes up prices, rents, and wages. It increases the concentration of young, high-productivity, and wealthy households in the city center (gentrification). When OOT investors buy 10% of the housing stock, city welfare goes down by 0.3% of permanent consumption levels. The average renter suffers a large welfare loss while the average owner gains modestly. We adapt the model to the New York metro area, obtain detailed data on OOT purchases, and find that the observed increase in OOT purchases is associated with a 0.1% welfare loss.
H70|Les assureurs mutualistes actifs sur le marché de l’assurance municipale en Europe|This presented analysis sought to assess the potential of the European municipal insurance market by looking into its main features and market size. It also weighed the potential impact of new regulatory requirements, in particular the European Commission Directive on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of insurance and reinsurance (Solvency II). An overview of the insurance industry’s performance highlights a strong resilience of the mutual business model relatively to the competing capitalistic model. Mutual insurers in some European markets remain leaders in the market; a result attributable to innovative financial and legal arrangements that were decisive in overcoming challenges pertaining to capital requirements and market access while keeping their mutual DNA. Looking ahead, current macroeconomic imbalances ensure the mutual insurance model a positive outlook, despite headwinds stemming from regulation and other comparative legal disadvantages. As for the specific municipal insurance market, the research identified two major systems of policy issuance: the classical property & casualty (P&C) and life insurance contracts and the fully in-house managed contracts. In terms of outlook, the municipal insurance’s specific features and opportunities make it an area for business expansion where mutual insurers might play a key role
H70|The Design of IEP Sites: Aiming for an Inclusive Economic Participation of Urban Citizens in Flanders|In order to remedy the economic position of socially vulnerable citizens in Flemish cities, the University of Antwerp has launched the concept of an “Inclusive Participation (IEP) site”. According to the CIRIEC workgroup “SSE and territories”, an IEP site can be defined as a particular territorial network that accommodates partners who jointly try to resolve, under the environmental constraints of an urban setting, the challenge of an inclusive economic participation. On the basis of two explorative research projects, the working paper illustrates the fine-tuning of the concept and the development of strategic-spatial blueprints to successfully design and manage these IEP sites.
H70|Does Leader-Member Exchange Impact on Organizational Citizenship Behaviour Readiness? Evidence from State Government Agency|Local Government (LG) being the third-tier in Malaysian government has been identified as one of the government agencies mandated to drive economic growth and development of a district and its residents. Being one of the main service providers, LG has yet to meet the public expectations as many complaints have being filed towards its operational issues as evidenced from statistical data from Public Complaint Bureau (PCB). Thus, in responding to PCB statistics and lack in-depth research on LG, this paper aims to investigate the relationship between leader-member exchange (LMX) and Organizational Citizenship Behaviors (OCB) among LG’ employees working in Southern region of Malaysia. Multiple regression analysis from a data set of 222 respondents, after factor analysis, revealed that LMX-affect respect and LMX-contribution have positive impact towards OCB while LMX-loyalty was found to be insignificant. A moderate 54% of variance in OCB has been explained. This study has provided empirical insights in supporting social exchange theory that quality LMX relationship has the ability to invoke OCB readiness. Due to LG constant interactions with the public, enhancement in dyadic relationship can help in reducing the level of complaints and towards improving the much needed operational efficiency.
H70|Factors Affecting Evaluation Influence in the Public Sector of Cam Lo District, Vietnam|This study seeks to answer what factors may affect evaluation influence in the public sector of Cam Lo District in Vietnam. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to extract factors that may affect evaluation influence. This procedure returned five factors, including involvement of evaluation partners, evaluation capacity, evaluation plans and methods, generation of evaluation report, and dissemination evaluation findings. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to verify whether the measured variables that were written to reflect the identified factors are reliable and valid. Path analysis was then conducted to investigate the relationships between the factors identified and evaluation influence. Survey data collected from 275 staff of in 2015 Cam Lo District highlight that two out of the five factors (i.e., evaluation capacity along with evaluation plans and methods) identified on the basis of the proposed conceptual framework have a statistically significant effect on evaluation influence
H70|Different forms of decentralization and their impact on government performance: Micro-level evidence from 113 countries|This study of the effect of decentralization on government performance differs from the vast literature on the topic in three major ways. First, we compare the effects of four different forms of decentralization, namely, fiscal decentralization, administrative decentralization, federalism, and aggregate decentralization. Second, we study the effect on three dimensions of government performance, namely, tax administration, business licensing and permits, and corruption. Third, the effects are judged in terms of the perceptions of nearly 100,000 business leaders located in 113 countries. Seven statements summarize our findings. First, fiscal and administrative decentralization improve perceptions of government performance. Second, federalism is associated with worse perceptions. Third, the effect of aggregate decentralization is ambiguous. Fourth, service industries tend to perceive decentralization more favorably than others. Fifth, large firms perceive decentralization less favorably than other firms. Sixth, the effect of the same form of decentralization varies in magnitude across the three government activities. Seventh, therefore, decentralization may not be oversold as a policy prescription to improve government performance; the form of decentralization and its contextualization in terms of the targeted area of government activity need careful consideration.
H70|Does the cutoff of “red capital” raise a red flag? Political connections and stock price crash risk|Using a Chinese exogenous regulatory setting that forbids political officials from sitting on boards, we investigate whether disruption to political connections induced by independent director’s forced resignation increases the firm’s stock price crash risk. The results show that firms announcing resignations of politically-connected independent directors after the regulation experience a significant increase in crash risk, suggesting that disruption to political connections intensifies managers’ bad-news hoarding behavior and makes firms more crash-prone. We further find that the negative impact of disrupted political connections on crash risk is less pronounced in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) than that in non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs). Moreover, the association is more salient when the resigned director has a geographic and industrial working background overlapping with the firm’s operation. Our findings are consistent with the notion that heightened resource acquisition pressure caused by disruption to political networks increases stock price crash risk.
H70|Rewards from public office and the selection of politicians by parties|We investigate the relationship between the quality of politicians, defined in terms of their competence (skills), and rewards from public office in a game between parties and citizens in which parties play a crucial role in the selection of politicians. Parties shape the selection of politicians by manipulating information about the quality of their candidates. An increase in the rewards from public offices leads to two opposing effects on the average quality of politicians. The first is a selection effect, whereby more skilled citizens enter politics, leading to an increase in average quality. The second is a manipulation effect, as parties have the incentive to further manipulate information to increase the probability of election for their unskilled candidates, from whom they can extract higher rents in the form of service duties. We find that the second effect dominates when (i) parties’ costs of manipulating information are sufficiently low; (ii) even in the absence of manipulation, the quality of information available to citizens about candidates is sufficiently poor; and (iii) the net gains from becoming a politician for unskilled citizens are sufficiently larger than those for skilled citizens. These findings provide a rationale for the ambiguous sign of the empirical relationship between the quality and pay of politicians.
H70|La spesa sanitaria delle Regioni in Italia - Saniregio2017|Il nuovo rapporto SaniRegio2017 fornisce un'analisi della spesa sanitaria corrente delle singole Regioni italiane. SaniRegio introduce un meccanismo di calcolo del fabbisogno standard basato su di un modello empirico derivato dalla funzione di costo dei servizi sanitari che considera come variabile dipendente la spesa storica corrente di ciascuna Regione e, tra i principali driver del fabbisogno, tiene conto di una pluralità di dimensioni legate al contesto socio-economico dei territori. Il Rapporto mostra come a fronte di una livello globale di spesa inefficiente stimato nel 16,2% della spesa storica, pari a circa 15,4 miliardi di euro, la riduzione di risorse si concentrerebbe maggiormente nelle regioni del sud; prendendo in considerazione anche l'ammontare di risorse sufficiente a colmare l'output-gap negativo, il possibile risparmio globale di spesa si ridurrebbe drasticamente, attestandosi al 2,5% della spesa storica, pari a circa 3 miliardi di euro.
H70|A Situational Theory of Pork-Barrel Politics: The Shifting Logic of Discretionary Allocations in India|Despite the extensive literature on distributive politics, we still lack a theory of how political and fiscal institutions interact to shape the pork-barrelling ability of national leaders in a federal parliamentary democracy. Focusing on party system attributes and governmental incentives attached to different types of discretionary grants, this article examines the extent to which a shift in the priorities and interests of the prime minister's party - effected by the change from a dominant-party system to a multiparty-coalition system - is responsible for the change in the dynamics of distributive policies. I use a rich panel dataset on Indian states to propose a situational theory of distributive politics which states that incentives for exclusive targeting of affiliated states in dominant-party systems drive national ruling parties towards particularism, while the shrinking opportunity to indulge in such a policy in multiparty-coalition systems creates a universalisation effect. Additionally, the disaggregated analysis of discretionary grants brings to the fore the fact that the shift from particularism to universalism occurs for schematic grants, which provide an opportunity for credit-claiming. The ad hoc grants, which are like side payments, remain subject to particularism.
H70|Las finanzas Autonomicas en 2016 y entre 2003 y 2016|En este informe se analiza la evolucion de los ingresos y gastos autonomicos y el saldo presupuestario del sector desde 2003 hasta el presente. En la primera parte del trabajo se presta especial atencion al comportamiento del gasto por habitante a precios constantes. Seguidamente se analizan en cierto detalle las cuentas de los ultimos ejercicios.
H70|El cálculo de las necesidades de gasto regionales: notas para la discusión|En este trabajo se repasa el procedimiento de cálculo de las necesidades de gasto que se utiliza en el sistema de financiación autonómica español y se discuten posibles mejoras del mismo. Los cambios contemplados incluyen ligar las ponderaciones de las variables de reparto al patrón observado de gasto, la inclusión de nuevos indicadores no recogidos en el modelo actual, el desdoblamiento de otros ya existentes y la introducción de correcciones por niveles de precios y de renta. El estudio incluye una propuesta específica para la modificación inmediata de la actual fórmula de reparto y una cuantificación de sus implicaciones.
H70|Decentralization and poverty reduction in Bolivia: Challenges and opportunities|This paper presents an analysis of the decentralization process that has been taking place in Bolivia over the last couple of decades. It starts with a review of the legal framework that determines the distribution of responsibilities and financial resources to the sub-national governments (9 departments and 339 municipalities), and continues with an analysis of the evolution and distribution of financing to these entities between 2001 and 2013. It then proceeds to describe the resulting progress in social indicators between 2001 and 2012 at the municipal level, and identifies the main remaining gaps in basic services by 2012. Finally, the paper offers an analysis of the factors that are most closely associated with progress in the main social indicator used by the Bolivian government – the Unsatisfied Basic Needs index. This provides the basis for a final section on recommendations for public investment in Bolivia.
H70|Önkormányzati Tulajdonú Társaságok Gazdálkodási Paramétereinek Vizsgálata Klaszteranalízissel| Az önkormányzati tulajdonú gazdasági társaságok biztosítják a lakosság számára fontos közszolgáltatások jelentős hányadát, így működésük, gazdálkodásuk minősége a tulajdonos önkormányzatok számára is nagymértékű figyelmet igényel, ezzel egyetemben kockázatok hordozója is lehet. Tanulmányomban a megyei jogú városok, a Főváros és a fővárosi kerületek cégeit vizsgáltam meg 2010-2013 között, likviditás, bonitás, rentabilitás szempontjából. Hipotézisként azt fogalmaztam meg, hogy működési és tőkeszerkezeti jellemzők a vizsgált vállalkozások döntő hányadában megfelelőek voltak. A vizsgálatok során évenként változó számú (183-334 db) vállalatot vizsgáltam meg klaszteranalízis segítségével, a vizsgálatba vont változókat a mérleg és eredménykimutatásból származó mutatókra alapoztam. Tanulmányból képet kaphatunk az önkormányzati cégek gazdálkodásáról, és azok időbeli változásáról. ------------------------------------------------ The government-owned business organizations provide a significant proportion of important public services to the population, thus the quality of their operation and management is important to the owner local governments which at the same time can also pose risks. In my study, I examined county towns, the capital and capital districts between 2010-2013 in terms of liquidity, creditworthiness and profitability. As a hypothesis, I assumed that the characteristic of operating and capital structure were appropriate in most analyzed companies. I examined a changing number of companies annually (184-334 units) using claster analysis, variables used in the study were imported from balance sheets and income statements. From the study, we can get a picture of the operation and temporal changes of local governments.
H70|Control Mechanisms in the Process of Preventing Corruption in Public Administration Offices on the Example of Entities in the Podkarpackie Province|A crucial element of the mechanism to prevent corruption in public administration is the explicit procedure of reacting to corruption events, regardless of whether it is based on ISO procedures or if it results from another system of legal solutions. The statutory anti-corruption solutions introduced in public institutions in the form of management control involve the staff abiding by ethical values, and they serve to improve the transparency, legal conduct, and ethics in the operations of a public administration office. The results of empirical research confirm that the implemented management control procedures form integral parts of the anti-corruption system in public entities.
H70|How well do subnational borrowing regulations work?|There are many positive aspects associated with subnational borrowing, including additional funding and promoting intergenerational equity. However, it may also endanger fiscal sustainability and macro stability due to moral hazard and soft budget constraints, making borrowing controls justified and common. This chapter reviews the different types of ex ante and ex post subnational borrowing regulations used in the international experience based on a large panel of developed and developing countries. Each type of regulation has advantages and disadvantages, with varying suitability to a countryâ€™s circumstances. It is found that the presence of subnational tax autonomy contributes to an increase in the general government primary balance but not significantly for subnational primary balances. A history of subnational bailouts is associated with lower primary balances, on average, at all levels. The â€˜golden ruleâ€™ and limits on debt and borrowing appear effective at all levels of government. However, none of the broad types of subnational borrowing regulations seem to have a distinct significant direct effect on the narrow definition of fiscal sustainability at the subnational level.
H70|Las finanzas autonómicas en 2015 y entre 2003 y 2015|Los saldos presupuestarios de las comunidades autónomas han mejorado sólo muy ligeramente durante 2015 a pesar de la reducción en casi 3.500 millones de euros del gasto en intereses que se ha producido en Contabilidad Nacional como resultado de la mejora de las condiciones financieras del FLA y el Fondo de Proveedores. El estancamiento del déficit autonómico se debe en parte a una debilidad itécnicaÓ de los ingresos del sistema de financiación regional, que se han visto reducidos en unos 2.700 millones como resultado de la inercia de las entregas a cuenta en momentos de cambio de ciclo, y en parte a algunas partidas atípicas de gasto en principio no recurrente por un importe total de 3.600 millones que prácticamente han compensado el ahorro en intereses. Aunque la mejora del déficit habría sido apreciablemente mayor en la ausencia de todos estos atípicos, la situación de las cuentas regionales sigue siendo delicada porque el déficit subyacente duplica el objetivo de estabilidad y porque la mejora de los saldos autonómicos registrada en los últimos ejercicios proviene en buena parte de una reducción de las partidas de inversión hasta niveles históricamente muy bajos que no podrán mantenerse por mucho tiempo sin que comiencen a afectar negativamente a la calidad de los servicios públicos. Aunque la previsible recuperación de los ingresos en los próximos ejercicios debería traducirse en una apreciable mejora de la situación otras cosas iguales, sería aconsejable que las comunidades autónomas continuasen trabajando en la contención de las partidas de gasto corriente, que comienzan a repuntar aún tras descontar los atípicos.
H70|Individual trust: does quality of public services matter?|This paper contributes to the literature on the determinants of social capital by investigating how the quality of local services influences individual’s generalized trust and trust in local government. Using data from the Italian National Statistic Office survey “Aspetti della vita quotidiana”, after building a measure for local services’ quality, we study its effect on individual’s social capital using linear regressions techniques. Our results suggest that good local public services affect positively individual’s social capital, the effect being stronger for trust in local institutions. To deal with possible endogeneity issues, the robustness of our results is tested using two-step GMM estimation, while the procedure proposed by Altonji et al. (2005) is used to study the sensitivity to omitted variables. Finally, the paper extends the analysis to further social capital measures (family ties, network social capital and trust in central government) and to alternative quality measures. We also test the existence of age related differences in the influence of public services’ quality on individual trust measures.
H70|Los gobiernos departamentales y la inversión de regalías en Colombia|Este trabajo describe cómo, a raíz del establecimiento del Sistema General de Regalías (SGR) en 2012, los departamentos colombianos ahora no solo ejecutan más recursos sino que tienen mayor participación en la escogencia de los proyectos que van a financiarse. Además, se analiza la manera en que se han invertido los recursos teniendo en cuenta los costos de oportunidad y las necesidades de los departamentos. El periodo de estudio es 2012-2015. Se pudieron identificar algunas diferencias en el patrón de la inversión al comparar departamentos productores y no productores. Asimismo, al evaluar la correspondencia entre la participación de algunos sectores (como transporte, ciencia y tecnología, educación, vivienda) en el valor de los proyectos aprobados e indicadores, como la cobertura en educación, el número de investigadores y grupos de investigación, el índice de déficit habitacional y el estado de las vías, no se observan altas correlaciones.

H70|The Limits of Career Concerns in Federalism: Evidence from China|Performance-based promotion schemes in administrative hierarchies have limitations. Chinese provincial leaders, despite facing strong career concerns, make different policy decisions depending on their career backgrounds. Provincial party secretaries who have risen from low to high positions within the province they govern (“locals”) spend a higher share of budgetary resources on education and health care and invest less in construction infrastructure than party secretaries who have made their most significant career advancements in other provinces (“outsiders”). Identification comes from variation in central leadership and term limits. As the promotion mechanism rewards infrastructure investments, locals are less likely to be promoted at the end of the term. We explore various mechanisms and provide evidence that the difference between locals and outsiders is not driven by knowledge or experience. Several pieces of evidence suggest that locals cater to low-level provincial elites, who helped them rise to power. Thus, local career trajectories limit the power of career concerns by fostering competing allegiances.

H70|Supermajorities and Political Rent Extraction|Models of political competition portray political candidates as seeking the support of the median voter to win elections by majority voting. In practice, political candidates seek supermajorities rather than majorities based on support of the median voter. We study the political benefits from supermajorities using data from Bavaria, the largest German state. Members of the Bavarian parliament had been permitted to hire relatives as office employees but in the year 2000 the practice was prohibited, with exceptions that allowed continuation of employment of previously hired relatives. The circumstances provide an informative setting to relate political behavior to protection of incumbency. Our results show that the likelihood of politicians to hire relatives increased with the margin of the majority for the incumbent in the previous election. When the majority increased by one percentage point, the likelihood of hiring relatives increased by about one percentage point. Supermajorities thus facilitated political rent extraction.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H70|Trade Liberalization and Environmental Taxation in Federal Systems| The literature on trade liberalization and environment has not yet considered federal structures. In this paper, we show how the design of environmental policy in a federal system has implications for the effects of trade reform. Trade liberalization leads to a decline in pollution taxes, regardless of whether pollution taxes are set at the federal (centralized) or local (decentralized) level, and it increases social welfare. The effect under a decentralized system is smaller than if these taxes are set by the federal government, and pollution emissions therefore decline in this case. Moreover, majority bias interacts with trade liberalization if federal taxes are used.
H70|Reconstruction Multipliers|"Following the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake, financing of reconstruction by the Italian central government resulted in a sharp and unanticipated discontinuity in grants across municipalities that were ex-ante very similar. Using the emergency financing law as an instrument, we identify the causal effect of municipal government spending on local activity, controlling for the negative supply shock from the earthquake. In our estimates, this ""reconstruction multiplier"" is around unity, and we show that the grants provided public insurance. Economic activity contracted in municipalities that did not receive the grants, while it expanded--or at least did not contract--in municipalities that did receive them. Our results suggest several policy implications with respect to the allocation mechanism of such grants."
H70|Determinants of Chinese Government Size: An Extreme Bounds Analysis|This paper studies the factors associated with the size of the public sector as measured by government spending at the level of Chinese provinces using the method of extreme bounds analysis to identify robust correlates with public sector size. We find that almost all traditional “economic” and “social stability” factors are insignificant and not robust to model specification changes. In contrast, “political” factors such as the degree of fiscal decentralization and national transfers to provincial governments tend to be significant and robust. Our findings suggest that repeated government attempts to reduce the relative size of the Chinese government sector have failed because the political factors determining government spending haven’t changed.
H70|Adaptation and Influence: The Schumpeterian Perspective on Business-Politics Relations|This paper introduces Schumpeter’s views on the relationship between business and politics and argues that we can discern a distinct Schumpeterian perspective of business-politics relations. Schumpeter’s views about the pivotal role of entrepreneurs in economic development attracted substantial interest in economic sociology and in political economy. His views about the role of entrepreneurs in politics have so far however hardly been studied. The paper identifies the following four aspects as central to Schumpeter’s perspective of business-politics relations: (a) entrepreneurs and corporations drive economic change, (b) entrepreneurs and corporations are ineffective in defending their political interests and vulnerable to hostile movements, (c) the resulting divergence of the economic and the political impact of entrepreneurs and corporations makes capitalism socio-politically instable, and (d) the relationship of entrepreneurs and corporations to political institutions and public policies is primarily adaptive, rather than causative. The paper proposes a two-dimensional typology of business-politics relations that combines the Schumpeterian focus on adaptation with the Marxian focus on influence. These two dimensions - adaptation and influence - result in four ideal types: business-dominated social compromise, imposed social compromise, business dominance, and political confrontation. Examples from German welfare state history illustrate these four types. The paper suggests that the Schumpeterian and the Marxian perspective, while in contrast to each other, may be complementary and each perspective valid under different socio-political conditions.
H70|Austerity States, Institutional Dismantling and the Governance of Sub-National Economic Development: The Demise of the Regional Development Agencies in England|Contributing to interpretations of the governance geographies of austerity, the paper explains how, why and in what forms austerity states are constructed by actors in particular political-economic contexts and geographical and temporal settings, how and by whom they are articulated and pursued, and how they are worked through public policy and institutional and territorial architectures. Empirically, the focus is explaining the UK Government and its abolition and closure of the Regional Development Agencies in England. First, a more qualitative and plural conception of austerity states is developed to question singular and/or monolithic notions of state types and their transitions, and to better reflect the particularities of how state projects are configured and unfolded by actors within political-economic variegations of capitalism. Second, a more geographically sensitive approach and appreciation of (re)scaling are detailed to incorporate and extend beyond the predominantly national frame and decentralising narratives deployed in current accounts. Last, a historically literate interpretation of institutional dismantling is advanced better to explain the politics and restructuring of institutional landscapes by actors within austerity states.
H70|Regional healthcare decentralization in unitary states: equal spending, equal satisfaction?| Does regional decentralization threaten the commitment to regional equality in government outcomes and outputs? We attempt to shed a light on this question by drawing on unique evidence from the largest European unitary states to have engaged in countrywide health system decentralization: Italy and Spain. We estimate, decompose and run a counterfactual analysis of regional inequality in government output (health expenditure per capita) and outcome (health system satisfaction) during the expansion of healthcare decentralization in both countries. We find no evidence of an increase in regional inequalities in outcomes and outputs in the examined period. Inequalities are accounted for by differences in health system design and management by regional governments.
H70|Taxes in an e-commerce generation|Abstract Rapid growth in e-commerce has altered the ability of jurisdictions to enforce commodity taxes on a destination basis. This results in different effective tax rates depending on the way in which goods and services are purchased and the characteristics of both the products and the sellers. We discuss the arguments for the destination principle as the appropriate place-of-taxation rule for consumption taxation of cross-border trade. We analyze various recent reforms to the value-added tax in the European Union in response to e-commerce. We then examine various policy options in the USA—maintaining the status quo, changing nexus rules, states adopting information reporting, and national reforms that require firms to remit taxes regardless of physical presence—and relate them to the recent European reforms. We conclude based on our analysis and the recent European Union experience that reforms at the national level appear to be the important next step to enforcing commodity taxes at destination in the USA.
H70|Absorbing Shocks: National Rainy-Day Funds and Cross-Country Transfers in a Fiscal Union|In this paper we investigate the interplay between national rainy-day funds and supra-national transfers in a fiscal union. We find that moral hazard leads to lower contributions to a rainy day fund with a fiscal union present, and further that the higher the fiscal transfer, the lower will be the contributions to the rainy-day fund. The optimal size of the fiscal union trades-off the ex-post insurance provided by the union and the moral hazard which reduces national ex-ante preparation for stabilization policies. Optimally, the insurance provided by the fiscal union should be lower (1) the more effective is own-fiscal policy; (2) the more the presence of the fiscal union reduces rainy-day fund savings; (3) the lower is the relative probability of recession; and (4) the lower is the utility gain of redistribution in the union. We also find that commitment to a transfer policy is essential. A fiscal union that is prone to break the rules on transfers negatively impacts the ex-ante contributions to individual members' rainy day funds.
H70|Empirische Studien zu Staatsverschuldung und fiskalischen Transferzahlungen|"Die vorliegende Studie behandelt in fünf eigenständigen Kapiteln Themen zur Staatsverschuldung und zu Finanztransferzahlungen Nach einer Einführung in die Thematik wird in Kapitel 2 untersucht, ob in den amerikanischen Bundesstaaten und in den deutschen Bundesländern nachhaltige Fiskalpolitiken verfolgt wurden. Zur Beurteilung der fiskalischen Nachhaltigkeit spielt die Berücksichtigung von Transferzahlungen eine entscheidende Rolle. Wird der Primärsaldo ohne Transferzahlungen betrachtet, deuten die Ergebnisse nicht darauf hin, dass sich die Regierungen in ihrer Fiskalpolitik nachhaltig verhalten haben. Kapitel 3 untersucht, ob das Wahlverhalten der Gemeinden bei Landtagswahlen in einem deutschen Bundesland die Verteilung von diskretionären Finanzzuweisungen des Landes an die Gemeinden beeinflusst hat. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass Gemeinden mit vielen Unterstützern der Landesregierung mehr diskretionäre Zuweisungen erhalten haben. In Kapitel 4 wird untersucht, ob und wann die deutschen Target-Forderungen im Zeitraum zwischen Januar 1999 und März 2014 ein explosives Verhalten aufwiesen. Kapitel 5 untersucht, ob Wahlmotive in OECD-Ländern „kreative Buchführung"" der Regierungen beeinflusst haben. Kreative Buchführung wird mit Hilfe der sogenannten „Stock-Flow-Adjustments"" – d.h. der Differenz zwischen der Veränderung des Schuldenstandes und dem ausgewiesenen Defizit – gemessen. Regierungen können kreative Buchführung betreiben, um ihre Kreditaufnahme zu verschleiern und Budgetdaten zu schönen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die Stock-Flow-Adjustments vor Wahlen angestiegen sind. In Deutschland wurden große Stock-Flow-Adjustments insbesondere durch die Einrichtung von Extrahaushalten verursacht. Kapitel 6 gibt einen Überblick der staatlichen Extrahaushalte in Deutschland und diskutiert, zu welchen Anlässen Extrahaushalte eingerichtet wurden. Außerdem wird betrachtet, inwieweit die neue deutsche Schuldenbremse die Staatsverschuldung in Extrahaushalten berücksichtigt und welche Gestaltungsmöglichkeiten der Bund und die Länder weiterhin zur Umgehung der erlaubten Kreditaufnahme über Extrahaushalte haben."
H70|Die politischen Kosten von Gebietsreformen|In der Debatte um Gebietsreformen wird zumeist übersehen, dass Fusionen von Gebietskörperschaften mit spürbaren politischen Kosten verbunden sein können. In diesem Beitrag werden die politischen Kos - ten von Gebietsreformen anhand der 2015 in Kraft getretenen Gemeindegebietsreform im österreichischen Bundesland Steiermark erläutert und quantifiziert. Hierbei wird gezeigt, dass eine aus Gemeinde - fusionen resultierende Unzufriedenheit in der Bevölkerung zu einer signifikant geringeren Wahlbeteiligung und einem höheren Stimmanteil für populistische Parteien führen kann. Vor Gebietsreformen sollte der Gesetzgeber daher zunächst immer auch andere, mildere Mittel zur Erreichung möglicher Einspareffekte prüfen.
H70|Beschäftigungseffekte der Exportkreditgarantien der Bundesrepublik Deutschland (Hermesdeckungen)|Die Bundesrepublik Deutschland sichert Exportgeschäfte unter bestimmten Kriterien gegen wirtschaftliche und politische Risiken durch Exportgarantien (Hermesdeckungen) ab. Ein wesentliches Ziel dieses Instrumentes ist die Teilnahme der deutschen Exportindustrie im internationalen Wettbewerb zu stärken und somit zur Schaffung und Erhaltung von Arbeitsplätzen in Deutschland beizutragen. Im Rahmen der vorliegenden Evaluierungsstudie untersucht das ifo Zentrum für Außenwirtschaft, in wieweit Hermesdeckungen Beschäftigungs- und Wertschöpfungseffekte in Deutschland nach sich ziehen und welchen Umfang diese haben. Der Untersuchungsansatz ist empirisch und verwendet moderne Methoden der ökonometrischen Politikevaluierung. Basierend auf aggregierten amtlichen Handelsstatistiken werden die Wirkungen von Hermesdeckungen über verschiedene Länder (unterschiedliche Risiken) herausgearbeitet. Ferner werden mit Hilfe der ifo Konjunkturtest Umfragedaten industrie- und firmenspezifische Wirkungen der Hermesdeckungen untersucht.
H70|Beschäftigungseffekte der Exportkreditgarantien der Bundesrepublik Deutschland »Hermesdeckungen«|In Deutschland werden den Unternehmen Exportkreditgarantien zur Verfügung gestellt, die auch als »Hermesdeckungen« bekannt sind. Im Rahmen einer aktuellen Studie hat das ifo Institut die Beschäftigungseffekte der Hermesdeckungen für die letzten zehn Jahre evaluiert. Die Analyse zeigte, dass Hermesdeckungen insbesondere für Exporte in Zielländer in Anspruch genommen werden, die sich neben hohem Wachstumspotenzial auch durch hohe Risiken auszeichnen. Die exportfördernde Wirkung von Hermesbürgschaften führt auch zu einer höheren Beschäftigung in Deutschland.
H70|Does political uncertainty influence firm owners‘ business perceptions?|Using microdata that serve as the foundation of the ifo Business Climate Index, Germany’s leading business cycle indicator, I examine whether political uncertainty influences how firm owners perceive their present state and future development of business. I use state election months as indicators of times of high political uncertainty. The results show that firm owners are optimistic regarding their expected business development before state elections. After state elections firms change their expectations and expect their business to develop worse. It is conceivable that firm owners are more optimistic prior to state elections because politicians promised individual policies to gratify the firms’ needs during election times. Firms might be disappointed after elections as the promises made during election campaigns by politicians turn out to be empty words.
H70|Incidencia de las reglas fiscales en la sostenibilidad de la deuda pública territorial en Colombia|Este documento aporta evidencia empírica acerca de la incidencia de las reglas fiscales en la sostenibilidad de la deuda pública territorial en Colombia. Mediante la metodología de datos panel, se encontró que el cumplimiento de la Ley 358 de 1997, la dependencia fiscal y la actividad económica influyen de manera positiva en la sostenibilidad de la deuda de las entidades territoriales, medida a través de su capacidad de pago. Entre tanto, el esfuerzo fiscal y los pasivos contingentes inciden de manera negativa. Finalmente, características como la rendición de cuentas, calidad en ejecución de políticas y ciclo político presupuestal, tienen un impacto significativo en la capacidad de pago de la deuda de las entidades territoriales. ***** This paper shows empirical evidence about the effects of fiscal rules on regional public debt sustainability in Colombia. By using panel data methodology, we found that Law 358 of 1997, fiscal dependency and economic activity, all have a positive effect on regional debt sustainability. Meanwhile, fiscal effort and contingent liabilities, impact it negatively. Finally, features such as accountability, quality of implementation of public policies and political budget cycle, all have a significant effect on the capacity to pay sub-national debt.
