R20|Modelling the distribution of mortgage debt|This paper presents an approach to modelling the flow and the stock of mortgage debt, using loan‑level data. Our approach allows us to consider different macroeconomic scenarios for the housing market, lenders’ and borrowers’ behaviour, and different calibrations of macroprudential policy interventions in a consistent way. This, in turn, allows us to take a forward-looking view about potential risks stemming from the distribution of mortgage debt, as well as assess the impact of potential macroprudential policies in a forward‑looking manner.
R20|Nutritional Inequality: The Role of Prices, Income, and Preferences|In the U.S., lower income households have a less healthy consumption basket than higher income ones. This paper studies the drivers of such nutrition inequality. I use longitudinal home-scanner data to estimate a demand system on food products, and measure the contribution of prices, disposable income and preferences to nutrition inequality. Disposable income and preferences have a predominant and quantitatively similar role in explaining consumption basket differences across income groups. Instead, prices have a limited effect. Further, I merge nutritional label information to assess, through a series of counterfactual exercises, the effect of income subsidies on nutrition quality. For example, I show that increasing the budget of a low-income household to the average level of the higher income households (a 45% increase in food expenditures) leads to an increase in protein consumption of approximately 5% and a decrease in sugar consumption of approximately 10%.
R20|The Economics of Parenting|Parenting decisions are among the most consequential choices people make throughout their lives. Starting with the work of pioneers such as Gary Becker, economists have used the toolset of their discipline to understand what parents do and how parents' actions affect their children. In recent years, the literature on parenting within economics has increasingly leveraged findings and concepts from related disciplines that also deal with parent-child interactions. For example, economists have developed models to understand the choice between various parenting styles that were first explored in the developmental psychology literature, and have estimated detailed empirical models of children's accumulation of cognitive and noncognitive skills in response to parental and other inputs. In this paper, we survey the economic literature on parenting and point out promising directions for future research.
R20|Hump-shaped cross-price effects and the extensive margin in cross-border shopping|This paper examines the effect of cross-border shopping on grocery demand in Norway using monthly store*category sales data from Norway's largest grocery chain 2011-2016. The sensitivity of demand to foreign price is hump-shaped and greatest 30-60 minutes' driving distance from the closest foreign store. Combining continuous demand, fixed costs of cross-border shopping and linear transport costs `a la Hotelling we show how this hump-shape can arise through a combination of intensive and extensive margins of cross-border shopping. Our conclusions are further supported by novel survey evidence and cross-border traffic data.
R20|Affordable Housing and City Welfare|Housing affordability has become one of the main policy challenges for the major cities of the world. Two key policy levers are zoning and rent control policies. We build a new dynamic equilibrium asset pricing model to evaluate the implications of such policies for house prices, rents, production and income, residential construction, income and wealth inequality, as well as the spatial distribution of households within the city. We calibrate the model to New York City, incorporating current zoning and rent control systems. Our model suggests large welfare gains from relaxing zoning regulations in Manhattan, and more modest gains from reducing the size of the rent control program. The former policy is progressive and a Pareto improvement, while rent control reform is regressive in nature and hurts the current beneficiaries.
R20|Housing uncertainty and the transition to parenthood among Britainâ€™s â€œGeneration Rentâ€|The literature suggests a positive link between homeownership and transition to parenthood. However, couplesâ€™ preferences to become homeowners before having their first child have been undermined by rising housing uncertainty and housing unaffordability over recent decades. Britain is an archetype example: homeownership rates have fallen markedly among young adults as a result of low wages, precarious employment, reductions in the availability of mortgage credit, and rising house prices, generating a housing crisis. Using longitudinal data from the British Household Panel Survey (1991-2008) and the United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study (2009-2016), and applying multilevel discrete-time event-history techniques on a sample of women aged 18-42, we investigate whether and how the link between housing tenure and first birth has changed over recent decades in Britain. We find that, in comparison to the 1990s, the likelihood of becoming a parent has declined among homeowners in recent years, whereas childbearing rates among private renters have remained stable. Thus owner occupiers and private renters have become more similar in terms of their likelihood of entering parenthood. Overall, our findings question the classical micro-level assumption of a positive link between homeownership and transition to parenthood, at least among Britainâ€™s â€œGeneration Rentâ€ .
R20|Working Paper 01-19 - Future evolution of the car stock in Belgium: CASMO, the new satellite of PLANET|The new Belgian CAr Stock MOdel, which is linked to the national transport demand model PLANET, is structured as follows: (a) The total desired car stock in each future year is a function of the country's population and GDP per capita. (b) The probability that a car is scrapped is modelled as a function of its age and accumulated mileage. The desired car stock is then confronted with the remaining car stock to determine total car purchases. (c) Total sales are allocated to individual emission classes, using the parameter values of a Stated Preference discrete choice model. The model is then calibrated in order to reflect the current market and policy context in Belgium (d) The results are mapped into an inventory that is aggregated according to the EURO emission class. (e) In order to represent that the non-price barriers to electrified cars will decrease over time, we have implemented an alternative approach where the perceived acquisition costs decrease over time. Alternatively, this approach can be used to explore what would be the required decrease in subjective costs to reach a given future market share.

R20|Do Private Household Transfers to the Elderly Respond to Public Pension Benefits? Evidence from Rural China|Aging populations in developing countries have spurred the introduction of public pension programs to preserve the standard of living for the elderly. The often-overlooked mechanism of intergenerational transfers, however, can dampen these intended policy effects, as adult children who make income contributions to their parents could adjust their behavior in response to changes in their parents’ income. Exploiting a unique policy intervention in China, we examine using a difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD) approach how a new pension program impacts inter vivos transfers. We show that pension benefits lower the propensity of adult children to transfer income to elderly parents in the context of a large middle-income country, and we also estimate a small crowd-out effect. Taken together, these estimates fit the pattern of previous research in high-income countries, although our estimates of the crowd-out effect are significantly smaller than previous studies in both middle- and high-income countries.
R20|Do short-term rental platforms affect housing markets? Evidence from Airbnb in Barcelona|In this paper, we assess the impact of the arrival and expansion of Airbnb on housing rents and prices in the city of Barcelona. Examining highly detailed data on rents and both transaction and posted prices, we use several econometric approaches that exploit the exact timing and geography of Airbnb activity in the city. These include i) panel fixed-effects models with neighborhood-specific time trends, ii) an instrumental variable shift-share approach in which tourist amenities predict where Airbnb listings will locate and Google searches predict when listings appear, and iii) event-study designs. For the average neighborhood in terms of Airbnb activity, our preferred results imply that rents have increased by 1.9%, while transaction (posted) prices have increased by 5.3% (3.7%). The estimated impact in neighborhoods with high Airbnb activity is substantial. For neighborhoods in the top decile of Airbnb activity distribution, rents are estimated to have increased by 7%, while increases in transaction (posted) prices are estimated at 19% (14%).
R20|The Spanish housing market: is it fundamentally broken?|This paper aims to investigate the relationship between housing prices and their fundamental determinants using the example of Spain and considering the possibility of structural breaks in the relationship. We find that the cointegrating coefficient estimates are quite unstable and need to be estimated for different subperiods. Specifically we find that the standard fundamentals explain the behaviour of equilibrium house prices well during the boom-bust period. However, only corporate profit or capital income seems to explain the evolution in recent years.
R20|Housing cooperatives are a growing presence in Australiaâ€™s housing system, providing a diversity of housing forms to a variety of household types across the income spectrum, typically serving low- and moderate-income households. International evidence shows that housing cooperatives can provide a range of housing from very low price points through to market rate in both non-urban and urban contexts. The research presented in this report reviewed a selection of international cooperative housing sectors in addition to the Australian context, with the aims of compiling current evidence for the social and financial benefits of housing cooperatives, to develop a framework to assess this in Australia; and to identify preliminary issues regarding the growth and diversification of housing cooperatives in Australia. Australian and international evidence for the benefits of housing cooperatives focuses on seven primary areas; greater levels of social capital, greater housing security and quality, health and wellbeing, skills acquisition, reduced costs, broader economic and development outcomes. Based on the international review, five factors can be seen to help the growth of cooperative housing in addition to supportive policy and/or public funding. Core amongst these are a stable asset base if the State itself is not the developer, access to appropriate finance, and familiarity and acceptance in the market. The growth and diversification of Australiaâ€™s cooperative housing sector requires assessment of its legislative and funding environment. Factors for consideration are: 1. Individual project viability; 2. Access to property title; 3. Appropriate development finance and resident mortgage mechanisms; 4. Policy support; 5. Appropriate regulation|No abstract is available for this item.
R20|Addressing urban sprawl from the complexity sciences|Urban sprawl is nowadays a pervasive topic that is subject of a contentious debate among planners and researchers, who still fail to reach consensual solutions. This paper reviews controversies of the sprawl debate and argues that they owe to a failure of the employed methods to appraise its complexity, especially the notion that urban form emerges from multiple overlapping interactions between households, firms and governmental bodies. To address such issues, this review focuses on recent approaches to study urban spatial dynamics. Firstly, spatial metrics from landscape ecology provide means of quantifying urban sprawl in terms of increasing fragmentation and diversity of land use patches. Secondly, cellular automata and agent-based models suggest that the prevalence of urban sprawl and fragmentation at the urban fringe emerge from negative spatial interaction between residential agents, which seem accentuated as the agent’s preferences become more heterogeneous. Then, the review turns to practical applications that employ such models to spatially inform urban planning and assess future scenarios. A concluding discussion summarizes potential contributions to the debate on urban sprawl as well as some epistemological implications.
R20|Chinese development assistance and household welfare in sub-Saharan Africa|By combining geocoded project-level data on Chinese development assistance with geocoded household-level data from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), we investigate the effect of Chinese project assistance on household welfare in 13 sub-Saharan African countries. We exploit the geographic proximity of household clusters across two different DHS survey waves (before and after the influx of Chinese aid) and use a difference-in-difference design in order to investigate the impact of Chinese aid on households' wealth and education. Our results consistently point to an overall positive effect of Chinese project assistance on household welfare: areas that receive Chinese projects are more likely to be wealthier, stay in school longer, and achieve a higher educational attainment than areas which did not receive such projects. Results are robust to various alternative model specifications.
R20|Did the Eco-Car program change the customer base of HVs?|For the last several decades, governments have implemented various energy conservation measures aimed at reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector. Among these measures, the spread of next-generation vehicles as an immediate policy goal has been particularly emphasized in recent years. By implementing subsidy programs for a limited period of time, governments try to influence the behavior of households that have not previously considered purchasing the products that have desirable properties. However, no literature has yet identified the households that switched from conventional gasoline vehicles to HVs. In this study, we compare the vehicle choice between three sampling periods (before/during/after the Eco-Car rebate program) and examine whether the rebate program changed the customer base of HVs.For the empirical analysis, we use micro-level data from the Japanese National Survey of Family Income and Expenditure (NSFE), which was collected in 2009 and 2014. NSFE collects data on households? socioeconomic characteristics, such as income/expenditure, savings/liabilities, and ownership of durable goods, as well as information related to houses, such as dwelling characteristics and site area. In addition, NSFE also collects vehicle-related information such as the number of vehicles owned, the year of purchase of each vehicle, and the type of vehicle.The empirical results by multinomial logit analysis demonstrate that the likelihood of HV selection increased substantially during the program period and remained at a high level after the program ended. We also find that households with large net wealth purchased HVs during the Eco-Car program period. Finally, we find that households having a higher income used to purchase HVs earlier. However, income has come to play a less important role in the choice between a HV and SGV after the end of the Eco-Car program.
R20|Household location in English cities|This paper is the first to test an amenity-based sorting model for cities in England. We explore household location under both monocentric and polycentric assumptions about city structure. On average, we find no systematic relationship between income and household distance to the city centre. However, there are differences between cities, with a positive income-distance relationship in Birmingham and Leeds, and a negative relationship in Newcastle. Household heterogeneity is also important; for example, on average households with heads who are migrants live 25% closer to the centre than non-migrants. We also find that only the employed (and those above the poverty line) are influenced by the availability of public transport, which is in direct opposition to the US evidence.
R20|Linking neighbors’ fertility. Third births in Norwegian neighborhoods|The aim of this paper is to gain more insight on the drivers behind geographical variations in family sizes by pointing out the role of neighborhoods and neighbors for two-child couples’ transitions to third births. Couples’ decisions about fertility behavior are influenced by their social context where immediate neighborhoods and neighbors may play a significant role. Furthermore, as neighborhoods are important contexts of childrearing, couples may sort geographically based on their fertility preferences. Using detailed geo-data from Norwegian administrative registers to locate couples in flexible ego-centered neighborhoods, this paper introduces a new dimension of spatial fertility variations. Results from regression models show that the family size of neighbors is positively related to each other. That is, the likelihood that two-child couples have a third child increases with the share of families with three or more children in the neighborhood. This relationship remains significant also after controlling for a range of couple characteristics, housing, neighboring women’s educational level and time-constant characteristics of neighborhoods. It is also consistent for various neighborhood definitions which in this study range from the 12 to the 500 nearest neighbors. However, the strength of the association between neighbors’ fertility increases with the number of neighbors, providing evidence that residential sorting is a dominant driver.
R20|Earthquake risk embedded in property prices: Evidence from five Japanese cities|We analyze the impact of short-run and long-run earthquake risk on Japanese property prices. We exploit a rich panel data set of property characteristics, ward attractiveness information, macroeconomic variables, seismic hazard data, and historical earthquake occurrences, supplemented with short-run earthquake probabilities that we generate from a seismic excitation model. We design a hedonic property price model that allows for probability weighting, employ a multivariate error components structure, and develop associated maximum likelihood estimation and variance computation procedures. We find that distorted short-run and long-run earthquake probabilities have a significantly negative impact on property prices. Our approach enables us to identify the total compensation for earthquake risk embedded in property prices and to decompose this into pieces stemming from short-run and long-run risk, and to further decompose this into objective and distorted risk components.
R20|Race and the City|This paper provides the introduction to the special issue on Race and the City in the Journal of Housing Economics in 2018. The paper surveys relevant topics on racial and ethnic discrimination and residential segregation, and provides a more detailed discussion of the specific papers in the special issue. The paper primarily focuses on the literatures on discrimination in housing, on-line markets and policing. In terms of racial segregation, the paper discusses work related to the pattern of residential segregation and the causes and consequences of segregation.
R20|Security Transitions|How do foreign powers disengage from a conflict? We study the recent largescale security transition from international troops to local forces in the context of the ongoing civil conflict in Afghanistan. We construct a new dataset that combines information on this transition process with declassified conflict outcomes and previously unreleased quarterly survey data. Our empirical design leverages the staggered roll-out of the transition onset, together with a novel instrumental variables approach to estimate the impact of the two-phase security transition. We find that the initial security transfer to Afghan forces is marked by a significant, sharp and timely decline in insurgent violence. This effect reverses with the actual physical withdrawal of foreign troops. We argue that this pattern is consistent with a signaling model, in which the insurgents reduce violence strategically to facilitate the foreign military withdrawal. Our findings clarify the destabilizing consequences of withdrawal in one of the costliest conflicts in modern history and yield potentially actionable insights for designing future security transitions.
R20|Who voted for Brexit? Individual and regional data combined|Previous analyses of the 2016 Brexit referendum used region-level data or small samples based on polling data. The former might be subject to ecological fallacy and the latter might suffer from small-sample bias. We use individual-level data on thousands of respondents in Understanding Society, the UK's largest household survey, which includes the EU referendum question. We find that voting Leave is associated with older age, white ethnicity, low educational attainment, infrequent use of smartphones and the internet, receiving benefits, adverse health and low life satisfaction. These results coincide with corresponding patterns at the aggregate level of voting areas. We therefore do not find evidence of ecological fallacy. In addition, we show that prediction accuracy is geographically heterogeneous across UK regions, with strongly pro-Leave and strongly pro-Remain areas easier to predict. We also show that among individuals with similar socio-economic characteristics, Labour supporters are more likely to support Remain while Conservative supporters are more likely to support Leave.
R20|The effect of culture on home-ownership|In this paper, we analyze the role of culture in determining whether, or not, an individual is a homeowner. We use data on first-generation immigrants who arrived in the United States under 6 years old. Following the epidemiological approach, those early-arrival immigrants grew up under the same US laws, markets, and institutions, so any dissimilarity in the proportion of homeowners by country of origin may be interpreted as a consequence of cultural differences. Our estimates indicate that there is a positive and statistically significant relationship between the cultural proxy, that is, the proportion of individuals who are homeowners by country of origin, and the immigrants' choice of home-ownership. Results are maintained after controlling for home-country observable and unobservable characteristics, and are consistent in several subsamples. Neither the differences in the formation of couples (same or different origin) nor the existence (or not) of mortgage financing appear to be driving our findings. Additionally, we present evidence of different mechanisms of transmission of culture (horizontal transmission, respect for elders, and gender roles), which reinforces our results on the cultural effect.
R20|Der Einfluss sozioökonomischer Faktoren auf die Nutzung des digitalen Zugangs zu Finanzdienstleistungen: Risikopotenzial für eine informationelle Kluft in den Geschäftsgebieten der Sparkassen|Bisherige Studien haben den digitalen Zugang zu Finanzdienstleistungen untersucht und gut versorgte sowie unterversorgte Regionen in Deutschland identifiziert. Das Vorhandensein eines hinreichend guten digitalen Zugangs sagt aber nichts darüber aus, ob dieser auch genutzt wird, um damit Finanzdienstleistungen nachzufragen. Dieses Papier stellt die Kunden in den Mittelpunkt und untersucht, welche sozioökonomischen Faktoren Einfluss auf die Nutzung des digitalen Zugangs für die Nachfrage nach Finanzdienstleistungen haben. Als Ergebnis können auch jene Attribute benannt werden, die eine sogenannte informationelle Kluft befördern. Ein regionaler Vergleich ermöglicht schließlich eine Aussage dazu, in welchen Gebieten (hier Geschäftsgebiete der Sparkassen) Deutschlands die Gefahr einer informationellen Kluft besonders groß ist. Es zeigt sich, dass dieses Risiko in ländlichen, dünn besiedelten Gebieten, mit einem hohen Durchschnittsalter der Bevölkerung und in Regionen mit einem relativ geringen durchschnittlichen Ausbildungsgrad vergleichsweise hoch ist. Hier droht insofern ein besonders hohes Risiko, dass Menschen infolge der voranschreitenden Digitalisierung von Bankdienstleistungen abgehängt werden und den Zugang zu grundlegenden Finanzdienstleistungen als Basis gesellschaftlicher Teilhabe verlieren.
R20|Down payment and mortgage rates: evidence from equity loans|We present new evidence that lenders use down payment size to price unobservable borrower risk. We exploit the contractual features of a UK scheme that helps home buyers top up their down payments with equity loans. We find that a 20 percentage point smaller down payment is associated with a 22 basis point higher interest rate at origination, and a higher ex-post default rate. Lenders see down payment as a signal for unobservable risk, but the relative importance of this signal is limited, as it accounts for only 10% of the difference in mortgage rates between loans with 75% and 95% loan to value ratio.
R20|How Large are Road Traffic Externalities in the City? The Highway Tunneling in Maastricht, the Netherlands|Infrastructure projects are increasingly aiming to improve liveability, in particular in urban areas. We analyse a specific case in which an existing highway in an urban area was moved underground in order to improve intercity traffic flows and to reduce traffic externalities. As travel times within the city hardly changed, this allows for a clean identification of the value of traffic externalities. We find that the liveability benefits of such integrated infrastructure are substantial relative to the construction costs. Each halving of distance to the tunneled segment is associated with 3.5% more appreciation in house prices since the start of the project.
R20|Real-Estate Agent Commission Structure and Sales Performance|Do higher real-estate agent fees imply better performance? This study uses a nation-wide dataset of residential real-estate transactions in the Netherlands from 1985 to 2011 to provide evidence against this. Brokers with a flat-fee structure who charge an up-front fee (which is substantially lower than the average fee of traditional brokers) and leave the viewings to the seller sell faster and at - on average - 2.7 percent higher prices. We correct for fixed house- and time effects. We provide additional evidence that the price difference is not due to a seller-selection effect.
R20|Food Deserts and the Causes of Nutritional Inequality|We study the causes of â€œnutritional inequalityâ€ : why the wealthy eat more healthfully than the poor in the United States. Exploiting supermarket entry, household moves to healthier neighborhoods, and purchasing patterns among households with identical local supply, we reject that neighborhood environments contribute meaningfully to nutritional inequality. Using a structural demand model, we find that exposing low-income households to the same products and prices available to high-income households reduces nutritional inequality by only nine percent, while the remaining 91 percent is driven by differences in demand. These findings counter the common notion that policies to reduce supply inequities, such as â€œfood deserts,â€ could play an important role in reducing nutritional inequality. By contrast, the structural results predict that means-tested subsidies for healthy food could eliminate nutritional inequality at a fiscal cost of about 15 percent of the annual budget for the U.S. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
R20|The Geography of Poverty and Nutrition: Food Deserts and Food Choices across the United States|"We study the causes of ""nutritional inequality"": why the wealthy tend to eat more healthfully than the poor in the U.S. Using two event study designs exploiting entry of new supermarkets and households' moves to healthier neighborhoods, we reject that neighborhood environments have economically meaningful effects on healthy eating. Using a structural demand model, we find that exposing low-income households to the same food availability and prices experienced by high-income households would reduce nutritional inequality by only 9%, while the remaining 91% is driven by differences in demand. In turn, these income-related demand differences are partially explained by education, nutrition knowledge, and regional preferences. These findings contrast with discussions of nutritional inequality that emphasize supply-side issues such as food deserts."
R20|The multifaceted relationship between environmental risks and poverty: new insights from Vietnam|Despite complex interlinkages, insights into the multifaceted relationship between environmental risks and poverty can be gained through an analysis of different risks across space, time and scale within a single context using consistent methods. Combining geo-spatial data on eight environmental risks and household survey data from 2010–2014 for the case study of Vietnam, this paper shows: (i) at the district level, the incidence of poverty is higher in high risk areas, (ii) at the household level, poorer households face higher environmental risks, (iii) for some risks the relationship with household-level consumption varies between rural and urban areas, and (iv) environmental risks explain consumption differences between households, but less so changes over time. While altogether these analyses cannot establish a causal relationship between environmental risks and poverty, they do indicate that Vietnam's poor are disproportionally exposed. Given growing pressures due to climate change, addressing such risks should be a focus of poverty reduction efforts.
R20|A Comparison of the Economics Impacts of Conditional and Unconditional Cash Transfers in Egypt|This paper uses a computable general equilibrium model to distinguish between the economy-wide impact of targeting conditional and unconditional cash transfer to Egyptian households following the full removal of subsidies. Analyzing the impact on the middle class whose vulnerability increased during the reform is another addition of this paper that makes an empirical contribution to the literature discussing the effectiveness of cash transfer compared to price subsidies. The STAGE model is calibrated on the Egyptian Social Accounting Matrix 2012/13. The results show that the removal of subsidies will have the largest negative impact on the consumption of middle class. Moreover, Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) maintains the best policy for mitigating the harmful effect of removing subsidies. It has a positive impact on the demand for labor in education and health sectors where the majority of labor is skilled males and semi-skilled females. Similarly, introducing CCT will boost production in health and education sectors.
R20|Hortinlea Baseline Survey Report 2014|This report summarizes major findings from the HORTINLEA survey conducted in 2014 under the framework of HORTINLEA project. The HORTINLEA project is an inter-disciplinary research project addressing food security in East Africa, particularly in Kenya. The project targets to improve the livelihood and nutritional situation of the rural and urban poor. To achieve this, it focuses on production and consumption of horticultural crops, especially of African indigenous vegetables (AIVs). The HORTINLEA survey, conducted in rural, peri-urban and urban areas of Kenya focused on AIV actors along the value chain namely: producers, traders and consumers. The survey was carried out in September and October, 2014 where data was collected at the household, plot and community levels. It was administered using structured questionnaire with Geo-codes where more than 1500 actors were interviewed along the AIV value chain. Various topics were covered in the survey including household composition, education, health, assets, expenditure, credit and saving, agricultural and AIV production, agricultural and AIV marketing, nutrition, shocks and coping strategies. The most widely produced African Indigenous vegetable is African nightshade produced by about 72 procent of respondents followed by cowpeas produced by about 48 procent of respondents. AIVs are traditionally considered as â€œwomenâ€™s cropâ€ where almost 60 procent of the producers stated that women are responsible for producing AIVs and in about 57 procent of the sample women are also responsible for marketing of AIVs. Most of the sampled households sell their AIV produce where African nightshade is the most marketed one. However, most producers do not have contract with the buyer, but rather sell their produce directly to consumers. Most AIV producers sell their produce either at the farm gate or at a stand on weekly markets while less than two percent of respondents sell their AIVs via supermarkets. Even though the AIV value chain has many challenges, it has as well opportunities to improve. First, the link between producers to retailers and consumers could be expanded and formalized so that producers could benefit from marketing of these products. Second, post-harvest handling and transportation system of AIVs should be improved to ensure good quality and timely delivery of AIVs to consumers. Third, processing and value-addition activities could be introduced, which on the one hand improve the quality of the AIV product, while on the other hand create employment opportunity at different segments of the value chain.
R20|Expenditures and food consumption of a patrician family in nineteenth-century Trentino: the Bossi Fedrigotti|This paper aims to analyse the expenditure and consumption of a noble family from Trentino, the Bossi Fedrigotti, in the nineteenth century. The origin and evolution of the family assets are traced from the fifteenth to the nineteenth century as they shifted from transport to trade, from trade to finance, and finally from finance to agriculture. The research is based on the household budgets and investigates the type, composition and variations in expenditures during two benchmark decades, 1835-44 and 1855-64. The relatively small share of expenses for food as compared to leisure, cultural activities, charity and conspicuous consumption reflects the family’s quest for social status and reputation, leading to the obtainment of a noble title in the eighteenth century. The Bossi Fedrigotti represented a pillar in the economic system of Rovereto, which they actively supported through a variety of economic and non-economic actions, helping the city to prosper and advance.
R20|Well-being effects of self-employment: A spatial inquiry|Our paper presents an empirical analysis of entrepreneurial well-being using a large-scale longitudinal household survey from the UK that tracks almost 50,000 individuals across seven waves over the period 2009–2017, as well as a number of exploratory case studies. We contribute to the existing literature by investigating how entrepreneurial well-being varies across locations along the urban-rural continuum, and across wealthy-deprived neighbourhoods. We use a Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM) approach to compare the well-being outcomes of individuals who switch into self-employment from waged employment, and show that entrepreneurial well-being, in the form of job satisfaction, is significantly higher for those living in semi-urban locations, relative to those living in urban and rural locations. We argue that semi-urban locations provide an optimal combination of ease of doing business and quality of life. Our results also show that individuals in wealthy neighbourhoods who switch into self-employment experience higher job satisfaction than otherwise comparable individuals living in materially deprived neighbourhoods, although the latter experience greater levels of life satisfaction following the switch.
R20|Hump-shaped cross-price effects and the extensive margin in cross-border shopping|This paper examines the effect of cross-border shopping on grocery demand in Norway using monthly store×category sales data from Norway’s largest grocery chain 2011-2016. The sensitivity of demand to foreign price is hump-shaped and greatest 30-60 minutes’ driving distance from the closest foreign store. Combining continuous demand, fixed costs of cross-border shopping and linear transport costs `a la Hotelling we show how this hump-shape can arise through a combination of intensive and extensive margins of cross-border shopping. Our conclusions are further supported by novel survey evidence and cross-border traffic data.

The paper surveys relevant topics on racial and ethnic discrimination and residential segregation, and provides a more detailed discussion of the specific papers in the special issue. The paper primarily focuses on the literatures on discrimination in housing, on-line markets and policing. In terms of racial segregation, the paper discusses work related to the pattern of residential segregation and the causes and consequences of segregation.
R20|Foreclosure Spillovers within Broad Neighborhoods|This paper tests for the spillover effects of foreclosure within broad neighborhoods. The best evidence that foreclosures have causal, spillover effects on housing prices and future foreclosures suggest highly localized spillover effects that are modest in magnitude, but these effects could multiply when the density of spillovers is high leading to larger aggregate effects in broader neighborhoods. We test this proposition by developing a proxy for the fraction of housing units/mortgages that are expected to be in negative equity during the crises. This proxy exploits the timing of purchases in each tract during the run up to the crisis, and we show that our source of identification, within tract variation in purchases over time, is not predicted the observed mortgage attributes. Our estimates suggest that 67 percent of the increase in the across tract dispersion in the recording of new foreclosure recordings can be explained by the spillover effects of the contemporaneous stock of foreclosures.
R20|Real estate and land property automated valuations systems: a taxonomy and conceptual model|Purpose - Automated valuation models have been in use at least for the last fifty years in both academia and practice, while a proper definition was coined only in the last decade. Automated valuation models is a very mature topic that has recently reemerged as very important with the rise of digital infrastructure. Therefore, this paper provides needed analysis and synthesis of the accumulated body of knowledge, and proposes a conceptual framework adapted to reemerging trend.Design/methodology/approach - This imply two-sided contribution of this paper, a taxonomy and a conceptual framework. In order to address properly a broad notion of automated valuation models’ use, this paper introduces automated valuation system as a term and its taxonomy based on key facets, properties and measurements. Proposed taxonomy is non-hierarchical because all automated valuation systems have the same importance and each one has these facets. Furthermore, conceptual model represents the relationships between the facets. The conceptual model for automated valuation system is based on the visualized decision support system consisting of decision, end user, interface data and model. Both taxonomy and conceptual model came into being after literature review that included a bit more than one hundred references.Findings - The overview of facets, their properties and their dummy measurement is discussed only with examples that would be sufficient to illustrate their regularities. Examples are selected as the most cited articles for each of the newly introduced automated valuation approaches. As mentioned, all indicated facets are visualized in a conceptual model that is again an adapted version of the most visuals example of a decision support systems.Research limitations/implications – As mentioned, taxonomy and conceptual model are built upon although relatively broad but selective choice on more than one hundred references. Perhaps a systematic literature review process could additional validate the proposed taxonomy and conceptual model.Practical implications - Assuring the credibility of an automated valuation model that is based purely on comparing the predictive accuracy of method ‘a’ versus method ‘b’ has become a common practice. Therefore, discussion of the use of the proposed automated valuation has been push forward. In addition, as a domain of price estimates has been far surpassed any unique discipline, term that is more generic would be appropriate to accommodate future research coming from multitude of disciplines.Originality/value – By knowledge of the authors this is the first paper that develops taxonomy and conceptual model of automated valuation systems.
R20|"Has the Growth in ""Fast Casual"" Mexican Restaurants Impacted Weight Gain?"|The United States is witnessing a boom in fast casual restaurants owing to the recent growth of ethnic restaurants throughout the country. This study examines the effects of proximity to a Mexican restaurant – the dominant type of ethnic fast casual restaurant – on maternal and child health. I match data on the complete residential addresses of all mothers who gave birth in the Miami metropolitan area between 1990 and 2009 to a time series of all establishments (restaurants and stores) selling food and drink. This unique data set allows me to use mother fixed effects and to exploit the variation over time of the food environment to identify the effects on maternal weight gain and childbirth outcomes. The results show that living in proximity to a Mexican restaurant is associated with an 8% lower likelihood of excessive weight gain among US-born mothers. These effects are concentrated in low-income neighborhoods and among members of disadvantaged groups (e.g., low-skilled, young, and African- American individuals). However, the results show no protective effect for foreign-born mothers. Lastly, there is no evidence of significant effects on other maternal outcomes or on various child health metrics at birth.
R20|Accessibility, Equity, and the Journey-to-Work|Inequality in transport provision is an area of growing concern among transport professionals, as it results in low-income individuals travelling at lower speeds while covering smaller distances. Accessibility, the ease of reaching destinations, may hold the key in correcting these inequalities through providing a means to evaluate land use and transport interventions. This article examines the relationship between accessibility and commuting duration for low-income individuals, compared to the general population, in three major Canadian metropolitan regions, Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver using multilevel mixed effects statistical models for car and public transport commuters separately. Accessibility measures are generated for jobs and workers both at the origin (home) and the destination (place of work) to account for the impact of competing labor and firms. Our models show that the impacts of accessibility on commuting duration are present and stronger for low-income individuals than for the general population, and the differences in impact are more visible for public transport commuters. The results suggest that low-income individuals have more to gain (in terms of reduced commute time) from increased accessibility to low-income jobs at the origin and to workers at the destination. Similarly, they also have more to lose from increased accessibility to low-income workers at the origin and to low- income jobs at the destination, which are proxies for increased competition. Policies targeting improvements in accessibility to jobs, especially low-income ones, by car and public transport while managing the presence of competition can serve to bridge the inequality gap that exists in commuting behavior.
R20|Disparity of Access: Variations in Transit Service by Race, Ethnicity, Income, and Auto Availability|This study explores the relationship between transit-based job accessibility and minority races and ethnicities, low- and middle-income households, and carless households at the block group level for the 50 largest by population metropolitan regions in the United States. A log-linear regression model is used to identify inequities in transit-based job accessibility across the US using data collected from the American Community Survey, the Environmental Protection Agency’s Smart Location Database, and the Access Across America database. The intra-metropolitan analyses reveal that accessibility is unevenly distributed across block groups that have different densities of race and levels of income. The differences in accessibility are especially apparent where there are denser pockets with higher percentages of African Americans, Hispanics, low-income households, and zero-car households. The inter-metropolitan analyses show that accessibility is unevenly distributed across metropolitan regions across the US when considering various sociodemographic populations. Different metropolitan regions provide different levels of accessibility for all investigated sociodemographic categories, whether considering racial minorities, levels of income, or car ownership. The results may inform recommendations for equitable transport planning and policy-making.
R20|Link-based Internal and Full Cost Analysis|This paper develops a link-based full cost model, which identifies the key cost components of travel, including both internal and external versions of cost, and gives a link-based cost estimate. The key cost components for travelers are categorized as time cost, emission cost, crash cost, user monetary cost, and infrastructure cost. Selecting the Minneapolis - St. Paul (Twin Cities) Metropolitan region as the study area, the estimates show that the average full cost of travel is $0.68/veh-km, in which the time and user monetary costs account for approximately 85% of the total. Except for the infrastructure cost, highways are more cost-effective than other surface roadways considering all the other cost components, as well as the internal and full costs.
R20|Travel Cost and Dropout from Secondary Schools in Nepal|The study relates the association between travel time to the lower secondary and secondary public schools of Nepal and the dropout grade before leaving secondary school using an ordered logit model. It is shown that as the travel time to the school increases, students are more likely to dropout from the school system in earlier grades. The results from this study will be useful to policymakers, especially from developing countries, as it places transport in the context of education.
R20|The drivers of household indebtedness reconsidered: An empirical evaluation of competing arguments on the macroeconomic determinants of household indebtedness in OECD countries| Household debt is at a record high in most Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries and it played a crucial role in the recent financial crisis. Several arguments on the macroeconomic drivers of household debt have been put forward, and most have been empirically tested, albeit in isolation of each other. This article empirically tests 7 competing hypotheses on the macroeconomic determinants of household indebtedness together in one econometric study. Existing arguments suggest that residential house prices, upward movements in the prices of assets demanded by households, the income share of the top 1%, falling wages, the rolling back of the welfare state, the age structure of the population, and the short-term interest rate drive household indebtedness. We formulate these arguments as hypotheses and test them for a panel of 13 OECD countries over the period 1993–2011 using error correction models. We also investigate whether effects differ in boom and bust phases of the debt and house price cycles. The results show that the most robust macroeconomic determinant of household debt is real residential house prices, and that the phase of the debt and house price cycles plays a role in household debt accumulation.
R20|Do short-term rent platforms affect rents? Evidence from Airbnb in Barcelona|Peer-to-peer platforms such as airbnb have recently entered the market thanks to the development of new technologies and their influence on traditional markets remains still understudied. Similarly, the multiplicity of local regulations adopted by big touristic cities in developed countries shows a lack of consensus both on the consequences and on the role of regulation. However, the actual impact of airbnb’s market entry on rents remains still unknown. I assess the causal impact of the beginning of airbnb’s economic activity on housing rents for the city of Barcelona using a Bartiklike instrumental strategy. Results suggest that airbnb is responsible for a 4% increase in rents.
R20|Does Higher Economic Development Reduce Household Size? Evidence from India|The paper investigates the impact of higher economic development on average household size in India. The analysis finds that increasing income measured by net per capita state domestic product and per capita consumption expenditure has a negative effect on average household size. Variables such as, higher level education, health outcomes, extent of inequality and urbanization has negative effect on the average household size. Lower level of poverty is associated with lower level family size in long run, whereas, infrastructure has a mix effect. Results show that different religious and social groups have an effect on family size in India. Smaller family size faces several problems such as child rearing, depression, separation, anxiety and land distribution dispute. The paper argues that the issue needs to bring into current development policies for changing social structure, land distribution process, and helping for maintaining appropriate balance between work and family which are missing currently.
R20|A Testable Theory of Institutional Change in Authoritarian Regimes|With the guidance of a new institutional framework, the theoretical modelling establishes the necessary and sufficient conditions for institutional change to occur in authoritarian regimes: first, external chocks must be strong, much stronger than in a democratic regime; second, the chocks must be of such a kind that gives rise to factional competition within the ruling group. It predicts that involvement by the ruled group brings about more extensive institutional change than that merely driven by the ruling group. The theory is then applied to explain rural China’s market transition. As institutional change defines pay-off structure, the extent of this change is approximated by the income advantage of cadre households relative to non-cadre households. Econometric tests based on a Chinese rural household panel data of 21 years confirm the theoretical prediction.
R20|Revisiting Heat Energy Consumption Modeling: Household Production Theory Applied to Field Experimental Data|This paper offers new insights on utility-driven heat energy consumption. The research question addressed is whether economic aspects affect short-term, less conscious behavior in the same way as long-term, more conscious behavior. The model proposed is based on Becker’s household production theory and integrates economic, engineering and behavioral elements. Comparative statics enables an interdisciplinary integration of price- and income functions to cover economic influences, the production function to cover technical influences, and the utility-based choice architecture. Based on a functional representation of the theories, a panel data model of heat energy consumption is estimated. The empirical analysis is based on data from 60 adjacent apartments in South-West Germany. We find empirical evidence that the price elasticity of demand is only statistically significant when using yearly aggregated data. This result provides evidence that occupants apparently do not act upon energy price signals when following their daily home heating routine. In less frequent considerations, as e.g. according to their yearly billing cycles, occupants adjust their heat energy consumption with respect to the fuel price influence. Furthermore, in relation to the other influences on heat energy consumption, we find that the price impact is less pronounced than the impact of comfort conditions.
R20|Municipal Utility System of Telegeoprocessing (MUST) conception|The aim of the paper is the presentation of the Municipal Utility System of Telegeoprocessing (MUST) conception. The proposed service/system (MUST) is based on European (EGNSS) Galileo and will be used by citizens (C), local government (G) and local business (B). MUST's aim is to provide universal access to real-time technical infrastructure information in the current location with the use of satellite navigation (Galileo), geospatial data and WxS services with use of Augmented Reality and Smart Cities technologies. The proposed service will increase the digital interaction between citizens and local government (G2C) as well as local government and local business (G2B). In addition, the service will be able to provide information about the attractiveness of particular area, thus providing a valuable source of knowledge about the potential users of urbanized space for local government units. The main technical task is to develop a location-based system (based on Galileo) that will allow real-time identification of users/citizens, real estate (plots), technical infrastructure, and at the same time respond to plans for the deployment of new, EGNSS signal. The innovative and functional result of this project will be the mobile MUST service, which eliminates the biggest barriers to the use of e-government platforms and provides unique information on the cost of connecting to the infrastructure within a planned investment.

R20|The Smart City Block: another level of intervention|Increasing the rate of renovation for the existing building stock is a crucial challenge for EU’s energy policy. The Smart City Block (SCB) project proposes an innovative answer to this challenge. The underlying hypothesis is that introducing a collective dimension to renovation could result in increasing rates of renovation while also impacting positively the efficiency of the renovation and the social ties within urban areas. The collective dimension considered is the city block in Brussels. The first part of this paper describes the theoretical part of the project that was necessary to develop an adapted methodology. It describes the SCB offering, Brussels segmentation and some results of surveys. The SCB offering shows that many different options can be proposed to the city block dwellers, ranging from a collective insulation, efficient heating systems and shared photovoltaics to collective kitchen garden in the inner space of the block, shared vehicles or shared spaces. This is especially relevant for Brussels where city blocks often have an inner space that could be used. Besides, the segmentation of Brussels based on city block characteristics offers a typology that can be further used to target specific environmental or social deficit. However, the collective dimension introduced in the project is challenging for western individualistic minds. In order to evaluate the acceptance of households, a survey was conducted on 4 city blocks in Brussels, representing over 450 households. It shows a clear willingness to investigate the concept further but only if concrete proposals with estimations of energy and financial savings are provided. Sharing space, equipment and activities was more positively accepted than what we initially expected. Although the attitude-behaviour gap must not be underestimated, this opening can be viewed as an evolution of lifestyles in some segments of the population. Governance and institutional arrangements are expected to play a critical role in supporting this evolution. The second part of the paper relates to the practical part of the research. Our selection process aimed at locating two types of city blocks: a “fuel poor” city block - where the inhabitants face comfort and energy cost difficulties – and a so-called “early adopter” city block – where inhabitants have a positive attitude for the SCB concept. In the “early adopter” city block, located in Uccle, brainstorming meetings and coelaboration meetings were held as to elaborate an SCB model, with the inhabitants and in accordance with their aspirations and needs. Different solutions, including district heating, shared photovoltaics, shared vehicles and collective insulation were modelled both technically and economically. Financing solutions were also proposed. In the “fuel poor” city block, located in Saint-Josse, we conducted a survey on the needs of inhabitants, commercial activities and owners (occupants or landlords). The need for increased energy efficiency is clearly expressed but we also identified the important barriers related to the ownership structure of the block. Prior to the conclusions and proposal for further research on this topic, a section is dedicated to a discussion on the methodology and the hypotheses used during this research.

R20|Insight from a Time-Varying VAR Model with Stochastic Volatility of the French Housing and Credit Markets|Through a time-varying VAR model with drifting parameters and stochastic volatilities (Cogley and Sargent, 2005, Primiceri, 2005), we explore nonlinearities on the French housing and credit markets, which give rich insights on the persistent bubble of the 2000s. While the price increase took place during a period of low shock variance, shock persistence increased during this period, as well as the elasticity relative to demography and income. Low reactivity of the housing stock to housing prices may create construction bottlenecks and explain these nonlinearities. However, even though our framework is very flexible, part of the price increase remains unexplained.
R20|A tiger by the tail: estimating the UK mortgage market vulnerabilities from loan-level data|Following the global financial crisis, macroprudential regulators in a number of countries took actions to mitigate risks arising from stressed mortgage markets to financial and economic stability. Having disaggregated information on the stock of mortgages allows policymakers to analyse particular cohorts of the market that may be more vulnerable to stress, and model how these cohorts may evolve in the future and might affect the outlook for financial and economic stability. To this end, we produce the first ever estimate of the current stock of all regulated UK mortgages at the level of individual loans using data from the flow of new mortgages. We use loan-level information of 14 million UK mortgages at the point each loan was originated or re-mortgaged. Using a series of algorithms from Computer Science, we identify individual loans in the flow of lending that are likely to be still in the stock at different points in time. Then we estimate how key characteristics of mortgages (including borrower incomes, house prices and outstanding loan amounts) are likely to have evolved over time since origination. We validate our overall model by comparing key variables to information available from other sources that provide partial characteristics of the stock, including household surveys and regulatory returns. Our stock estimate suggests that there may have been more vulnerable borrowers in recent years than household surveys suggest. Finally, we illustrate the type of cohort analysis that can be done using the loan-level estimate.
R20|The Effects of Household Debt on Consumption and Economic Growth (in Korean)|This paper discusses the effects of household debt in the aspects of 'flow effect' arising in the course of changes in household debt size and 'stock effect' occuring due to the level of household loans, and then, empirically analyzes the effects using the Korean time series data and the OECD panel data. The result of empirical estimation with GMM reveals that the flow effect of household debt facilitates consumption and economic growth while the stock effect hinders them. It is also found that the contribution of the flow effect on raising consumption and economic growth has decreased since 2000, however the contribution of the stock effect on impeding consumption and economic growth has expanded. The coefficients of flow effect and stock effect may change over time. Since the global financial crisis, the coefficient of flow effect has been scaled down, mainly because of the expansion of household mortgage loans that brought about a reduction in the share of household borrowing for consumption. The coefficient of stock effect has also decreased in size as the burden of household loan repayment was mitigated due to a fall in interest rates on household loans.
R20|Factors and Risks of Household Over-indebtedness Using a New Measure based on Conditional Quantiles (in Korean)|This paper suggests a new measure of household over-indebtedness based on the concept of conditional quantiles, and use the measure to examine the factors and the risks of the over-indebtedness. We first consider a distribution of household debt conditional on the overall payment ability, and specify the over-indebted household as the one whose debt exceeds Î¸-quantile of the conditional distribution. The overall payment ability is set to cover a variety of factors such as disposable income, assets, expected income, and consumption backgrounds. Î¸-quantile is estimated using Chernozhukov and Hong (2002)'s three step estimator for censored quantile regression. The empirical analysis shows a clear evidence of heterogeneous behavior of the over-indebted households compared to the others. We find that over-indebted households' income and real estate elasticities of debt are significantly higher and their debt/income ratio has increased faster in recent periods of low interest rates. Simulation study shows that these distinctive properties cause over-indebted households facing far greater default risks under macroeconomic shocks such as interest rate hikes and house price drops. We also find that lower-income and elderly-headed households' over-indebtedness problem is more serious in that they have significantly higher debt/income ratio compared to the other age and income groups.

R20|The Paradox of the Joneses: Superstar Houses and Mortgage Frenzy in Suburban America|Despite a major upscaling of suburban houses over the last decades, house satisfaction has remained steady in the United States. I show that upward comparison in size can explain this paradox, as top housing size mirrored the U-shaped pattern of top income inequality. Combining data from the American Housing Survey from 1984 to 2009 with an original dataset of three millions suburban houses built between 1920 and 2009, I find that suburban owners who experienced a relative downscaling of their home due to the building of bigger units in their suburb record lower satisfaction and house values. These homeowners are more likely to upscale and subscribe to new loans. Results are robust to household fixed effects and concentrated in counties with lower segregation, suggesting a causal link between inequality and mortgage debt. In the absence of keeping up with the Joneses, I estimate the mortgage debt to income ratio would have been 25 percentage points lower at the eve of the 2008 financial crisis.
R20|Tall Buildings and Land Values: Height and Construction Cost Elasticities in Chicago, 1870-2010|Cities around the world are experiencing unprecedented vertical growth. Yet, the economics of skyscrapers remain empirically understudied. This paper analyzes the determinants of the urban height profile by combining a micro-geographic data set on tall buildings with a unique panel of land prices covering 140 years. We provide novel esti-mates of the land price elasticity of height, the height elasticity of construction cost, and the elasticity of substitution between land and capital for tall buildings. In line with improvements in construction technology, the land price elasticity of height increased substantially over time, rationalizing a trend to ever taller buildings. The land price elasticity of height is larger for commercial than for residential buildings, suggesting that the typical segregation of land uses within cities is not exclusively shaped by the demand side, but also by the supply side.
R20|Out-of-town Home Buyers and City Welfare|The major cities of the world have attracted a flurry of interest from out-of-town (OOT) home buyers. Such capital inflows in local real estate have implications for affordability through their effects on prices and rents, but also for construction, local labor markets, the spatial distribution of residents, and ultimately economic welfare. We develop a spatial equilibrium model of a city that features heterogeneous households that make optimal decisions on consumption, savings, labor supply, tenure status, and location. The model generates realistic wealth accumulation and home ownership patterns over the life-cycle and in the cross-section. An inflow of OOT real estate buyers pushes up prices, rents, and wages. It increases the concentration of young, high-productivity, and wealthy households in the city center (gentrification). When OOT investors buy 10% of the housing stock, city welfare goes down by 0.3% of permanent consumption levels. The average renter suffers a large welfare loss while the average owner gains modestly. We adapt the model to the New York metro area, obtain detailed data on OOT purchases, and find that the observed increase in OOT purchases is associated with a 0.1% welfare loss.

R20|Credit, House Prices and the Macroeconomy in Cyprus|This paper examines the existence of a link between house prices, credit and macroeconomic conditions in Cyprus, using a vector error correction model (VECM) and quarterly data from 2005Q4 to 2016Q4. Overall, the results suggest that a link exists and that house prices have a bi-directional relationship with loans and the unemployment rate. Macroeconomic conditions matter for the Cyprus economy as an unexpected shock in unemployment is found to have a persistent impact on all the variables in the model. The interest rate is also found to have an effect on wages and house prices.
R20|Bank-specific shocks and house price growth in the U.S|This paper investigates the link between mortgage supply shocks at the banklevel and regional house price growth in the U.S. using micro-level data on mortgage markets from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act for the 1990-2014 period. Our results suggest that bank-specific mortgage supply shocks indeed affect house price growth at the regional level. The larger the idiosyncratic shocks to newly issued mortgages, the stronger is house price growth. We show that the positive link between idiosyncratic mortgage shocks and regional house price growth is very robust and economically meaningful, however not very persistent since it fades out after two years.
R20|How does working in a finance profession affect mortgage delinquency?|This paper uses a dataset from a leading American subprime lender, which contains detailed information on borrower and loan characteristics. We find that financial professionals are less likely to become delinquent. This effect cannot be explained by borrower characteristics, such as income, education, loan terms, property characteristics, geographic effects, or strategic default. We also find variation in the effect of working in a financial profession across borrowers of different ages and income levels. We discuss explanations for these results.
R20|Does the presence of wind turbines have negative externalities for people in their surroundings? Evidence from well-being data|Throughout the world, governments foster the deployment of wind power to mitigate negative externalities of conventional electricity generation, notably CO2 emissions. Wind turbines, however, are not free of externalities themselves, particularly interference with landscape aesthetics. We quantify these negative externalities using the life satisfaction approach. To this end, we combine household data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) with a novel panel dataset on over 20,000 installations. Based on geographical coordinates and construction dates, we establish causality in a difference-in-differences design. Matching techniques drawing on exogenous weather data and geographical locations of residence ensure common trend behaviour. We show that the construction of wind turbines close to households exerts significant negative external effects on residential well-being, although they seem both spatially and temporally limited, being restricted to about 4000m around households and decaying after five years at the latest. Robustness checks, including view shed analyses based on digital terrain models and placebo regressions, confirm our results.
R20|Legacies of homeownership: Housing wealth and bequests|This paper examines the effect of housing price shocks during the recent housing boom and bust on the bequest behavior of older homeowners. Prior studies find that illiquid assets have a strong expected influence on bequests, which suggests volatile housing markets will alter household bequest expectations, particularly since housing is generally the largest share of household wealth. I calculate shocks to housing wealth as the deviation in values from their growth trend over the last three years, and I exploit the geographic variation in housing market volatility to explore the relationship between housing value shocks and bequest expectations over the housing boom and bust. I find that housing price shocks, and especially negative shocks, have a consistent influence on bequest expectations for homeowners, particularly for older homeowners, and for those without stocks. A complementary analysis of elasticities also reveals a larger influence of housing values on bequests than other forms of wealth.
R20|Externalities of public housing: The effect of public housing demolitions on local crime|This paper evaluates the potential for negative externalities from public housing by examining crime rates before and after demolition of public housing projects in Chicago between 1995 and 2010. Using data on block-level crimes by type of crime merged to detailed geographic data on individual public housing demolitions, I find evidence that Chicago's public housing imposed significant externalities on the surrounding neighborhood. Using a difference in difference approach comparing neighborhoods around public housing projects to nearby neighborhoods I find that crime decreases by 8.8% after a demolition. This decrease is concentrated in violent crime. I use an event study to show that the decrease occurs at the approximate date of the eviction of the residents and persists for at least 5 years after the demolition. Neighborhoods with large demolitions and demolitions of public housing that had been poorly maintained display the largest crime decreases.

R20|Measuring Mortgage Credit Availability : A Frontier Estimation Approach|"We construct a new measure of mortgage credit availability that describes the maximum amount obtainable by a borrower of given characteristics. We estimate this ""loan frontier"" using mortgage originations data from 2001 to 2014 and show that it reflects a binding borrowing constraint. Our estimates reveal that the expansion of mortgage credit during the housing boom was substantial for all borrowers, not only for low-score or low-income borrowers. The contraction was most pronounced for low-score borrowers. Using variation in the frontier across metropolitan areas over time, we show that borrowing constraints played an important role in the recent housing cycle."
R20|Female empowerment, cultural effects and savings: Empirical evidence from India|This paper looks at household consumption and financial decisions made in a matrilineal society where women are by culture the financial household managers. This culture was strongly altered by the British in the mid-19th century in particular through christian missionaries who proclaimed that the role of the household manager is ascribed to men and not to women. Using two different datasets, our results show that female empowerment is stronger and individuals keep following the traditional matrilineal Khasi rules the further they live away from the former British base. Instrumental variable estimates exploiting differences in distance to the former British base in Cherrapunji, suggest that households where women are empowered, spend more on welfare enhancing goods such as education and nutrition, but are less likely to have savings left at the end of the month, and that these effects are causal.
R20|One cow per poor family: effects on consumption and crop production in Rwanda|A random sample of households in Rwanda are used to estimate the effects of the one cow policy on consumption and crop production during 2010-2014. A first-differenced model that takes into account the selection bias and placement effect associated with the policy and heterogeneity across households is estimated. Findings show a positive effect of receiving a cow on crop production, indicating that fertilizers provided by the cattle has enabled households to increase their agricultural production. Findings also point to the importance of knowledge and experience of rearing livestock for the outcome on consumption to realize.
R20|Real-Estate Agent Commission Structure and Sales Performance|Do higher real-estate agent fees imply better performance? This study uses a nation-wide data set of residential real-estate transactions in the Netherlands from 1985 to 2011 to provide evidence against this. Brokers with a flat-fee structure who charge an up-front fee (which is substantially lower than the average fee of traditional brokers) and leave the viewings to the seller sell faster and at - on average - 2.7 percent higher prices. We correct for fixed house- and time effects. We provide additional evidence that the price dfference is not due to a seller-selection effect.
R20|Manufacturing Decline and House Price Volatility|Using a unique dataset of all Swedish housing transactions over the 2009-2017 period, we find that an increase in manufacturing's share of employment is positively associated with house price growth volatility and negatively associated with risk-adjusted housing returns. Both effects appear to be related to manufacturing's impact on firm concentration and employment volatility. Moreover, as we demonstrate in an application, our results have implications for portfolio choice. They also suggest that the manufacturing decline since 1970 could account for a 32% reduction in house price volatility in Sweden, and similar reductions in the U.S., U.K., and Japan.
R20|The Geography of Consumption|This paper examines the interaction between consumers’ willingness to travel and producers’ choices for a broad range of industries that supply final consumption and account for a large fraction of employment in the United States. Using detailed credit card data, we present evidence that consumers actively manage the spatial dimension of their purchases. Further, the data exhibit considerable variation in expenditure gravity across sectors. We develop a simple theory of how a sector characteristic, the durability/storability of the sector’s output, affects consumer and producer behavior. We present empirical evidence that durability/storability appears to influence local employment, producer density, and establishment size differentially across sectors in U.S. counties. Our results have implications for a broad range of issues, including the consequences of local shocks, the impact of place-based policies, and the geographic market definition in the assessment of horizontal mergers.
R20|Financial Hardship and Saving Behaviour: Bayesian Analysis of British Panel Data|We explore whether a protective role for savings against future financial hardship exists using household level panel data. We jointly model the incidence and extent of financial problems, as well as the likelihood of having secured debt and the amount of monthly secured debt repayments, allowing for dynamics and interdependence in both of the two-part outcomes. A two-part process is important given the considerable inflation at zero when analysing financial problems. The model is estimated using a flexible Bayesian approach with correlated random effects and the findings suggest that: (i) saving on a regular basis mitigates both the likelihood of experiencing, as well as the number of, future financial problems; (ii) state dependence in financial problems exists; (iii) interdependence exists between financial problems and secured debt, specifically higher levels of mortgage debt are associated with an increased probability of experiencing financial hardship.
R20|Investigating the Macroeconomic Determinants of Hosehold Debt in South Africa|Following the 2007 global financial crisis, the understanding of the relationship between debt and other economic indicators has become crucial for policymakers worldwide. In this study, we investigated the macroeconomic determinants of household debt for the South African economy using macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth, consumption, interest rates, inflation, housing prices and domestic investments. Our mode of empirical investigation is the quantile regression approach which is applied to quarterly time series data spanning from 2002:q1 to 2016:q4. Our empirical results imply that inflation and consumption are insignificantly related with household debt; GDP growth and house prices are only related with household debt at moderate to high levels of distributions whereas interest rates and investment are related with household debt across all quantile distributions. All-in-all, these empirical findings bear important implications for South African policymakers.
R20|Food Deserts and the Causes of Nutritional Inequality|We study the causes of “nutritional inequality”: why the wealthy eat more healthfully than the poor in the United States. Exploiting supermarket entry, household moves to healthier neighborhoods, and purchasing patterns among households with identical local supply, we reject that neighborhood environments contribute meaningfully to nutritional inequality. Using a structural demand model, we find that exposing low-income households to the same products and prices available to high-income households reduces nutritional inequality by only nine percent, while the remaining 91 percent is driven by differences in demand. These findings counter the common notion that policies to reduce supply inequities, such as “food deserts,” could play an important role in reducing nutritional inequality. By contrast, the structural results predict that means-tested subsidies for healthy food could eliminate nutritional inequality at a fiscal cost of about 15 percent of the annual budget for the U.S. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
R20|Do government transfers reduce poverty in China? Micro evidence from five regions|This paper estimates urban and rural poverty rates across five Chinese province-level administrative regions (Shanghai, Liaoning, Guangdong, Henan and Gansu) using representative household survey data from the China Family Panel Studies survey. The types of government transfer payments that households in poverty received and the ability for such payments to lift them from poverty are also assessed. Consistent with published estimates from China's National Bureau of Statistics, the results highlight substantial disparities in poverty rates between provinces in 2014. Nevertheless, for each province, the poverty rates estimated from the survey data were notably higher than the official figures. Although the problem of rural poverty continues to be a significant focus of Chinese policymakers, the results suggest that the poverty rate was higher in urban than in rural areas in most provinces. This partly owed to the higher cost of living in urban China, which is captured in the poverty lines defined for this analysis. In 2014, the most common types of government transfer received by households in poverty were agricultural subsidies or social assistance - principally the dibao. Regarding the latter, the results suggest some improvement in payment targeting in rural areas between 2012 and 2014, but the majority of dibao recipients in most provinces still had income above the defined poverty line in 2014. Furthermore, across all provinces, the vast majority of households living below the defined poverty line did not receive social assistance at that time.

R20|Estimating Sustainable Development and Social Exclusion in Rural Pakistan|There are various aspects of sustainable development and social exclusion. Sustainable development commonly refers to the processes that meet the needs of individuals or groups without depleting social, political and economic resources. On the other hand, social exclusion refers to individuals or groups being deprived of participation in these processes. There is a vast body of international literature that defines these processes, but very little detailed empirical analysis available on rural Pakistan. This paper presents a situational analysis of sustainable development and social exclusion in rural Pakistan, using the Pakistan Rural Household Survey (Round 2) data1, set to compute the flexible multidimensional social exclusion index. This social exclusion index is based on various domains including material resources, education, health, living standard, financial hardship and food security, economic shocks, personal safety and societal and political participation. Each domain is defined by several indicators. A simple „sum-score‟ technique is used to estimate the depth of social exclusion at the household level. This social exclusion indicator is then aggregated to measure exclusion at the ethnic, regional and provincial level. These decentralized results can be used to formulate policies to help marginalized societies/ communities at the local and regional levels.
R20|Defining aspects concerning the rural household and the sustainable socio-economic development in Romania|Rural development has as main subject the rural space as a system in which the main components (natural resources, people) interfere and have a specific (economic, social, cultural, political, institutional) behaviour. The rural household is the main actor in the rural space, owner of the main (natural, human, economic, cultural) resources, which it uses at its own discretion and whose behavior is very important for the society where it belongs. The need for this study stems from the necessity of the Romanian rural household to get adapted to the new Romanian and European socio-economic development realities. Even though the modernization paradigm has been replaced by the rural development paradigm, the Romanian rural communities and agriculture must continue their modernization process, which had a sinuous evolution rather than a continuous constant evolution as in the case of the developed countries from Europe, taking into consideration the new orientations of the current rural development.
R20|Exploring Spatial Trends in Wealth Inequalities in Punjab, Pakistan|This study examines the disparities in wealth inequality across districts in Punjab, Pakistan. The paper documents Gini coefficients of wealth inequality using disaggregate household data to assess disparities at the district level as well as disaggregated by urban and rural areas for each district. Furthermore, the paper deploys spatial statistical tools to explore the spatial disparities in wealth inequality in Punjab. This study finds the existence of spatial clustering in wealth inequality in districts at aggregate, urban, and rural area levels. The study emphasizes the need to allocate resources for eradication of disparities among regions and districts. Furthermore, policies and decision-making aimed at reducing regional disparities and in enhancing equity are needed. Given the spatial clustering in economic depravity, the remedial policies must be spatially aware and sensitive to spatial interdependencies discovered in this paper
R20|Murshidabad Silk Industry in West Bengal: A Study of its Glorious Past & Present Crisis|Murshidabad is the second largest traditional silk producing district in West Bengal, which bears a golden legacy of producing superlative silk in India since seventeenth century. Kassimbazar was one of the major hubs of silk purchase for the British silk merchants. The industry went into great decline as the Industrial Revolution in West set in. In the post Independence period attempts were made to revive this home-based artisanal industry in India to expand employment and income opportunities in the rural economy. However, during 2002-2012, there was an exodus of more than 23 thousand silk farmers and 10 thousand silk weavers from the industry. This paper delves into issues related with income determinants of the household silk industry in Murshidabad. The primary data analysis exposes that ‘language efficiency’, ‘number of family members’, ‘ownership of bicycle/motorbike and television’, ‘male labour force’ and ‘women autonomy’ are positively influencing the income of the silk producing households, while the significant factors which inversely influences the level of annual income of the silk producing households are ‘age of the household head’, ‘female workers’, ‘cost of production’, ‘male family members’, ‘morbidity of female’ and ‘expenditure autonomy of female in the family’. The government should adopt pro-active measures like subsidizing the cost of silk weavers, revamp the health insurance scheme of the silk manufacturing women and increase the language efficiency to enhance the silk manufacturers’ income earning capacity. The government should also raise the level of sanitation facility of the silk reelers and weavers and communication goods like bicycle, television to be provided.
R20|Out-of-town Home Buyers and City Welfare|The major cities of the world have attracted a flurry of out-of-town (OOT) home buyers. Such capital inflows affect housing affordability, the spatial distribution of residents, construction, labor income, wealth, and ultimately welfare. We develop a spatial equilibrium model of a city with substantial heterogeneity among residents. We calibrate the model to the New York and Vancouver metro areas. The observed increase in OOT purchases is associated with 1.1% (5.0%) higher house prices and a 0.1% (0.34%) welfare loss in New York (Vancouver). Taxing OOT buyers can turn welfare losses into gains when tax revenues finance a local public good.
R20|Leveraging the Benefits of Integrating and Interacting Electric Vehicles and Distributed Energy Resources|In this paper, benefits resulting from the interaction of electric vehicles and photovoltaic generation units are analyzed. In doing so, a bottom-up approach is developed to simulate the driving and charging behavior of electric vehicles. An economic analysis is then performed to determine key findings for households with photovoltaic systems and electric vehicles: First, smart electric vehicle charging concepts may allow households to achieve higher cost-saving potentials by increasing their share of self-consumption by 59% compared to the case of uncontrolled charging. Second, adopting more of a system-oriented perspective, smart electric vehicle charging concepts could react to times of peak load and thereby reduce the average peak-load increase due to electric vehicles to 27%. According to these findings, it may be beneficial for policy makers to encourage peak-load minimizing charging behavior by introducing, e.g., load-sensitive tariff schemes. Technical challenges arising from the peak-load impact of electric vehicles may be regarded as being a coordination problem. Finally, the analysis shows that the potential of electric vehicles to counteract extremes of reverse power lows due to high photovoltaic electricity generation is limited.
R20|What are the Role of Economic Factors in Determining Leaving and Returning to the Parental Home in Europe During the Crisis? Technical Details|This paper intends to provide supplementary material for correlated studies and to present an extended analysis of transition of young adults from their parents’ homes to other living arrangements for a period 2005-2012. It focuses on whether the economic crisis has affected the emancipation model i.e. the pattern of leaving and returning home. The sample is drawn from European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), using the longitudinal structure for the period 2005-2012 for 17 EU countries it has been shown results for both a static and dynamic analysis of living arrangement. Moreover the paper estimates a trivariate probit model to analyse the determinants of leaving (and returning) home considering simultaneously two of the key factors namely employment and partnership. Findings show that parental monetary resources play a crucial role in adulthood transitions. More than in previous recessions, the family plays a protective role allowing their adult children to stay longer at home, i.e. allowing young adults to overcome the economic difficulties faced during the Great Recession. This is true especially in those countries (i.e. Continental countries) where economic independence is highly valued (both by parents and children), and school-to-work transitions tend to be smoother.
R20|Financial Hardship and Saving Behaviour: Bayesian Analysis of British Panel Data|We explore whether a protective role for savings against future financial hardship exists using household level panel data. We jointly model the incidence and extent of financial problems, as well as the likelihood of having secured debt and the amount of monthly secured debt repayments, allowing for dynamics and interdependence in both of the two-part outcomes. A two-part process is important given the considerable inflation at zero when analysing financial problems. The model is estimated using a flexible Bayesian approach with correlated random effects and the findings suggest that: (i) saving on a regular basis mitigates both the likelihood of experiencing, as well as the number of, future financial problems; (ii) state dependence in financial problems exists; (iii) interdependence exists between financial problems and secured debt, specifically higher levels of mortgage debt are associated with an increased probability of experiencing financial hardship.
R20|Recourse and residential mortgages: The case of Nevada|The state of Nevada passed legislation in 2009 that abolished deficiency judgments for purchase mortgage loans made after October 1, 2009, and collateralized by primary single-family homes. In this paper, we study how this change in the law affected equilibrium mortgage lending. Using unique mortgage loan-level application data and a difference-in-differences approach that exploits the qualification criterion, we find that the law change led to a decline in equilibrium loan sizes of about 1 to 2 percent. There exists some evidence that mortgage approval rates also decreased for the affected loan applications. These results suggest that making the deficiency judgment law more default friendly in Nevada generated material cost on borrowers at the time of mortgage origination.
R20|The Impact of Parking Policy on House Prices|Paid parking is the recommended policy tool by economists to deal with excess demand for street parking. However, we know very little about the effects of this policy on residents. This is particularly important in the context that residents have political power and usually vote against paid parking when it is detrimental to residents. Hence, in our analysis, we take into account that residents receive residential parking permits which provides political support for paid parking. We estimate the combined effect of a paid-parking parking policy – i.e. the introduction of paid parking and residential parking permits on residents – by examining its effect on house prices. We focus on Amsterdam and Utrecht using data over a period of 30 years. We do not find any effect of this paid-parking policy on house prices. This finding is consistent with the idea that residents only vote in favor of a local policy when it has no negative impact on their house prices.
R20|Do cultural factors alter the relationship between risk attitudes and economic welfare?|This paper analyzes how cultural factors shape risk attitudes and subsequently alter its relationship with economic welfare. The research sample is comprised by a three wave balanced panel data set of 588 ethnically diverse households collected between 2008 and 2013 in the Central Vietnam. Different ethnic groups are characterized by different languages, customs and beliefs that create the cultural diversity of the sample. Different approaches are used to examine the relationship between risk attitudes and economic welfare in the presence of the cultural diversity. First, a single-equation estimation method using a fixed effects model and a Hausman-Taylor model is employed to examine the unidirectional relationship. Second, a simultaneous equation estimation method using the Three Stage Least Squares model is applied to explore a bidirectional relationship between risk attitudes and economic welfare. Among the ethnic minorities, results indicate a negative association between willingness to take risks and economic welfare at low degree but a positive at the higher degree of risk-taking. For the ethnic majority, a positive and mutual relationship between risk attitudes and economic welfare is indicated. The ethnic majority is economically better-off than their minority counterparts are, whereas the minorities are economically homogenous but strongly diverse in risk attitudes and social factors. This study sheds light on the cultural heterogeneity in the individual risk attitudes as well as in shaping its relationship with economic welfare. Generally, it is suggested to consider sociocultural factors via risk-taking channel in socioeconomic policies that target ethnically or culturally diverse populations. Particularly, that implies a need to encourage the risk-taking strategies among the extremely risk-averse individuals, particularly who belong to the ethnic minorities.
R20|Bank-Specific Shocks and House Price Growth in the U.S|This paper investigates the link between mortgage supply shocks at the banklevel and regional house price growth in the U.S. using micro-level data on mortgage markets from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act for the 1990-2014 period. Our results suggest that bank-specific mortgage supply shocks indeed affect house price growth at the regional level. The larger the idiosyncratic shocks to newly issued mortgages, the stronger is house price growth. We show that the positive link between idiosyncratic mortgage shocks and regional house price growth is very robust and economically meaningful, however not very persistent since it fades out after two years.
R20|Intra-household decision making and long-term welfare effects: New empirical evidence|This paper looks at household consumption and financial decisions made in a matrilineal society where women are by culture the financial household managers. This culture was strongly altered by the British in the mid-19th century. We use the distance to the former base as an instrument for women empowerment. Results show that households that follow the matrilineal Khasi tradition, spend more on education and nutrition, but are less likely to have savings left at the end of the month.
R20|Human capital in cities and suburbs|Abstract Research on talent or human capital generally focuses on the metro level and neglects the relative effects of its distribution between center cities and their surrounding suburbs. This research examines the connection between human capital in urban centers (defined here as principal cities) versus suburbs on the economic performance of US metropolitan areas. The findings indicate that this distribution of human capital has significant connection to metro economic performance, with suburban human capital being more strongly related to performance than human capital in the principal city. This result also varies by metro size.
R20|Economic conditions and the living arrangements of young adults: 1960 to 2011|Abstract The recent economic downturn in the USA has coincided with stories of young men and women choosing to remain at home, or to move back in with their parents since they cannot afford to live independently. This paper first describes changes in parental coresidence over the last half-century, and then assesses the causal link between economic conditions and living arrangements among young adults using data on more than 15 million individuals from 1960 to 2011. Comparing changes in economic conditions across US states to changes in living arrangements, I find that fewer jobs, low wages, and high rental costs all lead to increases in the numbers of men and women living with their parents. The magnitudes of the effects are quite large: for men, I estimate that changes in economic factors alone are large enough to have caused the observed changes in parental coresidence between 1970 and 2011.

R20|Relationship Between Household Food Poverty and Vulnerability to Food Poverty: Evidence from Nigeria|Poverty and vulnerability to poverty are major challenges facing developing countries and have attracted the attention of development economists and policy analysts in recent years. This study examined the relationship between household food poverty and vulnerability to food poverty in Nigeria based on data from Nigeria Living Standard Survey (NLSS) (2004) obtained from the National Bureau of Statistics. A least-cost technique associated with the food-energy-intake approach was used to compute zone-specific food poverty lines based on the food baskets common to each geo-political zone; the Foster–Greer–Thorbecke (FGT) poverty index was used in computing food poverty incidence; the three-step feasible generalised least squares (3FGLS) procedure was used in estimating the magnitude of vulnerability to food poverty; cross tabulation and Pearson’s product moment correlation coefficient were utilised for the purpose of analysing the association between household food poverty and vulnerability to food poverty. The food poverty incidence was 50.23 % while the vulnerability to food poverty incidence was 61.68 % and the vulnerability to food poverty/food poverty ratio was 1.228. The food poor were more vulnerable to food poverty than the non food poor. There was significant positive correlation between food poverty incidence and vulnerability to food poverty incidence even though the correlation was not very strong. Thus, policies and programmes that will optimally reduce food poverty and vulnerability to food poverty should be adopted in Nigeria; these should be targeted more on the food poor. This is a major way to break the yoke of underdevelopment in Nigeria. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2016

R20|Do open borders tempt a saint? Evidence from Schengen on crime rates in German border regions|The abolishment of passport and any other type of border controls at the German-Polish and German-Czech border in December 2007 provoked public concerns that open border would increase cross-border crime. Despite these widespread concerns, there is still little research on whether the public fears were justified. The paper evaluates the extent to which the implementation of the Schengen Agreement in Poland and the Czech Republic in 2007 affected crime rates in German regions bordering these two countries. Effects are identified by regression-adjusted difference-in-difference estimation on matched samples that allows evaluating the Schengen effects in a causal way. Preliminary results show that no significant Schengen effect can be observed for the most common types of criminal offense. This indicates that crime patterns did not change after the implementation of the Schengen Agreement in a statistically significant way. These findings suggest that in contrast to public concerns, border regions have not experienced an increase in crime as a result of Schengen. In light of the current discussion on the future of the Schengen zone and borderless Europe, this is quite an important, indicatory result.
R20|A Consumer and Investment Model of Housing Demand of Iran: Estimation and Policy Implications|This paper presents a study of the housing demand in Iran according to the consumer and investment approach during the period of 1995-2011. The first approach is based on a statistical evaluation of the consumer function, based on system equations, which describes the consumer housing demand as five groups of consumer goods and services. The second approach evaluates the consumer housing demand as a separate investment good, which depends on several factors. Based on the achieved results, the paper makes an analysis of the influence of the different factors on the consumer housing demand.In consumer approach behavior of the consumers of deciles urban households in all over the country has been assessed, through the panel data by using the Linear Expenditure System (LES) with using Seemingly Unrelated Regression Estimation (SURE) housing consumption demand of households are estimated. Result shows that housing market has been support law of demand with negative income elasticity of 0.81. Also the cross-elasticity of all groups are negative which is indicating that these commodities are supplement for the housing good in the consumption household budget. The second approach, capital characteristic of the commodity, investigates the impact of price house, and household income, local gold price, consumer goods price index and housing credits on effective housing demand of Iran in same period. The main result of this approach is that price elasticity of housing is positive.
R20|Housing and credit markets in Italy in times of crisis|We investigate the determinants of Italian house prices and residential investments in a structural model with possible disequilibria in the market for lending to both households and firms in the building sector. Based on a structural approach that takes into account the multifold relationships between demand and supply within the housing and the credit markets, we find that, while house prices react mostly to disposable income and demographic pressures, lending conditions also exert a significant impact. During the recent crises the contribution of declining bank rates to household lending was limited, due to the greater deleveraging needs of Italian banks. Conventional monetary policy has supported house prices, albeit with declining intensity as policy rates have gradually approached the lower bound. At the same time, unconventional monetary policy measures have sustained house prices via their effect on Italian sovereign spreads, which have shrunk by a sizeable amount since they peaked in the period between late 2011 and early 2013. Finally, we find that house price developments stayed in line with the fundamentals, during both the global financial and sovereign debt crisis, with only minor and occasional discrepancies.

Los resultados muestran una relación positiva entre el ingreso y el ahorro de los hogares. Además, se encuentra que la probabilidad de ahorrar aumenta con el nivel educativo, el ingreso, la participación laboral y la tenencia de vivienda del individuo. De otro lado, los resultados indican que la educación, el ingreso y una situación laboral estable aumentan la probabilidad de ahorrar en bancos y fondos de empleados o cooperativas y disminuyen la probabilidad de ahorrar de manera informal.
R20|The Cost of Consumption Smoothing: Less Schooling and less Nutrition|Using novel microdata, we explore lifecycle consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa. We find that households' ability to smooth consumption over the lifecycle is large, particularly, in rural areas. Consumption in old age is sustained by shifting to self-farmed staple food, as opposed to traditional savings mechanisms or food gifts. This smoothing strategy indicates two important costs. The first cost is a loss of human capital as children seem to be diverted away from school and into producing self-farmed food. Second, a diet largely concentrated in staple food (e.g., maize in Malawi) in old age results in a loss of nutritional quality for households headed by the elderly.
R20|Consumption and Expenditure in Sub-Saharan Africa|Using novel micro data we explore the lifecycle profiles of consumption and expenditure in Sub-Saharan Africa. Adult-equivalent expenditure shows a hump over the lifecycle that is twice larger in urban areas than in rural areas. In contrast to expenditure, consumption (measured in caloric intake) remains relatively stable across ages in both rural and urban areas, including in old age. Interestingly, consumption in old age is sustained by the increasing role of self-farmed food over the lifecycle, as opposed to traditional savings mechanisms. The specialization in self-farmed staple food leads to a nutritional loss.
R20|Express delivery to the suburbs. The effects of transportation in Europe’s heterogeneous cities|This paper provides evidence for the causal effect of the highway and railway infrastructure on the suburbanization of population in European cities. We adopt different measures of transportation infrastructure and estimate their joint effects on suburbanization using a two-step panel approach. Our main results suggest that an additional highway ray displaced approximately 4% of the central city population in European cities over a 10-year period, whereas we find no significant effect for the railways on average. However, railways did cause suburbanization those located in Central-North Europe. When employing the full time span covered by our data and accounting for the diversity of European cities, we find a smaller effect of highways on suburbanization during more recent decades and for “cities with history”. Factors such as historical urban amenities, traffic congestion, urban policies etc. appear to provide reasonable explanations for these differences. The findings of this paper are novel and provide valuable insights for European regional and transport policies.
R20|Determinants of Financial Inclusion of Urban Poor in India: An Empirical Analysis|Financial inclusion is crucial for the inclusive and sustainable economic growth of developing countries. Access to financial services to all citizens, particularly to low income and poor people is a key to promote inclusive growth. While rural financial inclusion assumes importance from policy makers and academicians, urban financial inclusion needs urgent attention with rapidly increasing urbanization, unique requirements of urban population and increasing poor and low income population living in urban areas, particularly slum areas. The paper attempts to analyze the nature, characteristics and determinants of financial inclusion in Pune, a large city of India based on a household survey at an identified slum area. Empirical findings of the survey include the socio-economic characteristics and banking behaviour of households Furthermore, the paper identifies the major determinants of the level of financial inclusion using a multiple regression model using socio-economic characteristics of the households. Finally the paper suggests appropriate policies and strategies for enhancing financial inclusion in urban areas through building low cost personalized distribution network, creating asset linked and collateral free credit schemes, leveraging Aadhar (biometric identity card) platform, creating targeted product and service offering, strengthening business correspondent cells, and setting up urban financial inclusion centers.

R20|The greener, the happier? The effect of urban land use on residential well-being|We investigate the effect of urban land use on residential well-being in major German cities, using panel data from the German Socio-Economic Panel and cross-section data from the European Urban Atlas. We reduce concerns about endogeneity by employing fixed-effects (within) estimators, with individual and city of residence fixed effects, while controlling for a rich set of observables. The results show that access to green urban areas, such as gardens and parks, is positively associated with, whereas access to abandoned areas, such as waste or leftover land, is negatively associated with life satisfaction. The effects are strongest for residents who are older, accounting for up to a third of the size of the effect of being unemployed on life satisfaction. We calculate the marginal willingness-to-pay of residents in order to have access to green urban and abandoned areas in their surroundings, as well as the life-satisfaction maximising amounts of them. Finally, we provide a policy case study, while discussing limitations and avenues for future research.

R20|Car ownership and residential parking subsidies: Evidence from Amsterdam|Many cities around the world have introduced paid parking but implicitly subsidize parking for example by providing residential parking permits for street parking. We study the welfare effects of residential parking subsidies through changes in car ownership for Amsterdam. We employ a boundary-discontinuity design that exploits spatial variation in the length of waiting lists for permits and therefore in the size of the parking subsidy. In the city center, the waiting time for a permit is up to four years. Our results indicate that one additional year of waiting for a parking permit reduces car ownership with 2 percentage points corresponding to a price elasticity of car demand of −0.8. We demonstrate that subsidizing residential parking induces a substantial welfare loss. On average, a parking permit induces an annual deadweight loss of €270. Furthermore, we show that the provision of parking permits is an income-regressive policy: rich households are five times more likely than poor households to receive these (implicit) parking subsidies.
R20|Home tenure, stock market participation, and composition of the household portfolio|In this study, we empirically analyze the simultaneous decisions of households to participate in the stock market and/or own their home. A vast literature stream exists on decisions to buy or rent a home, and many contributions report the low participation rate of American households in the US stock market. Numerous authors have also provided evidence that home tenure (modeled as an exogenous variable) affects the share of household portfolios held as stocks. However, the present study is the first to allow decisions on homeownership and stockholding to be simultaneous and endogenous. We use a dynamic bivariate logistic panel data model on the Panel Study of Income Dynamics data from 1999 to 2007, controlling for sample selection bias and time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity. These estimates allow us to simulate the individual paths of homeownership and stockholding status over whole life cycles, according to household characteristics. Ceteris paribus, we show that households acquiring one asset (either home or stocks) acquire the other at an earlier stage in their life cycles, implying that some households become trapped in a no-stockholding, renting position.
R20|The effect of housing wealth on labor force participation: Evidence from China|This paper uses the 2011 China Household Finance Survey data to estimate the effect of changes in housing value on homeowners’ labor force participation. Using the average housing capital gains of other homes in the same community as an instrument for the housing capital gains of a given household, we find that a 100,000 yuan increase in housing value leads to a 1.37 percentage point decrease in female homeowners’ probability of participating in the labor force and a 1.49 percentage point increase in their probability of becoming housewives. We find little effect on men's labor force participation.
R20|Household food security: Perceptions, behavior and nutritional quality of food purchases|Food security is an encompassing concept that includes several dimensions: sufficiency, acceptability, safety, stability and nutritional quality. Lately, diverse studies discuss how much objective and subjective indicators are able to characterize some of the above-mentioned dimensions. This has opened the door to some apparent contradictions between different food security measurements that reflect perception (through specific surveys) and behavior (expenditure data).
R20|Water affordability issues in developed countries – The relevance of micro approaches|In developed countries, water affordability issues are regarded as a non-significant problem. This paper analyses the prevalence of affordability problems at household level and the determinants that might affect their occurrence. From a questionnaire-based survey, Portuguese household level data are used to show that average measures can mask affordability issues for substantial proportions of the low income groups. Findings also indicate that to tackle affordability problems more successfully, special tariff schemes should consider household income, size (large families) and composition (children in poorer households).
R20|Cost-effectiveness analysis of alternative water heater systems operating with unreliable water supplies|This paper reports on a cost-effectiveness analysis of four types of water heating systems operating in a situation where there is an unreliable water supply. These systems are electric water heating, a solar water heating system (SWHS) with electricity back-up, the SWHS with an LPG water heater, and an LPG water heater alone. It is found that in the conditions of North Cyprus, an SWHS with an LPG heater back-up is the most cost-effective, most convenient and most environmentally friendly system. The last two systems all have a cost per m3 of hot water that is approximately 50% of the cost of heating water by electricity. This study finds that in situations where there is a winter or cloudy season, the choice of the source of energy for SWHS׳s back-up during this period is critical for its overall cost-effectiveness. When a pressurized supply of water is available, the cost of heating water is reduced by 20% for the SWHS with LPG back-up and for the heating of water by the LPG heater alone.

Because the reverse mortgage (RM) can fulfill this requirement, it has become increasingly popular among elderly homeowners. Based on the assumption that seniors seek maximum utility, this article presents a theoretical economic model that derives a decision rule for participating in the RM program. The model takes account of the influences of bequest motivation, random death times and stochastic house prices. A critical value for the intensity of house bequest motivation is also derived from our formula for the decision rule. We then use this value to show how the elder's desire to participate in the RM program is influenced by three sets of factors: the elder's personal characteristics and circumstances, the content of the RM contract, and the current economic situation. Elders' desire to participate in the RM program is found to be negatively correlated with the fixed cost of applying for an RM, the RM contract rate, and the cash income from the elder's retirement plan; on the contrary, the desire to participate is positively correlated with the RM principle limit factors, the elder's age at the time of joining the RM program, the elder's time preference, the elder's initial cash wealth, the elder's initial house price, the current interest rate, and the volatility of the house return. These analyses should help RM policy executors and providers understand the RM borrower's decision-making process and how the factors mentioned above influence an elder's desire to apply for an RM.
R20|Key Determinants of Demand, Credit Underwriting, and Performance on Government-Insured Mortgage Loans in Russia|This research analyses the process of lending from Russian state-owned mortgage provider. Two-level lending and insurance of mortgage system lead to substantially higher default rates for insured loans. This means that underwriting incentives for regional operators of government mortgage loans perform poorly. We use loan-level data of issued mortgage by one regional government mortgage provided in order to understand the interdependence between underwriting, choice of contract terms including loan insurance by borrower and loan performance. We found an evidence of a difference in credit risk measures for insured and uninsured loans and interest income.
R20|"""Domografia"": storia dell’evoluzione urbana attraverso gli edifici"|"Il lavoro, di natura esplorativa, propone la ""domografia"", intesa come narrazione (graphia) dell’edificato (domos), in contrapposizione a quella della popolazione (demos) riferita esclusivamente alla popolazione umana. Scopo dell’analisi ""domografica"", parafrasando la definizione di Colombo (1959), è quello di studiare ""l’insieme degli edifici, [in particolare] del loro ammontare, della loro composizione, del loro sviluppo, dei loro caratteri generali, considerati principalmente da un punto di vista quantitativo [""]. Il riferimento è perciò a indicatori di stato e di movimento dell’insieme degli edifici di un territorio. Il recente Censimento degli edifici, che ha interessato i Comuni con popolazione superiore ai 20.000 abitanti e i capoluoghi di provincia, con l’utilizzo della Rilevazione dei Numeri Civici (RNC) ha introdotto la rilevazione puntuale degli edifici e delle loro caratteristiche. Tale profonda innovazione nell’ambito della statistica ufficiale consente l’applicazione di varie metodologie di analisi territoriale. L’applicazione di tecniche demografiche all’edificato offre una descrizione del paesaggio interessante per capirne l’evoluzione storica e funzionale e nuovi possibilità di analisi nell’ambito della pianificazione territoriale, con un approccio che si può appunto definire ""domografico"". Gli strumenti GIS valorizzano poi i contenuti individuati, oltre a delineare le evoluzioni territoriali intercorse."
R20|Income Mobility and Income Inequality in Rural China|The economic literature has argued for a long time that income mobility could attenuate the degree of cross-sectional inequality by offering people opportunities to improve their socio-economic position. Using the longitudinal data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) from 1989 to 2011, we measure income mobility as the degree to which longer-term incomes are distributed more or less equally than yearly income. Five main results are emphasized. First, there is strong income mobility in rural China that partly offsets yearly income inequality. Second, income mobility has decreased since the 2000s, indicating that income distribution is becoming more rigid. Third, mobility is mainly associated with transitory income fluctuations, particularly in the two tails of the distribution. Fourth, income mobility has an equalizing effect on income distribution. Fifth, we show that non-agricultural income mobility has substantially increased over the period and that its equalizing nature has also recently increased. While the development of the non-agriculture sector in rural China was a crucial factor in explaining the increase in rural inequality until the mid-2000s, we suggest that the large-scale generalisation of such non-agricultural opportunities partly accounts for the decline in rural inequality observed since the mid-2000s.
R20|Household formation over time: Evidence from two cohorts of young adults|This paper examines how various demographic and economic factors impact household formation both within and across cohorts. The results show substantial differences in the share of young adults living with their parents over time. Differences in demographics, housing costs, and business-cycle conditions can explain as much as 70 percent of the difference in household-formation rates across cohorts, a result driven in large part by increased sensitivity of young adults’ household-formation decisions to economic conditions. Changes in parenting styles and shifting social norms likely also play roles.
R20|Mortgage Choice: Interactive Effects of House Price Appreciation and Mortgage Pricing Components|Previous research provides rationales for and evidence of a link between house price appreciation and mortgage choice, with higher appreciation associated with higher take-up rates for adjustable-rate mortgages relative to fixed-rate mortgages. Research also finds mortgage interest rates and their underlying components to be important determinants of mortgage financing choices. In this paper we extend the earlier research and show that house price appreciation can have important interactive effects with those other determinants of mortgage financing choices. The analysis focuses on the period from 2000 to 2007, an episode marked by rapid house price appreciation along with a persistent and notable increase in the use of adjustable-rate mortgage financing, including alternative mortgage products. We find that higher house price appreciation dampened the estimated sensitivity of take-up rates among mortgage financing options to the underlying mortgage pricing components. The results, which are especially robust for fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages that are fully amortized, were not driven solely by observations in markets with especially high rates of house price appreciation. Moreover, after taking into account the interactive effects with mortgage pricing components, house price appreciation is estimated to have had relatively little additional effect on take-up rates among mortgage financing options.
R20|Households’ willingness to pay for access to outdoor recreation: An application of the house price method using spatial quantile regressions|This paper investigates how household demand for access to nature varies across a Danish housing market. I use conditional quantile regressions to estimate the implicit price for a change in nature area conditional on the home price. If there are systematic differences in the willingness to pay for nature across the house price distribution, a conditional mean will systematically under- or over-predict the impact for certain priced homes. In addition, this heterogeneity can be of interest to policy-makers as a potential indicator of the distributional profile associated with a given policy. This study investigates this question by employing both standard spatial econometrics and spatial quantile regressions. I find that nature in the vicinity of the home is perceived as an amenity across the entire market. This result is robust to different spatial controls. What is not robust is the size and the profile of the price premium. There is a large correlation between the income level within a neighborhood and the level of outdoor recreation. Controlling for unobserved quality through fixed effects reveals that the price premium increases with prices, but when controlling for the general price level using the trade price of neighboring homes (a lag), the price premium becomes constant. Controlling for local neighborhood affluence and unobserved quality on a larger scale yields the same results as the spatial lag term but with a more robust model due to the absence of endogeneity. The paper offers a discussion of this discrepancy and relates it to the more general discussion of controlling for spatial dependence.
R20|Discontinuity in Relative Credit Losses: Evidence from Defaults on Government-Insured Residential Mortgages|This paper investigates the distribution of relative credit losses given mortgage default for loans provided by a major government-sponsored creditor in a local area. We use borrower’s individual and loan-level data on residential mortgages originated in the period 2008–2012. Our numerical analysis indicates that mortgages bunching at certain Loan-to-Value ratios (LTV) led to a discontinuity in relative credit loss given mortgage default. Through regression analysis, we demonstrate discrete jumps in the approximated historical credit losses generated by loans with a high LTV ratios and find thresholds allowing the segmentation of loans according their credit risk. In addition, our results suggest that mortgage insurance is a potentially valuable instrument for compensation for expected loss in certain risk segments.
R20|Alternative Approaches to Housing Services and Japanese CPI: -Bias from Nominal Rigidity of Rents-|Despite the significant decrease in housing prices during the collapse of the Japanese bubble in the first half of the 1990s, housing rents hardly changed at all. Why is it that housing rents do not change? Why are housing prices and housing rents not linked? In this paper, in order to address these questions, we conducted an alternative indicators for housing services in CPI. First, we found that the annual proportion of residential units whose rent changed was no more than about 5%. This is extremely low, representing 1/20 of the figure for the U.S. and 1/6 of the figure for Germany. The underlying reason for this high degree of rigidity is the specific circumstances of the Japanese housing market, where opportunities to change rents are inherently limited due to the fact that tenant turnover is low while the duration of rental contracts is two years. Even more important, however, is the fact that rents are not changed even when opportunities to change them arise such as tenant turnover or contract renewals, thereby significantly lowering the probability of rents changing. Based on analysis using the adjustment hazard function technique proposed by Caballero and Engel (2007)[3], we found that whether or not a given unit's rent was adjusted mostly did not depend on how much its current rent diverged from the market conditions. In addition, it has been pointed out that the high depreciation rate characteristic of the Japanese market is a problem. Addressing this problem is extremely important when it comes to estimating housing rent indexes.
R20|Partners in Crime: Schools, Neighborhoods and the Formation of Criminal Networks|Why do crime rates differ greatly across neighborhoods and schools? Comparing youth who were assigned to opposite sides of newly drawn school boundaries, we show that concentrating disadvantaged youth together in the same schools and neighborhoods increases total crime. We then show that these youth are more likely to be arrested for committing crimes together – to be “partners in crime”. Our results suggest that direct peer interaction is a key mechanism for social multipliers in criminal behavior. As a result, policies that increase residential and school segregation will – all else equal – increase crime through the formation of denser criminal networks.
R20|Towards a national indicator for urban green space provision and environmental inequalities in Germany: Method and findings| Action 5 of the EU 2020 Biodiversity Strategy explicitly mentions that member states will map and assess the state of ecosystems and their services in their national territory by 2014 with the assistance of the Commission. Access to urban green is a key contributor to social and ecological functions in urban environments. However, in Germany - like in many other European countries - a national indicator measuring the provision of urban green on household and individual level is missing. This study develops a national indicator for urban green space provision and environmental inequalities in Germany on household and individual level. We investigate the provision of urban green by merging geo-coded household data from the German Socio- Economic Panel (GSOEP) and census population data with geo-coded data on land use from the European Urban Atlas (EUA) for German major cities with more than 100.000 inhabitants. Based on open green space standards applied in European urban city planning we de ne two variables measuring access to green: First, we estimate the distance to urban green measured as the Euclidean distance between the household and the nearest green-site in meters. Secondly, we calculate the coverage of urban green space around the households in square meters. Results of the distance analysis based on GSOEP data show a mean and median distance to public green space of 229:1m and 190:5m, respectively. The results further indicate that 93% of the German households have access to green space within a 500m and 74.1% within a 300m bu er around their location. The average green space provision in German major cities adds up to 8:1m2 per capita (median). Moreover, statistical analysis of the socio-economic background of the households shows di erences in urban green provision related to income, education, employment status, migration background and nationality. We also identify di erences in green space provision on the city level ranging from 10:6ha (city of Frankfurt/Oder) to 1:2ha (city of Schwerin) green space within 500m around the household. Distances to the nearest urban green also vary between cities ranging from 99m (city of Frankfurt/Oder) to 349m (city of Schwerin). The coverage of green space per capita ranges from 36m2 (city of Bergisch Gladbach) to 2:5m2 (city of Schwerin). We also provide a ranking of German major cities based on the green space provision on city level. The analysis further shows an unequal distribution of green within cities. The ndings provide helpful information for policy and planning to ensure an adequate green space provision and to eliminate related environmental inequalities in Germany.
R20|Housing equity, saving and debt dynamics over the Great Recession| This paper uses the large and heterogeneous house price shocks in Denmark from 2006-2009 to provide new evidence on the contested determinants of the correlation between house prices and saving. Crucially, to compare the savings behaviour of home-owners who experienced di fferent house price shocks but similar shocks to income expectations, we exploit the structure of the wage setting process in the Danish public sector. We fi nd strong evidence of a causal link between changes in house prices and saving for young and old home-owners, both through a direct wealth eff ect and through housing equity serving as collateral or precautionary wealth.
R20|The Determinants of Subprime Mortgage Performance Following a Loan Modification|We examine the evolution of mortgage modification terms obtained by distressed subprime borrowers during the recent housing crisis and the effect of the various types of modifications on the subsequent loan performance. Using the CoreLogic Loan Performance dataset that contains detailed loan level information on mortgages, modification terms, second liens, and home values, we estimate a discrete time proportional hazard model with competing risks to examine the determinants of post-modification mortgage outcomes. We find that principal reductions are particularly effective at improving loan outcomes, as high loan-to-value ratios are the single greatest contributor to re-default and foreclosure. However, any modification that reduces total payment and interest (P&I) reduces the likelihood of subsequent re-default and foreclosure. Modifications that increase the loan principal—primarily through capitalized interest and fees—are more likely to fail, even while controlling for changes in P&I.

R20|Analysing the Effect of Remittances on Rural Household in Pakistan|Rural households are more vulnerable to uncertain situations, for these uncertainty they diversify not only their resources but their income. Income receive to households is in three formats i.e. labour income, internal remittance income and external remittance income. Rural households invest for uncertain situation in future, rural households invest in assets in good time and this investment help them to tackle future uncertainty. Current paper investigates by using the data of PSLM that how remittances effect accumulation of assets, because remittances are utilise as transitory income. Results also explains that external remittances significantly affect the assets accumulation of rural households.
R20|Complex Factors Behind Misguided Policies in Socioeconomics: From Mass Migration and Persistent Alienation to Rampant Crime and Economic Malaise|In a complex and chaotic world, people often gloss over the facts and jump to conclusions. Unfortunately, the hasty approach usually yields deficient and even harmful results. The domains affected range from migration and poverty to alienation and crime. According to the Myth of Boon, for instance, immigrants always benefit the host society. In this light, many people envisage the great migrations of the 19th century from Europe to America. However, the United States at that stage was itself a developing country; moreover the Civil War showed that clashing cultures cannot co-exist. Meanwhile the Myth of Multiculturalism asserts that a mashup of mores is always desirable; but the reality is otherwise. When immigrants in their millions pour into sparsely populated districts, they end up replicating the cultures that caused them to flee their homelands in the first place. The upshot is disruptive and distressing for all parties be they newcomers or incumbents. In addition, the Myth of Virtue declares that migrants of all backgrounds are equally upright. Yet comprehensive studies in Sweden have shown that violent crimes can be traced to immigrants at rates which are at least four times those for natives. From another angle, a drove of migrants is a godsend for criminals. For instance, a terrorist ring struck in France in 2015 and again in Belgium the following year. The perpetrators – who grew up in Belgium, France and Sweden – displayed immigrant backgrounds and included part of the cohort that traveled to the Mideast to receive training from militants then returned to Europe by posing as refugees. Since socioeconomic problems are intertwined rather than independent, a piecemeal approach will not fill the bill. Instead, a coherent grasp of the issues and their tie-ups is a prerequisite for devising a wholesome solution.
R20|Poverty in Europe: Sociodemographics, Portfolios and Consumption of Wealth Poor Households|In this paper we describe the portfolio structure of poor households within the euro area using micro-data from the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS), the Luxembourg Wealth Study (LWS) and the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS). Our approach differs from existing ones in that we analyse the (net) wealth-poor instead of the income-poor households. We are able to identify households in the bottom net wealth decile and study their portfolio structure. From a methodological point of view, our study shows that a poverty indicator based on households net wealth needs to be designed and interpreted with great care. Given that wealth accumulates over time and (high income) households can borrow against their future income stream, it is not clear whether low net wealth holdings are really indicative of being poor, for example in the sense of material deprivation or consumption opportunities. Since consumption can be financed from wealth and income, an indicator combining wealth and income may be a solution. We find significant heterogeneity in the portfolios of households in the bottom net wealth decile across countries. The characteristics of the group of households with low wealth are different across countries as well. Real assets are held by fewer less wealthy households than financial assets and almost all wealth-poor households own deposits and sight accounts, but only a few have mortgage debt. Wealth-poor households are, on average, smaller than other households and their heads are younger. Additionally, less wealthy households are not the unemployed households with low education levels. In some countries high educated household heads and full-time employees belong to the wealth-poor. The poor households spend, on average, about 20 percent of their gross income on food.
R20|The impacts of underground petroleum releases on a homeowner's decision to sell: A difference-in-differences approach|Actual and perceived damages from environmental disamenities can disrupt a utility maximizing household's otherwise optimal decision of when to sell their home. This study examines this relatively under-investigated topic with an empirical application to petroleum releases from leaking underground storage tanks, like those commonly found at gas stations. The ubiquity and relative homogeneity of this disamenity facilitates a difference-in-differences methodology. The results reveal that the timing of home sales is impacted by leak and cleanup events at these disamenities; leading to both selling sooner and delaying a sale, depending on the event, presence of the primary exposure pathway, and the quality of the home. The implications of these results are discussed.
R20|Full cost analysis of accessibility|Traditional accessibility evaluation fails to fully capture the travel costs, especially the external costs of travel. This study develops a framework of extending accessibility analysis combining the alternate (internal and external) cost components of travel, time, safety, emission and money, with accessibility analysis, which makes it an efficient evaluation tool for the potential needs of transport planning projects. An illustration of this framework based on a toy network was also built in this paper, which proves the potential of applying the extending accessibility analysis into the network of metropolitan areas.
R20|The Impact of Family Composition on Educational Achievement|Parents preferring sons tend to go on having more children until a boy is born and to concentrate investment in boys for a given number of children (sibsize). Thus, having a brother may affect a childâ€™s education in two ways: an indirect effect by keeping sibsize lower and a direct rivalry effect where sibsize remains constant. We estimate the direct and indirect effects of a next brother on the first childâ€™s education conditional on potential sibsize. We address endogenous sibsize using twins. We find new evidence of sibling rivalry and gender bias that cannot be detected by conventional methods.

Uma análise por meio por meio do Modelo Dinâmico Estocástico de Equilíbrio Geral (DSGE) [How has the Central Bank reacted to shocks (bubbles) in the Brazilian housing prices? An analysis using a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model]|This article aims to analyze the effects of shocks (bubbles) in real estate prices on Brazilian macroeconomic variables (GDP, inflation and interest rate). Two methodological procedures were used: first, the structural parameters of the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model will be obtained through the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). The results of this stage will be used to simulate the effects of shocks in the housing prices on a artificial economy. Subsequently, a Vectors Autoregressive (VAR) model is used in which shocks are identified through signal restriction, based on the results obtained by calibration of the theoretical model. The results showed that the effects of bubbles in the Brazilian housing market positively affected subsequent movements in product and inflation; however, the effect of this shock on these variables was only transitory, instead causing persistent effects only on the interest rate.
R20|Remittances and Asset Accumulation of Household in Pakistan|Assets accumulated by household is important topic, it is investment by household to maximise their utility for present time and for future. It is stock investment which help the household to use these assets in tough time. How income receive to household from three sources i.e. labour income, internal remittances, and external remittances effect assets accumulation of household is the topic for investigation in this paper. This paper analyses the effect of remittances on aggregate household’s assets of Pakistan by using Probit model estimated through maximum likelihood method. Finding of this paper shows that external remittances positively and significantly affect assets accumulation of aggregate household of Pakistan. Results of the paper are closest to theoretical idea that remittances have significantly affect the asset accumulation of household.
R20|Multiple Equilibria in the Urban Spatial Structure: Evidence from the Hanshin Earthquake|Despite the theoretical predictions that multiple equilibria exist in urban spatial structure, there remains a dearth of related empirical literature. This study adopts the 1995 Hanshin earthquake, which devastated the major city of Kobe (Japan), as a natural experiment to investigate the existence of multiple equilibria. Using municipality-level population data for the period of 1988–2011 and synthetic control approach, the analysis reveals that 16 years after the earthquake, the urban spatial structure in quaked areas persistently differs from the pre-quake pattern, although the total population recovered. Because of the seismic damage to Kobe, residents from around it migrated to areas close to Osaka, another major city close to the epicenter but less damaged. The major motivation underlying the migration is the demand for services provided in major cities. This tendency was not reversed even after Kobe was reconstructed, because the equilibrium of population dynamics moved to a new steady state.
R20|Multidimensional Poverty Mapping for Rural Pakistan|This paper estimates and maps the multidimensional poverty for rural Pakistan. It uses micro data from household surveys to construct the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) with human development indicators like education, health, standard of living and wealth. Furthermore, it identifies multiple deprivations at individual level contributions in education, health, standard of living and wealth in the rural multidimensional poverty as overall and district levels. The results show that the 59 percent rural population of Pakistan is poor. The district Thatta, in Sindh, district Dera Ghazi Khan in Punjab and the district Nowshera in the KPK record highest multidimensional poverty index. No district is included from Baluchistan due to unavailability of data. It is expounded that the policy makers can develop the strategies to reduce the rural poverty by enhancing rural education, improving living standards and creating opportunities for income.
R20|Reciprocal Associations between Neighborhood Context and Parent Investments: Selection Effects in Two Longitudinal Samples|The present study addresses the degree to which neighborhood disadvantage and parenting investments are reciprocally linked over time, and the relative degree to which both show indirect effects on child externalizing through each other. Data come from two studies: the first followed families from the childâ€™s birth to age 11 (N= 1,364), the second followed children from birth to age 9 (N=4,898). In both studies, material and emotional parenting investments/resources predicted selection into neighborhoods over time, and neighborhood disadvantage frequently predicted relative change in parenting investments. The prediction to change in child externalizing was larger for parenting investments than it was for neighborhood characteristics in most of the models tested.
R20|Moving on Down: The Conflated Impact of Family Instability and Disadvantaged Neighborhoods on Cognitive, Externalizing, and Internalizing Outcomes|Research indicates youth who face family instability have more negative outcomes than youth who remain in stable families. A gap in the literature is whether following family instability youth will move to a neighborhood with more disorder. Individuals that transition to neighborhoods with more disorder have profound negative effects in comparison to those who remain in higher quality neighborhoods. This study employs longitudinal data from the Fragile Families Study to determine whether family instability increases youthsâ€™ risk of movement to a lower quality neighborhood, and whether the effects of family instability in conjunction with movement to lower quality neighborhood impact educational outcomes, internalizing problem behaviors, and externalizing problem behaviors in comparison to youth only experiencing family instability. We find family instability significantly increases the odds of youth moving to lower quality neighborhoods, and youth display increased internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors following both family instability and movement to lower quality neighborhoods.
R20|Reverting to Informality Unregistered Property Transactions and the Erosion of the Titling Reform in Peru|Titling programs have focused mostly on providing initial tenure security and have not properly addressed maintaining the formality of future property transactions. Our data indicates that properties become de-regularized due to unregistered transactions in urban slums, which threatens to undo the success of the titling program in the long run. We exploit a natural experiment provided by the elimination of a streamlined registration system targeted for the poor residents in Peru to identify how costly and burdensome registration policies can increase de-regularization. Our analysis indicated that the elimination of such a system led to a significant reduction in the probability of registering transactions, including those that involved a change in ownership. Overall, our findings stress the necessity of building specific components aimed at maintaining properties formal into the design of urban titling programs.
R20|The Effect of Creative Class on Economic Development of Cities: The Case of Turkey|Economic power of cities depends on their human capital as much as their pyhsical capital. Florida’s hypothesis about Creative Class is tested in this study in the context of Turkey. For this purpose, we examine the relationsip between alternative mesures of human capital and regional development applying structural equation models and path analysis. Our results confirm Florida’s hypothesis that high level of creativity fosters regional economic development. Evidence also suggest that total creative class seems to be better measurement than education in accounting for regional development across Turkish cities. In addition, our results suggest that while there is statistically significant association between the distribution of creative class and the presence of artistically culturally creative individuals (bohemians), there is no significant association with consumer amenities and university. As a result, Florida’s hypothesis does not completely explain the distribution of creatives in the Turkish context.
R20|Some Like it Hot: The Role of Environmental Concern and Comfort Expectations in Energy Retrofit Decisions|This study investigates the role of environmental concern and comfort expectations in the decision to retrofit a dwelling and their implications for the rebound effect. We ex-ante elicit individual preferences for deep thermal energy-saving measures in residential buildings by means of a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) among 3,161 owner-occupiers and tenants in Germany. Besides room temperature, we include air quality, level of control over the system, noise reduction, and aesthetics of the dwelling as proxies for indoor comfort. Our model also accounts for monthly payments related to the implementation of the measure – and customized based on tenancy status, building type, and size of the dwelling – as well as technical energy cost savings. Econometric estimation provides significant results for most of the parameter coefficients. Findings show that thermal comfort preferences are heterogeneous: 33% of the respondents attach positive values to an increase in indoor temperature that would result from the deep retrofit, providing evidence in favor of a technical rebound effect. While environmental concern explains heterogeneity in most of the attributes, its interaction with thermal comfort is not significant. Thermal comfort is, however, the least important attribute in the analysis.
R20|Shall I Open the Window? An Experiment on Effort and Habits in Thermal-Comfort Adjustment Practices|Energy retrofits of residential dwellings, ceteris paribus, result in a new socio-technical system characterized by higher room temperatures. In the new environment, individuals might change their type of interaction with the building and exert a certain level of effort to adapt to the new comfort situation depending on their previous practices. In this paper, by means of a Discrete Choice Experiment conducted among 3,161 tenants and owner-occupiers in Germany, we investigate preferences for practices implemented to adjust thermal comfort in retrofitted buildings, thus attempting to reconcile rational choice with social practice theories. We focus on effort and habits but our models also account for the type of control over the room temperature, adjustment time, and clothing. Our results show that in the presence of an obstruction, like potted plants or other decorative paraphernalia, in the proximity of the interaction point with the system, respondents dislike exerting effort to fully open the window but would still make the effort to switch off the heating system. Moreover, respondents with more environmentally-friendly heating and ventilation habits particularly dislike tilting the windows rather than opening them wide; however, after the retrofit they tend to prefer wearing lighter clothes at home. By quantitatively measuring the impact of each factor in the decision-making process, we contribute to the ongoing rebound debate in the energy economics and social psychology literature alike.
R20|An economic analysis of policies for promoting economically efficient water heater systems operating under seasonal climatic conditions|This article reports on an economic cost-effective analysis of water heating systems including solar water heating systems. This study finds that in situations where there is a winter, or a rainy season, the choice of the source of energy for the solar water heating systemsâ€™ back-up during this period is critical for its overall cost-effectiveness. It is found that in the conditions of North Cyprus, an solar water heating systems with electricity back-up is far superior to using electricity alone; however, it is inferior to heating water with either a liquefied petroleum gas water heater alone or an solar water heating systems with an liquefied petroleum gas back-up. Policies to promote water heating systems that reduce the use of electricity should not encourage the installation of solar water heating systems with electricity back-up. An liquefied petroleum gas water heater or an solar water heating systems with an liquefied petroleum gas back-up are economically more cost-effective, with or without the inclusion of the social cost of carbon estimates.
R20|Gender differential Impact of NERICA adoption on Total Factor Productivity: evidence from Benin Republic| This study examines the relationship between adoption of NERICA varieties and the Total Factor Productivity among men and women. Data were collected from 342 rice farmers randomly selected in the central and northwest Benin. Total Factor Productivity was estimated using a Cobb-Douglass production function. The impact was estimated using the Local Average Treatment Effect. Results show that the adoption of NERICA variety improves Total Factor Productivity of potential adopters and it benefits men and women differently. Potential women adopters got a higher gain on their Total Factor Productivity than men. This finding suggests that targeting women with NERICA increase significantly rice productivity more than the case where men are targeted.
R20|Food demand in Vietnam: structural changes and projections to 2030| Rank three demand systems have been recognized to be best-suited for long-term demand projections due to their Engel flexibility. Using a fitted QUAIDS model, food demand in Vietnam is projected under scenarios that account for alternative growth rates in food expenditures, food prices and urbanization. Results indicate that at higher levels of expenditure growth, budget share of rice declines while budget shares of high-valued foods such as meat and drinks increase. Demand for rice is projected to decline in 2020 and further in 2030 both on a per capita basis and in total while demand for other foods increases. The projections also show that the effect of urbanization is more remarkable for rice while it is modest for non-rice food groups. Results of this study highlight the importance of considering the effect of income distribution and urbanization in long-term food demand projections.

R20|The vertical city: the price of land and the height of buildings in Chicago 1870-2010|We analyze the determinants of building heights in Chicago by combining a micro-geographic data set on tall buildings with a unique panel of land prices covering 140 years. Consistent with the predictions of classic urban economics models, we find that developers respond to increasing land prices by increasing density, i.e. building taller. In 2000, the elasticity of height with respect of land price was about 45% for tall commercial buildings and 30% for tall residential buildings. As expected given significant improvement in construction technology over time, we find that the height elasticity approximately doubled over the last 100 years. We find evidence for dissipative height competition within cities, as excessively tall buildings are significantly less likely to be constructed near to each other than other buildings. Proximity to scenic amenities creates an extra incentive to outrival competitors, particularly in the residential market.
R20|Speed 2.0: Evaluating Access to Universal Digital Highways|This paper shows that having access to a fast Internet connection is an important determinant of capitalization effects in property markets. Our empirical strategy combines a boundary discontinuity design with controls for time-invariant effects and arbitrary macroeconomic shocks at a very local level to identify the causal effect of broadband speed on property prices from variation that is plausibly exogenous. Applying this strategy to a micro data set from England between 1995 and 2010 we find a significantly positive effect, but diminishing returns to speed. Our results imply that disconnecting an average property from a high-speed first-generation broadband connection (offering Internet speed up to 8 Mbit/s) would depreciate its value by 2.8%. In contrast, upgrading such a property to a faster connection (offering speeds up to 24 Mbit/s) would increase its value by no more than 1%. We decompose this effect by income and urbanization, finding considerable heterogeneity. These estimates are used to evaluate proposed plans to deliver fast broadband universally. We find that increasing speed and connecting unserved households pass a cost–benefit test in urban and some suburban areas, whereas the case for universal delivery in rural areas is not as strong.
R20|Estimating the Impact of Forced Sales on House Prices|We study the price effects of forced sales on the Dutch housing market. A forced sale may result in a lower transaction price because of e.g. suboptimal incentives for revenue maximization. The lower transaction price may also spill over to regular (unforced) nearby transactions. We aim to measure both the forced sale discount and the spillover effect. We employ an unusual rich dataset for house transactions in the Netherlands between 2007 and 2013. To identify the effects of forced sales we control for very local neighborhood trends and detailed house characteristics. We find that a forced sale results in a price discount of about five percent. Each nearby forced sale reduces the transaction price by about 0.4 percent.
R20|The Greener, the Happier? The Effects of Urban Green and Abandoned Areas on Residential Well-Being|This paper investigates the effects of urban green and abandoned areas on residential well-being in major German cities, using panel data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) for the time period between 2000 and 2012 and cross-section data from the European Urban Atlas (EUA) for the year 2006. Using a Geographical Information System (GIS), it calculates the distance to urban green and abandoned areas, measured as the Euclidean distance in 100 metres between households and the border of the nearest urban green and abandoned area, respectively, and the coverage of urban green and abandoned areas, measured as the hectares covered by urban green and abandoned areas in a pre-defined buffer area of 1,000 metres around households, respectively, as the most important determinants of access to them. It shows that, for the 32 major German cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants, access to urban green areas, such as parks, is significantly positively associated, whereas access to abandoned areas, such as brown fields, is significantly negatively associated with residential well-being, in particular with life satisfaction, as well as mental and physical health. The effects are strongest for residents who are older, accounting for up to a third of the size of the effect of being unemployed on life satisfaction. Using data from the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II) for the time period between 2009 and 2012, this paper also shows that (older) residents who report living closer to greens have been diagnosed significantly less often with certain medical conditions, including diabetes, sleep disorder, and joint disease.
R20|Deindustrialisation and the polarisation of household incomes: The example of urban agglomerations in Germany|The tertiarisation, or perhaps more accurately, the deindustrialisation of the economy has left deep scars on cities. It is evident not only in the industrial wastelands and empty factory buildings, but also in the income and social structures of cities. Industrialisation, collective wage setting, and the welfare state led to a stark reduction in income differences over the course of the 20th century. Conversely, deindustrialisation and the shift to tertiary sectors could result in increasing wage differentiation. Moreover, numerous studies on global cities, the dual city, and divided cities have also identified income polarisation as a central phenomenon in the development of major cities. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), we find an increasing polarisation of household income structures since the mid-1990s. In urban agglomerations, this income polarisation is even more pronounced than in the more rural regions. The income polarisation in Germany is likely to have multiple causes, some of which are directly linked to policies such as the deregulation of the labour market. But extensive deindustrialisation is probably also one of the drivers of this process, and it has directly weakened Germanyâ€™s middle-income groups.
R20|Sowing the Wind and Reaping the Whirlwind? The Effect of Wind Turbines on Residential Well-Being|This paper investigates the effect of wind turbines on residential well-being in Germany, using panel data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) and a unique, novel data set on wind turbines for the time period between 2000 and 2012. Using a Geographical Information System (GIS), it calculates the distance from households to the nearest wind turbines to determine whether an individual is affected by disamenities, e.g. through visual pollution. The depth of our unique, novel data set on wind turbines, which has been collected at the regional level and which includes, besides their exact geographical coordinates, their construction dates, allows estimating the causal effect of wind turbines on residential well-being, using difference-in-difference propensity-score and spatial matching techniques. We demonstrate that the construction of a new wind turbine in a treatment area of 4000 metres around households has a significantly negative impact on life satisfaction. Moreover, this effect is found to be of transitory nature. Contrasting the implicit monetary valuation with the damage through CO2 emissions avoided by wind turbines, wind power turns out to be a favorable technology despite robust evidence for negative externalities.
R20|Do People Shape Cities, or Do Cities Shape People? The Co-evolution of Physical, Social, and Economic Change in Five Major U.S. Cities|Urban change involves transformations in the physical appearance and the social composition of neighborhoods. Yet, the relationship between the physical and social components of urban change is not well understood due to the lack of comprehensive measures of neighborhood appearance. Here, we introduce a computer vision method to quantify change in physical appearance of streetscapes and generate a dataset of physical change for five large American cities. We combine this dataset with socioeconomic indicators to explore whether demographic and economic changes precede, follow, or co-occur with changes in physical appearance. We find that the strongest predictors of improvement in a neighborhood’s physical appearance are population density and share of college-educated adults. Other socioeconomic characteristics, like median income, share of vacant homes, and monthly rent, do not predict improvement in physical appearance. We also find that neighborhood appearances converge to the initial appearances of bordering areas, supporting the Burgess “invasion” theory. In addition, physical appearance is more likely to improve in neighborhoods proximal to the central business district. Finally, we find modest support for “tipping” and “filtering” theories of urban change.
R20|The role of urban green space for human well-being|Most people in Europe live in urban environments. For these people, urban green space is an important element of well-being, but it is often in short supply. We use self-reported information on life satisfaction and two individual green space measures to explore how urban green space affects the well-being of the residents of Berlin, the capital city of Germany. We combine spatially explicit survey data with spatially highly disaggregated GIS data on urban green space. We observe a significant, inverted U-shaped effect of the amount of and distance to urban green space on life satisfaction. According to our results, the amount of green space in a 1km buffer that leads to the largest positive effect on life satisfaction is 35ha or 11% of the buffer area. In our sample, 75% of the respondents have less green space available.
R20|Methods for including income distribution in global CGE models for long-term climate change research|The consequences of climate policy and the impacts of climate change vary among different types of households depending on their income level, expenditure pattern, and other socioeconomic characteristics. Global economy-environment models that are used to assess climate change issues traditionally do not distinguish households by income or other attributes. To facilitate progress in this area, we review and assess literature on methods to include household heterogeneity in global long-term Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models. We distinguish among three categories of approaches: 1) the explicit modeling of multiple household types within the CGE framework, 2) micro-simulation modeling, and 3) direct modeling of income distribution. For each of these approaches we describe the method, key assumptions, limitations and several prominent examples from the literature. Moreover, we discuss data needs, including the contents of household survey data, their availability and processing. We conclude with an overview of what each method could provide for global, long-term climate-related research.
R20|The role of informational uncertainty in the decision to strategically default|This study identifies a severe gap between the financial backlash borrowers believe awaits them after strategic mortgage default and the reality that lenders rarely pursue deficiency judgments. This coupled with the social norm finding that borrowers widely view strategic default as immoral, leads us to recommend lenders and policymakers seeking to stem the tide of defaults to pursue a policy of informational opacity. We make several recommendations for how to carry out such a policy as well as what might need to change in society before the alternative policy of informational transparency becomes ideal.
R20|When Walmart comes to town: Always low housing prices? Always?|Walmart often faces strong local opposition when trying to build a new store. One common complaint is that Walmart lowers nearby housing prices. In this study we use over one million housing transactions located near 159 Walmarts that opened between 2000 and 2006 to test if the opening of a Walmart lowers housing prices. Using a difference-in-differences specification, our estimates suggest that a new Walmart store actually increases housing prices by between 2% and 3% for houses located within 0.5 miles of the store and by 1–2% for houses located between 0.5 and 1 mile.
R20|Blowing it up and knocking it down: The local and city-wide effects of demolishing high concentration public housing on crime|This paper estimates the effect that the closure and demolition of roughly 20,000 units of geographically concentrated high-rise public housing had on crime in Chicago. We estimate local effects of closures on crime in the neighborhoods where high-rises stood and in proximate neighborhoods. We also estimate the impact that households displaced from high-rises had on crime in the neighborhoods to which they moved and neighborhoods close to those. Overall, reductions in violent crime in and near the areas where high-rises were demolished greatly outweighed increases in violent crime associated with the arrival of displaced residents in new neighborhoods.
R20|Change and Persistence in the Economic Status of Neighborhoods and Cities|This chapter reviews recent literature that considers and explains the tendency for neighborhood and city-level economic status to rise and fall. A central message is that although many locations exhibit extreme persistence in economic status, change in economic status as measured by various indicators of per capita income is common. At the neighborhood level, we begin with a set of stylized facts and then follow with discussion of static and dynamic drivers of neighborhood economic status. This is mirrored at the metropolitan level. Durable but slowly decaying housing, transportation infrastructure, and self-reinforcing spillovers all influence local income dynamics, as do enduring natural advantages, amenities, and government policy. Three recurring themes run throughout the paper: (i) Long sweeps of time are typically necessary to appreciate that change in economic status is common, (ii) history matters, and (iii) a combination of static and dynamic forces ensures that income dynamics can and do differ dramatically across locations but in ways that can be understood.
R20|Housing, Finance, and the Macroeconomy|In this chapter, we review and discuss the large body of research that has developed over the past 10-plus years that explores the interconnection of macroeconomics, finance, and housing. We focus on three major topicsâ€”housing and the business cycle, housing and portfolio choice, and housing and asset returnsâ€”and then review the recent literature that studies housing and the macroeconomy during the great housing boom and bust of 2000â€“2010. Our emphasis is on calibrated models that can be compared with data. In each section, we discuss the important questions, the typical set of tools used, and the insights that result from influential articles. Although great progress has been made in understanding the impact of housing outcomes on macroeconomic aggregates and vice versa, work remains. For example, economists recognize the importance of changing credit-market conditions in amplifying the volatility of house prices, but cannot explain the timing of these changes. At the end of the chapter, we discuss a new literature that assesses the macroeconomic effects and welfare implications of housing policies.
R20|The Vertical City: The Price of Land and the Height of Buildings in Chicago 1870-2010|We analyze the determinants of building heights in Chicago by combining a micro-geographic data set on tall buildings with a unique panel of land prices covering 140 years. Consistent with the predictions of classic urban economics models, we find that developers respond to increasing land prices by increasing density, i.e. building taller. In 2000, the elasticity of height with respect of land price was about 45% for tall commercial buildings and 30% for tall residential buildings. As expected given significant improvement in construction technology over time, we find that the height elasticity approximately doubled over the last 100 years. We find evidence for dissipative height competition within cities, as excessively tall buildings are significantly less likely to be constructed near to each other than other buildings. Proximity to scenic amenities creates an extra incentive to outrival competitors, particularly in the residential market.
R20|Composite Indices Based on Partial Least Squares|In this paper, we compare Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares (PLS) methods to generate weights for composite indices. In this context we also consider various treatments of non-metric variables when constructing such composite indices. Using simulation studies we find that dummy coding for non-metric variables yields satisfactory performance compared to more sophisticated statistical procedures. In our applications we illustrate how PLS can generate weights that differ substantially from those obtained with PCA, increasing the composite indices' predictive performance for the outcome variable considered.
R20|Treatments of Non-metric Variables in Partial Least Squares and Principal Component Analysis|This paper reviews various treatments of non-metric variables in Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithms. The performance of different treatments is compared in the extensive simulation study under several typical data generating processes and recommendations are made. An application of PLS and PCA algorithms with non-metric variables to the generation of a wealth index is considered.
R20|A Post Occupancy Evaluation of a green rated and conventional residence hall|Green buildings increasingly attract attention in the real estate sector, and the US sector is no exception. Studies indicate that green rated buildings may bring higher rents and sales prices. One reason for this inequity is that the indoor environment of these buildings may outperform conventional buildings. The main objective of this paper is to conduct a post-occupancy evaluation (POE) to compare the indoor environment in a LEED certified, on-campus residence hall with a similar, non-green rated hall. Results are evaluated to determine if green buildings really outperform. The results suggest that the green rated building outperformed the conventional building in the majority of the indoor environmental aspects, but not all. These results can inform a cost-benefit analysis of green features for new construction and renovation.
R20|What Broke First? Characterizing Sources of Structural Change Prior to the Great Recession|This paper identifies and characterizes episodes of structural change in the 27 years that preceded the Great Recession. This is done by performing Bai-Perron (2003a, 2003b) tests on 61,843 time series that span 34 countries, which collectively accounted for 81% of Gross World Product in 2013. Three major stylized facts are established. First, the rate of structural change increased throughout the early 1990s, stabilized in 2003, and then decreased slowly until 2007. Second, there were three large spikes in the pace of structural change after the 1990-1991 recession: 1993-1994, 2001-2003, and 2007-2009. The latter two overlap with recessions in the U.S. and many other major economies, but the first does not. This spike is associated with structural change in residential investment, consumption, exchange rates, and real estate. Across countries, the degree of structural change is highest in China during this episode. Third, the periods 1993-1994 and 1997-2000 contain heavy structural change in real estate and lending; however, the rate of structural change in house price and construction series was more pronounced in and after 2001.
R20|Water Resources – an Analysis of Trends, Weak Siglans and Wild Cards with Implications for Russia|Water resources are crucial for the continuity of life. Humans and living species need fresh water for drinking and sanitation, while industries in most sectors of the economy need water for some part of production processes themselves. Access to fresh water is a grand challenge at the global level, mainly due to increasing water consumption, a low rate of replenishment of resources as well as external factors, like climate change, that significantly reduce amount of water available. The solutions to the existing water problems require systemic approaches for the sustainable use of water resources, while advancing water infrastructure and providing circular use of water. Russia is one of the countries, which is relatively better positioned compared to a number of other countries in the world regarding the availability of water resources. However, there are still considerable issues regarding the protection and use of water resources, purification processes, water networks, consumption patterns, discharge, treatment and re-use. The present study focuses on the use of water resources in Russia with a long term perspective developed through a Foresight study. The first step involved a scanning exercise, to be followed by future scenarios on the second step, and strategy proposals for action on the third one. The paper presents the results of the scanning phase. The present paper consists of four parts. The introduction reviews the key issues and challenges concerning water resources. The first part describes the detailed research methodology. Furthermore, trends and uncertainties are identified in the course of the study, and their implications for water resources in Russia are discussed. Particular attention is paid to state-of-the-art situation in three domains identified in the scope of research: sustainability of water systems, water use by households and industry, and new water products and services. Weak signals and wild cards are described in the third part. The paper concludes with a brief description of the next phases of the study and follow-up activities planned in the project.
R20|Russia’S Water Resources 2030: Plausible Scenarios|The research presented in this paper focuses on the sustainable use of water resources in Russia based on a Foresight study with a 20-year time horizon. The study uses a scenario-planning method to develop four trajectories: economic depression, economic stagnation, visionary future, and national priority. These four trajectories offer significantly different yet plausible alternative futures. The current paper draws upon the earlier horizon scanning activity, which identified a set of trends, weak signals and wild cards, along with their implications for water resources in Russia. Based on this work, it identifies key factors and indicators, which may characterize future developments in the following domains: (i) the sustainability of water systems; (ii) water use by households and industry; and (iii) new water products and services. The evolution of variables and indicators will then be considered under the scenarios termed ‘Nearly perfect future’ (economic growth), ‘Problem conservation’ (economic stagnation), ‘Losses and accidents’ (economic depression), and ‘National priority’ trajectories. The paper concludes with a brief description of further research directions, including a discussion on the probability of the scenarios being implemented. Russian policy makers and water companies may use the scenarios to adapt (i.e. plan for timely responses), avert certain undesirable future developments, or approximate the visionary future of the sector
R20|Water Resources 2030: Policy Recommendations|The Foresight study presented in this paper is devoted to the sustainable use of water resources in Russia. The authors analyse possible trajectories of development in the three thematic areas (i) sustainability of water systems; (ii) water use by households and in industry; and (iii) new water products and services. The Foresight methods cover expert interviews and seminars, desk research, and policy analysis. The state and corporate policy recommendations for the water sector offered in this study correspond with the water scenarios earlier identified by Saritas et al.: “Nearly ideal future”, “Losses and accidents”, “Problem conservation”, and “National Priority” [Saritas et al., 2015]. For each of these four scenarios, policy recommendations for water companies were identified covering new solutions (including technological innovations), new values and competencies, organisational changes, modernisation of the infrastructure, financial issues, and legal and regulatory changes. Moreover, we recommend certain policy measures and approaches to state policy in the water sector. The paper concludes with the main directions and instruments for the sector’s development, which should be planned and implemented jointly by the government and businesses, as well as other stakeholders (organisations and people).
R20|Excess Commuting in the US: Differences between the Self-Employed and Employees|"In this paper, we propose a new spatial framework to model excess commuting of workers and we show empirical differences between the self-employed and employees in the US. In a theoretical framework where self-employed workers minimize their commuting time, employees do not minimize their commuting time because they lack full information, and thus the difference between the time devoted to commuting by self-employed workers and employees is modeled as wasteful commuting (i.e., excess commuting). We first formulate a microeconomic framework for commuting by modeling the location of individuals in urban cores surrounded by rings. Using the American Time Use Survey for the years 2003-2013, our empirical results show that employees spend twelve more minutes per day, or forty percent of the average commuting time, compared to their self-employed counterparts. This is consistent with our ""diana"" model, in that location is an important factor."
R20|Hukou Changes and Subjective Well-Being|The literature on subjective well-being has highlighted the negative effects associated with the restrictions and inequality imposed by the hukou system on China's rural population. However, quantifying the cost of holding a rural hukou has generally been problematic, principally for lack of suitable data or measurements. Thanks to RUMiC, a new longitudinal database on China, this limitation can be overcome by exploiting exogenous changes in hukou status due to expropriation. The results support that granting an urban hukou substantially enhances subjective well-being within the household, especially for the household heads. The results complement a growing literature on subjective well-being focusing on China.
R20|Types of Spatial Mobility and the Ethnic Context of Destination Neighbourhoods in Estonia|Most studies of the ethnic composition of destination neighbourhoods after residential moves do not take into account the types of moves people have made. However, from an individual perspective, different types of moves may result in neighbourhood environments that differ in terms of their ethnic composition from those in which individuals previously lived. We investigate how the ethnic residential context changes for individuals as a result of different types of mobility (immobility, intra-urban mobility, suburbanisation, and long-distance migration) for residents of the segregated post-Soviet city of Tallinn. We compare the extent to which Estonian- and Russian-speakers integrate in residential terms. Using unique longitudinal Census data (2000-2011) we tracked changes in the individual ethnic residential context of both groups. We found that the moving destinations of Estonian- and Russian-speakers diverge. When Estonians move, their new neighbourhood generally possesses a lower percentage of Russian-speakers compared with when Russian-speakers move, as well as compared with their previous neighbourhoods. For Russian-speakers, the percentage of other Russian-speakers in their residential surroundings decreases only for those who move to the surburbs or who move over longer distances to rural villages. By applying a novel approach of tracking the changes in the ethnic residential context of individuals for all mobility types, we were able to demonstrate that the two largest ethnolinguistic groups in Estonia tend to behave as 'parallel populations' and that residential integration in Estonia is therefore slow.
R20|Why do poor households not apply for welfare benefits? evidence from Jamaicas path program|Estimates show only 56 percent of poor households who are eligible for benefits under the Program of Advancement Through Health and Education (PATH) in Jamaica actually applied to the program. Also, application rate among urban households is approximately half the rate that exists among poor rural households. This study investigates potential reasons for the relatively low application rate. Using data compiled by the Statistical Institute of Jamaica (STATIN), we conclude that single male household heads are two to four times less likely to apply for benefits compared to households headed by females and married couples. Problems regarding information about PATH and the complexity of the application process have the greatest impact on the decision not to apply.
R20|Food poverty profile for Nigeria|Poverty has remained largely unabated in Nigeria despite the efforts made in tackling it. Previous studies on poverty focused on total expenditure and did not adequately cater for regional differences in prices, needs, tastes and preferences. This study, therefore, examined the incidence, depth and severity of food poverty in Nigeria and produced a food poverty profile for the country based on zone-specific food poverty lines. The study used data from National Bureau of Statistics Nigeria Living Standard Survey, 2004. Linear programming technique in the spirit of the Food-Energy-Intake (FEI) approach, and the Foster-Greer-Thorbecke (FGT) index were utilized. The estimates of the study showed, among other things, that food poverty lines varied across zones, and food poverty was pervasive in the country and varied across zones. Thus policies and programs that will adequately increase people access to food and minimize the incidence of food poverty in Nigeria should be adopted.
R20|The assimilation of migrant households in the urban areas of a developing country|This paper explores the economic performance of rural-urban migrant households in the recently flourishing urban areas of Nepal. Using nationally representative primary survey data, we find that upon their arrival, these migrant households have 24 percent less income and 13 percent less consumption than their local counterparts but converge to equal levels of income and consumption after 10 and three years, respectively. Our results suggest that a higher level of education accelerates the speed of assimilation. Compared with the Mountain/Hill regions, migrants in the prosperous Tarai region possess a lower level of welfare upon arrival but exhibit more rapid assimilation.
R20|Land and labor reallocation in pre-modern Japan : a case of a northeastern village in 1720-1870|"In agricultural societies, adjusting land and labor according to changes of labor endowment that result from family life cycle events is premised on making full use of resources for each farming household and for the economy as a whole. This paper examines how and how well households in pre-modern Japan reallocated land and labor, using a population register covering 150 years from 1720–1870 for a village in the Tohoku region. We find that households reacted to equalize their production factors; land-scarce households tended to acquire or rent-in land and out-migrate their kin members, while land-abundant households tended to release or rent-out land, in-migrate kin members, or employ non-kin members. Estimates suggest that more than 80% of the surplus or deficit area of land was resolved if the household rented or ""sold"" land. We discuss a potential underlying mechanism; namely, that the village's collective responsibility for tax payment (murauke) motivated both individual households and the village as a whole to reallocate land and labor for the efficient use of resources."
R20|Monitoring household liquidity constraints across Europe: a panel approach|Excessive real estate credit is a major threat to financial stability. However, risk arising from household credit is difficult to monitor at an aggregate level. As household liquidity constraints play a key role, we propose a new indicator for the analysis of mortgage lending restrictions: The average marginal effect of household income on the probability of home ownership. Resorting to data from the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), the preceding European Community Household Panel (ECHP) and the German Socio Economic Panel (SOEP), we conduct a comprehensive empirical investigation based on various panels for European countries between 1999 and 2010. We find significant differences in marginal effects across countries as well as across time. Most striking are low and weakening marginal effects during the run-up of the financial crisis of 2007 for countries such as Spain and the United Kingdom - countries severely affected by bursting real estate bubbles since 2008. On the one hand, our results demonstrate the potential usefulness of the new indicator within early warning approaches for real estate and financial crises. On the other hand, they highlight the problem of heterogeneous household liquidity constraints across Europe, particularly with regard to the common monetary policy within Eurozone countries.

R20|Food security and small landholders in south Asia|This paper surveys the status of food security in the South Asian countries, particularly India. Particular attention has been paid to small landholders (those households owning less than 2 hectares of land). Using NSS data from 1993–94 and 2004–05 the paper shows that small landholders are an increasing proportion of i) total rural households, ii) rural households who are poor, and iii) rural households who are undernourished. The paper then singles out five disconnects in India's recent economic performance as constituting the reason for this outcome. It advances some policy conclusions on how these disconnects can be addressed.
R20|Determinants of Urban Poverty: The Case of Medium Sized City in Pakistan|Urban poverty, which is distinct from rural poverty due to demographic, economic and political aspects remain hitherto unexplored, at the city level in Pakistan. We have examined the determinants of urban poverty in Sargodha, a medium-size city of Pakistan. The analysis is based on the survey of 330 households. Results suggest that employment in public sector, investment in human capital and access to public amenities reduce poverty while employment in informal sector, greater household size and female dominated households increase poverty. We recommend greater investment in human capital and public amenities as a strategy for poverty alleviation.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
R20|Socio-economic conditions, inequality and deprivation in North East India|In spite of ample natural and human resources, the north east region of India that consists of eight states is still lagging behind as compared to many states of India. People of these states are deprived in different socio-economic indicators. The aim of the paper is to examine the inequalities in socio-economic parameters of development, analyse inequality in the access to basic amenities, and quantify the level of facility and socio-economic deprivations. It was found that Multi-dimensional Poverty Index (MPI) value is highest in Assam but, inequality among the MPI poor is high in Meghalaya. In 2011-12, BPL population was highest in Manipur (46.7 %) followed by Assam (40.9 %) and Arunachal Pradesh (37.4 %) exceeding the all India level (29.5). It was observed that inequality is high in growth rate of population (%) (among demographic indicators), sanitation facilities (among the indicators of economic conditions), rail density (among indicators of infrastructure), average years of education, per capita monthly expenditure (Rs) and population Below Poverty Line. Analysis of access to basic amenities, namely, drinking water, toilet facility and electricity reveals the existence of wide state-level variations. Inequality in access to electricity is highest in urban sector as compared to the rural sector among the three basic services. Among the states of NER, the maximum average deprivation in the basic facilities is located in Meghalaya and the most Socio-economic deprived state is Nagaland. Thus, it is recommended for consistent and balanced development approach, expansion of capability, improvement in infrastructure and diversification of agriculture across the eight states of North East India.
R20|The future of the Romanian rural household from the perspective of agricultural censuses|The development of agriculture in nowadays circumstances cannot be merely assessed from the perspective of agriculture as a main branch of national economy, but further from a social point of view which is highly significant as it represents the traditional small farm households which provide the basic necessaries for the rural population as well as the usability implication of over 55% from the agricultural area of the country. On the whole, by agricultural exploitation there is the general tendency of considering its commercial aspect only, perfectly justifiable in the case of agricultural exploitations with a legal, juridical character, but there is also to be regarded the social aspect of agricultural exploitation without a juridical status, which is largely representative for the small farm households. In the period of time between the 2 General Censuses (2002 and 2010) the agricultural exploitations without a legal, juridical status diminshed by 13.6%, while the agricultural area used diminshed by 3.3% only, leaving over 7.5 million agricultural area as responsability for these exploitations.
R20|Estimation of effects of transport accessibility on housing prices|The paper analyzes the key determinants of real estate prices in Perm, with special attention to transport accessibility indicators. The issue of transport accessibility modeling is discussed. The valuation of price hedonic model revealed that housing prices in Perm are affected mostly by the area of the apartment, the fact of its location on the first floor, number of public transport routes in the district, and time to the city centre.
R20|The joint choice of tenure, dwelling type, size and location: the effect of home-oriented versus culture-oriented lifestyle|This study investigates knowledge-workers’ housing preferences in terms of tenure, dwelling type, location and size. The analysis is conducted by applying a joint multinomial-logit ordered-response model to the housing choices of knowledgeworkers residing in the Tel-Aviv metropolitan region and working in the high-tech and finance sectors. The results confirm the following hypotheses: (i) controlling for socioeconomic characteristics and workplace, knowledge-workers’ housing choices relate to their lifestyle; (ii) knowledge-workers with a culture-oriented lifestyle prefer to rent small apartments in central locations; (iii) knowledge-workers with a home-oriented lifestyle prefer large dwelling units, mainly single-detached houses, in suburban locations.

R20|Intra-metropolitan residential mobility and income sorting trends|The dynamics of residential sorting have been previously explored using segregation models. In contrast with these models which emphasize resultant spatial distributions, this paper suggests an approach of assessing temporal income sorting trends through the analysis of residential mobility patterns. The approach is focused on ‘gains’ in neighborhood socioeconomic status experienced by movers as a result of residential relocation. The analysis of income sorting trends is based upon the analysis of inter-group differentials in these gains over time. Trends in income sorting are assumed to follow temporal variations in exogenous factors such as housing market circumstances. As different age groups are assumed to respond differently to these variations, income sorting is expected to evolve to some extent on the basis of age. An empirical example demonstrates the application of this approach to intra-metropolitan residential mobility data collected for the Tel-Aviv metropolitan area through the years 1997–2008.

R20|Are indebted households poorer? Evidence from Slovakia|This paper analyses the impact of household indebtedness on household net wealth, using Slovak data from the first wave of the Household Finance and Consumption Survey. We find two different effects of household indebtedness on wealth – a highly negative impact of non-mortgage debt and a neutral effect of mortgage debt. Furthermore, we find that households living in bigger municipalities and more developed regions are both wealthier and more indebted. Finally, we ascertain that household wealth is mainly determined by income, home ownership, inheritance, household composition, the characteristics of household head, and regional demographic and economic conditions.
R20|New Estimates for the Price of Housing in the Japanese CPI|The paper looks at problems associated with measuring the services of owner-occupied housing (OOH) in the Japanese CPI. The paper shows that alternative approaches to measuring the services of OOH lead to quite different measures of CPI inflation for Japan. The Japanese CPI uses a rental equivalence approach to measuring OOH services and uses an index of all paid rents to price these services. However, Japanese rents are very sticky and under these circumstances, it seems more appropriate to use an index of newly contracted rents to value the opportunity cost of using the services of owned dwelling units. The paper examines this issue. It also looks at the adequacy of the sampling approach used in the Japanese CPI and at the problems surrounding the treatment of depreciation in constructing constant quality indexes for paid rents in the Japanese CPI. Finally, hedonic regressions for the quality adjustment of rents are run on an extensive data set.
R20|Urban-Rural Differences in Level of Various Forms of Trust in Hungary|This study examines the association between urban/rural residence and various forms of trust in Hungary, including control variables such as age, gender, income, marriage, qualification into the analysis. Trust is a basic dimension of human capital and a very often used concept in everyday situations too. Trust research became increasingly popular in recent years. However, urban-rural and spatial differences of specific forms of trust remains a rarely investigated question. Trust can be measured with one question (global or general trust) or with many questions. Global measures of trust have serious methodological and interpretative problems. Therefore a research was conducted with 19 questions concerning the various personal or impersonal subjects of trust. Respondents (n=2031) of a countrywide representative survey in Hungary rated their trust in various groups or institutions on a 10-point Likert scale. The results were analysed along the settlement hierarchy at four different levels: Budapest, the country capital; cities with county rights (namely the biggest Hungarian cities, apart from Budapest); smaller and medium sized cities; villages. Various sociodemographic factors were included into the analysis. In some cases age and gender is a more significant factor in differentiating the results as the settlement type, but age and gender can have a different effect on results for different settlement types. The results have a great variability according to the subject of trust. General differences between settlement types show a higher trust level in cities with county rights, then towns, villages and at last Budapest. Exceptions from this general picture are highly interesting: trust in personal contacts is much lower in Budapest, trust in institutions or abstract institutions (law and legal system, market system, political system, banks) is higher than in villages, institutions with more concrete personal contacts is higher in villages than in Budapest. The difference is bigger in the case of church. In Budapest, compared to other settlements, trust is lower in personal contacts, but the differences between settlement categories are lower than the differences of trust between the personal and impersonal contacts. Gender differences according to the settlement categories are also interesting. The highest trust level can be seen in elder age. However, trust of younger adults is higher in Budapest, mainly thanks to the much higher trust level in abstract institutions. Trust of younger adults in personal contacts and health institutions is not higher in Budapest. These are just some of the main finding of our complex results.
R20|Inhabiting, be citizens, that is cum-cives, or customers?|Introduction The goal is the analysis of the conflict growing between the interest of the inhabitants and that of the real estate market. With particular reference to Italy, considering the trends of residential urban transformations it is necessary to understand if the welfare of the inhabitants has improved. To inhabit it is one of the four pillars of the Athens Charter (1938), considering as base brick the family structure formed mostly by two adults, one worker (mainly male) and two children. With the life that was rhythmed by the times of production (Ernesti, 1995) i.e. the movements 'house' 'work'. So for over 300 years the home issue has had a close relationship with that work as the many models of economy of space have proved. And the third/fourth age was not contemplated, instead today it represents the larger population. In manufacture, in administrative offices etc. the jobs have become unsteady and the precarious ones, both temporally and geographically, have risen in Western countries: the uncontrolled globalization requires the labour force free from any ties, as are the other its products/elements. To underline that in countries called BRIC the model 'home-work' is still valid for reasons of scale and agglomeration: the causes of their growing 'urban gigantism'. The paper investigates, using case studies, if there is awareness of these radical social transformations, how they are tackled and what idea of civitas is proposed and is built with the cum-cives - i.e the citizens. All this with the EU budget constraints that limit local authorities in their urban policies and therefore also those for the house. Thus forcing them to disposals of public property, also the residential one, to heal the financial deficit, as it is happening recently in the capital of Italy. Conclusion The housing policies must be essential part of urban policy, related to those social and fiscal ones. If, as is the Italian case, there are reforms of the cadastre that raise property values, without urban policies of social equity there is not 'social housing' that can work. Unless the logical is to pursue the US model of 'social and wealth zoning', elder people in 'city of pensioners' or abandoned, increasing the ghettoization and peripheries without quality and having gentrification of inner cities. Without National Policies, much more than the bad recent Italian 'House Plan' the 'home question' will remain open. It is possible to have by useful examples suggestions for methodological good practices and strategies that make clear the need for such an integrated approach. The only way for getting more equity spatially and the reduction of the risk of social unrest. An approach able to conjugate the market and policy, that is the art of govern the polis.
R20|Revealed Preferences and Spatial Segregation|The relationship income / distance to CBD is basically nonlinear and its form varies a lot across the world. We often consider classic forms such as the typical US city one, where rich people live in the suburbs and the European city where they live downtown. Nevertheless, more complex patterns could be observed like in New York City. In this city, the area which is the closest to the city center is very rich; poor people live further away from CBD and the middle class lives in the suburbs. To explain these stylized facts, we use a model inspired by Turnbull (1997). Instead of employing the classical utility functions, this model applies the revealed preference theory. In his original paper, Turnbull established several propositions that made his model consistent with the main results obtained in urban economics (for instance that the prices decrease in relation to the distance from the CBD). Despite its consistence, the model gives different predictions than the main studies regarding the relationship between income and distance to CBD. This model allows us to deal with a great heterogeneity among the households (regarding incomes, tastes, transportation modes, amenities consumption) and thus enables many different potential equilibria. This diversity of equilibria permits to represent in a more accurate way cities and patterns and thus justifies the use of this model. Moreover, we try to take into account every parameter that could influence location choice in a single framework. Some model focuses on access to public transportation (Glaeser et al. (2008), other on amenities (Brueckner et al. (1999)). But no model has ever succeeded in giving a complete framework for studying the income sorting. Utility functions are usually used because the revealed preferences method is highly complex. But our model is quite simple because we demonstrated that the GARP axiom used in the revealed preference theory is equivalent to a simple equation. In our paper, several differences are found when comparing our results to the classic method using utility functions. Firstly, the ratio commuting costs per mile over demand land for rent is found constant between income groups, which is consistent with Wheaton (1977). As this variable is no longer supposed to explain the income sorting, the model focuses on other variables to explain it: income elasticity of housing demand, commuting time or amenity consumption. Moreover, in our model, some of the richer households will locate closer from CBD than a poorer one while other rich households will locate further away. This leads to an overlapping of the different income groups unlike the utility functions models that often predict complete segregation (except in De Bartolome and Ross (2003)).
R20|Monetary Policy and the Housing Market: A Structural Factor Analysis| This paper studies the role of the Federal Reserve's policy in the recent boom and bust of the housing market, and in the ensuing recession. By estimating a structural dynamic factor model on a panel of 109 US quarterly variables from 1982 to 2010, we find that, although the Federal Reserve's policy between 2002 and 2004 was slightly expansionary, its contribution to the recent housing cycle was negligible. We also show that a more restrictive policy would have smoothed the cycle but not prevented the recession. We thus find no role for the Federal Reserve in causing the recession.

R20|Identifying income and wealth-poor households in the euro area|In this paper, we analyse different measures of asset and income poverty using micro-data for 15 euro area countries from the 2010 Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS). We are particularly interested in the way in which specific definitions of income and wealth poverty affect the number and socio-demographic characteristics of poor households, as well as their portfolio composition and consumption expenditure. We find that adding wealth to the poverty definition mainly influences the percentage of poor households but has a limited effect on the documented socio-demographic composition, portfolio structure and food consumption of poor households compared to the patterns under a pure income poverty measure. Within each country, we document some heterogeneity with regard to the percentage of poor households across different poverty measures. However, across countries, the percentage of households in poverty for any given indicator is relatively homogenous. We find the typical socio-demographic patterns for poor households: the risk of being income and/or wealth-poor is, in almost all countries, higher for smaller households, households with a less educated head and single-parent households. We also show that the percentage of female, old and retired reference persons is higher for poor households than for the population at large. Additionally, the participation rates in real and financial assets for poor households are lower than for the population as a whole. Poor households spend more than 30% of their gross income on food.
R20|Sowing the Wind and Reaping the Whirlwind? The Effect of Wind Turbines on Residential Well-Being|We investigate the effect of the physical presence of wind turbines on residential well-being in Germany, using panel data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) and a unique novel panel data set on more than 20,000 wind turbines for the time period between 2000 and 2012. Using a Geographical Information System (GIS), we calculate the proximity between households and the nearest wind turbine as the most important determinant of their disamenities, e.g. visual interference into landscape aesthetics. Our unique novel panel data set on wind turbines, which was collected at the regional level, includes their exact geographical coordinates and construction dates. This allows estimating the causal effect of the physical presence of wind turbines on residential well-being, using a difference-in-differences design. To ensure comparability of the treatment and control group, we apply propensity-score and novel spatial matching techniques based on exogenous weather data and geographical locations of residence, respectively. We show that the construction of a wind turbine within a treatment radius of 4,000 metres around households has a significantly negative effect on life satisfaction. For larger treatment radii, no negative externalities can be detected. Moreover, the effect is transitory, vanishing after five years at the latest. As wind turbines are addressed at avoiding negative externalities of local pollutant and global greenhouse gas emissions, they fulfil an important role in the de-carbonization of electricity systems world-wide. Comparing the imposed spatially and temporally limited externalities with the avoided externalities from emissions, the positive impact of wind turbines is by several magnitudes higher than the negative.

R20|The Mortgage Interest Deduction and its Impact on Homeownership Decisions|This paper examines the impact of the combined U.S. state and federal mortgage interest deduction (MID) on homeownership attainment, using data from 1984 to 2007 and exploiting variation in the subsidy arising from changes in the MID within and across states over time. We test whether capitalization of the MID into house prices offsets the positive effect on homeownership. We find that the MID boosts homeownership attainment only of higher-income households in less tightly regulated housing markets. In more restrictive places, an adverse effect exists. The MID is an ineffective policy to promote homeownership and improve social welfare. © 2014 The President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
