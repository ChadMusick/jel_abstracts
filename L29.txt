L29|Analysis of Business Development on Organic Products at Muslim SMEs (MSMEs) in Malang, Indonesia|Objective - This study aims to determine the constraints on business development of organic products run by Muslim SMEs (MSMEs) in Malang city. Businesses concerned with organic generally adopt the principles of health, ecology, justice and protection. Organic products are very popular in today's global market. This is because organic products provide great opportunity for development. However, the requirements of organic products can be quite stringent, as is the experience of developers of organic products in Muslim SMEs (MSMEs) in Malang, Indonesia. Methodology/Technique - This research analyses the root problem using a fishbone method. To determine the main problem, an AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) method is used. The data is obtained using FGD (Focus Group Discussion) attended by informants with an understanding of organic products produced by: Lily Group, Organic Vigur, Representatives of AOI (Organic Alliance of Indonesia) and Representatives of Pamor (Association of Organic Society) in East Java. Finding and Novelty - The research results identifies the problems faced by Muslim SMEs including: raw material, market condition, organic certification, and financial and social capital. Furthermore, the main policy issue faced by these businesses is organic certification. The implications of these policies impact market accessibility and expansion of market reach. The novelty of this research is the identification of the effect of business development policies on Muslim SMEs producing organic products.
L29|Multi-dimensional Individual Work Performance: Predictors and Mediators|Objective - Individual work performance (IWP) has been researched time and time again in the past few decades. Interestingly enough, existing research on IWP focuses mainly on the area of work production and lacks an in-depth holistic understanding of IWP and other interrelated work behaviours. In this study, IWP is explored in the context of a multidimensional construct that includes the dimensions of task, contextual, and counterproductive behaviours. The purpose of this research is to investigate whether the three variables of work engagement (WE), psychological empowerment (PE), and subjective well-being (SWB) mediate and correlate with the relationship between perceived organisational support (POS) and IWP. Methodology/Technique - 780 employees from 4 organisations in Jakarta were selected to participate in this study. The respondents were tasked with responding to five questionnaires including (1) IWP of Koopmans, (2) POS of Eisenberger, (3) SWB of Diener, (4) WE of Baker and Schaufeli, (5) PE of Spreitzer. The data was analysed using structural equation modelling. Findings - The results show that the proposed structural model aligns with the empirical data [X2 (0, N = 780) = 0, p = 1.000; RMSEA=.000]. This research concludes that the relationship between POS and IWP is best mediated by either WE, PE or SWB. Among the three mediators, WE plays the greatest role in mediating the relationship between POS and IWP. Novelty - These findings expand on previous research on the weak relationship between POS and IWP.
L29|The Impact Of Training On Employee Effectiveness|It is commonly believed that training leads to an increase in the competencies of employees and therefore an increase in their performance. This view is based on the assumption that companies and organizations lack necessary competencies and that this shortage limits their effectiveness. The second assumption is that the increase in abilities achieved in the training process will translate into improved results. In the following article, we present an alternative thesis in which training can and often does, lead to a decrease in productivity. We present two reasons why training can lead to poorer results: 1.relative oversupply of competencies in the company and the associated misidentification of the competency gap, and2.apparent efficiency gains - i.e. not leading to improved results - in a situation where there are productivity bottlenecks that are not a result of work efficiency. This thesis is supported by research conducted during observations made by one of the authors, which is presented in the form of observations and comments. The second is the ValueView method, the results of which, are referred to in the text. In the summary of the article, we indicate ways in which the planning of training events can be improved, their subordination to short-term business objectives, and the use of modern techniques of organizational planning.
L29|Tourism Policy for Encouraging the Development of SMEs in Belitong, Indonesia|Objective – This study discusses the role of tourism policy in the development of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the province of Belitong, Indonesia. Methodology/Technique – This research applies mixed method analysis through the use of likert-scale questionnaires and interviews. The respondents completing the survey are from SME proprietors. Following the questionnaire, an interview with the Regent was delivered to confirm the findings. Findings – The research shows that people working in SMEs agree that tourism policy encourages the development of SMEs. However, it is shown that tourism policies need to be more inclusive, particularly with respect to shifting such policies from a mining (extractive) economy into a tourism economy. Novelty – This study resiliently makes suggestions for the improvement of public communication; some people fail to comprehend tourism policies which may lead to the ineffectiveness of the programs.
L29|Entrepreneurial Personality in Predicting Self-Regulation on Small and Medium Business Entrepreneurs in Pekanbaru, Riau, Indonesia|Objective – The present study was conducted to describe the psychological state of the entrepreneur in the utilization of resource potential and business development, and to identify the personality factors that most influence self-regulation in SMEs entrepreneurs. Methodology/Technique – This study was performed using a measurement scale in order to test the response of the personality factors and self-regulation of entrepreneurs of SMEs in Pekanbaru, Riau. The sample included 152 entrepreneurs of SMEs. Regression analysis was been applied to test the influence of the personality factors contributing towards self-regulation. In addition, descriptive response analysis is used to describe the response shown by the participants regarding the variables measured. Findings – The analysis shows that personality factors (openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness) have a significant effect on self-regulation in entrepreneurs in Pekanbaru City. The results also show that the personality factor neuroticism does not have a significant effect on self-regulation in entrepreneurs of SMEs in Pekanbaru, Riau. Novelty – SMEs in Indonesia hold the potential for increasing economic growth. Despite this, the Central Bureau of Statistics has recorded a decrease in the number of new SMEs from 2011 to 2014.
L29|A Business Model Bridging Knowledge Gaps|Starting with a case-study we illustrate an emerging business model for the Industrial Internet of Things that applies to other ITC-based industries as well. We formalize this business model by importing the concept of structural holes into semantic networks and suggest that a similar logic applies to conceptual maps of consumers’ behaviour, too.
L29|Trust and signals in workplace organization: evidence from job autonomy differentials between immigrant groups|While much work has considered trust’s effect on workplace organization, particularly the granting of job autonomy, this relationship remains essentially a black box, lacking insight on the deeper process underlying employers’ ultimate trust or autonomy decision. I seek to unpack the trust-organization nexus, focusing on the role of employers’ inferences about employees’ trustworthiness. Integrating extant literatures, I posit that employers use group membership—and specific group-level traits—as an observable signal concerning individual employees’ trustworthiness and decide how much autonomy to grant to employees that have similar observable individual-level qualities but belong to different, easily recognizable social groups. Empirical analysis of job autonomy differentials between groups of migrants with different ethnonational identities reveals systematic patterns of variation that cannot be explained on the basis of observable employee traits alone. Hence, the evidence strongly supports the signalling value of group membership, demonstrating an important real-world feature of trust governing workplace organization.
L29|The Role of Leadership Styles and Entrepreneurial Orientation in Distingushing more from less Succcessful Organizations|Competitive advantage has an extremely important place in strategic thinking both within the organization and the country. The international competitiveness of a country is a reflection of the ability of the organizations within it to achieve success both on the national and international markets. The latest scientific researches attribute organizational performance and consequently competitive advantage to its leaders and their ability to optimally use available resources. Sources have shown that leaders facing the ongoing globalization market challenges through their behaviour can improve the organization's performance. Effective leaders enable it by increasing the level of entrepreneurial orientation of the organization (nurturing its proactive, innovative and risk-taking characteristics) through the interrelationships among its workers as well as their commitment, confidence and motivation for greater work quality. All these favourable effects are primarily enabled by transformational leadership style, first described by Burns (1978), and elaborated in detail by Bass (1985a), whose implementation is dominantly advocated in modern organizations. This paper explores which leadership characteristics can be used to improve the organization's performance, and whether less successful organizations can be distinguished from the ones that are more successful. The results of this study show that there are specific characteristics that the organization should nurture if it wants to be successful and that less successful organizations can be distinguished from the ones that are more successful according to leadership style they use.
L29|Timing of Proactive Organizational Consulting: Difference between Organizational Perception and Behaviour|The aim of this paper is to show organizational perceptions and behaviours regarding proactive search for consultancy services. Management consulting is operating primarily through the analysis of perceived and existing organizational problems, but on the other hand it could be considered as a creation of value for organizations through the application of knowledge, techniques and, assets to improve organizational performance which is in the unknown and hidden potential part of organizational Johari window. Perceptions of organization are shown through managers and consultants perceptions survey in southeast Europe region. From the other side as an empirical base of real managerial behaviours there is a database of companies which had been proactively asking for consultancy services in southeast Europe region. This research is based on Adizes Institute database, which is the reason we have introduced the Adizes Corporate Lifecycle model theory. We will show the difference of perceptions at what stage in lifecycle organizations should engage consultant help and reality, when companies actually do that. We will use data analysis results to discuss whether timing when organizations decide to proactively engage consultants is the right time for such engagement.
L29|Les délais de paiement sont stables en 2015|À fin 2015, les indicateurs du crédit interentreprises présentent une grande stabilité par rapport à l’année précédente : les délais clients s’établissent à 44 jours de chiffre d’affaires, les délais fournisseurs à 50 jours d’achats et le solde commercial à 12 jours de chiffre d’affaires. En tendance depuis 2000, malgré la baisse des délais de paiement, le solde commercial (ou solde du crédit interentreprises) a augmenté de 2 jours sur la période, alimenté par une baisse plus rapide des délais clients que des délais fournisseurs. L’hétérogénéité sectorielle reste marquée, et s’explique principalement par des spécificités propres à chaque secteur d’activité : nature de la clientèle, usages dans les relations commerciales. Les retards de paiement ne s’aggravent pas mais présentent toujours une marge d’amélioration. En effet, 32 % des entreprises sont victimes d’un paiement tardif et 29 % des entreprises paient elles-mêmes leurs fournisseurs en retard. Au niveau macroéconomique, ces retards engendrent un déficit de liquidité estimé à 16 milliards d’euros pour les petites et moyennes entreprises (PME) et 6 milliards pour les entreprises de taille intermédiaire (ETI). Pour faire face à ces tensions de trésorerie, les entreprises ont de plus en plus recours à l’affacturage, qui est un mode de financement court terme consistant à céder des factures à des établissements financiers en échange de liquidité immédiate.
L29|China's Decentralized Privatization and Change of Control Rights|A distinct feature of China's privatization is that its design and implementation are decentralized and administered by the local governments. Based on a proprietary survey dataset containing 3,000 firms in over 200 cities, this paper studies how city governments choose among various privatization methods, how these methods transfer control rights, and how they influence privatization outcomes. We find that less political opposition to labor downsizing and greater fiscal capacity prompt cities to choose direct sales to insiders (MBOs) as their privatization method. This method transfers the most control rights to private owners, retains the least government supports and is associated with most hardened budget constraints, restructure most effectively, and achieves the greatest performance improvement.
L29|The Relationship Between Organizational Climate And Job Satisfaction In Service Companies, Asociacion Del Clima Organizacional Y La Satisfaccion Laboral En Empresas De Servicios|Organizational Development and specifically the evaluation and monitoring of employee perceived factors that that increase satisfaction level and organizational climate is fundamental. This study examines a sample of 255 employees from three service companies at Pachuca de Soto, Hidalgo. The research was quantitative, descriptive and correlational and uses two instruments: Brown & LeighÂ´s Organizational Climate and J. L. MeliaÂ´s Job Satisfaction (S21/26). The results show that as favorable perception of the organizational climate increases so does the members/employeesâ€™ satisfaction
L29|Causal Reasoning in Corporate Annual Reports: The Truth and Nothing But the Truth?|Annual reports are companies’ business cards to present and explain important corporate performance outcomes, both internally and externally. On the basis of the well-explored self-serving attribution bias in publicly available but unaudited documents, the question remains whether the tendency to take personal credit for positive outcomes (acclaiming attributions) but to assign blame for negative outcomes to external circumstances (defensive attributions) also holds for legally regulated management reports. Beyond that, it remains to be clarified whether acclaiming and defensive attribution patterns are determined either by surrounding conditions (i.e. cognitive information-processing explanation) or by impression management strategies (i.e. motivational explanation). A unique panel dataset of Germany’s largest blue-chip corporations provides evidence of the existence of self-serving attribution patterns in the explanations provided for cause-consequence relations in corporate management reports. With regard to acclaiming attributions, our findings support motivational intentions. With regard to the defensive attributions, however, the cognitive information-processing explanation dominates.
L29|Strengthening the Management of Ubiquitous Internet by Refining ISO/IEC 27001 Implementation Using a Generic Responsibility Model|The recent emergence of decentralized networks and ubiquitous Internet has highlighted the need for a better management of the companies’ IT architecture and for an improvement of the users of the network’s responsibility. Many standards have recently emerged to face these requirements. By analyzing them, we observe that they all include reference to the user responsibility but also that no common understanding of it exists. These statements have oriented our research toward the elaboration of an innovative, simple and pragmatic responsibility model that includes a user commitment dimension. ISO/IEC 27001:2005 is one of that new standard that aims at providing a framework for improving the information system management and the security of IT architecture. Although this standard is recognized over the globe, many surveys and cases studies provide interesting feedback about its implementation problems. In this paper, we introduce our responsibility model, we depict the responsibility aspects encompassed in ISO 27001 and we propose some improvement perspectives to face these problems and strengthen its implementation.
L29|The Effects of High Growth on New Business Survival|High-growth, young businesses have received increased attention in the research and policy sphere because of their job creation potential. However, relatively less attention has focused on the effects of high growth on firm survival and its implications for job creation and destruction dynamics. This paper analyzes the effect of high employment growth on the survival of new establishments and the survival patterns of high-growth firms in the U.S. State of Georgia. We use the National Establishment Time-Series (NETS) data to examine the new establishments that started between 1990 and 1999 and trace their employment dynamics through 2008. We analyze how early-stage employment growth impacts the survival rate of these establishments. Our analysis provides evidence that high employment growth early in their life cycle significantly reduces the likelihood of subsequent failure.
L29|A cross-generational perspective of workers? expectations in the canadian public service sector|The public service sector is faced with sharp demographic shifts which have an effect on employees? perspectives on job satisfaction. Relationships between workers belonging to different age groups are perceived as uneasy, especially since the ?mentoring? approach, aimed at bridging the gap between younger and older staff, yielded mixed results. This problem is compounded by gender related differential expectations regarding work. The aim of this research was to study the individual and combined effects of gender and age on work-related expectations and overall job satisfaction. The sample included 182 165 public service employees from various government agencies representing approximately 70% of the entire canadian federal work force. Data was collected using the PSES (Public Service Employee Survey), a questionnaire measuring a variety of constructs such as job satisfaction, social support, stress, harassment, fairness, social climate, demands, control and so forth. The sample took part in the study in 2009 and 2014. Participants were included in a 3 X 2 factorial design (age groups X gender) with various indicators of work perception used as dependent variables. MANOVAs and ANOVAs were computed and significant effects were decomposed using Scheffé post hoc tests. A significant multivariate effect of the factors was found [F(multi) = 16.56 ; p.
L29|Networks and Firm Performance: A Case Study of Vietnamese Small and Medium Enterprises|Small and medium enterprises play an important role in developing and transition economies. Recently, more attention has been paid to the role of networks in improving firm performance. By using data from the DANIDA project on SME survey with more than 2,500 manufacturing firms in Vietnam, we examine the relationship between networks and firm performance, particularly focusing on small and medium businesses. Network data covers four dimensions of networking including withinsector‐ network, across‐sector‐network, informal and formal creditors, and politicians and civil servants. Multivariate panel regressions have been applied. The results suggest that firm performance is positively related to the existence and the size of networks with individuals in a different sector and networks connecting to politicians and civil servants.
L29|Die Bedeutung der eigentümer- und familiengeführten Unternehmen in Deutschland|Die vorliegende Studie untersucht, wie sich der Anteilswert der eigentümer- und familiengeführten Unternehmen an der Gesamtzahl aller Unternehmen seit dem Jahr 1998 verändert hat. Hierzu wurden rund 16.500 repräsentativ ausgewählte deutsche Unternehmen auf ihre Eigentums- und Leitungsstrukturen hin untersucht und die Ergebnisse auf die Gesamtheit aller deutschen Unternehmen hochgerechnet. Es zeigt sich, dass der Anteil der eigentümer- und familiengeführten Unternehmen von 94,8 % (1998) auf 93,6 % (aktuelles Berichtsjahr 2014) zurückgegangen ist. Des Weiteren wurde untersucht, welche Bedeutung reinen Hilfseinheiten innerhalb komplexer Unternehmen aktuell zukommt. Rund 33.300 Unternehmen (1,0 % bezogen auf alle deutschen Unternehmen) sind als reine Hilfseinheiten anzusehen und müssten entsprechend der Vorgaben der EU an die Unternehmensstatistik konsolidiert werden.
L29|Culture and International Business|National culture is still an important factor in managing a wide spectrum of areas and forms of international business. The understanding of the concept of culture, respectively the values and practices of foreign business partners, is instrumental in achieving effective intercultural communication and international business. The notion of culture as a set of schemes and codes (culture-as-a-code) gives ground to the context dependent concept of culture (culture-in-context). Although the context dependent paradigm of culture is not a new phenomenon, the international business practice has not capitalized on its contributions yet. The paper does not aim at comprehensively revealing the nature of culture and its components. The focus is on those issues which have proved its significance for international business practice. The thesis states that culture is dynamically enfolded in international business practice and its specific context. That’s why contemporary international business players should be knowledgeable about both the traditional postulates about the culture factor and the dynamic aspects of cultural, including intercultural, matters. On the basis of a literature review and analytical reasoning, the paper strives to shed light on the topical debate on culture and its implications for international business.
L29|Délais de paiement : en 2014, le solde du crédit interentreprises reste à un niveau historiquement élevé|En 2014, alors que les délais de paiement poursuivent leur repli, le solde du crédit interentreprises demeure à un niveau historiquement haut. Un tiers des entreprises reste concerné par des retards de paiement. Ces retards représentent un coût implicite pour les trésoreries des entreprises, particulièrement pour les PME.
L29|Learning from Experience: The Project Team is the Key|Background: Learning from experience and knowledge management described in existing literature evidence that there are different practices that enable these processes, and that a distinction between implicit and explicit knowledge is essential for our analysis.
L29|Team adaptation|We model an organization as a team choosing between a status quo project and a potentially superior alternative. We show that the members’ concern for each other’s motivation leads to a lack of communication, resulting in a failure to adapt (i.e. the status quo is maintained even when evidence for the alternative’s superiority has been observed). Adaptation failures are particularly severe when production exhibits strong complementarities. Improving the organization’s aggregate information has the adverse effect of reducing communication. In the long run, the organization can become “locked-in” with the status quo, in that adaptation is impaired for every adoptable alternative.
L29|Romanian Cultural Specificity Reflected In The Romanian Post-December Studies|In this article we proposed an inventory of the main post-December researches conducted by Romanian researchers, on the Romanian cultural specificity, with suggestions of valorization in organizations, especially for the management. The analyzed diagnoses, whose findings are synthetically presented, are grouped according to their reference level: national or regional one. The conclusions extract the main axiomatic trends, discussing the positive and / or negative implications within the working place.
L29|Intercultural Competence Between Desirability And Necessity|This article is an attempt to scan and inventory the key aspects concerning intercultural competence on appeal to literature and information provided by training centers. Punctually, our concerns have focused on the definition and components of intercultural competence, but also on some models and tools that form it. Specific aspects in management were highlighted and we make a proposal for a positive exploitation of the ample material, a rather redundant one which we had access to using innovative collaborative networks, within a multidisciplinary and multicultural project.
L29|Economics of leadership and hierarchy|This paper explores leadership within hierarchical organizations. For each hierarchy, I consider a dynamic signaling game in which each player observes only the actions of his direct superiors before choosing his action. At the top of the hierarchy are the leaders, who learn the state from nature. The hierarchy controls the flow of information and the timing of the game, and determines the equilibrium output and welfare. I show that the welfare-optimal hierarchy is the chain, because it maximizes the incentive of players to “lead by example” for their subordinates. The chain remains optimal even in the presence of verifiable or unverifiable costly information acquisition by the leaders.
L29|Does “small bank advantage” really exist? Evidence from China|A small bank advantage indicates that small banks have a comparative advantage in granting relationship lending to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This paper used loan data from Chinese SMEs to test this hypothesis during a financial crisis and during non-crisis times. Compared with large banks, small banks are only superior in offering SMEs relationship lending through a pre-existing relationship, regardless of the financial crisis. Without pre-existing relationships, small and large banks have no advantage in providing loans to SMEs. We also find that there is no significant positive association between bank size and whether an SME changes its lending bank or the number of its financing sources, regardless of whether there is currently a financial crisis. The results indicate that small banks fail to maintain a strong relationship with SMEs, possibly because of the hold-up problem resulting from relationship lending.
L29|Implementation of Accounting Standard on Small and Medium-Sized Entities (SMEs)|"""Objective – Small- and medium-sized entities (SMEs) have an important role in economic growth. SMEs are a key source of employment and economic growth in Indonesia. Unfortunately, the growth of SMEs is not accompanied by the implementation of accounting and reporting, in accordance with applicable of Indonesian Accounting Standards for Non- Publicly-Accountable Entities (SAK-ETAP). SAK-ETAP is a self-contained of accounting standard for many transactions and events that a small or medium-sized entity or a private entity that is not publicly accountable may face. This research aims to analyse the implementation of Indonesian Accounting Standard for Non-Publicly-Accountable Entities on SMEs. Methodology/Technique – This research was conducted with the approach of surveys and field observations. The collection of data through surveys using questionnaires, direct observation and interviews according to respondents' experiences. Unit of analysis in this study is organizational or business unit. Its mean, that this study uses the organization as the subject to conclude the process of identification, implementation and evaluation Indonesian Accounting Standards for Non-Publicly- Accountable Entities or SMEs. Findings – The results of this study showed that only a small percentage of SMEs that have used SAK-ETAP as a guide in the preparation of the accounting and financial statements. This contrasts with the important role of SMEs in GDP of almost 58%. For that is very necessary the role of related institutions in supporting the development of SMEs in Indonesia, particularly in the financial statements standard. The majority of SMEs just recording to identify the transaction and recording the amount of revenue. Primary problem faced was the lack of their knowledge of SAK-ETAP and the competence of accounting staff were less. Novelty – This financial report is a major concern, as the financial statements providing financial information, financial performance, and cash flows of business units. If there are weaknesses in recording in the financial statements of SMEs it becomes a challenge for an institution that is competent to fix it. Socialization and guidance of SAK-ETAP are needed and more intensive to SMEs in Indonesia."""
L29|Compensation and Intrinsic Motivation in Nonprofit and For-Profit Organizations|We develop a theoretical model in which for-profit and nonprofit employers compete to hire a worker who derives intrinsic motivation from the nonprofit’s social mission. We also use a unique data set of California establishments to provide new evidence on sectoral differences in pay and HRM systems, finding a greater incidence of training and benefits in nonprofits, lower wages (with the wage gap increasing in skill level), and less incentive pay than in for-profits. The model is used to interpret both this new evidence and other empirical results from the literature, including the inconclusive sign of the FP-NP wage differential.
L29|Training & Development Barometer for Effective Transformation of Organizational Commitment and Overall Performance in Banking Sectors of KPK, Pakistan: Qualitative study of Workforce of Bank of Khyber|This research paper investigates the impact of T&D program on the level of employees' organizational commitment and overall performances in the Banking sector of KPK by considering Bank of Khyber as a case study. Study aims to critically examine all three attributes of organizational commitment (affective, normative, and continuance commitment respectively) and its impact on the job satisfaction in banking sector of KPK, Pakistan. The notions of Guest et.al, (2003) and Wall & Wood (2005) are taken as a foundation to explore the linkage between organisational commitment and T&D program, however both these studies had not investigated all three attributes in equal manner. The focus of these previous studies were more on affective and continuance commitment and did not investigate the causes and consequences that make these attributes to create an impact on the overall performances. Thus this study is significant because it attempts to explain in exploratory manner the reasons behind impact created by training. Inductive approach in a cross-sectional design following interpretive research philosophy research is carried out. The bank of Khyber, KPK is case study selected with 15 regional and branch managers as participants for interviews and 277 employees participated in the survey questionnaire, selected through stratified, convenience, and random sampling technique. Results of present study indicates that to retain skilled workforce, organization has to work on their continuance commitment by offering them promotion and salary increment because these are two factors that enable firms to retain skilled workers. Training increases employees' affective and normative commitment more in general as compare to continuance commitment. This paper contributes to the field of management and administrative sciences by investigating the relationship between T&D program and employees' performance and organisational commitment by exploring workforce and management's perspective through financial institution. It adds to the managerial literature related to T&D in relation with organisational commitment and overall performance in developing country's context.
L29|Competitive Advantage From Resource Theory And Capabilities, La Ventaja Competitiva, Desde La Teoria De Recursos Y Capacidades|This work presents a description-correlation type research with non experimental design to identify competitive advantages and the determining factors of organizational capacities. The objective is to identify the perception of employees in respect of personalization capacities and reconfiguration of the company in which they work and their relationship to the competitive advantage of the firm. To achieve this, a sample size of 100 employees from the productive sector of the City of Tecate in Baja California, Mexico was used. A questionnaire was used as reported by MÃ¡ynez-Guaderrama, et al. 2013. We determine reliability by means of Cronbachâ€™s alpha resulting in a reliability index of 0.798. The results obtained reveal a positive but weak association exists between organizational capacities studied and the competitive advantage.
L29|Women'S Leadership In Management Of Hidalgo To Companies: An Analysis Of Its Associated Practices And Circumstances The Post,El Liderazgo Femenino En Directivos De Empresas Hidalguenses: Un Analisis Sobre Sus Practicas Y Circunstancias Asociadas Al Puesto|The present study examines the role of women as managers in Hidalgoâ€™s labor force. It also examines the circumstances they experience during the process that led them to obtain and maintain the leadership position. Two instruments were used. The IPL (Leadership Practices Inventory) of Kouzes and Posner (2003) and a survey based on Moncayo and Zuluanga (2014). The population was 110 female managers and 330 subordinates in 22 medium-sized companies from the state of Hidalgo. The results show a high level of agreement between management and subordinates. The results demonstrate the most prevalent components of IPL are: to inspire a shared vision, enable others to act and model that way, and that the main reasons why a woman decides to seek a management position is to obtain a better salary, personal satisfaction and experience.
L29|Career Prospects and Effort Incentives: Evidence from Professional Soccer|It is difficult to test the prediction that future career prospects create implicit effort incentives because researchers cannot randomly “assign” career prospects to economic agents. To overcome this challenge, we use data from professional soccer, where employees of the same club face different external career opportunities depending on their nationality. We test whether the career prospect of being selected to a Euro Cup national team affects players’ pre-cup performances, using nationals of countries that did not participate in the Euro Cup as a control group. We find that the Euro Cup career prospect has positive effects on the performances of players with intermediate chances of being selected to their national team, but negative effects on the performances of players whose selection is very probable. Our findings have implications for the incentive effects of within-firm promotions and of external career opportunities. This paper was accepted by John List, behavioral economics.
L29|Size of Training Firms: The Role of Firms, Luck, and Ability in Young Workers' Careers|This paper analyzes how life-cycle unemployment of former apprentices depends on the size of the training firm. We start from the hypotheses that the size of training firms reduces long-run cumulated unemployment exposure, e.g. via differences in training quality and in the availability of internal labor markets, and that the access to large training firms depends positively on young workers' ability and their luck to live in a region with many large and medium-sized training firms. We test these hypotheses empirically by using a large administrative data set for Germany and find corroborative evidence.
L29|On the cultural profile of project management|The dominance of technical over the behavioral elements of projects is considered as a failure factor in project management (PM). Projects are not just a technocratic solution but also a social system. Thus, the practice of PM, viewed as an overall management approach, is a function of technical competences of PM but also of the presence and development of certain cultural values among the people in the organization. As far as the origin of modern PM comes from Western management culture, the extent of transferability of “Western” PM knowledge in the practice of other countries, whose national cultural peculiarities differ from the Western ones, is questionable. At the same time professional PM training might be instrumental in changing work values as required by the professional PM culture. In addition to national and professional culture, other cultural layers also play a role, for example organizational culture, and personality characteristics of the individual - participant in international projects. It is the responsibility of the very project manager to judge the ratio of influence which various cultural layers exert on the management of each single project. The article aims at assisting international project managers in their judgment about the cultural profile of the projects, they are responsible for.
L29|The Managerial Culture. A Literature Review|This article aims to analyze the evolution of the managerial culture concept in order to assessthe importance of manager and of his / her personality during the processes of decision makingand implementing in an organization. In order to achieve this goal, an ethic approach is employedand a qualitative research is developed. Thus, the articles published on Proquest that included inthe tile, abstract or key words one of the next phrases: â€œcultureâ€ , â€œorganizational cultureâ€ orâ€œmanagerial cultureâ€ , are analyzed. The results prove that the managerial culture represents asubject of interest for both academics and practitioners since it comprises a set of elements whichare absolutely indispensable in the process of establishing the corporate strategies. These findingshave both theoretical and practical implications; on the one hand, it synthesis how the conceptevolved and, on the other hand, it brings forward its importance in organizational environment.

Se soporta en la tipología de las transgresiones del “greenwashing”, identificando comportamientos explicativos contradictorios por parte de una compañía, incluyendo sus reportes de sostenibilidad. El estudio ilustra un planteamiento teórico soportado en un caso de estudio en donde se identifican elementos para reconocer señales de reportes difusos y en últimas, permita detectar el “greenwashing” corporativo.
L29|Capability vs Competency: A Case of Vishpala Prosthetics|To understand a business, its operations or its competitiveness, it is important to understand the competition and factors of production. These factors help in evaluating the profitability of a firm, its growth prospects and eventual long-term survival. Further, to ensure survival (sustainability) of the firm, it is essential to ascertain the plausible source of competitive advantage, such as core competency. The firm faces with the choice to either build all such required competencies in-house or to somehow acquire them from outside. This paper takes the case of Vishpala Prosthetics and tests the issues of competency in the practical perspective of strategy implementation.The paper converge the two diverging perceptions of the firm, capability versus competency, by analyzing the resource that is valuable to the firm.
L29|Entrepreneurship, Technological Innovation, and Economic Growth: Empirical Analysis of Panel Data|Abstract This article aims to develop elements of answers to the effect of adequate entrepreneurial activity that would have effects on economic growth. This work analyzes the relationship between entrepreneurship and economic growth for a panel of developing countries over the 2004–2011 periods. In this study, we used two measures of entrepreneurship: the new density and the potential of innovation. We estimated a growth function using the method of static and dynamic panel data. Our results show that the new density and growth are significantly and positively correlated. Our results also show that if the short-term impact of technological innovation on growth is negative, this effect is positive in the long term. This result confirms the theoretical predictions, namely the theory of spillage.
L29|Los factores determinantes del comportamiento innovador de las cooperativas: un análisis para el caso de Castilla y León<BR>[Determining factors of the innovative behavior of cooperatives: an analysis of the case of Castilla y León]|Las cooperativas tienen una larga trayectoria histórica en la economía española y han demostrado su capacidad para competir frente a las empresas tradicionales en el mercado. Para mantener esa capacidad, además de aprovechar las ventajas competitivas vinculadas con su idiosincrasia como empresas de la economía social, deben tener en consideración que la economía está crecientemente globalizada y, cada vez más, basada en el conocimiento, en especial, el de contenido tecnológico. Consecuencia de lo anterior, la capacidad innovadora aparece con un aspecto clave para hacer frente a sus competidores. En este artículo se caracteriza el comportamiento innovador de las cooperativas en Castilla y León y se analizan los factores internos y externos que afectan a su desempeño innovador, tomando como base los datos de una encuesta realizada a 581 cooperativas de la citada comunidad autónoma. Los resultados del análisis empírico realizado, que se lleva a cabo mediante regresión logística binaria multivariante sobre distintos tipos de innovación, permiten identificar la dimensión de las organizaciones, la existencia de planificación, las actividades de I+D y el capital humano como los principales factores determinantes.
L29|Size of Training Firms and Cumulated Long-run Unemployment Exposure – The Role of Firms, Luck, and Ability in Young Workers’ Careers|This paper analyzes how life-cycle unemployment of former apprentices depends on the size of the training firm. We start from the hypotheses that the size of training firms reduces long-run cumulated unemployment exposure, e.g. via differences in training quality and in the availability of internal labor markets, and that the access to large training firms depends positively on young workers' ability and their luck to live in a region with many large and medium-sized training firms. We test these hypotheses empirically by using a large administrative data set for Germany and find corroborative evidence.
L29|Capacitación como componente de desarrollo productivo en las microempresas: El Caso de la FEDEMYPE Santa Cruz|Las MYPES son una parte importante de la economía nacional, los microempresarios identifican a la falta de capacitación como un factor determinante para mejorar su productividad; sin embargo, cuando se les pregunta qué tipo de capacitación necesitan, no existe consenso sobre sus necesidades. El presente estudio de caso busca mostrar la situación actual de las MYPES con respecto a sus necesidades de capacitación a través de un trabajo con la FEDEMYPE Santa Cruz. Entre las principales razones del porqué no existe consenso entre las necesidades de capacitación está la gran diversidad de las MYPES y el distanciamiento entre la oferta de capacitación brindada por instituciones gubernamentales y no gubernamentales con la demanda de capacitación de las micro y pequeñas empresas. Por otro lado, también se realizó una recapitulación de los tipos de capacitación que se socializó con la FEDEMYPE con el fin de complementar estudio.

L29|The Psychological Contract|The psychological contract became known as a research paradigm within corporate research, providing a broad framework which explains the employee-company relations. Despite all this, there are still many debates on the concept and a series of criticism were expressed that led to the necessity of some more rigorous theoretical and empirical analysis. The psychological contract refers to the unwritten, implicit expectations that employees have from the company and vice versa; it is that which defines the things the employee expects from the employer. Consequently, each of the parties involved in the contract may have different perceptions on these commitments and obligations. Thus the psychological contract may be regarded as an exchange relation between the employer and the employee. Breaking the psychological contract affects the performance, the morale, and the motivation of the staff in a negative manner. The information presented in this paper is intended to contribute to the theoretical and methodological development of the concept.
L29|Análisis de la actividad emprendedora de los sectores de la transformación y servicios industriales en Cartagena de Indias - Colombia|El sector de la transformación y de los servicios a la industria son los que aportan más en términos de valor agregado a la ciudad de Cartagena de Indias (Colombia). En el presente estudio se analizan estos sectores desde una perspectiva de emprendimiento, utilizando el Modelo del Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM). Los resultados son coherentes con los reportes de crecimiento del industria en la ciudad, ya que los emprendedores que están involucrados en estos sectores tienen una estructura enfocada más a la perdurabilidad, la motivación por oportunidad y la innovación. Comparativamente, los resultados muestran una mayor fortaleza de estos sectores en comparación con el sector de consumo. ****** The transformation and services sectors, in the industry, are those providing more in terms of added value to Cartagena. This research addresses an analysis of these sectors from a perspective on entrepreneurship using the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor model (GEM). Our results are consistent with the reports about the industry growth in Cartagena due to the fact that entrepreneurs, involved in these sectors, have a structure more focused on sustainability, motivation by opportunity and innovation. The results also show, comparatively, an increased strength between these sectors compared to the consumer one.
L29|China’s Decentralized Privatization and Change of Control Rights|A distinct feature of China’s privatization is that both its design and its implementation are highly decentralized and are administered by the local governments. Based on a survey of 3,000 firms in over 100 Chinese cities, this paper studies how city governments choose among various privatization methods, how these different methods transfer control rights from the government to private owners, and how various privatization methods lead to different restructuring and performance. Our data indicate that although privatization in China has made substantial progress in reallocating control rights from the government to private owners, the degree of remaining government influence in corporate decisions across different privatization methods varies significantly. More importantly, political and fiscal constraints critically determine city governments’ decisions on how to privatize. Cities with less political opposition to labor shedding and where the government has stronger fiscal capacity tend to choose direct sales to insiders (MBOs) as the privatization method, which transfers control rights to private owners most completely. As a result, MBO firms restructure most effectively and achieve the greatest performance improvement.
L29|Standardization and the impacts of voluntary program participation: Evidence from environmental auditing|We explore how limits to our insight about the underlying decision-making structure of firms may affect the conclusions we draw about the likely impacts of participation in voluntary environmental programs. We develop a theoretical model to examine the conditions under which a multi-facility firm chooses to employ a standardized adoption policy for a voluntary program. We test this model empirically using a firm-level dataset on the adoption of a voluntary environmental auditing program and find that, consistent with the theoretical model, a standardized auditing outcome is less likely among firms with more heterogeneous portfolios of facilities. We also examine the effect of environmental auditing on facility compliance using both firm-level and facility-level controls. We find that the estimated effect depends on whether or not measures that proxy for firm incentives for standardization are included in the analysis. These findings suggest caution in drawing conclusions on the effectiveness of voluntary programs in improving compliance based on analyses that assume standardization on the part of the firm.

The work aims to make two main contributions. First, by analyzing recent shifts in the world oil and gas industry and their implications from the perspective of changing supermajors’ market positions and economic power, this paper discloses the root causes of strategic moves undertaken by today's global «Big Oil» struggling with multiple competitive threats and simultaneously adjusting to the on-going industry transformation. Second, the work defines the core features of the supermajors' business model and examines whether the newly introduced strategy characteristics could be considered as business model innovation
L29|Leading Leadership Style to Motivate CulturalOriented Female Employees in I.T Sector of Developing Country: I.T Sectors' Responses from Pakistan|This empirical study explores different Leadership styles' dimensions influencing culturaloriented female employees' motivation in rapidly improving Pakistan's I.T sector. HypotheticoInductive-Deductive model was adapted to construct theoretical framework by opting mixed method under realism philosophy. Sample size is 357 female employees working in software houses of Pakistan's 10 cities selected by combining convenience sampling and stratified sampling techniques. Survey questionnaire contained close-ended questions based on Bass and Avolio (1994) Full Range MLQ Model and WMS. Moreover, 36 female employees were interviewed selected from top five business cities' of Pakistan's software houses through convenience sampling. Results indicate transformational leadership style's dimensions are dominant in motivating female employees scoring overall 0.75. Moreover, transactional has moderate positive relation (0.38) with sub-motivational variables. Though, 'Management-By-Expectation (Passive)' along with Laissez-faire leadership style has no relationship with sub-variables of motivation. In I.T sector of Pakistan, female employees are mainly motivated by interpersonal relations with supervisors, peers, and subordinate, friendly environment, flexibility, socialization, recognition, responsibility, social rewards, and most importantly improved working conditions. It is essential to motivate female workers through 'walk-the-talk' approach along with coerce and accurate vision.

We examine knowledge networks as facilitators of the aforementioned transmission among persons involved in globeo, metallic, decorating and packaging. The results show how the transfer of knowledge occurs and that this transfer is born home work involving the family. This occurs because work in the industry is seasonal and most people have a steady job. This work occurs at more than 400 workshops located in the zone operated under the modality of homework. We draw attention to the presence of and transfer of tacit knowledge with the support of social networks in the same workshops

L29|Is Spirit At Work Under Kaizen Environments Affected By Age, Education, Tenure And Position At The Organization?, En El Espiritu De Trabajo En Ambientes Kaizen Â¿Influye La Edad, La Escolaridad, La Antiguedad Y La Posicion En La Organizacion?|Human beings must cover not only physical, emotional and cognitive, but also spiritual necessities. This holds particularly true, when the individual is looking to find a meaningful sense to his work. The current research is focused on analyzing the existence of differences in indicators of spirit at work considering demographic and organizational characteristics of the individuals. We examine individuals who work in a maquiladora plant of electronic articles located in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua. An empirical, quantitative and cross-sectional study was designed based on the existing literature, especially the literature on environments by Lean Kaizen. The instrument was applied to one-hundred subjects. Variance analysis examining the independent variables age, education, tenure and position held were performed. Results show that spirit at work under a Lean Kaizen environment is actually affected by age, education, tenure and position held.
L29|People or Trust in Building Commitment to Change?|The success of organizational change lies on people, in this regard on employee’s commitment to change. On the other hand, there are many variables that can influence the success of organizational change, such as the content of the change, the process of the change, individual characteristics, leadership, external environment and organizational context. The objective of this study is to identify the major contributor to people’s commitment to change, namely psychological empowerment (individual characteristics), and organizational trust (organizational context). The study was conducted at state owned organizations with 539 respondents. Data was collected using Commitment to Change Inventory, Psychological Empowerment, and Organizational trust Inventory. The data were analyzed using Multiple Regression and Structural Equation Model (SEM). The results of the study showed that both Psychological Empowerment and Organizational Trust have positive and significant correlation and contribution to Commitment to Change. The study also showed that both Organizational Trust and Psychological Empowerment have higher impact to affective commitment to change compares to other dimensions of commitment to change. The implications of the study can be used for organizational change practitioner, to create trustworthy organizational climate, and to develop Psychological Empowerment, in order to create high commitment to change.
L29|Not all smooth sailing: Barriers to small business success for owner/managers from Middle Eastern communities in Melbourne|There has been very little international research on Arab entrepreneurs from the Middle East, who began to land on American shores during the late 1880s and on other parts of the world for decades. Little attention has also been given to Arab entrepreneurs from the Middle East, who began to land on Australian shores during the late 1860s, and who have been greatly contributing to the Australian economy and cultural diversity for almost 150 years. Thus, in an attempt to fill the gap, this paper investigates barriers to small business success, using a sample of Middle Eastern communities in Melbourne, Australia, specifically the Lebanese, Egyptian and Iraqi communities, the three largest in the state of Victoria with developed community infrastructures. Unfortunately, a list of the total target population did not conveniently exist for sampling purposes; and it was impractical to compile such a list, therefore, cluster sampling was utilized, particularly, area sampling, as geographic areas were identified. For pragmatic reasons, and to enhance representativeness of the sample, PPS technique was used to identify the proportion of each sample for each community for interviews. Thus, around ten per cent (n=16) in proportion to the total number of working population (N=165) were subsequently interviewed. Individual in-depth, semi-structured and audiotaped interviews were conducted using a list of open-ended questions relating to the barriers to business success. Interviews were manually content-analyzed using conventional content analysis and constant comparative methods. Thus, the analysis of participants’ comments reflected the following barriers to business success: (i) dealing with difficult people; (ii) loss of support sources; (iii) personal idiosyncrasies of the owner/managers; (iv) financial barriers; (v) lack of specific business experience; and (vi) others. The analysis of participants’ comments also indicated that dealing with difficult people as a barrier to business success was further analysed into (A) extended family, friends and people from own community, (B) employees and (C) customers, the other five barriers could not be analysed further. Quotations and excerpts from interviews were used to facilitate understanding interviewees’ points of view, as well as to illustrate and support each the first and the second levels of analysis for each of the barriers. This study lies in its contribution to academic literature, and its results should improve understanding of entrepreneurial behavioral patterns through the development of teaching and training programs, which can assist government and relevant bodies in introducing public policy that helps improve entrepreneurs’ success.

L29|Dividends and family governance practices in private family firms|Intra-familial principal–principal conflict are a relevant agency problem in privately held family firms. These conflicts of interest commonly occur between active and passive family shareholders, and require remedies different from those that deal with principal-agent conflicts. This article empirically examines whether or not firms use dividends as instruments to cope with conflicts of interest between active and passive family shareholders and how family governance practices moderate this relationship. The results show that the existence of an intra-familial conflict of interest results in a higher propensity to pay dividends and that the use of family governance practices strengthens this relationship. Additionally, the findings suggest that using family governance practices leads to a more efficient dividend policy. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015
L29|Economic failure and the role of plant age and size|This paper introduces a large-scale administrative panel data set on corporate bankruptcy in Germany that allows for an econometric analysis of involuntary exits where previous studies mixed voluntary and involuntary exits. Approximately 83 % of all bankruptcies occur in plants with not more than 10 employees, and 61 % of all bankrupt plants are not older than 5 years. The descriptive statistics and regression analysis indicate substantial negative age dependence with respect to bankruptcy risk but confirm negative size dependence for mature plants only. Our results corroborate hypotheses stressing increasing capabilities and positional advantage, both predicting negative age dependence with respect to bankruptcy risk due to productivity improvements. The results are not consistent with the theories explaining age dependence via imprinting or structural inertia. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015
L29|Understanding the dynamics of entrepreneurship through framework approaches|Although entrepreneurship is not a new phenomenon, attempts to study it in a systematic manner are fairly recent. The field of entrepreneurship has evolved in a rather disjointed or seemingly random manner, and entrepreneurship has developed as a business discipline by borrowing, building upon, and adapting theoretical and conceptual work from such fields as sociology, psychology, anthropology, marketing, management, finance, organizational behavior, and engineering. And yet, it would appear that the volume of work attempting to describe, explain, and predict aspects of entrepreneurship has grown to a point where we can begin to develop a more complete and integrated picture. The purpose of this paper was to examine the various theoretical perspectives and frameworks of entrepreneurship and to offer an integrative perspective through a proposed “framework of frameworks” which ties together other existing frameworks, each of which explores a particular aspect of the overall phenomenon of entrepreneurship. The value of using a framework to explain and therefore better understand entrepreneurship is examined. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015
L29|Localisation as an Attribute of Competitiveness on the Economic Class Hotel Market|The article presents the results of the authors’ research into the influence of localisation factors on price behaviours (approval) of customers of economy class hotels in Wroclaw, with the identical purpose of stay. The factors affecting the price level of the hotel service were checked. A customer opinion poll with 43 premises was conducted. With the use of the factor analysis, substantial conditions were appointed. Out of seven formulated localisation premises (value attributes), three were included in the set of significant ones. Such preferences were affected by the tourist purpose of the stay. This purpose determines the preference of the localisation assessed according to the purpose of stay over standard localisation dimensions (distance from the station, airports, centre, roads). Creating competitiveness via localisation has solid bases but requires the examination of detailed conditions, which is shown in this article.
L29|In Quest of SME-Conducive Policy Formulation|The very topic raises a challenging question: that is, of the role and significance, if not the “survival,” of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and related structures amid forces, which – particularly in the sphere of industry – tend to favor the “big” over the “small” at first sight. At the same time, this points to underlying aspects and challenges of broader socioeconomic and structural dimensions with a concomitant need to formulate appropriate, more differentiated, and specifically designed business policies. Today, such challenges and related problems are seen as intertwined and multipronged, given (i) the growing international (not least as a strategic ingredient of development) perception of the role and exposure of SMEs in terms of their sector-related structural significance nationally, regionally, and globally; (ii) a closer-to-the-skin view of developments related to ongoing restructuring in the European business environment, which, in the context of SMEs, is in many ways regionally unique; and (iii) the overriding socioeconomic and systems-related aspects of a more comprehensive SME-specific policy formulation.
L29|Should I Stay or Should I Go? Participation and Decision-Making in Family Firms|We explore the implications of altruism in family firms for the allocation of decision-making rights. Our results suggest that centralization occurs in a broader range of circumstances in family than in nonfamily firms, consistent with empirical evidence. We show that an agent might remain in a decentralized family firm even though he prefers centralization, and that an agent might remain in a centralized family firm even when it does not do the type of work the agent prefers. We relate our findings to the relative performance of family versus nonfamily firms, and to problems of succession.
L29|Intercultural Communication in International Business through Transactional Culture Building|Intercultural communication is the central, integrating component in the system of inter­national business; the “glue” which binds all of the elements together. Although the field of in­ternational business communications is practice oriented, awareness of the philosophical and methodological foundations and of the analytical tools develops analysis and assessment skills in intercultural situations and reveals new practical options to the participants in the system of inter­national business. The article proceeds from the situation and context-based views of culture and intercultural communication. The thesis states that the transactional culture approach reflects the contemporary behavioural perspective in in­ternational business. Namely, behavioural chang­es in the participants in international business occur under the influence of the international­ization and globalization of economic processes. On the basis of a literature review, analytical reasoning and empirical observations, the article sheds light on the concept of transactional cul­ture and discusses its implications for intercul­tural communication in international business
L29|Students’ Potential For Authentic Leadership|To know yourself and to act accordingly has been seen as a moral imperative throughout history. The aim of this research was to determine potential of students for authentic leadership and relation between their authentic personality and potential for authentic leadership. The sample consisted of students (N=133) from Serbia (male – 59% and female – 41%). The average age of students was M=21.9. Instruments used were Authenticity Scale (Wood et al., 2008) and Authentic Leadership Self-Assessment Questionnaire (ALQ – Walumbwa et al., 2008). Authenticity scale had three subscales – authentic living, accepting external influence and self-alienation. Authentic Leadership Self-Assessment Questionnaire had four subscales – self-awareness, internalized moral perspective, balanced processing and relational transparency. Results showed that students are authentic persons - M=43.16 (with theoretical range of scores from 12 to 84) and have a potential for authentic leadership – M=57.41 (with theoretical range of scores from 16 to 80). Authentic personality in students is not a predictor of authentic leadership (R2=.001,F(1,132)=.08, p
L29|Informal Groups in Global Work Environment: Group Work or Team Work?|Groups and teams within the organizations represent a widespread subject of research nowadays. But there are aspects that still need to be considered, especially in a global economy which brings along new opportunities and challenges. In this context, in the present paper we aim to clarify the differences between formal group, informal group and team, but mostly between group work and team work, as different work styles in organization. We also point out the consequences of using the wrong type of work style in a specific task situation which is particularly important in actual global work environment.
L29|Quantum theory of firm|The present innovative research continues a series of scientific articles on a) the theory of the firm in the nonlinear dynamic financial and economic systems in the classic economics science, b) the information theory of the firm in the classic economics science, c) the quantum microeconomics theory in the quantum economics science, presenting the groundbreaking theoretical research results: 1) the quantum theory of firm in the frames of the quantum microeconomics theory in the quantum econophysics science is proposed; 2) the formulas (1, 2) to compute the firm’s discrete-time EBITDA (the firm’s value) changes at the different time moments are derived; 3) the formulas (3, 4) to calculate the distribution of a number of the firms’ excited business processes of certain value at the selected firm’s state in the economy of scale and scope are presented; 4) the notion on the wave function in the quantum econophysical time-dependent/time independent wave equations is introduced; 5) the formulas (5, 6) to predict the firm’s discrete-time EBITDA (the firm’s value) state changes in the national/global economies at the certain time moment, using the wave functions in the quantum econophysical time-dependent/time independent wave equations, are derived; 6) the quantum phenomena, including the possible weak/strong interactions between the firms in the national/global economies are described; 7) the comparative analysis between a big number of the classic theories of the firm and the quantum theory of the firm is completed, explaining the main characteristic differences and existing similarities; 8) the evolutionary shift from the classic theory of the firm to the quantum theory of the firm is described; 9) the perspectives on the application of the quantum theory of the firm with the aim to solve the various economic problems in the real- and speculative- sectors of economic markets are discussed.
L29|Making Sense of the Elusive Paradigm of Entrepreneurship|The term “entrepreneurship” apparently means different things to different people including scholars and thought leaders. Because entrepreneurship is multifaceted, it is studied from many different perspectives, yet, that has fostered a multitude of definitions. Even the scholarly literature (where normally the deepest understanding would be found) is rife with disparities and even contradictions about what is and is not entrepreneurship. Some have suggested a narrower and more defined focus on entrepreneurship where only bona fide entrepreneurship research theories would explain entrepreneurial phenomena. We believe that constricting the field may the wrong approach. Our purpose then is to try and make sense of the disparate meanings and views of entrepreneurship prevalent in both the scholarly literature as well as among thought leaders in business and policy. We reconcile the seemingly chaotic and contradictory literature by proposing a coherent approach to structure the disparate ways that entrepreneurship is used and referred to in the scholarly literature. We examine three coherent strands of the entrepreneurship literature and identify an emerging eclectic view of entrepreneurship, which combines several of the views prevalent in the main approaches discussed.
L29|CONTRIBUTING FACTORS OF EMPLOYEE’S PERFORMANCE: A CASE STUDY OF LOCAL NGOs IN PESHAWAR CITY|The research study has been focused to study the contributing factors towards employee’s performance. Performance of employees is one of the most significant factors for the growth and success of every organization. Data was collected through the distribution of questionnaires. 120 questionnaires as the sample size were distributed among the employees of local NGOs. The returned questionnaires were 106 having a response rate of 88.33%. The findings of the study found that job security, relationship with colleagues, relationship with supervisor, working conditions and employee’s empowerment were found to have significant impact on employee’s performance.
L29|Capability vs Competency: A Case of Vishpala Prosthetics|To understand a business, its operations or its competitiveness, it is important to understand the competition and factors of production. These factors help in evaluating the profitability of a firm, its growth prospects and eventual long-term survival. Further, to ensure survival (sustainability) of the firm, it is essential to ascertain the plausible source of competitive advantage, such as core competency. The firm faces with the choice to either build all such required competencies in-house or to somehow acquire them from outside. This paper takes the case of Vishpala Prosthetics and tests the issues of competency in the practical perspective of strategy implementation.The paper converges the two diverging perceptions of the firm, capability versus competency, by analyzing the resource that is valuable to the firm through the five tests as suggested by Collis & Montgomery (2008), viz. the test of inimitability, the test of durability, the test of appropriability, the test of substitutability and the test of competitive superiority. With this, the argument between capability versus competency is explained in the perspective of strategy implementation with the help of the case on the firm.
L29|Designinig collaborative processes among SMEs. An overview of inhibiting and motivational factors|This paper scrutinizes the ground rules for designing collaborative processes by focusing on inter-organizational collaboration and considering collaboration as a process for improving the competitiveness of small and medium sized firms (SMEs). In a need to be more competitive and facing an ever more knowledge-based environment, SMEs must collaborate in order to stay competitive and easily adjust to new situations. Collaboration in itself is perceived as a dynamic process taking place among various actors who come together to jointly achieve a beneficial outcome. This paper provides an overview of the evidence on common motives and inhibiting factors for collaboration among SMEs based on a review of the evidence.
L29|Market category generation by meta-contrast thesis|This study is based on the J.C. Turner et al. discussion of self-categorization and investigates generated categories in relation to existing categories. The research question in this study was: Does the existence of parallel categories clearly set boundaries for new categories? The aim of this study is to demonstrate the generation of categories in this market with cases of Japanese mini insurance. The conclusions were, firstly, that new product categories are generated in relation to parallel product categories and secondly that, if products have labels that can be clearly compared with parallel product categories, consumers can clearly see the boundaries between new and existing categories.
L29|Specific mechanisms for stimulating R&D investments within the EU|This paper consists of a meta-analysis of several studies regarding the innovation and R&D potential of the European Union, as well as the internal discrepancies among different member states. This part is followed by a comparative structural analysis of the main characteristics of innovative and non-innovative enterprises from the European Union, thus facilitating the identification of the most relevant aspects that are innovation-sensitive, as well as and the major obstacles that influence the innovative activity of companies. As a result, we were able to identify the most adequate mechanisms used for stimulating innovation and R&D activities and, therefore, we draw our concluding remarks and advanced several general recommendations concerning the governmental approaches innovation and R&D activities in the business enterprise sector.
L29|Good practices in social economy in Poland – about resources, resourcing and related challenges in social entrepreneurship (Analiza dobrych praktyk ekonomii spolecznej w Polsce – o zasobach i ich pozyskiwaniu w przedsiebiorczosci spolecznej)|The aim of this paper is to analyse and identify resources, resourcing ways and challenges related among “good practice” examples presented in “Atlas of social economy in Poland”. The Atlas has been promoted in the biggest Internet portal on social enterprise, social economy and social entrepreneurship in Poland. To achieve this aim, the author uses 25 cases of “good practices” presented in the Atlas and deconstructs the profiles’ content. Two types of social enterprise initiatives, as regards resource mobilization are identified. Also, related challenges are discussed in the context of resource mobilization.
L29|Efficiency or bounded rationality? Drivers of firm diversification strategies in Vietnam|Considering the case of diversified firms within a developing/transition country such as Vietnam, this paper investigates diversification relatedness while taking into account both firm- and industry-specific components. The high volatility of the dynamics of diversification observed in Vietnam suggests the hypothesis that firms decide to enter into new industries following a trial and error process, initiated by boundedly rational herding behaviors, i.e., firms follow the most commonly observed business combinations. Using a survivor-based (SB) measure of relatedness, we test the hypothesis of boundedly rational behavior. We find that both the probability of exit and the different performance measures (Return on sales and Total factor productivity) are not or are negatively correlated with SB-related diversification. This is in contrast to what has been observed in developed countries. However, using the SIC distance approach, we obtain the expected positive relationship between performance and relatedness in diversified firms. The conflicting result between these two relatedness indices therefore suggests there has been a trend in follow-up among inexperienced firms that imitate the direction and intensity of the diversification of dominating players within the industry (herd behavior). However, diversified firms gain experience over time and choose more efficient business combinations in subsequent entries. When we use the classical SIC-based approach, we find that greater diversification raises profitability, but only to an optimum relatedness point, beyond which the positive effect fades away. To control for the endogeneity of diversification relatedness and the serial correlation in error terms, we adopt an instrumental-variable two-stage least-squares estimation approach (IV-2SLS) with GMM treatment.

L29|The Spirit of the Law over its Letter: The Role of Culture and Social Norms in Shielding Cooperative Banks from Systemic Shocks|The macroeconomic impact of banks� misconduct led users of financial services to be deterred from using the system to the detriment of market integrity and called upon policy makers and supervisors to turn to �culture� as a means to regain public trust and eventually guarantee the stability of the real economy. From this vantage point, the crisis showed that culture did indeed matter, as it can significantly influence the effectiveness of decision-making process and, thus, the risk appetite/profile of banks. Culture and behaviour have shown to be the main threat to financial stability policy makers and supervisors have currently to cope with. What is already clear is that culture is an important subject to focus on when supervising banks. Nevertheless, the problem is that current academic thinking lacks both clarity and expertise on what �culture� is all about and how it should be implemented by banks. This paper addresses this gap by exploring the illustrative case of cooperative banks. Extensive empirical evidence shows indeed that cooperative banks turned out to be more stable than commercial banks for several reasons related to the ownership structure and the business model. However, the extant literature lacks to take into account whether cooperative values (i.e. solidarity; mutualism; proximity; social commitment) contributed in motivating employees to do the right thing and to steer away from reckless behaviour. The investigation brings to the fore the main question of whether and how cooperative banks� values and culture played a role in ensuring the soundness and efficiency of risk-taking policies.
L29|A Review of Recent Research on CEOs’ Influence on Firm Performance|Management scholars, as well as scholars in other disciplines, have demonstrated a longstanding interest in the influence that chief executive officers (CEOs) have on firm performance. There is now a substantial literature on this general topic. Despite the importance of the issue and the existence of a sizable body of research, there does not appear to be a recent review of studies of the CEO-firm performance relationship. This paper seeks to begin to address this gap by reviewing recent studies in this area that have appeared in high-influence management journals. To organize our review, we place these studies into five main categories: 1) studies that examine how various CEO characteristics, which have not received much prior attention, are related to firm performance; 2) studies that consider possible mediators of the performance effects of CEO attributes that have been examined in the past; 3) studies that consider how certain CEO behaviors (versus CEO characteristics) influence firm performance; 4) studies that are concerned with the so-called “CEO effect”, which is the amount of variance in firm performance that can be attributed to CEOs (versus other factors like industry or the general macro-economic environment); and 5) studies that consider factors that determine when the CEO effect is stronger or weaker.

L29|Identité, Intentionnalité, Opacité et Gouvernance Interactive|Le point de départ de cette recherche correspond à l’étude, d’un point de vue philosophique, des comportements d’agents, d’acteurs, appartenant à une population hétérogène, basée sur une approche cognitiviste et sociale de l’identité et l’hypothèse selon laquelle les logiques d’action relèvent d’une fragmentation infinie des « moi » (Elster, Lahire, Sen).Le jeu social auquel participent ces agents en matière de médiation et de coordination fait référence à la sociologie de la traduction (Callon) correspondant à la mise en oeuvre de procédures spécifiques (au sens de la prétopologie) relatives à l’émergence de différentes formes sociales (Simmel), de communautés hybrides en tant que structures éphémères.Le but est alors d’expliquer comment les différentes formes d’engagement des agents (Thévenot), à travers les appareils (Lyotard, Déotte), les réseaux (en tant qu’artefacts) mis en place au niveau de la genèse de ces structures et conditionnant leur autonomie, induisent à la fois une certaine ambiguïté et une certaine opacité entre l’individuel et le collectif et quelles peuvent en être les conséquences en matière de gouvernance interactive.

L29|Organizational Citizenship Behavior, Predictor Of Job Performance|This article outlines the Romanian and foreign studies carried on concerning the subject of Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB). The help given to a colleague when necessary he/she needs it, giving up to a better job offer made by competing firms, continous training, all of these define the organizational citizenship behavior and support a proper organizational functioning. Nowadays the concept of „organizational citizenship behavior ” known also as „devoted soldier syndrome” is an unfamiliar term for many managers. As far as managers are concerned they consider that organizational citizenship behavior is almost impossible to be applied in Romanian organizations. This article prezents a detailed study about Organizational Citizenship Behavior expressed by employee in health and how much of this behavior may be predicted by the age and gender of the employees from medical organizations.
L29|Synergy Effects In Work Teams|Today’s organization increasingly utilizes all kind of teams in order to surpass their competitors through flexibility, adaptability and innovation, features which are seen to characterize the teams. For this purpose, the concept of synergy in teams’ activity is often mentioned as the prime reason for which collective work is considered to be superior comparative with individual work. But what exactly does it mean? The present paper aims to shed some light on the concept of synergy in work teams and its positive effects, namely, the social consequences of collective work such as social compensation, social indispensability, social comparison, social identity, but also its negative effects, such as free-riding, social loafing and sucker effect. These are important group phenomena that managers should be aware of because they have a major impact on team performance, and consequently, on organization performance.
L29|Depredación organizacional: las consecuencias del uso del poder en la organización|El concepto «depredación» en el ámbito de la organización es usual asociarlo con el deterioro de susrecursos. Sin embargo, al abordarlo desde la ecología de poblaciones, el resultado es un enfoque centradoen las relaciones entre los actores de la organización y la interacción de 3 variables principales: el poder de los actores, la intimidad entre ellos y la letalidad de sus actuaciones. Estas 2 últimas son solicitadas enpréstamo desde la clasificación funcional propuesta por la ecología de poblaciones y es clave en la relaciónpresa-depredador. Este documento pretende aprovechar dichos conocimientos disponibles en la ecología,y argumenta que su estudio facilita la comprensión de los estilos de dirección en la organización.
L29|La modélisation du risque en immobilier d'entreprise|The real estate asset class is tangible, heterogeneous and illiquid. It gives a specific investment universe that needs to be understood by investors, because the uncertainties created by this universe compose the risk of real estate investment. We suggest modelling risks across a sum of risk unit appraisal, on one hand, in constructing portfolio analysis, and on the other hand, through the office market risk premium modelling. Our doctoral study proposes to adapt financial theorems to risk modelling in the main European office markets. Our thesis will be written in Englishand its body will be articulated around three axes whereby those will be illustrated under the form of article.
L29|De la nécessité d’une vision partenariale en gouvernance de l’entreprise:une note|(VF)Comment les systèmes de gouvernance, en encadrant les décisions des dirigeants, influencent-ils la création durable de valeur par la firme ? Les réponses à cette question centrale de la gouvernance d’entreprise sont contingentes aux représentations de la firme mobilisées et sont plus ou moins satisfaisantes si on retient une perspective gestionnaire. La gouvernance actionnariale ne pouvant apporter une réponse pertinente, il faut se tourner vers la vision partenariale. Il est cependant nécessaire d’enrichir cette vision, initialement disciplinaire, par une dimension cognitive pour disposer d’un cadre pleinement adapté.(VA)How corporate governance systems, by conditionning management decisions, influence the sustainable creation of value by the firm ? The answers to this central question of corporate governance are contingent to the used representations of the firm and are more or less satisfactory if one adopts a managerial perspective. The shareholder view being unable to provide a relevant answer, we must turn to the stakeholder view of corporate governance. However, it is necessary to enrich this view, initially exclusively disciplinary , with a cognitive dimension to obtain a fully adapted framework.
L29|Valeur partenariale et approche intégrée du contrôle de gestion:une note|(VF)L’objectif de cette note est de conforter les liens entre valeur partenariale, modèle des stakeholders et contrôle de gestion intégré. Dans une première étape nous montrons, à travers la littérature stratégique, que la VP peut prétendre au statut de cadre intégrateur en permettant d’associer les leviers incitatifs et cognitifs de la création de valeur au sein d’une théorie partenariale de la firme. Dans une deuxième étape, nous cherchons à clarifier les liens entre le modèle des stakeholders et la VP, en revenant sur la question des objectifs de la firme. (VA)The purpose of this note is to strengthen the links between the stakeholder value, the stakeholder model of the firm and integrated management control. In a first step, we show, through the strategic literature, that the VP may qualify as integrative framework in considering simultaneouly incentives and cognitive levers of value creation inside a stakeholder theory of the firm. In a second step, we seek to clarify the relationship between the stakeholder model and the VP, in reexamining the issue of the objectives of the firm.
L29|Gentlemen do not talk about money: Remuneration dispersion and firm performance relationship on British boards|Using a sample of 781 U.K. firms over the period 2000–2008 we study the relationship between remuneration dispersion at executive board level and firm performance. We find that this relationship is sensitive to nationality composition of the executive boards. In contrast with findings on American data, British companies are characterized by a negative dispersion–performance relationship, i.e., the greater the dispersion is, the worse firm performance is, however, boards with American CEOs or at least 30% of American nationality non-CEO executives are characterized by a positive dispersion–performance relationship. The results are robust when controlling for various firm, board and CEO characteristics, including cross-listing on U.S. exchanges and having sales in the U.S. Implications for executive remuneration reforms and board diversity are discussed.
L29|Efficiency of Islamic banks during the financial crisis: An analysis of Middle Eastern and Asian countries|The world economy is still suffering from the severe global financial crisis that caused the failure of several banks. This has encouraged economists worldwide to consider alternative financial solutions and attention has been focused on Islamic banking and finance as an alternative model. Hence, this study examines the efficiency level of Islamic banks during the financial crisis specifically in Middle Eastern and Asian countries from 2007 to 2010. Moreover, bank-specific and risk factors were examined to understand the determinants of efficiency. The efficiency of Islamic banks is measured using data envelopment analysis by adopting the intermediation approach. The financial information is extracted from BankScope database for a four year period (2007–2010) which includes 79 Islamic banks across a number of countries. The study also critically analyses pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency of the Islamic banks in Middle Eastern and Asian countries and estimates their return to scale. The findings explain that Islamic banks were able to sustain operations through the crisis. However, the study also shows that the majority of these Islamic banks were scale inefficient. Most of the scale inefficient banks were operating at decreasing returns to scale. This study also found that both profitability and capitalisation were the main determinants of Islamic banking efficiency. Hence, the findings of this study have policy implications and make a contribution to policy-making by providing empirical evidence on the performance of the Islamic banks and their efficiency levels.
L29|Foreign Direct Investment and Domestic Entrepreneurship: Blessing or Curse?|This paper explores the effects of foreign direct investment, measured by mergers and acquisitions, on domestic entrepreneurial entry. We use a micro-panel of more than two thousand individuals disaggregated by industry in seventy countries including both developed and developing economies, 2000-2009. The theory yields ambiguous predictions about the relationship between FDI and entrepreneurship; positive spillovers via dissemination of technology or negative because of crowding out. Our empirical analysis is conducted at three levels of aggregation. We find the relationship between FDI and domestic entrepreneurship in aggregate and intra-industry to be negative. Policies need to consider how to counteract this effect.
L29|The Dynamics of Employment Growth: New Evidence from 18 Countries|Motivated by the on-going interest of policy makers in the sources of job creation, this paper presents results from a new OECD project on the dynamics of employment (DynEmp) based on an innovative methodology using firm-level data (i.e. national business registers or similar sources). It demonstrates that among small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), young firms play a central role in creating jobs, whereas old SMEs tend to destroy jobs. This pattern holds robustly across 17 OECD countries and Brazil, extending recent evidence found in the United States. The paper also shows that young firms are always net job creators throughout the business cycle, even during the financial crisis. During the crisis, entry and post-entry growth by young firms were affected most heavily, although downsizing by old firms was responsible for most job losses. The results also highlight large cross-country differences in the growth potential of young firms, pointing to the role played by national policies in enabling successful firms to create jobs.
L29|Contracts, Job Security And Development Of The University|The research success of a university requires ecient recruiting. The talents of candidates are unobservable for administrators, and so they delegate hiring to the faculty who have better knowledge of the job market. Since professors dislike putting their own employment at risk, faculty, especially less productive, have an incentive to hire less productive candidates to insure against getting red themselves. I argue that both tenure and strict long-term administrative positions mitigate this problem, and allow one to hire better candidates.
L29|DIFFERENT NETWORKS IN MSMEs LOCATED IN PUEBLA, MEXICO DIFERENTES REDES SOCIALES EN LAS MIPYME LOCALIZADAS EN PUEBLA, MEXICO|This paper presents an analysis of the differences and particularities of the nodes that make up social networks in MSMEs located in Puebla, Mexico is presented. The sample was comprised of two groups of companies was the first 341 companies represented by their owner or manager , a questionnaire of 10 questions was applied , it is important to note that the field research was conducted in a single stage , which lasted three weeks; in the first week 91 questionnaires in week 50 questionnaires were applied in the third week and 200 questionnaires were applied. The second group consists of 114 micro and small entrepreneurs. This allowed to investigate the differences that exist in the social networks created by poblanas MSME from the environment where they are located and accordingly vary the actors involved and the exchange of knowledge that support them to remain in the market improvements in their product and processes. Noting that the environment influences the actors involved in the network and therefore in knowledge exchanges that take place between them.
L29|A Leaders’s Influence on the Definition and Implementation of Strategy in Organizations|In modern business conditions, the success of an organization is connected to the leader skills and abilities. Leadership becomes more important every day due to the requests of a turbulent and variable environment which can be satisfied only by organizations led by leaders able to harmonize the leading of the organization with the real situation within it. Thus leaders, through their behavior and skills influence, define and implement organization strategy to a large extent.
L29|Delegation of Decisions About Change in Organizations: The Roles of Competition, Trade, Uncertainty, and Scale|Using unique establishment-level data, we find that delegation of organizational change is more likely in workplaces that: face a competitive product market, export, have predictable demand, are part of a smaller overall organization, and have fewer workplaces in the firm producing the same output. Surprisingly, we find no significant relationship between import competition and the allocation of decision-making rights within a firm. Our results are robust to a range of specifications and to alternative measures of our key explanatory variables. (JEL D23, L23, L29).

L29|Understanding Incubator Value – A Network Approach to University Incubators|Abstract Networking represents a cornerstone for entrepreneurial action, nurturing relationships that provide access to necessary resources. Previous research shows that such relationships can be fostered as part of incubation processes. However, there is a lack of understanding of the underlying networking process, particularly in settings aimed at promoting them such as Networked Incubators (NIs). Moreover, little is known about entrepreneurs’ expectations when joining a NI, or about entrepreneurs’ satisfaction regarding the fulfilment of those expectations. We address these issues by investigating the features of networking within NIs, and by positing new ways of measuring incubator performance: performance from the entrepreneurs’ perspective. The article focuses on the start-ups located in UPTEC - Science and Technology Park of the University of Porto, a NI. A combination of qualitative and quantitative methodological tools (including content and social network analysis) is used. Findings show how entrepreneurs hold relatively high expectations for the dimensions of Legitimacy/Credibility, Infrastructure, and Networking, and lower expectations regarding the Business Support provided by the incubator. However, the UPTEC network shows low levels of Networking, raising questions regarding effectiveness of NIs. The findings also reveal a number of factors that impact the value and effectiveness of the networking process within a NI.
L29|Is self-leadership the new silver bullet of leadership? An empirical test of the relationship between self-leadership and organizational commitment|Self-leadership is theoretically assumed to be the key management approach in modern knowledge work because it strengthens the employees’ commitment. This study examines the relationship between self-leadership and affective organizational commitment empirically. An underlying assumption in the self-leadership research, that employees are guided and committed by internal work ideals, is tested, and self-leadership is compared to motivational factors in traditional management theories. The results show that self-leadership positively affects organizational commitment, while the internal work ideals overall do not seem to have the expected effect. However, the effect of self-leadership on commitment disappears when the relationship is controlled for traditional motivational factors. The theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed, and foci for future research are suggested.
L29|How External Environment and Internal Organization contribute in Commitment to Change? (Study at organizational change in state owned organizations in Indonesia)|The success of organizational change was influenced by many factors, and some of them are the conditions of external environments and internal organization. This study is trying to identify the role and contribution of employee?s perception about external environment and internal organization in relations with commitment to change. The study was conducted at financial state owned organizations with 539 respondents, using Organizational Trust and Organizational Task Environment as data collection tools. The study revealed that both perceptions of employee?s about external environment and internal organization, (organizational trust), have positive and significant correlation and contributions in commitment to change. The results also showed that organizational trust have more contribution to commitment to change, compares to organizational task environment. The implications of the study can be used to strengthen the understanding about the process of organizational change, through increasing employee?s commitment by boosting the two variables, namely organizational trust, and positive perceptions about external environments, especially organizational trust. This study also important in change management, as it was understood from the previous research that leader and its leadership style is important in the success of organizational change, however in this study it showed that as organizational trust is the important variable.
L29|Psychological Empowerment and Organizational Task Environment in Commitment to Change|The purpose of this study is to elaborate the role of psychological empowerment, and perceptions of external environment in committing employees with organizational change. This study tested the effect of dimensions of psychological empowerment as well as the effect of employee?s perception on external environment on organizational commitment to change in financial state owned organizations in Indonesia. Data was gathered from 539 employees working in financial state owned organizations in Indonesia. Data collection was using Organizational Task Environment, Psychological Empowerment and Commitment to Change inventories. Results showed the significant effect of Psychological Empowerment and Organizational Task Environment on commitment to change. Results also showed that perceptions on external environment have more contribution to commitment to change compares to psychological empowerment. Moreover, the study also revealed that all dimensions of Organizational Task Environment (capacity, dynamism and complexity) have significant effect on commitment to change, with capacity has the strongest impact on commitment to change. Likewise, all psychological empowerment dimensions (meaning, competence, self-determination and impact) has significant effect on commitment to change, with meaning has the highest contribution to commitment to change. This study is a contribution to theory and practice of change management, with an increased understanding on commitment to change, psychological empowerment and perceptions of external environments in committing the employees with the organizational change.
L29|Team Development Through Music Creation|The current study aims to explore a new method for creating an effective working team, using music terminology as a metaphor for team work. Teams have been proved to play a crucial role in organizations, with most organizational activities being conducted through teams. Success in organizations depends upon the quality of their teams, meaning the teams have the necessary competencies for their operation. Establishing efficient working teams requires a thorough and constant development. The rationale of using music terminology as metaphors in the current work relies on the assumption that metaphors advance insights into team activities and act as spotlights on related phenomena, often in novel and surprising ways.Graduate and undergraduate students in Business Management classes volunteered to participate within 10-member teams in an experiment following a lecture that dealt with groups and teams in organizations. None of them had any musical background, according to a pre-condition of taking part in this activity. The students were first given a short introduction regarding music terminology such as rhythm, dynamics, phrase, beat, etc. Following this introduction they were given a short rhythm section as well as a variety of musical (mostly repercussion) instruments. Their objective was to perform the whole rhythm section as a team according to instructions provided to them. The other students in the class served as observers, watching the team's members coping with the assignment up to the final performance. After the experimental session was completed, the team, along with the observers, filled out various rating scales and held a discussion about their feelings and insights.The contribution of the current study is both conceptual and practical. The experience of acting in a musical group with a defined goal may enlighten more clearly the characteristics and competencies required for those who take part in a team work within organizational settings. The musical activity examined here does not pose psychological threats that may hinder natural behavior on the participants' part. This kind of activity provides the team members, as well as their observers, with new tools for evaluating their behaviors.
L29|When in Rome do as the Romans do: is it a reality of business life?|Every aspect of our scientific life is subdued to accelerated development and with the internationalisation of the economy the area of intercultural communication still possesses great potential for research. Both researhers and professionals emphasise the importance of knowledge of different cultures and they agree that globalisation has brought the growing trend to work ? virtually and/or face-to-face ? with people from different cultural backgrounds.The research to be discussed in the paper is a part of a complex research conducted in 2013. The main objective of the research is to help companies to work more effectively. The purpose of the present paper is to demonstrate the results of a survey conducted with Hungarian professionals who are in business contact with partners with different cultural backgrounds. This paper focuses on demonstrating how culture influences behaviour in international setting where business partners have differing values, attitudes and norms.The data was collected with the aid of a research questionnaire (more then 300 respondents). The respondents were asked to answer close-ended and open-ended questions making choices among a set of alternatives focusing on their attitudes in several business situations. The data was entered into the SPSS programme and analysed using appropriate statistical methods. The findings reveal that companies seem to find it difficult to adapt their messages to suit different cultural groups but there are new approaches with promise the most success for communicating and working effectively in international business settings.
L29|The economic contribution of start-up firms in Germany|This paper utilizes German tax data to present evidence about the direct and indirect effects of new firm formation. Cohort analysis is applied to investigate survival, sales, inputs, and value added of start-up firms. Most drop-outs occur in the early years. We show that start-up microenterprises increase economic vitality directly. Turnover and value added are in an approximate proportion of 3:1. With respect to the indirect effects of new firms, we find that one Euro of sales induce considerable indirect effects because 66 Cents are used to buy products and services from incumbents. For this reason, new firms substantially promote economic prosperity of incumbents. Sectoral differences are also indicated, with the manufacturing industry generating highest sales and relying on most inputs in the early periods.
L29|Projektpriorisierung im Rahmen eines ganzheitlichen Projektportfoliomanagements|In vielen Unternehmen gehören Projekte und Projektmanagement bereits zum Alltag. Die wachsende Bedeutung der Projektarbeit und die damit einhergehende Menge parallel abgewickelter Projekte führen zu neuen Herausforderungen, denen in der Unternehmenspraxis begegnet werden muss. Während klassisches Projektmanagement Einzelprojekte bewältigt, bedarf es im Multiprojektumfeld zusätzlich der Klärung wichtiger Fragen wie: Welche Projektideen sollen zur Durchführung ausgewählt werden? Wie können die knappen Unternehmensressourcen möglichst erfolgreich und anhand objektiver Kriterien auf die Einzelprojekte verteilt werden? Wie lassen sich die Einzelprojekte als Gesamtheit erfolgreich steuern und kontrollieren? Diesen und anderen Fragestellungen widmet sich das Projektportfoliomanagement, indem es für die übergeordnete und ganzheitliche Planung sowie Steuerung der Projektlandschaft sorgt. Ein wichtiger Bestandteil stellt dabei die Projektpriorisierung dar, die für die systematische Bewertung und Einstufung aller erfassten Projekte zuständig ist. Das vorliegende Arbeitspapier befasst sich zunächst mit den Themen des Projektportfoliomanagements. Zu Beginn werden wichtige Begriffsabgrenzungen vorgenommen. Anschließend werden Ziele und Nutzen sowie Prozesse des Projektportfoliomanagements erläutert, bevor eine Einführung in die Aufbauorganisation die Ausführungen abrundet. Daraufhin wird die Projektpriorisierung näher beleuchtet. In diesem Zuge werden u. a. verschiedene Kriterien und Methoden der Projektbewertung vorgestellt und die Verbindung zwischen der Projektpriorisierung und der Projektauswahl erklärt.
L29|Value Co-Creation As Precondition For The Development Of A Service Business Model Canvas| Environmental changes such as increasing competitive pressure and rising customer power force companies to rethink their way of doing business and to implement a service-oriented business logic. As a result, companies more and more aim at offering solutions instead of selling products in order to meet customer demands more effectively. This transition from a goods-oriented to a service-oriented logic depicts a fundamental change in the mental model underlying the business. Therefore, a redesign of a company’s business model is necessary. This paper analyzes the influence of a product-service transition on the business model canvas against the background of service-dominant logic. The paper analyzes how a service-dominant business logic affects the design of the nine building blocks of the business model canvas. Special emphasis is given to the aspect of value co-creation and the need to integrate customers as key partners in value creation processes. The result of this conceptual paper is a set of propositions that may serve as a basis for future empirical research.

L29|Decision-making and implementation in teams|We use a mechanism–design approach to study a team whose members choose a joint project and exert individual efforts to execute it. Members have private information about the qualities of alternative projects. Information sharing is obstructed by a trade–off between adaptation and motivation. We determine the conditions under which first–best project and effort choices are implementable and show that these conditions can become relaxed as the team grows in size. This contrasts with the common argument (based on free–riding) that efficiency is harder to achieve in larger teams. We also characterize the second–best mechanism and find that decision–making may be biased either in favor or against the team’s initially preferred alternative.
L29|Transferencia tecnológica: Un proceso de negociación clave para el crecimiento de las Pymes|En el presente artículo se pretende socializar la importancia de las Oficinas de Transferencia de Resultados de Investigación (OTRI) y el aporte que estas hacen a las industrias de cada país, en especial mediante la estrecha relación con las pequeñas empresas (Pymes). Las OTRI son canales institucionales que vinculan a las Universidades y Centros de Investigación con empresas del sector productivo, estas colaboran y asesoran en labores de I+D+i, tanto a las empresas como a sus propios investigadores. Las OTRI propician la transmisión de conocimientos entre universidad y empresa y entre las propias universidades. La estrecha relación de trabajo colaborativo en los esfuerzos de investigación, no solamente deben permear las grandes empresas, en el presente, se realiza una propuesta conceptual que vincula los resultados de investigación con las pequeñas empresas, realmente porque este tipo de empresas son las que mueven la economía de los países de ingreso tardío, debido a diferentes factores que involucran el acceso a capital, la cultura, las condiciones propias de cada región entre otras, dadas estas condiciones, es de vital importancia que los esfuerzos de investigación se vean reflejados en el acceso a tecnologías para las Pymes, generando esto un aporte al crecimiento y desarrollo de la economía nacional.

L29|La dimensión espacial del suicidio y su vínculo con el mercado laboral mexicano (2000-2004)|A principios del siglo XXI en México se ha puesto de manifiesto en la opinión pública la preocupación respecto al ascenso de muertes por la causa de suicidio y de su posible vínculo con malas condiciones laborales. El objetivo principal del trabajo es comprobar si las tasas de suicidio son una respuesta a malas condiciones laborales. Para este propósito, partiendo de una perspectiva espacial, se buscó evidenciar el comportamiento heterogéneo del fenómeno del suicidio a través del territorio mexicano, verificar la existencia de “regiones” en el espacio de tasas de suicidio y comprobar si las tasas de suicidio son una respuesta a las características económicas, demográficas y sociales de los municipios de la República Mexicana en particular a las laborales. El trabajo encuentra que no existen las evidencias estadísticas suficientes para probar que malas condiciones laborales estén provocando un incremento en la incidencia del suicidio. Adicionalmente, se hace visible que las cifras nacionales y estatales no reconocen comportamientos regionales importantes.
L29|Financiamiento de la banca comercial para las micro, pequeñas y medianas empresas en México|El objetivo de este artículo es estudiar la estrategia de otorgamiento de créditos a las mipymes por parte de la banca comercial en México, así como examinar los factores que la incentivan o la obstaculizan. Para ello, en 2011 se efectuó una encuesta detallada entre los bancos comerciales que operan en el país. En esta se evidencia que existe un creciente interés por ampliar el crédito a las mipymes, pese a que estos créditos representan todavía una pequeña proporción de la cartera total. Se detectaron tres diferentes modelos de negocios, con divergencias importantes en las estrategias seguidas para atender a este segmento de empresas. Los factores que constituyen una mayor barrera para la oferta de crédito son la presencia de información insuficiente, fallas en el sistema de protección de acreedores, la informalidad, y las transformaciones históricas y rupturas que la banca comercial ha experimentado en las últimas tres décadas.
L29|Commercial bank financing for micro-enterprises and SMEs in Mexico|This article examines commercial bank lending strategies for micro-enterprises and small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) in Mexico, and the factors that promote or hinder lending in this segment. With this in mind, in 2011 a detailed survey was conducted of commercial banks operating in Mexico. Although credit to microenterprises and smes still represents a small share of the loan portfolio, the survey results point to growing interest in broadening it. Three different business models were identified, with major differences in strategies for offering financial services to this segment of enterprises. The greatest barriers to increasing the credit supply are lack of information, creditor protection failures, informality, and the changes and disruptions that commercial banking has experienced over the past three decades.
L29|Networking entrepreneurs|In a cluster and in a network the figure of the entrepreneurs appear as an apparatus of social relations and cooperation. We believe that entrepreneurial networks are key elements for a cultural quality system, but recent literature tends to not consider the social flow (internal) of spillovers produced by these (entrepreneurial) networks. The purpose of this paper is to stress the role of entrepreneurs through a conceptual map that relies upon strategic entrepreneurial networks. We suggest to fill a theoretical gap in entrepreneurial literature, and make the figure and role of entrepreneurial networking team emerge with a strategic role for creating opportunities and new social knowledge. From our interpretation appears what is still unexpressed or not well explicated in literature: the entrepreneurial team and its natural attitude in producing social knowledge.
L29|Decision–Making and Implementation in Teams|We use a mechanism-design approach to study a team whose members choose a joint project and exert individual efforts to execute it. Members have private information about the qualities of alternative projects. Information sharing is obstructed by a trade-off between adaptation and motivation. We determine the conditions under which first-best project and effort choices are implementable and show that these conditions can become relaxed as the team grows in size. This contrasts with the common argument (based on free-riding) that efficiency is harder to achieve in larger teams. We also characterize the second-best mechanism and find that decision-making may be biased either in favor or against the team's initially preferred alternative.
L29|Coordinates The Operations Of The Franchise And The Implications In The Field Of Accounting|Franchising system is one of the modern systems widely practiced in contemporary economy, the distribution of goods and provision of services. With strong growth in the U.S. in late 1970, modern franchise system was taken over by European countries with advanced economies, and then gradually been internationalized through expansion in all continents. Statistics show that by the application of the system of franchising, distribution companies and have considerably turnover and reduced substantial costs. In Romania, the interests for the establishment of companies of franchising and regulating them have become realities in terms of our country to the market economy. He gradually increased the number of small and medium local entrepreneurs, interested to join the franchise as the franchisees partners. Also, a fundamental role in this area, we have made considerable investments in the stock of some international companies for the creation of the territory of our country's important network of franchisee. Foreign franchisees of the Romanian market belong to some developed countries accounting for system contracts with reputable and authoritative. With regard to the system of franchising are relevant advantages that customize, including: promoting the economic interests of the small and medium-sized entrepreneurs; high degree of flexibility needed to adapt to modern economic requirements; implementation of low cost; safety in carrying out business; Enrol in the trends of globalization of the world economy, the possibility of obtaining a high level of profitability; specific provisions of protection against economic risk, comparative with most other systems in the world economy.
L29|Le rôle des connaissances architecturales dans l’élaboration de la plateforme technologique d’un écosystème en émergence: le cas des plateformes NFC|Cette recherche met l’accent sur les conditions relatives à l’élaboration d’une plateforme technologique dans l’objectif d’identifier quelle en est, ou quelles en sont, les composantes clefs structurant l’émergence d’un écosystème d’affaires. Elle mobilise pour cela la théorie de l’innovation architecturale (Henderson et Clark, 1990 ; Anderson et al. 2008). Elle s’inscrit dans une démarche de recherche abductive par l’observation participante et propose une grille d’analyse utile à l’identification des prérogatives essentielles à la construction des plateformes technologiques. Testée dans le cadre d’une étude de cas contemplative (Savall et Zardet, 2004), cette grille d’analyse permet de montrer comment la dimension relationnelle des connaissances architecturales facilite l’élaboration des plateformes technologiques de type supply chain dont l’évolution vers la forme industrielle relève en revanche des trois autres dimensions des connaissances architecturales. Du point de vue managérial enfin, cette grille d’analyse facilite aux praticiens l’identification de leur positionnement stratégique et leur rôle dans le processus de conception d’une plateforme technologique.
L29|Logistics Management Methodology For The Improvement Of Small Businesses, Metodologia De Gestion Logistica Para El Mejoramiento De Pequenas Empresas|Small businesses generally lack financial resources to pay for a logistics consulting. This implies that management of processes within the organization becomes a problem for the employer or an opportunity for improvement. This paper presents a methodology of support to improve logistics operations of small businesses. The first step proposed is to make a diagnosis from a basis of indicators of procurement, warehousing, transportation, distribution, customer service, reverse logistics, social responsibility and logistics costs. Further tools are designed for each of the above areas that improve internal logistics problems of companies. According to the diagnostic results, the company should decide which of these tools meet their needs to find an improvement. The first results of this implementation are disclosed hereby.
L29|Capabilities To Customize Production And Reconfigure Internally: Do Capabilities Influence Perceived Operating Performance And Competitive Advantage?, Las Capacidades De La Empresa Para Personalizar Su Produccion Y Reconfigurarse De Forma Interna: Â¿Influencian Su Desempeno Operativo Y Su Ventaja Competitiva Percibidos?|Having the best capacities allows companies to efficiently choose and implement the necessary activities to produce and deliver goods and services to their clients. Nevertheless, if the purpose is to exceed competitor performance, it is necessary for companies to deploy their capabilities in a superior manner. This work analyzes the impact of operational capacities of massive personalization and reconfiguration and competitive dimensions recognized as strategic. We examine how the affect operative development from a productive entity, and the effect of this on perceived competitive advantage. The research design was quantitative and the empirical information was examined in two stages: the first through a confirmatory factorial analysis (CFA) and the second through a system of structural equations based on covariance (SSEBC). Results confirm that: 1) a direct, positive and significant relationship between the capacity of massive personalization and perceived operative performance, 2) reconfiguration capacity affects positively, directly and significantly perceived operative development, and 3) perceived operative development influences perceived competitive advantage in a direct, positive and significant manner.
L29|Comparing Strategies of Collaborative Networks for R&D: An Agent-Based Study|In this work we analyze the evolving dynamics of different strategies of collaborative networks that emerge from the creation and diffusion of knowledge. An evolutionary economic approach is adopted by introducing decision rules that are applied routinely and an agent-based model is developed. Firms (the agents) can collaborate and create networks for research and development purposes. We have compared three collaboration strategies (A—peer-to-peer complementariness, B—concentration process and C—virtual cooperation networks) that were defined on the basis of literature and on empirical evidence. Strategies are introduced exogenously in the simulation. The aims of this paper are twofold: (i) to analyze the importance of the networking effects; and (ii) to test the differences among collaboration strategies. It was possible to conclude that profit is associated with higher stock of knowledge and with smaller network diameter. In addition, concentration strategies are more profitable and more efficient in transmitting knowledge through the network. These processes reinforce the stock of knowledge and the profit of the firms located in the centers of the networks. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013
L29|The Impacts of Promotions/Marketing, Scheduling, and Economic Factors on Total Gross Revenues for Minor League Baseball Teams|The purpose of this empirical study is to identify the key marketing and scheduling determinants of game attendance at minor league baseball games. Identification of such marketing and scheduling factors can provide the management of minor league teams in similar environments with information to more efficiently pursue the goal of game attendance maximization. To ensure greater comparability of data between teams and hence relevance of results, this study focuses upon a single grouping of teams, the Carolina League, and a single minor league baseball season, 2006. The Carolina League consists of eight teams serving eight metropolitan areas: Lynchburg City, VA; Winston-Salem, NC; Wilmington, DE; Salem City, VA; Myrtle Beach, SC; Prince William County, VA; Lenoir City, NC; and Frederick County, MD.

L29|The entrepreneur’s mode of entry: the effect of social and financial capital|This article uses a French database of firms set up in 1998 to investigate the determinants of takeovers versus startups as a mode of entry. It focuses on two determinants that previous research has not fully analyzed: social capital and financial capital. Our findings suggest social capital affects the mode of entry. They show that entrepreneurs with social capital are more likely to create new firms from scratch than to take over existing firms. We confirm the effect of financial capital on the mode of entry. Bank loans are more often associated with takeovers than with startups and low initial wealth is more often associated with startups than with takeovers. These results show that finance affects the mode of entry. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2013
L29|Highly Important Objectives For Innovation In Romania Within The European Context|Romania, as a country with a low R&D level, in order to converge to the living standards of western economies, is doomed to foster private investments in applied research and experimental development. Thus, it is critical to study what are the main objectives for innovation at organizational level. This paper investigates the most important objectives for innovation in Romania and in the European Union, aiming to find out what are the main challenges innovative enterprises have to face. The general approach is focused on the analysis of the frequency with which these objectives occur, both at general and structural levels. Therefore we have extracted the most important three highly important objectives for innovation, both in Romania and EU: improving the quality of goods or services, the need to increase the range of goods or services and the entering new markets or increase the market share. All these three are positively correlated with the size (number of employees) of the organization. One of our findings underlines that there are fewer objectives in EU then in Romania, both at general and structural levels. Such a situation suggesting that the differences derive from two main sources: Romania has more needs, thus the enterprises target more goals, and there is a lack of managerial know-how that leads to non-prioritized objectives for innovation. Also, we identified an asymmetry, consisting in the fact that in EU, medium sized enterprises are more likely to act as the small ones, as opposed to the Romanian context. R&D and innovation component should be in the center of the Romanian strategy for convergence and competitiveness strengthening, treating differently the SMEs in order to foster innovation in a sustainable manner, through the encouragement of private enterprises to engage in partnerships for R&D an innovation. Also there is a critical need for governmental intervention in building facilities for the modern business infrastructures (business incubators, industrial parks, clusters, and competitive poles), creating a viable VC market for innovative projects, stimulating the creation of new SMEs and fostering internationalization of the local enterprises.
L29|Determinants of the economic performance of Portuguese Academic Spin-offs: do Science & Technology infrastructures and support matter?|Academic and political interest in Academic Spin-offs (ASOs) has increased significantly in Portugal in the last few years. Although these firms, created to exploit the results of scientific research, are considered important contributors to employment and wealth creation, in the Portuguese case, their impact has been modest, at best. Based on a sample of 101 ASOs associated to the members of the University Technology Enterprise Network (UTEN), we found that ASOs are quite small (employing on average 9 full time equivalent individuals and a turnover of 300 thousand euros). Besides being highly R&D intensive, Portuguese ASOs are internationally-led with almost half of the respondent firms involved in exporting. An econometric analysis revealed the relevant role of certain types of S&T infrastructures and support mechanisms for the economic performance of ASOs In particular, access to incubators, access to skilled labour, and support in terms of business mentoring and counselling emerged as significantly and positively related with ASOs’ sales per worker. Moreover, their economic performance is extremely dependent on internationalization dynamics, with firms that export outperforming their domestically-based counterparts. The lack of economic return on R&D performed and patents registered by firms indicates that the steady investment in science, technology and innovation in Portugal in the last decade, although undoubtedly necessary, has not yet materialized sufficiently to push the system towards solid, productive and value added firms. Therefore, policies aimed at accelerating ideas and knowledge into internationally competitive ideas and products are required.
L29|The Dynamic of Project Monitoring and Evaluation Mechanisms within Modern Organizations|This paper aims to emphasize the role of monitoring and evaluation mechanisms within project management and their importance in the context of modern organizations. Thus, we provide a short literature review on the evolution of the monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, and we emphasize the fact that the most relevant are: Gantt Diagram, Benchmarking techniques, Balanced Scorecard Management Systems, CPM, PERT, etc. Also, we propose a short review on the correlation between the monitoring and evaluation mechanisms and the project management evolution, identifying six important stages in the development of project management. Therewith, project management developed rapidly, and the application of some rigorous monitoring and evaluation mechanisms became more and more significant, having the capacity to generate outstanding upgrades in what concerns the projects implementation.
L29|The agglomeration of exporters by destination|Precise characterization of informational trade barriers is neither well documented nor understood. Using Russian customs data, we document that regional destination-specific export spillovers exist for developing countries, extending a result that was only known for developed countries. This result suggests behavior responding to a destination barrier. To account for this fact, we build on a monopolistic competition model of trade by postulating an externality in the international transaction of goods. We test the model’s prediction on region-level exports using Russian data and find improvement over gravity-type models without agglomeration. This finding has important development implications in that export policy that considers current trade partners may be more effective than policy that focuses only on the exporting country’s industries. Furthermore, our findings can be considered in the burgeoning literature refining transaction costs beyond the traditional iceberg cost. Copyright Springer-Verlag 2013
L29|Inter-Industry Strategic R&D and Supplier-Demander Relationships| This paper investigates if the R&D of an industry changes due to the R&D of an industry's suppliers and/or demanders. Using an annual industry-level panel of manufacturing R&D in the United States, I find that regressing the R&D of an industry on the lagged values of another industry's R&D suggests R&D comovement between industries with a strong supplier-demander relationship. Variance decompositions indicate that the R&D of an industry has high forecasting power over the R&D variance of another industry if the two industries share a strong supplier-demander relationship. © 2013 The President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
L29|Wohlstandseffekte des Gründungsgeschehens|Die Studie analysiert die Wohlstandseffekte des Gründungsgeschehens anhand der Daten des Umsatzsteuerpanels. Mittels einer Kohortenanalyse werden die Bestandsfestigkeit von Gründungen, der Umsatz, die Vorleistungsbezüge und Wertschöpfung sowie die Beschäfti-gung untersucht. Viele Gründungen scheiden nach nur wenigen Jahren wieder aus. Von einem Euro Umsatz verbleiben im Gründungsunternehmen 34 Cent als Einkommen und 66 Cent gehen an vorgelagerte Unternehmen. Das Gründungsgeschehen hat somit eine erhebliche Bedeutung für Bestandsunternehmen. Es zeigen sich branchenspezifische Unterschiede, wobei das Produzierende Gewerbe und hier insbesondere die innovativen Teilbereiche mittelfristig die höchste Wertschöpfung erzeugen und die meisten Vorleistungen nachfragen.
L29|Innovationstätigkeit von Familienunternehmen|Familienunternehmen sind genau so innovativ wie Nicht-Familienunternehmen. Systematische Unterschiede gibt es jedoch in Hinblick auf die Innovationstreiber: Ein solcher ist die Unternehmensgröße. So hat sich gezeigt, dass kleinere Familienunternehmen verhältnismäßig große Innovationsvorteile aufweisen. Die Studie liefert auch Hinweise dafür, dass insbesondere ältere Familienunternehmen eine höhere Anzahl von FuE-Kooperationen eingehen. Zudem verkleinern Familienunternehmen seltener ihren Personalbestand. Dies wirkt sich ebenfalls positiv auf ihr Innovationsverhalten aus. Allerdings gibt es auch Faktoren, die das Innovationsverhalten von Familienunternehmen negativ beeinflussen: So zeigt sich, dass die Innovationsneigung in der Gründergeneration am höchsten ist, aber mit jeder nachfolgenden Generation signifikant abnimmt - zum Teil unter das Niveau von Nicht-Familienunternehmen.
L29|On Derivatives Markets and Social Welfare: A Theory of Empty Voting and Hidden Ownership|In the past twenty-five years, derivatives markets have grown exponentially. Large, modern derivatives markets increasingly enable investors to hold economic interests in corporations without owning voting rights, and vice versa. This leads to both empty voters â€” investors whose voting rights in a corporation exceed their economic interests â€” and hidden owners â€” investors whose economic interests exceed their voting rights. We present formal models that show how, when financial markets are opaque, empty voting and hidden ownership can render financial markets unpredictable, unstable, and inefficient. By contrast, we show that when financial markets are transparent, empty voting and hidden ownership have dramatically different effects: they follow predictable patterns, encourage stable outcomes, and promote efficiency. Our analysis lends insight into the operation of securities markets in general and derivatives markets in particular. It also provides a new justification for a robust mandatory disclosure regime and facilitates analysis of proposed substantive securities regulations.

L29|Founders and Financially Affiliated Directors on Charter School Boards and Their Impact on Financial Performance and Academic Achievement|This study uses a hand-collected dataset for charter school boards in Massachusetts between 2001 and 2009 to examine the relationship between financial performance and the presence of founders and financially affiliated directors. School-level financial performance suggests that founder presence on a board has a negative effect on both financial and academic performance of a charter school. On the other hand, the presence of financially affiliated directors on the charter school governing board is positively related to financial performance, but unrelated to academic achievement. The results are consistent with the literature on corporate and nonprofit boards that have attributed financially affiliated directors with greater incentives to monitor financial targets, while founders are less likely to achieve performance expectations.

En el presente caso, se trata la historia de la Clínica de Occidente de Cali, hasta el año 2011, que pasó de ser una entidad con altos márgenes de rentabilidad enfocada en estratos medio-altos, a tener que acogerse a la Ley de Quiebra en 2004, por efecto de la implementación del nuevo Sistema de Salud de 1993. Después de un efectivo proceso de planeación estratégica alineado con el entorno, ha presentado una notoria recuperación, llevándola a un alto posicionamiento.
L29|La influencia de la cultura organizacional y la capacidad de absorción sobre la transferencia de conocimiento tácito intra-organizacional|En este artículo se analiza la influencia de la capacidad de absorción y la cultura organizacional como factores requeridos para que la transferencia de conocimiento sea exitosa y eficiente. La investigación fue de naturaleza cuantitativa, empírica y de sección transversal. La información se examinó, en una primera etapa, a través de un Análisis Factorial Confirmatorio (AFC), y posteriormente mediante un Sistema de Ecuaciones Estructurales basado en Covarianzas (CBSEM). Los resultados indican que ambas variables inciden positiva y significativamente sobre la transferencia de conocimiento intra-organizacional, y que en el caso de la cultura, existe una influencia directa y otra indirecta, mediada por la capacidad de absorción.
L29|La presse en tant que mécanisme de gouvernance partenariale:Danone et l’affaire LU - The press as a stakeholder oriented corporate governance mechanism:Danone and the LU affair|(VF)Les médias jouent un rôle important dans les crises, en particulier, celles touchant à la création et à la répartition de la valeur de l’entreprise. L’objectif de cet article est d’analyser le rôle de la presse en tant que mécanisme de gouvernance partenariale. Ce rôle est étudié au moyen d’une étude de cas basée sur le groupe Danone de 1996 à 2008. Cette étude de cas est centrée sur le conflit opposant le groupe Danone à certaines de ses parties prenantes, lors de la restructuration de sa branche biscuits en 2001. Nous montrons que la presse est un mécanisme de gouvernance d’entreprise partenariale.(VA)The media play a significant role in the context of economic crises, in particular those touching on the creation and capture of corporate value. The aim of this article is to analyze the role of the press as a potentially stakeholder oriented corporate governance mechanism. A case study of the Danone Group from 1996 to 2008 is used as the empirical support of this research. We focus more specifically on the conflict that opposed Danone and its stakeholders during its reorganization in 2001. We find that the press does actually function as a stakeholder oriented corporate governance mechanism.
L29|The shadows of the socialist past: Lack of self-reliance hinders entrepreneurship|We provide empirical evidence that the experience of a socialist regime leads to a lack of self-reliance by comparing East and West Germans conditional on regional differences in current economic development. This meaningful lack of self-reliance persists after the regime's breakdown and hinders the development of an entrepreneurial spirit, which might hamper the transition process. Since East Germany adopted the formal institutions of a market economy quasi overnight when reunifying with West Germany, we avoid simultaneity issues regarding current institutions and preferences. Further tentative evidence suggests that the socialist regime also affected the composition of the East German population by inducing selective migration before the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961.
L29|Regional economic divide and the role of technological spillovers in Italy. Evidence from microdata|This paper assesses the impact of Research and Development (R&D) efforts on production in the North and Centre-South of Italy by using a panel of 1,203 manufacturing firms over the period 1998–2003. The estimations are based on a nonlinear translog production function augmented by a measure of R&D spillovers. This measure combines the geographical distance between firms, the technological similarity within each pair of firms and the technical efficiency of each firm. The estimation method takes into account the endogeneity of regressors and the potential sample selection issue regarding firms’ decisions to invest in R&D. The two main results are as follows. Internal and external R&D have a lower impact in the Centre-South of Italy than in the rest of the country and they are weak substitutes whatever the area.
L29|La calidad del empleo de las entidades de la economía social en período de crisis|In 2009, the Social Economy companies have created employment in a context characterized by high job losses in the Spanish labour market. The aim of this paper is to analyze the employment of Social Economy, also to show that the highest quality and flexibility in the use of these entities is a key to face situations of recession. Although official data sources have some limitations, the analysis shows a higher quality of employment in the Social Economy companies based on some of the employment´s critical dimensions as gender equality, flexibility, safety, inclusion, diversity and non-discrimination.

The paper nowadays shows the suitability of multi-location strategy of cooperative production today and ends with a brief discussion of the possible keys to face current challenges.
L29|Identification Of Common Factors In Tacit Knowledge Transference Within Organizations, Identificacion De Factores Comunes Estudiados, Relacionados Con La Transferencia De Conocimiento Tacito Dentro De Las Organizaciones|Tacit knowledge transference can be used as organizational strategies to support, generate and maintain a sustainable competitive advantage. However, there is no consensus on which process and variables are relevant to a successful and efficient transfer of tacit knowledge. In this study, we review the existing literature to identify variables that are commonly used by other authors. Then, we use an exploratory factor analysis to probe these variables. Results show that previous studies have used three common factors for studying tacit knowledge transfer: those related to individuals; those concerning organizations; and a mixed approach.
L29|Trust, Commitment And Intention To Share: Influencing Variables To Transfer Knowledge Within Organizations?, Confianza, Compromiso E Intencion Para Compartir: Â¿Variables Influyentes Para Transferir Conocimiento Dentro De Las Organizaciones?|Available evidence shows there is no certain knowledge of the required factors for successful and efficient intra-organizational knowledge transference. In this paper we study, the influence of trust, in skill and affective commitment, on the intention and willingness to share, and the effect of the latter on knowledge transference. The research was conducted using quantitative analysis. Empirical information was analyzed in two stages: first through a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and second using a Covariance Based Structural Equation Model (CBSEM). Results show that: 1) there is a significant, positive, and direct relationship between knowledge transference and intention and willingness to share, 2) trust in skill and affective commitment affect significantly, directly, and positively the intention and willingness to share, and 3) trust in skill and affective commitment influence knowledge, transference within organizations in a significant, positive, and indirect form.

L29|Financial Balance And Loans Of The Shareholders To The Company|The present analyses, based on a case study show the influence on the financial balance of the loans from shareholders , taking into account the accounting treatment of loans. We do not know that the Romanian economic literature to be treated that aspect. That is why we consider the study as being useful to managers, members, shareholders, and all business partners to form the economic decisions. The purpose of this financial analysis is to examine critically the accounting and financial information ofered by the companies to assess their performance and their financial position (Laurence Le Gallo). The financial position of firms is assessed based on the financial structure and financial balance. In a same time the financial balance is approached from a static perspective based on the: net situation, working capital, necessary of working capital, net treasury. The present analyses deals with financial balance in a static manner based on these four indicators listed. The sources of data for the analysis of financial balance are offered mainly in the financial statement. This document has been used data from a company that is engaged in the carriage of goods. Analysis was made over a period of five years. The present analysis showed that financial balance is influenced by the way that the shareholders loans to the company are treated by including them in long-term debt or short-term. Reprocessing of loans and their inclusion in long-term debt, changes the perspective on financial balance showing that on the long-term company has a stable balance. These aspects require preparation of loan agreements with associates as loans work in reality. The contracts must to highlight the progress of the loan on the long term and not to be extended or remodeled the short-term contracts. Of course, there are always solutions to improve the financial balance and in this way the financial position and the performance of the company. However, the proposed solutions must be based on a proper perspective on the financial balance offered by the suitable treatment of the raw data.

L29|Subcontractor Selection Using Analytic Hierarchy Process|Turkish textile firms work under a heavily competitive atmosphere in terms of prices due to globalization. Firms have to take into consideration several criteria like cost, quality and delivery-on-time in order to survive the global market conditions and to maintain profitability. To meet these criteria, contractor companies have to select the best subcontractor. Therefore, the selection of subcontractor for the contractor company is a problem. The aim of this study is to solve the problem of Yeşim Textile, a contractor company, about the selection of the best subcontractor for its customer Nike. To solve the problem, firstly, the main criteria and relevant sub-criteria, which are of importance for Yeşim and Nike, were defined. Then, authorities from the firms were interviewed in order to formulate pairwise comparison matrices using the Saaty’s importance scale. In a sense, this matrix is the model of this study. The model, named AHP, was analyzed using the Expert Choice software. Best subcontractors for Yeşim were determined based on the model results. In addition, these results were analyzed for the firm’s decision makers.

The first part discusses the role and function of law and of comparative legal research on the topic of cooperative identity (sec. 2). The second part focuses on cooperative identity within the International Cooperative Alliance (ICA) Principles and the ICA Statement on the Cooperative Identity at large (sec. 3). The third part compares the ICA Statement on cooperative identity with the legal identity that several European jurisdictions assign to cooperatives (sec. 4). Conclusions follow.
L29|New Study Group on European Cooperative Law: �Principles� Project|This paper presents both a new scientific network named �Study Group on European Cooperative Law� (SGECOL), and the �Principles of European Cooperative Law� (PECOL) project, which SGECOL has identified as its first research activity. SGECOL is a European group of cooperative law scholars, established in Trento (Italy), at the European Research Institute on Cooperative and Social Enterprises (Euricse), in November 2011. SGECOL�s general objective is to conduct comparative research on cooperative law in Europe, thus promoting increased awareness and understanding of cooperative law within the legal, academic and governmental communities at national, European and international level. SGECOL intends to achieve this objective through various research initiatives on cooperative law, beginning with the drafting of PECOL. PECOL will take the form of legal provisions accompanied by explanatory comments. They will be developed on the basis of the existing cooperative law in Europe, focusing in particular on six European jurisdictions (Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK). PECOL, however, will not simply summarize and describe the common core of European national cooperative laws. Going beyond that, the project aims to present the main general provisions through which � in the authors� view � cooperative law should be formulated to provide cooperatives with a definite and distinct legal identity vis-a-vis other business organizations. The PECOL project does not serve a single specific purpose, still less is its goal to impose harmonization on national cooperative laws. PECOL will be a scientific and scholarly work, capable of serving many potential functions, depending on the users� particular needs.
L29|The Effects Of Network???S Structural Holes: Polycentric Institutions, Product Portfolio, And New Venture Growth In China And Russia|This study examines the effect of network???s structural holes, i.e., the absence of a link between two contacts who are both linked to an actor, on product development and profit growth of software ventures in two different institutional contexts of China and Russia. Using interview data of 159 software entrepreneurs in Beijing and Moscow, the study found that the effect of structural holes is contingent upon country institutional context and venture development stage. Specifically, structural holes have a positive main effect on product portfolio but a negative main effect on profit growth in the second revenue year - early stage of venture development. Structural holes are more useful in the Russian institutional context compared to the Chinese institutional context due to the polycentricity of institutions. The research implications of the findings are discussed.

In other words, our results are in line with procedural utility theory (Benz and Frey, 2004, 2008).
L29|Projektdesign als organisatorischer Rahmen des Projektmanagements|In den letzten Jahren haben Veränderungsgeschwindigkeit und Komplexität der betrieblichen Umwelt drastisch zugenommen. Die Betriebsstrukturen entsprechen den daraus resultierenden Anforderungen oftmals nicht mehr. Häufig sind die bestehenden Organisationen zu fragmentiert und zu hierarchisch strukturiert und damit für interdisziplinäre Zusammenarbeit und rasche Entscheidungen zu schwerfällig. In dieser Situation ist die Abwicklung von Vorhaben mit den etablierten Abläufen kaum mehr zu bewältigen. Es braucht dann neue Organisationsformen und Strukturen, die vor allem effizientere Führungs- und Kommunikationswege ermöglichen, entsprechend den Anforderungen der jeweiligen Aufgabenstellung. Vor diesem Hintergrund wird Projektmanagement zunehmend zur Schlüsseldisziplin. Das vorliegende Arbeitspapier widmet sich diesem Themenkomplex. Der Fokus liegt hierbei auf dem Projektdesign, d. h. der Schaffung der aufbauorganisatorischen Rahmenbedingungen, die mit der Arbeits- und Organisationsform Projektmanagement verbunden sind. Hierbei werden die bisherigen Projektorganisationsformen ergänzt um die explizite Definition von Rollen einerseits und Unterstützungsstrukturen - vor allem durch ein Project Management Office - andererseits. Weiterhin werden eine klare Befugnisabgrenzung sowie die Notwendigkeit von Vorgehensmodellen betont.
L29|Regional Headquarters as Mode of Control for TNC Subsidiaries: A Network-Oriented Perspective|Our conceptual paper sheds light on the role of regional headquarters in coordinating the information and knowledge transfer within the transnational company (TNC) understood as globally dispersed network. We presume that organizational units are embedded in an internal network which is mainly dominated by the TNC headquarters (HQ) and at least one external network that is determined by relationships to the host government, suppliers, customers, (competing) firms, other organizational units, universities, and research labs. We regard the importance of local conditions that may lead to local-based subsidiary knowledge creation which is not triggered off and controlled by the HQ. This forces the HQ to recapture control over the subsidiary initiative to be able to govern it in an adequate and from a superior TNC point of view beneficial way. We believe that RHQ can be employed as organizational tools in this context to ensure an internal flow of information of adequate quality and quantity which resolves the problem of lacking information and shows how RHQ can fulfil this task. The paper contributes to business research by giving a distinct and widely new insight into the mode of operation of RHQ within TNC based on a network-oriented, information-focused perspective.

L29|Technology Audit – General And Practical Lines| The present paper is a mixture between the theoretical notions regarding the procedure of technology audit (TA) and the experience the authors have gained from actually applying it on SMEs, so that the provided viewpoint shall be a realistic one. It starts with a general presentation of the technology audit process (TA), its main parts and subdivisions, emphasizing the role and importance of each single one. There are detailed descriptions of the benefits recurring from performing a TA, as well as the implication of the analyzed company in these activities. We have considered useful to resume the process into a graphic representation, showing the interconnection between all the parts of a TA, as well as their order. At the end, one has mentioned the action plan, the component of the TA that provides specific solutions for the deficiencies determined with the help of a SWOT analysis. Last but not least, extending the procedure to macro level, one has presented some of TAs general utilities and impacts, correlated with the cooperation with the local and central authorities.
L29|On The Need Of Sme Organizational Adaption To The International Business Environment: A Competence-Based Perspective| In our paper we challenge the common notion that small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) have to adapt to the international business environment to be successful when acting in an international context. Although we believe in a need for certain adaption, we claim that the possibility that SME are to a certain extent able to proactively shape outer conditions is not adequately considered in literature. Therefore we ask how far SMEs in international business need to adapt to the environment to ensure a state of international competitiveness. We understand SMEs as open systems (Sanchez and Heene, 1996) and employ the Competence-based Theory of the Firm (CbTF) (Foss and Ishikawa, 2007; Freiling et al., 2008) as theoretical frame of reference for our conceptual paper. Thanks to its moderate voluntaristic nature, this theory allows considering both social embeddedness and managerial discretion of firms. Besides, this perspective takes into account internal developments as well as developments in the business environment. This is particularly useful to understand interaction processes with the environment that aim at accessing so-called ‘firm-addressable assets’. Firm-addressable assets explain the resource dependence of international SMEs on third-parties. However, backed by ‘absorptive capacity’ (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990), firm-addressable assets fuel internal processes of learning as well as resource and competence building. Moreover, CbTF allows for considering the role of certain categories of resources. Following service-dominant logic (SDL) (Vargo and Lusch, 2004), the distinction between ‘operand resources’ and ‘operant resources’ becomes a centerpiece of our argument: SMEs need to adapt to the environment due to resource constraints by operand resources and shape the environment primarily driven by operant resources. Our paper advances research in three ways: (1) we reinforce the concept of moderate voluntarism in this stream of research and challenge the predominantly deterministic view on SME environmental adaption; (2) we introduce a rather new theory (CbTF) and develop an understanding that features the managerial discretion of SME’s in international competition; (3) we depart from the quite unspecific notion that intangibles matter in case of proactive SME management and specify the resource categories in this realm with more explanatory power in this regard.

L29|Towards a characterization of crowdsourcing practices|The word Crowdsourcing ?a compound contraction of Crowd and Outsourcing, was used by Howe in order to define outsourcing to the crowd. Beyond cost, benefits for the company can be substantial. It can externalize the risk of failure and it only pays for products or services that meet its expectations. The Crowdsourcing phenomenon covers heterogeneous situations and it has inspired a number of authors. However, we are still lacking a general and synthetic view of this concept. The aim of our work is to characterize Crowdsourcing in its various aspects. First we define of Crowdsourcing, and provide examples that illustrate the diversity of Crowdsourcing practices and we present similarities and differences between Crowdsourcing and established theories (Open Innovation, User Innovation and Open Source Software). Then, we propose and illustrate a typology of Crowdsourcing practices based on two criteria: the integrative or selective nature of the process and the type of tasks that are crowd sourced (simple, complex and creative tasks). In either case, the client firm seeks to mobilize external competencies. Relying upon the crowd can be an adequate method, because of its unique characteristics that are fostered by the Internet. Finally, we present some potential benefits and pitfalls of Crowdsourcing. JEL Codes: O32, L17, L24, L29, M19

It also shows the fi ndings related to the practices for direction succession linked to new family relatives in a study of seven cases in the Department of Caldas, Colombia. For its development we go through the theoretical construction that diverse authors have made about concepts such as family companies, the succession process, the Agency Theory and the way family companies face the process, fruit of the ""fi nite"" nature of the human being that forces a succession in its direction. The results of the investigation allows recommendations to family companies in the way to deal with the succession process that sooner or later will have to be faced. Some of the diffi culties found during the work, was the unavailability of the directors to collaborate in gathering information.

L29|Entrepreneurial Phenomenon: Some Reasons for Career Choice Intentions|Self-employment and entrepreneurship become increasingly important in our modern economies. This paper tries to provide a timely, definitive and comprehensive overview of the field. The key issues addressed include the impact of ability, risk, personal characteristics to the entrepreneurship. The aim of this article is to provide some information that someone needs in order to decide if the life of an entrepreneur is right for him or the decision to be a self employed is a good one. Making the choice on becoming an entrepreneur can be a challenge. How to know if entrepreneurship is right or not is another question. Also, understanding the attitude towards risk and the correspondent reward for an entrepreneur is very important. The main purpose of this paper is to provide a review and offer a theoretical extension of research on the psychological factors that influence the entrepreneur behavior. There is a meaningful and positive relationship between all psychological dimensions of empowerment (self-efficiency, self-determination, personal consequence, meaning, trust in others) and entrepreneurship.
L29|The Effect of Relative Standing on Considerations About Self-Employment|This paper uses unique German data to examine the effects of the relative standing on the individual propensity to become self-employed in the next two years. The results suggest that the relationship between relative wage positions and propensity to become self-employed is U-shaped. This is interpreted as evidence that low status translates into entrepreneurial motivation for workers in low relative wage positions. Employees with high relative standing, in turn, seem to be more concerned about the lack of future career prospects in paid employment and consider self-employment as a next step on the individual career ladder.
L29|An Empirical Study of the Relationship Among Job Satisfaction, Organizational Commitment and Turnover Intention|This study conducted on 100 employees from production sector and 82 employees from service provider sector. The relationship among job satisfaction, organizational commitment and turnover intention are investigated to determine statistically significant relations. The results of the study support the hypotheses. Job Satisfaction has a significant and positive relationship with three dimensions of organizational commitment and turnover intention has a significant and negative relationship with job satisfaction and organizational commitment.
L29|Networks of relations and Word-of-Mouth Communication|We study networks of relations - groups of agents linked by several cooperative relationships - exploring equilibrium conditions under different network configurations and information structures. Relationships are the links through which soft information can flow, and the value of a network lies in its ability to enforce agreements that could not be sustained without the information and sanctioning power provided by other network members. The model explains why network closure is important; why stable subnetworks may inhibit more valuable larger networks; and why information flows and action choices cannot be analyzed separately. Contagion strategies are suboptimal here, as they inhibit information transmission, delaying punishments.

L29|When does Superiors’ Deviance threaten Organisational Hierarchy?|There has been some research into employees’ organisational misbehaviour. But how about managers’ or superiors’ deviance? Little is known about the impact of superiors’ misbehaviour on the system of hierarchical order. This theoretical paper, therefore, investigates how, why and when superiors’ crossing of boundaries contributes to the stabilisation and continuation of hierarchical social system – and when their misbehaviour threatens it. For investigating this question, the concept of crossing of boundaries will be applied to superiors’ deviance in the realms of social action, interests, social identity and ideology. Findings suggest that almost all of superiors’ deviance does not threaten hierarchical organisations.

We conïfirm the typical pattern of an initial increasing and then soon decreasing number of employees in start-up cohorts. Furthermore, we provide some of the first evidence for the ""liability of aging"" phenomena in Germany. Older firms face a relatively high risk of failure.

L29|Leadership Competencies for Managing Diversity|The new understanding of diversity involves more than increasing the number of different identity groups on the payroll. An important proposal is that the experience of diversity in an organisation results from pervasive styles of management. This article dealt with the specific paradigms of diversitymanagement and leadership style theory used to address the research problem in the empirical study, namely ‘Is diversity management experience related to leadership styles or competencies?’ The models of diversity and inclusion indicators are used to examine the experience of diversitymanagement. The population of this study into the experience of diversity management is two thousand six hundred and sixty nine (2669) respondents. Leadership styles were obtained from four hundred and forty (440) leaders. The Cronbach alpha values were determined in order to indicate internal validity and reliability.
L29|Stress and Adaptive Mechanisms of the Seafarers|Today stress is psychological and not another time, mentally. This is especially multiforme and its mark where we least expect or not expect at all. Strain, race against time, pressure, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. No we have no idea of many stressors we have every day.. What happens then? What is this strange evil? Our working conditions are far from being so heavy like old times. Ever more sophisticated technologies are being developed to facilitate the tasks we most dirty and improve communication between us. Working time is reduced by regularly to leave more space to our private lives and leisure time. And yet! All indicators show the danger. However paradoxical it might seem, occupational stress levels are unmatched, regardless of socio-professional category under consideration, employees or staff. The consequences are difficult for the individual, whoever he may be: chronic fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression, cardiovascular disease, digestive problems, etc.. For all these evils, one agent is responsible - stress, also in the Romanian landscape tragic news, we see cases of suicide in the workplace. Stress will be recognized as an occupational disease, as happens in other European countries.
L29|Demerger und ihre Operationalisierung. Eine empirische Untersuchung von Demerger-Erfolgsfaktoren|Fusionen und Akquisitionen sind einem hohen Misserfolgsrisiko ausgesetzt. Unternehmen muessen sich angesichts einer damit oft einhergehenden Geld- und Wertvernichtung die Frage stellen, welche Massnahmen einzuleiten sind, wenn sich Erwartungen an Unternehmenszusammenschluesse nicht erfuellen. Eine in diesem Zusammenhang bislang kaum beobachtete Massnahme stellt ein Demerger, also die bewusste Revidierung einer Fusion oder Akquisition, dar. Die Seltenheit dieser strategischen Option in der unternehmerischen Praxis ist vor allem auf die fehlende Expertise im Umgang mit Demergern zurueckzufuehren. Fuer das mangelnde Know-how ist in besonderer Weise die Wissenschaft verantwortlich, die sich bisher nur spaerlich mit demergerspezifischen Wirkungsbeziehungen und Erfolgsfaktoren beschaeftigt hat. Vor diesem Hintergrund wird in der vorliegenden Arbeit der Frage nachgegangen, wie Demerger zu operationalisieren sind und welche Faktoren dabei eine erfolgskritische Rolle spielen. Die Ergebnisse dieser empirischen Untersuchung bieten konkrete Handlungsempfehlungen fuer die Gestaltung von Demergern. Es werden wichtige Erkenntnisse fuer ein erfolgreiches Demerger-Management und damit Demerger-Erfolgsfaktoren geliefert. Die Studie ist zudem eine Grundlage fuer die noch junge Demerger-Forschung. Sie leistet somit einen Beitrag zur Untersuchung neuer Loesungsmoeglichkeiten im Rahmen des strategischen Managements und fuer die Wahrnehmung von Demergern als strategische Option. Das Buch richtet sich an Wissenschaftler und Studenten der Betriebswirtschaftslehre mit den Schwerpunkten Organisation, Unternehmensfuehrung, strategisches Management oder M&A sowie an Verantwortliche in M&A-Abteilungen und andere Entscheidungstraeger in Unternehmen.

La dimension territoriale est importante car ces futurs entrepreneurs sont les acteurs d’un territoire qui se caractérise par un faible dynamisme entrepreneurial. Ils créent une entreprise dans le NPC parce qu’ils y vivent, pour y créer leur emploi. The aim of this article is to present the results of a case study undertaken in the Nord-Pas de Calais region in northern France in 2009.We interviewed future entrepreneurs, during their training period at the Chamber of Trade, to identify their profile (age, gender, education, professional activity, their resources (in knowledge, capital and social relations, or their resource potential) and their motivations (innovation or unemployment). The territory played an important role in this study, being characterized by low entrepreneurial dynamics. These future entrepreneurs are creating their own businesses in the Nord-Pas de Calais because they live here and have no other employment.
L29|The Role of Workers in Management|Independent of whatever other advantages it might have for the workers, worker ownership has repeatedly demonstrated in the real world that it is no guarantee for worker participation in management. The participation of workers in management as a first step toward worker self-management requires institutions and practices that will both allow such participation and promote it. This paper considers, in the frame of four standard issues in worker self-management, six specific institutions and practices common to the collection of co-ops that constitute the MondragÃ³n complex that have generated meaningful worker participation in management in this large corporation.JEL classification: J54, L29, M19

L29|Aerotropolis: an aviation-linked space|This paper examines the conditions allowing for the formation of aeropolitan areas as large industrial areas with a high concentration of commercial activities in the proximity of cargo airports. When firms deliver part of their production by plane, land competition takes place among service operators, firms and farmers. Service operators supply facilities that firms can take advantage of. Our framework allows selecting a stable land equilibrium: the spatial sequence Airport-Industrial Park-Rural Area (A-I-R). Aerotropolis-type configurations arise around cargo airports when there is an intense use of the airport by the firms and a sufficiently high level of facilities.

L29|Organizational Commitment And Case Study On The Union Of Municipalities Of Marmara|The present paper, written on the subject of institutional commitment, presents a theoretical and empirical study aiming at measuring the level of institutional commitment of the staff of the Union of Municipalities of Marmara. The field study realised for the purpose of the paper measured levels of affective, continuance and normative commitments of the workers. In addition, the correlation between the personal and demographic characteristics of the staff members and the types of their institutional commitment have been analyzed. Thus, it has been established that the workers are strongly committed to the organization by affective and normative commitment, while continuance commitment is less relevant. The relationship between this finding and the personal and demographic characteristics have been determined in details. The study concludes that the management of the union shall take measures to strengthen the continuance commitment. In this respect, some proposals have been elaborated. On the other side, some advices addressed to academicians who will realize studies on this subject have been listed.
L29|Efficiency of public goods provision in space|This article incorporates a political decision process into an urban land use model to predict the likely location of a public good. It fills an important gap in the literature by modeling the endogenous location of open space. The article compares open space decisions made under a majority rules voting scheme with welfare-improving criterion and finds households tied to a location in space compete for public goods. Significant differences emerge between the two decision criteria, indicating that requiring referenda for open space decisions is likely to lead to inefficient outcomes. Specifically, many open space votes are likely to fail that would lead to welfare improvements, and any open space decisions that do pass will require amenities larger than needed to achieve the social optimum. The more dispersed and large the population, the larger the gap between the socially efficient level and the level needed for a public referendum to pass.

L29|The Gas Transportation Network as a ‘Lego’ Game: How to Play with It?|Gas transportation networks exhibit a quite substantial variety of technical and economical properties ranges roughly from an entrenched natural monopoly to near to an open competition platform. This empirical fact is widely known and accepted. However the corresponding frame of network analysis is lacking or quite fuzzy. As an infrastructure, can a gas network evolve or not from a natural monopoly (an essential facility) to an open infrastructure (a “highway” facility)? How can it be done with the same transportation infrastructure components within the same physical gas laws? Our paper provides a unified analytical frame for all types of gas transportation networks. It shows that gas transport networks are made of several components which can be combined in different ways. This very “lego property” of gas networks permits different designs with different economic properties while a certain infrastructural base and set of gas laws is common to all transportation networks. Therefore the notion of “gas transportation network” as a general and abstract concept does not have robust economic properties. The variety and modularity of gas networks come from the diversity of components, the variety of components combinations and the historical inclusion of components in the network. First, a gas network can combine different types of network components (primary or secondary ones). Second, the same components can be combined in different ways (notably regarding actual connections and flow paths). Third, as a capital-intensive infrastructure combining various specific assets, gas transportation networks show strong “path dependency” properties as they evolve slowly over time by moving from an already existing base. The heterogeneity of gas networks as sets of components comes firstly from the heterogeneity of the network components themselves, secondly from the different possibilities to combine these components and thirdly from the ‘path dependence’ character of gas network constructions. These three characteristics of gas networks explain the diversity of economic proprieties of the existent gas networks going from natural monopoly to competitive markets.

An exploratory investigation (chapter 4)|The main aim of the paper is to identify the succession strategies (especially the ways in which they attempt to balance the strive to maintain family’s control over the company with the goal of firm’s growth) of the first generation of Polish entrepreneurs. Research survey was conducted on a random sample of 496 family enterprises in first quarter of 2009 (first phase, survey) and 61 family enterprises in third quarter of 2009 (second phase, in-depth-interview). Research project “Succession Scenarios in First Generation of Polish Entrepreneurs” was conducted in the years 2008-2010 by Aleksander Surdej and Krzysztof Wach was financed by Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education (Project no. 1326/B/H03/2008/34).
L29|R&D, innovation and productivity, and the CIS: sampling, specification and comparability issues|We construct and estimate a modified version of the Crépon, Duguet and Mairesse (1998) model to investigate the links between R&D, innovation output and productivity. We propose a model specification that, among other features, aims to better capture the variance component of the cooperation and obstacles to innovation variables. Results based on Finnish CIS data support this alternative specification and highlight the role of process innovations. We also address comparability over time within the same country, by comparing Finnish CIS3 and CIS4 estimates. Despite CIS harmonisation, both sample selection issues and nuances in the specification of the variables prove to have a profound effect on the results, and question the validity of this currently popular comparison exercises.
L29|Creating a Model for Business Performance Assessment - a background|Entrepreneurs have been exposed to continually increasing competitive pressures. Hence, a process of continuous improvement is to be an inherent part of firm management. In case this process shall be implemented on a broad basis with the aim to maintain and increase firm competitiveness, then this process must be approached in a system and systematic way. An implementation of a suitable system of performance assessment based on a comprehensive TQM model seems to be an appropriate instrument for that. However, it is of vital importance the diagnostic approach to be preferred within the performance assessment when aiming at maintenance and strengthening the competitiveness. Such an attitude to performance assessment enables an assessment of processes and systematic factors in relation to identified lacks in firm performance in a more qualified way. In this respect, the authors of the paper refer to the conclusions of Conti and present a framework algorithm for diagnostic firm self-assessment based on notorious Deming´s PDSA cycle (Plan - Do - Study - Act). At the same time, in the paper there are specified basic activities that should be realized within single phases of firm self-assessment cycle. In general, the paper deals also with some firm self-assessment success factors.
L29|Coordinates of Policy Concerning SMEs Development in Romania|Approach of SMEs development in Romania is based on two category of premises: 7 internal premises, which refers on the Romanian economy and 6 external premises regarding the EU situation and world evolution in last two years. The second part of the paper contains the three coordinates of SMEs development in Romania: previsions concerning performances and business environment in 2010; strategic priorities and coordinates regarding economy’s development structure in certain fields – commercial, scientific, human resources and economic; construction and implementation of strategy for realization of knowledge based economy in Romania. Elements incorporated by this material are aiming to contribute to the take of the SMEs sector and implicitly of the Romanian economy from the actual economic crisis.
L29|Getting out of Crisis of SME Sector|Without any doubt, relaunching Romanian economy depends very much on SME sector getting out of the crisis, sector which has the main contribution to GDP production, to state budget income and human resources employment. Starting from these premises, based on scientific research performed in the framework of the VALAD* project, we present in the following a group of coordinates and markers which, in our opinion, are capable to relaunch indigenous SME sector. Elements contained in this study are complementary to the ones presented in the article “Policy coordinates concerning SME sector development in Romania”, published in the previous issue of this magazine.

L29|The Development of the SMEs Sector in Romania. An Approach Regarding the Dynamics and the Perspectives|This paper focuses on the development of the SMEs sector in Romania. In the first part there are revealed the main approaches concerning the role of SMEs in the economy, and especially their contribution to the transition to the “knowledge based economy”. The second part defines the methodological framework, presenting the six main indicators that are analyzed: number of enterprises, number of persons employed, gross value added, apparent labour productivity, rate of profitability and propensity to invest. The third part presents in an organized way the study results and the most relevant five tendencies, concerning SMEs sector in Romania, that are deriving from the data analysis. The forth part aims to present a number of six general recommendations that are capable to soften the economic crisis effects over the SMEs from Romania, and, what is the most important, to create a incentive framework for the creation and the development of SMEs. The presented recommendations are based on two elements: the results of the current study, and the best practices concerning the SMEs sector development from all over the world.
L29|The Gas Transportation Network as a ‘Lego’ Game: How to Play with It?|Gas transportation networks exhibit a quite substantial variety of technical and economical properties ranges roughly from an entrenched natural monopoly to near to an open competition platform. This empirical fact is widely known and accepted. However the corresponding frame of network analysis is lacking or quite fuzzy. As an infrastructure, can a gas network evolve or not from a natural monopoly (an essential facility) to an open infrastructure (a highway facility)? How can it be done with the same transportation infrastructure components within the same physical gas laws? Our paper provides a unified analytical frame for all types of gas transportation networks. It shows that gas transport networks are made of several components which can be combined in different ways. This very lego property of gas networks permits different designs with different economic properties while a certain infrastructural base and set of gas laws is common to all transportation networks. Therefore the notion of gas transportation network as a general and abstract concept does not have robust economic properties. The variety and modularity of gas networks come from the diversity of components, the variety of components combinations and the historical inclusion of components in the network. First, a gas network can combine different types of network components (primary or secondary ones). Second, the same components can be combined in different ways (notably regarding actual connections and flow paths). Third, as a capital-intensive infrastructure combining various specific assets, gas transportation networks show strong path dependency properties as they evolve slowly over time by moving from an already existing base. The heterogeneity of gas networks as sets of components comes firstly from the heterogeneity of the network components themselves, secondly from the different possibilities to combine these components and thirdly from the ‘path dependence’ character of gas network constructions. These three characteristics of gas networks explain the diversity of economic proprieties of the existent gas networks going from natural monopoly to competitive markets.
L29|Corporate Culture and the Tournament Hypothesis|The empirical literature on the effect of dispersion of executive remuneration (i.e., the intensity of a tournament structure) on the comparative performance of companies is mixed. Studies on US data tend to find strong positive effects but non-US studies tend to fail to find an effect. This suggests that tournaments are likely to be more effective in some situations than others. Using UK data we are able to exploit differences between companies as they become more Â‘AmericanisedÂ’ to provide some insight into this question. In the UK there has been a change towards the use of the US terminology CEO and away from the more tradition UK nomenclature of MD. A minority of UK companies retain the terminology MD. Also in some UK companies the top executive is a US citizen. Both these may tell us something about the culture of the company. We test whether tournaments are more likely to be effective if the company calls it top executive CEO and also if there is a US CEO. We find that increasing the dispersion of remuneration is no more effective for companies with CEOs than for MDs. However, we find that the situation is different when we look at companies with US CEOs relative to the rest of the sample. Here we find that increasing the dispersion is associated with better company performance.
L29|PMBOK-Compliance der Projektmanagement-Software Projektron BCS|Projekt-Compliance bedeutet die Befolgung von Gesetzen und sonstigen Regelwerken im Rahmen der Projektarbeit. Wie bei der Durchführung von Geschäftsprozessen sind auch in der Projektarbeit zahlreiche Vorgaben aus Gesetzen, Standards, Normen, Verträgen und weiteren unternehmensinternen und -externen Regularien zu beachten. Somit muss auch Projektarbeit compliant sein, d. h. Anforderungen aus unterschiedlichsten Regelwerken berücksichtigen und ihnen nachkommen. Zu den relevanten Regelwerken zählen auch Normen und Standards des Projektmanagements (PM), die wiederum durch PM-Softwaretools abzubilden sind. Somit stellt sich die Frage, inwieweit PM-Tools compliant sind zu bestimmten PM-Normen und -Standards. Zur Beantwortung sind PM-Normen und -Standards auf ihre Compliance-Anforderungen hin zu analysieren und der Grad der Erfüllung dieser Anforderungen durch PM-Tools ist zu bestimmen. Dies wird im Rahmen dieses Arbeitspapieres anhand der USamerikanischen Projektmanagement-Norm Project Management Body of Knowledge Guide (PMBOK Guide) und der Projektmanagement-Software Projektron BCS exemplarisch durchgeführt. Als Ergebnis ist festzuhalten, dass ein fundiertes Urteil über die PMBOK-Konformität von Projektmanagement-Tools durch die Ableitung von funktionalen und qualitätsbezogenen Anforderungen und die Bewertung ihrer Erfüllung durch das Tool möglich ist. Für die exemplarisch geprüfte Projektmanagement-Software Projektron BCS zeigt sich, dass diese in weiten Teilen, jedoch nicht in einem zentralen Element des PM-Wissensgebietes Kommunikationsmanagement PMBOK-compliant ist.
L29|Grundlagen der Projekt-Compliance|Compliance als Teilbereich der Corporate Governance betrifft zwar letztlich den Geschäftsalltag. Doch die hierbei genutzten Produkte bzw. Systeme werden vor ihrer Nutzung i. d. R. im Rahmen von Projekten - als üblicher Form zur Umsetzung von Vorhaben der Unternehmensentwicklung - geplant und realisiert. Also müssen Compliance-Anforderungen für die spätere Nutzung bereits in Projekten bei ihrer Gestaltung, Entwicklung und Implementierung berücksichtigt werden. Zudem unterliegt auch die Projektarbeit als solche - teilweise spezifischen - Compliance-Anforderungen. Wie bei der Durchführung von Geschäftsprozessen sind somit auch in der Projektarbeit zahlreiche Vorgaben aus Gesetzen, Standards, Normen, Verträgen und weiteren unternehmensinternen und -externen Regularien zu beachten. Das vorliegende Arbeitspapier unternimmt eine Begriffsklärung und entfaltet Projekt-Compliance als zunehmend wichtiges Handlungsfeld des Projektmanagements.
L29|Das Management des (un)erwünschten Ressourcenüberschusses - Teil I. Funktionen, Zustände und Entstehung des organizational slack|The object of the present analysis is organizational slack. The paper targets at a “slack type” which consists of basic information deriving from slack functions, slack conditions, antecedents of slack and dispositional requirements of slack. The purpose of the analysis is the creation of a preliminary heuristic for slack search, which combines all preconditions for systematical use of slack. The paper is the first part of an analysis series to the ambivalent role of organizational slack as an indicator of efficiency and inefficiency in the resource allocation process of a firm.
