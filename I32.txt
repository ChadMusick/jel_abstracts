I32|The Long-Term Effects of Cash Assistance|We investigate the long-term effects of cash assistance for beneficiaries and their children by following up with participants in the Seattle-Denver Income Maintenance Experiment. Treated families in this randomized experiment received thousands of dollars annually in extra government benefits for three or five years in the 1970s. We match experimental records to Social Security Administration data using a novel algorithm and find that treatment decreased adults' post-experimental annual earnings by $1,800 and increased disability benefit applications by 6.3 percentage points, possibly driven by occupational changes. In contrast, children in treated families experienced no significant effects on any main variable studied.
I32|Partial Identification of Economic Mobility: With an Application to the United States|The economic mobility of individuals and households is of fundamental interest. While many measures of economic mobility exist, reliance on transition matrices remains pervasive due to simplicity and ease of interpretation. However, estimation of transition matrices is complicated by the well-acknowledged problem of measurement error in self-reported and even administrative data. Existing methods of addressing measurement error are complex, rely on numerous strong assumptions, and often require data from more than two periods. In this paper, we investigate what can be learned about economic mobility as measured via transition matrices while formally accounting for measurement error in a reasonably trans- parent manner. To do so, we develop a nonparametric partial identification approach to bound transition probabilities under various assumptions on the measurement error and mobility processes. This approach is applied to panel data from the United States to explore short-run mobility before and after the Great Recession.
I32|Parental Child Care Time, Income and Subjective Well-Being: A Multidimensional Polarization Approach for Germany|Neither market income nor consumption expenditure provides an adequate picture of individual standard of living. It is time which enables and restricts individual activities and is a further brick to a more comprehensive picture of individual well-being. In our study we focus on a prominent part of time use in non-market services: it is parental child care which contributes not only to individual but also to societal well-being. Within a novel approach we ask for multidimensional polarization effects of parental child care where compensation/substitution of time for parental child care versus income is interdependently evaluated by panel estimates of society's subjective well-being. The new interdependent 2DGAP measure thereby provides multidimensional polarization intensity information for the poor and the rich and disentangles the single time and income contribution to subjective well-being for targeted policies ensuring at the same time the interdependence of the polarization dimensions. Socio-economic influences on the polarization pole risk and intensity will be quantified by two stage Heckman estimates. The analyses are based on the German Socio-Economic Panel with 21 waves and robust fixed effects estimates as well as the German Time Use Surveys 1991/92 and actual 2012/13 with detailed diary time use data. Prominent result: compensation between parental child care time and income proved to be significant, but there are multidimensional regions with no compensation, where parental child care time deficit is not compensated by income. Interdependent multidimensional polarization by headcount and intensity increased significantly over the twenty years under investigation with remarkable risk and intensity differences.
I32|Do constraints on women worsen child deprivations? Framework, measurement, and evidence from India|This paper provides a framework for analyzing constraints that apply specifically to women, which theory suggests may have negative impacts on child outcomes (as well as on women). We classify women’s constraints into four dimensions: (i) low influence on household decisions, (ii) restrictions on mobility, (iii) domestic physical and psychological abuse, and (iv) limited information access. Each of these constraints are in principle determined within households. We test the impact of women’s constraints on child outcomes using nationally representative household Demographic and Health Survey data from India, including 53,030 mothers and 113,708 children, collected in 2015-16. We examine outcomes including nutrition, health, education, water quality, and sanitation. In our primary specification, outcomes are measured as multidimensional deprivations incorporating indicators for each of these deficiencies, utilizing a version of UNICEF’s Multidimensional Overlapping Deprivation Analysis index. We identify causal impacts using a Lewbel specification and present an array of additional econometric strategies and robustness checks. We find that children of women who are subjected to domestic abuse, have low influence in decision making, and limited freedom of mobility are consistently more likely to be deprived, measured both multidimensionally and with separate indicators.
I32|Combining Administrative and Survey Data to Improve Income Measurement|We describe methods of combining administrative and survey data to improve the measurement of income. We begin by decomposing the total survey error in the mean of survey reports of dollars received from a government transfer program. We decompose this error into three parts, generalized coverage error (which combines coverage and unit non-response error and any error from weighting), item non-response or imputation error, and measurement error. We then discuss these three sources of error in turn and how linked administrative and survey data can assess and reduce each of these sources. We then illustrate the potential of linked data by showing how using linked administrative variables improves the measurement of income and poverty in the Current Population Survey, focusing on the substitution of administrative for survey data for three government transfer programs. Finally, we discuss how one can examine the accuracy of the underlying links used in the combined data.
I32|The Distribution of Well-Being among Europeans|We analyse the evolution of EU citizens’ living standards, considering the EU as a single country. Average living standards have improved considerably as the European integration process has unfolded. EU28 income inequality has steadily declined, mostly as a result of the macroeconomic convergence of new EU-accession countries. EU15 income inequality fell steadily until the mid-1980s, but picked up again during the economic turmoil following the Great Recession, largely reflecting the divergence between periphery and core countries in the euro area. Using a common EU standard reveals more progress in terms of poverty reduction. It also shows that the patterns of income convergence across member states differ across categories of residents, thus calling for a more careful consideration of the personal and national dimensions of EU policies.
I32|Growing into Relative Income Poverty: Urban China 1988 to 2013|This paper presents several arguments for applying a relative poverty line to urban China. For example between 2002 and 2013 urban residents in China changed their assessment of how much money that is necessary. Data from the China Household Income Project indicate that while, assessed against an absolute poverty line, poverty among Chinese urban residents was already fairly low in 2007, increasing proportions fell under a relative poverty line from 1988 to 2007. Thus income growth in urban China was more rapid in the middle segments of the income distribution that at it's lower segments. In 2013, at least as large fractions of the urban population as in many rich countries were deemed poor in relative terms. We also specify and estimate logit models for 2002 and 2013 after first having divided the samples into children, adults and elderly people. We find that the risk of being relative poor in urban China both years under study was positively associated with lack of work among adult household members, a low education of the household head, living in a low-income city, the number of children, and being aged and not receiving a pension. Pensions for the aged in combination with co-residency with adult children or with other adults have kept poverty rates among the increasing number of elderly in urban China from exceeding those among adults. In contrast, relative poverty rates are somewhat higher among children than among the entire urban population.
I32|Can Agricultural Extension and Input Support Be Discontinued? Evidence from a Randomized Phaseout in Uganda|Many development programs that attempt to disseminate improved technologies are limited in duration, either because of external funding constraints or an assumption of impact sustainability; but there is limited evidence on whether and when terminating such programs is efficient. We provide novel experimental evidence on the impacts of a randomized phase-out of an extension and subsidy program that promotes improved inputs and cultivation practices among smallholder women farmers in Uganda. We find that phase-out does not diminish the use of either practices or inputs, as farmers shift purchases from NGO-sponsored village-based supply networks to market sources. These results indicate short-term interventions can suffice to trigger persistent effects, consistent with models of technology adoption that emphasize learning from experience.
I32|Measuring Economic Mobility in India Using Noisy Data: A Partial Identification Approach|We examine economic mobility in India while rigorously accounting for measurement error. Such an analysis is imperative to fully understand the welfare effects of the rise in inequality that has occurred in India over the past few decades. To proceed, we extend recently developed methods on the partial identification of transition matrices and apply this methodology to newly available panel data on household consumption. We find overall mobility has been markedly low: at least 7 out of 10 poor households remain poor or at-risk of being poor between 2005 and 2012. We also find Muslims, lower caste groups, and rural households are in a more disadvantageous position in terms of escaping poverty or transitioning into poverty compared to Hindus, upper caste groups, and urban households. These findings suggest inequality in India is likely to be chronic and also challenges the conventional wisdom that marginalized households are catching up on average.
I32|Conflict and Poverty in Afghanistan's Transition|Despite record economic growth for more than a decade, poverty has remained stubbornly high in Afghanistan, especially in the regions that suffered less from conflict. This paper aims to explain this paradox by combining a model of conflict intensity at the province level over period 2007-14 with a model of consumption at the household level in 2011. Provincial data show that higher levels of conflict were positively correlated with both a larger presence of troops (international and Afghan) and larger aid flows. Household data show that the negative impact of conflict on consumption was more than offset by the positive impact of aid and troops. According to the estimates, Afghan troops contributed more to poverty reduction than international troops, possibly because they spent more locally. The paper uses the estimated models to conduct an out-of-sample validation exercise, focusing on the transition initiated in 2014. The results should be interpreted with caution, as the quantitative models cannot account for strategic shifts in the insurgency and watershed political developments. But they suggest that the reduction in the number of international troops and declining foreign aid flows led to an increase in conflict intensity and a decline in consumption per capita, matching current trends.
I32|Male students’ augmented underperformance with teacher-perceived gender stereotypes as score markers : natural experimental evidence from rural Philippines|Schoolboys in the Philippines are said to be underperforming in human capital accumulation, particularly education, compared to their female counterparts, especially in rural regions. Although existing literature has analyzed the sources of this bias, further research is required to understand its background. Thus, by combining our unique primary data from our own field survey using tailored questionnaires conducted in Marinduque Province and administrative data on the National Achievement Tests (NATs), we compare sources of the persistence of a negative male effect on test scores. We avail of the variations of blindness in rating systems between the NATs and teacher-rating report cards (RCs). Results of sensitivity analysis in regressions support the hypothesis that male students are systematically more likely to receive lower scores when they are evaluated in a non-blind rating system in which teachers know who the examinees are. The paper empirically presents an insightful perspective about Filipino s choolboys’underperformance being further augmmented through gender stereotypes perceived by the evaluators, in this case, the school teachers.
I32|Inferences and descriptive analyses on education, livelihoods, and rural poverty through fieldwork and tailored household survey in Marinduque, the Philippines|This paper spells out the descriptive information of our primary-data collection survey. The survey was conducted in the Marinduque province, the Philippines for researches on exploring male underperformance in education. The province was selected from the regions of typicality with the research topic in the country. The provincial economy is characterized as a rural economy in which primary sectors are prevailing. Self-employment miscellaneous occupations and public servants also prevail in the economy. The male youth in our sample underperform in education not only in academic achievements but also in enrollment status and daily activities as compare to their female counterparts. The male youth stopped or dropout from schooling earlier and more. While the hindrances to schoolings are generally common to both males and females, this paper presents some reported situations they face differently.
I32|The middle class in Japan, 1994-2009: Trends and characteristics|In this study, we estimate the population shares of the Japanese middle class during 1994-2009 and discuss its characteristics. The middle class hovered around 65% (from 67.29% in 1994 to 65.21% in 2009) of the population, having 75-200% of each year's median income. However, if we fix the income ranges of the middle class to the 1994 level, the middle class declined considerably to 59.47% in 2009, the upper class also declined, and the lower class and the poor increased. Thus, the stability of the middle class seems due to the overall decline in Japan's income distribution. In addition, the population share of the middle class among the working population (18-64 years) is larger than that among the elderly population (65 years and over). Therefore, the middle class is in danger of shrinking further as the population continues ageing. Meanwhile, population ageing also affects redistributive policies: the share of social transfers of gross income is increasing and the redistributive effect of social security is growing. Additionally, despite declining income levels, there were no major changes in the share of income tax (including social insurance premiums) on gross income. This is, in fact, assumed to be due to factors such as increased social insurance rates.
I32|Relative Income Poverty Rates and Poverty Alleviation via Tax/benefit Systems in 49 LIS-Countries, 1967-2016|Most welfare states design their tax/benefit system to combat income poverty. Some countries are more effective in poverty alleviation than others. What can explain these variations in outcomes and effectiveness? And has the redistributive power of different social programs changed over time and across countries? This paper analyzes the effectiveness of social transfers and income taxes in alleviating poverty. We focus on 49 LIS-countries for the period 1967-2016. We compare relative income poverty rates at the levels of market incomes and disposable incomes, that is before and after social transfers and income taxes, in order to analyze the effect of tax and transfer policies in reducing income poverty, i.e. to determine the target efficiency of social transfers. We perform several tests with the most recent data. Finally, we perform several partial analyses by disaggregating poverty rates to socioeconomic and demographic conditions in order to investigate to what extent variations at the social program level (such as old age pensions, child benefits) affect the measured effectiveness of the welfare state in alleviating income poverty. We use micro-data from the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) to examine household market income poverty and disposable income poverty, the antipoverty effect of social transfers and income taxes, and the underlying social programs that drive the changes. LIS data are detailed enough to allow us to measure both overall poverty reduction, and the partial effects of poverty reduction by several taxes or transfers. We elaborate on the work of Caminada et al (2017, 2018 and 2019). LIS data also allow us to decompose the trajectory of the market income poverty to disposable income poverty in several parts (i.e. 9 different benefits and income taxes and social contributions). The Leiden LIS Budget Incidence Fiscal Redistribution Dataset on Relative Income Poverty (LLBIFR Dataset on Relative Income Poverty 2019) allows researchers and public policy analysts to compare antipoverty effects across developed countries and middle income countries over the last five decades. Research may employ these data in addressing several important issues. Changes (in the generosity) of welfare states can be linked to changes in the antipoverty effects. Best-practices among countries can be identified and analyzed in detail. The LLBIFR on Relative Income Poverty 2019 with its detailed data on income taxes and a large number of individual social benefits offers a rich source of information which may be used by scholars and policy analysts to study the effects of different social programs on economic well-being.
I32|Impact of Fiscal Consolidation on the Mongolian Economy|The Government of Mongolia began implementing an IMF program under the Extended Fund Facility agreement (EFF) in May 2017. Under the program, the government has decreased expenditures and increased taxes to achieve debt sustainability via fiscal consolidation and stable growth. At the same time, the government has faced challenges because of its commitment of fiscal consolidation to the IMF: the rising price of fuel and its own fuel-subsidy policies. We used the PEP standard static CGE model to examine the impact of fiscal consolidation on the Mongolian economy under various conditions. Moreover, we used a poverty (microsimulation) model to analyze those impacts at a household level. Our analysis of the impact of fiscal consolidation under pessimistic and optimistic mineral-commodity-price scenarios showed that Mongoliaâ€™s economy was closely tied to international commodity prices. Our examination of the governmentâ€™s alternative policies on fuel subsidies in an environment of fiscal consolidation demonstrated that the effect of increased fuel prices on the economy depended upon government fuel-subsidy policy.
I32|The Economic and Environmental Impact of Foreign Direct Investment on the Mongolian Coal-Export Sector|This paper examines the impact of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) intended to increase the exporting capacity of the coal sector on the Mongolian economy and environment by using a recursive dynamic Computable General Equilibrium model. FDI was used to expand the coal-export sector as well as to construct a railway line connecting the Mongolian main coal reserve and the Chinese border. FDI had a positive impact on macroeconomic variables such as GDP, employment, investment, and household consumption but produced a Dutch disease effect in some sectors. The new railway reduced the environmental impact of transporting coal.
I32|Does social context affect poverty? The role of religious congregations|This paper contributes to the literature that aims at identifying and measuring the impact of social context on individual-level outcomes. We focus on religious congregations (social groups with which Christian worshipers feel associated) and investigate congregation effects on individual poverty using U.S. data and a multilevel approach. In order to correct for selection effects, we model congregation choice using a multinomial logit model and subsequently incorporate correction components into the multilevel model of congregation effects. Our empirical results support the existence of congregation effects and, therefore, the importance of social context on individual poverty. We find that congregation size, recreational services, initiatives to integrate new members and behavior standards play important roles in shaping the probability that churchgoers experience poverty. Individual behavior (in terms of participation in the religious life of congregations) also matters. These finding are in line with the idea that congregations’ activities can foster social interactions and cooperation reducing individual probability of experiencing poverty.
I32|Le politiche per l’assistenza: il Reddito di cittadinanza|During 2018 and the first part of 2019 the Italian debate on public expenditure for cash transfers has been dominated by two arguments: “Quota 100” for pensions and the Citizen’s Income (CI) for social assistance. This chapter is entirely devoted to the CI, which represents a turning point in policies against poverty in Italy, with positive aspects and some problems. After section 2, which updates the indexes on poverty and inequality in Italy, section 3 traces the history and the main contents of CI, formulating also some proposals to improve its design. Then a discussion of the quantitative effects of CI on poverty follows. Finally, section 5 deepens the relationship between poverty and the labour market, and the role that the CI could play in this context.
I32|Boosting quality education with inclusive human development: empirical evidence from sub-Saharan Africa|This study examines the importance of inclusive human development in promoting education quality in a panel of forty-nine Sub-Saharan African countries for the period 2000-2012. The empirical evidence is based on Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Fixed Effects (FE) and Quantile Regression (QR) estimations. It is apparent from the OLS and FE findings that inclusive human development has a negative effect on the outcome variable. This negative effect implies that inclusive human development improves education quality. This result should be understood in the light of the fact that the adopted education variable is a negative economic signal given that it is computed as the ratio of pupils to teachers. Therefore, a higher ratio reflects diminishing education quality. From QR, with the exception of the highest quantile, the tendency of inclusive human development in reducing poor quality education is consistent throughout the conditional distribution of poor education quality. Policy implications are discussed.
I32|Inequality and the Economic Participation of Women in Sub-Saharan Africa: An Empirical Investigation|This study investigates the effect of inequality on female employment in 42 countries in sub-Saharan Africa for the period 2004-2014. Three inequality indicators are used, namely, the: Gini coefficient, Atkinson index and Palma ratio. Two indicators of gender inclusion are also employed, namely: female employment and female unemployment rates. The empirical analysis is based on the Generalised Method of Moments (GMM).The following main findings are established. First, inequality increases female unemployment in regressions based on the Palma ratio. Second, from the robustness checks, inequality reduces female employment within the frameworks of the Gini coefficient and Palma ratio.
I32|Inequality thresholds,Governance and gender economic inclusion in Sub-Saharan Africa|Inequality and gender economic exclusion are major policy concerns facing sub-Saharan Africa in the post-2015 development agenda. The study provides critical masses of inequality that should not be exceeded if governance is to promote gender economic participation. The research focuses on 42 countries in sub-Saharan Africa using annual data spanning from 2004 to 2014. The empirical evidence is based on the Generalized Method of Moments. The following findings are established. First, inequality (i.e. the Gini coefficient) levels that completely nullify the positive effect of governance on female labour force participation are 0.708 for political stability, 0.601 for voice & accountability, 0.588 for government effectiveness, 0.631 for regulatory quality, 0.612 for the rule of law, and 0.550 for corruption-control. Second, inequality thresholds at which female unemployment can no longer be mitigated by governance channels include: 0.561 (for political stability) and 0.465 (for the rule of law). Third, inequality levels that completely dampen the positive impact of governance on female employment are 0.608 for political stability, 0.580 for voice & accountability, 0.581 for government effectiveness, and 0.557 for the rule of law. As the main policy implication, for good governance to promote gender economic inclusion, inequality levels should not exceed established thresholds.
I32|How enhancing gender inclusion affects inequality:Thresholds of complementary policies for sustainable development|This study investigates how enhancing gender inclusion affects inequality in 42 African countries for the period 2004-2014. The empirical evidence is based on the Generalized Method of Moments. Three inequality indicators are used, namely, the: Gini coefficient, Atkinson index, and Palma ratio. The two gender inclusion measurements used include female labour force participation and female employment. The following main findings are established. There are positive net effects on inequality from the enhancement of gender inclusion dynamics. An extended threshold analysis is used to assess critical masses at which further increasing gender inclusion enhances inequality. The established thresholds are: (i) 55.555 ?employment to population ratio, 15+, female (%)?for the nexus with the Gini coefficient. (ii) 50 ?labor force participation rate, female (% of female population ages 15+)? and between 50 to 55 ?employment to population ratio, 15+, female (%)?, for the Atkinson index. (iii) 61.87 ?labor force participation rate, female (% of female population ages 15+)? for the Palma ratio. These established thresholds are worthwhile for sustainable development because, beyond the critical masses, policy makers should complement the gender inclusion policy with other measures designed to reduce income inequality. Some complementary measures that can be taken on board beyond the established thresholds could focus on enhancing, inter alia: information and communication technology, infrastructural development; financial inclusion and inclusive education.
I32|Income levels,governance and inlusive human development in Sub-Saharan Africa|This study examines how income-driven governance affects inclusive human development in Sub-Saharan Africa with data for the period 2000-2012. The empirical evidence is based on the Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) and Tobit regressions. Nine bundled and unbundled concepts of governance are used: political (voice & accountability and political stability/no violence), economic (government effectiveness and regulation quality) and institutional (corruption-control and the rule of law) governances. The main finding is that ?middle income?-driven governance has a higher effect on inclusive human development than ?low income?-driven governance. Policy implications are discussed in the light of: (i) the contemporary relevance of findings; (ii) the pivotal role of a higher income level in the post-2015 sustainable development agenda; and (iii) inconsistent strands in the literature and in foreign aid policies.
I32|Industrial Growth in Sub-Saharan Africa: Evidence from Machine Learning with Insights from Nightlight Satellite Images|This study uses nightlight time data and machine learning techniques to predict industrial development in Africa. The results provide the first evidence on how machine learning techniques and nightlight data can be used to predict economic development in places where subnational data are missing or not precise. Taken together, the research confirms four groups of important determinants of industrial growth: natural resources, agriculture growth, institutions, and manufacturing imports. Our findings indicate that Africa should follow a more multisector approach for development, putting natural resources and agriculture productivity growth at the forefront.
I32|The Non-Standard Monetary Policy Measures of the ECB: Motivations, Effectiveness and Risks|This paper examines the challenges faced by the European Central Bank since the outbreak of the global financial crisis. From 2008 to 2014, the need to preserve the correct functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism and ensure the supply of credit to the private sector stretched the limits of conventional monetary policy. In 2015, the risk of deflation led the ECB to start a large scale asset purchase programme. The analysis is largely based on a review of the many studies that Banca d’Italia staff has produced on the factors that have brought inflation to unprecedented low levels in 2014 and on the effects of the asset purchase programme.
I32|La pobreza en Quibdó: Norte de carencias|A pesar de que la pobreza en Colombia se redujo considerablemente en las últimas cuatro décadas, Quibdó es la ciudad capital donde se mantienen los peores indicadores. El presente documento utiliza información cartográfica y espacial para caracterizar la pobreza de las comunas e identificar posibles trampas espaciales de pobreza en la capital chocoana. Los resultados muestran que la zona norte tiene los indicadores de pobreza y violencia más altos en la ciudad. No obstante las grandes inversiones en los últimos cinco años, se registra una persistencia en las condiciones de pobreza en Quibdó. Por ejemplo, el indicador de necesidades básicas insatisfechas continúa por encima del observado en varias ciudades capitales cuatro décadas atrás. Finalmente, el documento propone una opción de inversiones en varios sectores que podría ayudar a cerrar las brechas de pobreza a 2030. **** ABSTRACT: Besides an overall poverty reduction in Colombia in the last four decades, Quibdó remains as the capital city with the worst indicators. This paper assesses poverty in the communes of the city using spatial information and geographical maps attempting to identify possible spatial poverty traps. The results indicate that the north of the city faces the highest indicators of poverty and violence. Although public investment has increased in the last 5 years, the conditions of poverty persist. For example, the rate of unsatisfied basic needs remain higher than other capital cities four decades ago. To end with, the paper prioritizes investment in several sectors in order to bridge the poverty gap in 2030.
I32|Análisis de la Pobreza y Condiciones de Vida en Valledupar|En Valledupar la pobreza ha incrementado durante los últimos cuatro años, pasando de 27% en 2014 a 33,4% para 2017. La distribución del ingreso también sufrió un revés importante durante el mismo periodo de tiempo, cuando el coeficiente de Gini pasó de 0,42 a 0,46, lo que indica que en 2017 hubo una mayor concentración de la riqueza que en 2014 (DANE, 2018). Este documento estudia los principales factores que han incidido en el aumento de la pobreza y propone una serie de inversiones para contrarrestar la desmejora en las condiciones de vida de los valduparences. Los resultados indican que el deterioro en el mercado laboral (empleo, salarios e informalidad) y la calidad de la educación son los factores que explican el incremento en pobreza. Las inversiones propuestas en temas de educación, vivienda y trabajo, que reducirían la pobreza y generarían un entorno propicio para el desarrollo económico de Valledupar, requieren de $230 millones de dólares para los próximos 10 años, lo que implicaría un esfuerzo fiscal adicional por generar $22,8 millones de dólares adicionales anuales hasta 2030. **** ABSTRACT: Poverty rate increased six percentage points in the past four years in Valledupar (DANE, 2018). The income distribution deteriorated as well during the same period of time. This document studies the main factors that explain the rise in poverty in Valledupar during 2014-2017 and proposes a series of investments that will help the city to overcome this drawback in their economic and social development. The results show that the worsening in labor market conditions (wages, employment and informality rate) due to negative shocks in coal prices and low quality of education are the factors driving the poor performance of Valledupar in terms of poverty reduction. We propose a set of investments in education, labor policy and housing that cost $230 millions of dollars for the next 10 years, in order to create structural conditions for development and lower poverty.
I32|Social Security Replacement Rates and Other Benefit Measures: An In-Depth Analysis|In this report, CBO examines whether Social Security benefits enable retired workers to meet their basic needs and the extent to which benefits replace preretirement earnings. Focusing on workers with long careers, CBO finds that those benefits enable most of those workers to cover their essential living expenses as measured by the official federal poverty threshold. However, the extent to which benefits replace preretirement earnings varies substantially, depending on the way benefits and earnings are measured.
I32|Childhood Circumstances and Young Adulthood Outcomes: The Role of Mothers’ Financial Problems|We here consider the cognitive and non-cognitive consequences on young adults of growing up with a mother who reported experiencing major financial problems. We use UK data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children to show that early childhood financial problems are associated with worse adolescent cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes, controlling for both income and a set of standard variables, and in value-added models controlling for children’s earlier age-5 outcomes. The estimated effect of financial problems is almost always larger in size than that of income. Around one-quarter to one-half of the effect of financial problems on the non-cognitive outcomes seems to transit through mother’s mental health.
I32|Understanding the relationship between inequalities and poverty: mechanisms associated with crime, the legal system and punitive sanctions|This paper outlines the various issues pertaining to how crime, the legal system and punitive sanctions may provide a mechanism through which inequality is positively related to poverty. We analyse trends in crime rates, review evidence on the determinants of criminal activity, trends in incarceration rates and prison populations, and the profile of prisoners. We explore relevant aspects of criminal justice policies, changes to Legal Aid, and legal reforms, and finish by outlining how the evidence suggests that crime, the legal system and punitive sanctions is one of the mechanisms that contributes to the positive link between economic inequality and poverty, before reviewing policy options.
I32|Understanding the relationship between poverty, inequality and growth: a review of existing evidence|This paper reviews the theoretical literature and empirical evidence on the relationship between poverty, inequality and economic growth. It finds evidence that economic inequality is good for growth as well as new convincing evidence that inequality is bad for growth. Variation in data quality, methodologies, the range of countries included in different studies makes it difficult to compare the evidence. A recent hypothesis that the relationship between inequality and growth might be non-linear, with very low and very high levels of inequality being harmful to growth but a range in between where the relationship is not clearly defined might provide a means to unify some of the conflicting findings.
I32|Diverging Identification of the Poor: A non-random process. Chile 1992–2017|This paper explores and compares how two different approaches identify the poor. We investigated the degree of association in the identification of the poor between the utilitarian approach, implemented through the standard monetary FGT measure, and the capability approach, implemented through the Alkire-Foster method. The correlation between socioeconomic characteristics and demographics with a measure of the association in the identification of the poor is investigated at the province level by using a panel fixed-effects model. In addition, using different cross-sections of the data, we study the issue at the household level by means of a logit model. In both cases, household non-eligibility across some of the indicators of the multidimensional poverty index is a relevant empirical issue that needs to be considered. In Chile, we find that in the past 25 years, the level of association between the two poverty measures has declined at a rate of 1.5% per year, being robust in alternative measures of association in the identification of the poor. The decline is unimportant during the 1990s, a decade of rapid economic growth, while it is notable thereafter, in a period characterized by modest economic growth and the progressive introduction and deepening of social policies. We find that a rural location of residence and demographic changes can explain the reduction. Income-poor households are more likely to be multidimensionally poor if their stock of education is lower, if their size is larger, and if they are located in rural areas. Consequently, the poverty overlap decline is a real process, in which the inconsistent of the poor is not randomly distributed across the population. On the basis of our results, we hypothesize that the reduction in the overlap between these two poverty measures is a general phenomenon that tends to occur in countries undergoing demographic transition, urbanization, and progress in education. If so, and given the fact that poverty alleviation strategies are adopted partly on the basis of poverty statistics, in the developing world, the diverging identification of the poor might have distributive consequences for the poor themselves.
I32|The Long-Term Effects of Parental Separation on Childhood Multidimensional Deprivation: A Lifecourse Approach|Abstract A large literature has documented the impact of parental separation on children’s financial poverty. However, income has been increasingly criticized as an indicator of childhood living conditions and deprivation. In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework and adapt existing measures of adult multi-domain deprivation to produce childhood deprivation indicators that are age-specific and child-centred. These new indicators allow within-individual, longitudinal analyses to measure the impact of a shock on childrens living conditions. We apply this method to explore the long term effects of parental separation on childhood deprivation, considering four dimensions of children’s lives: leisure; material conditions; parenting behaviours and routines; and basic material goods. We track children over the first decade of life by using a nationally representative UK cohort of over 18,000 children. Using a fixed-effects framework, we find that, while the increase in income poverty after parental separation is large, the impact on childhood deprivation was more mixed. Our results suggest that, while facing strong financial constraints, separated parents cut back on normative but costly activities such as holidays and outings, but attempt to maintain children’s basic material circumstances and their day-to-day parenting and routines, at least around separation. However, heterogeneous effects exist, suggesting that parents’ pre-separation social and economic capital may play an important role. This approach therefore adds more precision and nuance to our understanding of the processes around parental separation and its impacts on children.
I32|Intertemporal pro-poorness|Abstract A long-lasting scientific and policy debate queries the impact of growth on distribution. A specific branch of the micro-oriented literature, known as ‘pro-poor growth’, seeks in particular to understand the impact of growth on poverty. Much of that literature supposes that the distributional impact should be measured in an anonymous fashion. The income dynamics and mobility impacts of growth are thus ignored. The paper extends this framework in two important manners. First, the paper uses an ‘intertemporal pro-poorness’ formulation that accounts separately for anonymous and mobility growth impacts. Second, the paper’s treatment of mobility encompasses both the benefit of “mobility as equalizer” and the variability cost of poverty transiency. Several decompositions are proposed to measure the importance of each of these impacts of growth on the pro-poorness of distributional changes. The framework is applied to panel data on 23 European countries drawn from the ‘European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions’ survey.
I32|Premature mortality and poverty measurement in an OLG economy|Abstract Following Kanbur and Mukherjee (Bull Econ Res 59(4):339–359 2007), a solution to the “missing poor” problem (i.e., selection bias in poverty measures due to income-differentiated mortality) consists in computing hypothetical poverty rates while assigning a fictitious income to the prematurely dead. However, in a dynamic general equilibrium economy, doing “as if” the prematurely dead were still alive is likely to affect wages, output and capital accumulation, with an uncertain effect on poverty. We develop a three-period OLG model with income-differentiated mortality and compare actual poverty rates with hypothetical poverty rates that would have prevailed if everyone faced the survival conditions of the top income class. Including the prematurely dead has an ambiguous impact on poverty, since it affects income distribution through capital dilution, composition effects, and horizon effects. Our results are illustrated by quantifying the impact of income-differentiated mortality on poverty measures for France (1820–2010).
I32|Missing poor and income mobility|Higher mortality among the poor prevents standard poverty measures from quantifying the actual extent of old-age poverty. Whereas existing attempts to deal with the ”missing poor” problem assume the absence of income mobility and assign to the prematurely dead a fictitious income equal to the last income enjoyed, this paper relaxes that assumption in order to study the impact of income mobility on the size of the missing poor bias. We use data on poverty above age 60 in 12 countries from the EU-SILC database, and we compare standard poverty rates with the hypothetical poverty rates that would have prevailed if (i) all individuals, whatever their income, had enjoyed the same survival conditions, and if (ii) all individuals within the same income class had been subject to the same income mobility process. Taking income mobility into account has unequal effects on corrected poverty measures across countries, and, hence, affects international comparisons in terms of old-age poverty.
I32|Försörjningsstöd, institutioner och strukturcykeln|Ur ett strukturcykliskt perspektiv sker en omvandling av ekonomi, institutioner och politik under omvandlingsperioderna. Då välfärd kan betraktas som en funktion av dessa borde det vara möjligt att analysera välfärd och de institutionella arrangemang som är nödvändiga för en välfärdsproduktion med hjälp av en strukturcyklisk ansats. Lennart Schön har i ett flertal studier diskuterat detta samband, men på en hög teoretiskt abstraktionsnivå. Denna uppsats syftar till att diskutera i vilken utsträckning ett strukturanalytiskt resonemang är tillämpligt vid analyser av tillkomst och förändring av olika välfärdsarrangemang och social reformarbete. Socialtjänst och försörjningsstöd, samt deras föregångare, används som exempel. Resultaten indikerar att 1871 års fattigvårdsförordning, 1918 års fattigvårdslag, 1956 års socialhjälpslag och 1997 års socialtjänstlag styrts eller i stor utsträckning påverkats av sociala utvecklingsblock, medan 1980 års socialtjänstlag snarare tillkommit enligt ett kris-/skördetidsmönster.
I32|The Effect of Education on Poverty: A European Perspective|This paper provides evidence on the causal relationship between education and poverty. I construct a novel database comprising compulsory schooling reforms in 32 European countries and use them as instruments for education. I find economically large poverty-reducing effects of education among people aged 30 to 80. This holds true for both objective measures of poverty (relative income poverty, lack of basic necessities, weak labor market attachment) and a subjective measure of poverty (self-assessed difficulties in making ends meet). An additional year of education thus reduces not only the likelihood of being classified as living in poverty but also the likelihood of considering oneself to live in poverty. Increases in labor force participation and full-time employment as well as better health are potential mechanisms behind these results.
I32|Defining and measuring energy poverty in Poland|The EU Member States are obliged to assess the scale of energy poverty in their respective national contexts. We propose a new definition of energy poverty in Poland, with different levels of specificity corresponding to the needs of different levels of administration. We also propose a set of five indicators for measuring energy poverty based on data from the Polish Household Budget Survey. Two expenditure-based indicators identify energy-poor households: a modified version of the Low Income High Cost indicator and an indicator based on actual energy expenditures. Three self-reported indicators related to financial capability, the physical condition of the dwelling, and the subjective level of thermal comfort are used to measure the severity of energy poverty. We find that all five indicators show that the older the dwelling is, the higher the risk of energy poverty is. Moreover, while the expenditure-based measures show that households living in detached houses have higher energy poverty rates than households living in multifamily buildings, the thermal comfort indicator shows the opposite relationship. Households living in dwellings without central heating are at a higher risk of energy poverty, according to all self-reported indicators.
I32|Measuring energy poverty in Poland with the Multidimensional Energy Poverty Index|Energy poverty is a complex problem that is generally caused by having a low income, having high energy costs, and/or living in a home with low energy efficiency. Various indicators capture these factors, but there is no consensus among researchers on which is the best one, or on how to combine them. Thus, poverty mapping and policy planning would benefit from having access to a unitary index of poverty. We have created a multidimensional energy poverty index using the methodology proposed by Alkire and Foster (2008). The index accounts for five dimensions of energy deprivation: two objective indicators of “low income, high costs” and “high share of energy expenditure in income”, as well as three subjective indicators of “inability to keep the home adequately warm”, “presence of leaks, damp, or rot” and “difficulties paying utility bills”. We define households as poor if at least two forms of deprivation are present. We apply our index to Poland using Household Budget Survey data. We find that in 2017, 10% of households in Poland suffered from multidimensional energy poverty, and that about half of these households were also income-poor. Households living in buildings built before 1946, households living in rural areas, and households that were dependent on retirement and disability pensions or on unearned sources of income were at especially high risk of energy poverty.
I32|Targeting when Poverty is Multidimensional|The view of poverty as a multidimensional phenomenon has swiftly become mainstream. However, the debate remains open as to how such ?multidimensional poverty? should be assessed in practical settings, particularly when identifying the beneficiaries of poverty alleviation programmes. This paper develops a novel empirical approach that explicitly takes into account the goals and needs of the policy-maker. In particular, the paper takes up the case of a government official running a budget constrained programme to alleviate a few dimensions of poverty, and translates her concerns into a set of desiderata which the multidimensional measure should meet. The policy-maker targeting ability and aversion to the risk of leakages play crucial roles in setting the desired properties. We illustrate our methodology in the context of a CCT programme in Peru, and show that it improves expected leaking and undercoverage relative to alternative Alkire-Foster based approaches.
I32|The distribution of well-being among Europeans|We analyse the evolution of EU citizens’ living standards, considering the EU as a single country. Average living standards have improved considerably as the European integration process has unfolded. EU28 income inequality has steadily declined, mostly as a result of the macroeconomic convergence of new EU-accession countries. EU15 income inequality fell steadily until the mid-1980s, but picked up again during the economic turmoil following the Great Recession, largely reflecting the divergence between periphery and core countries in the euro area. Using a common EU standard reveals more progress in terms of poverty reduction. It also shows that the patterns of income convergence across member states differ across categories of residents, thus calling for a more careful consideration of the personal and national dimensions of EU policies.
I32|Inequality and growth: The cholesterol hypothesis|A fundamental unsolved question in economics is whether inequality is good or bad for growth. We argue here that this lack of consensus is due to the cholesterol hypothesis. This hypothesis states that the part of inequality generated by factors beyond the individuals’ control, referred to as inequality of opportunity (IO), is growth-deterring, while the type of inequality generated by the difference in the willingness to exert effort, referred to as inequality of pure effort (IE), is growth-enhancing. We first build an overlapping generation model with human capital to derive a reduced-form growth equation consistent with this hypothesis, and the existing interaction between poverty and inequality. Then, given the inherent difficulty to decompose total inequality into IO and IE, we develop a strategy to test the cholesterol hypothesis: by extending the standard inequality-growth equation with a proxy of IO, the estimated coefficient of inequality must increase, while the coefficient of the IO proxy must be negative. Next, we use the best available data at worldwide level and, given the limitations of the existing IO indices, we construct an alternative proxy of IO by considering that the quality of institutions and ethnic and religious tensions are relevant macroeconomic drivers of IO. Using an instrumental variable approach and different samples and IO measures, our results do not reject the cholesterol hypothesis at worldwide level.
I32|Urban poverty: Theory and evidence from American cities|The concentrated poverty index, i.e. the proportion of a metro area's poor population living in extreme-poverty neighborhoods, is widely adopted as a policy-relevant measure of urban poverty. We challenge this view and develop a family of new indices of urban poverty that, differently from concentrated poverty measures, i) capture aspects of the incidence and distribution of poverty across neighborhoods and ii) are grounded on empirical evidence that living in a high-poverty neighborhood is detrimental for many dimensions of residents's well-being. We demonstrate that a parsimonious axiomatic model that incorporates these two aspects characterizes exactly one urban poverty index. We show that changes of this urban poverty index within the same city are additively decomposable into the contribution of demographic, convergence, re-ranking and spatial effects. We collect new evidence of heterogeneous patterns and trends of urban poverty across American metro areas over the last 35 years and use city characteristics to identify relevant drivers.
I32|Measuring the Distributional Impact of Taxation and Public Spending: The Practice of Fiscal Incidence Analysis|Taxation and public spending are key policy levers the state has in its power to change the distribution of income. One of the most commonly used methods to measure the distributional impact of a country’s taxes and public spending is fiscal incidence analysis. Rooted in the field of Public Finance, fiscal incidence analysis is the method utilized to allocate taxes and public spending to households so that one can compare incomes before taxes and transfers with incomes after them. Standard fiscal incidence analysis just looks at what is paid and what is received without assessing the behavioral responses that taxes and public spending may trigger on individuals or households. This is often referred to as the “accounting approach.” Although the theory is quite straightforward, its application can be fraught with complications. The salient ones are discussed here. While ignoring behavioral responses and general equilibrium effects is a limitation of the accounting approach, the effects calculated with this method are considered a reasonable approximation of the short-run welfare impact. Fiscal incidence analysis, however, can be designed to include behavioral responses as well as general equilibrium and inter-temporal effects. This article focuses on the implementation of fiscal incidence analysis using the accounting approach.
I32|The Effect of Government Health Expenditure on the Income Distribution: A Comparison of Valuation Methods in Ghana|Government spending on services affects the level and distribution of welfare, but measuring its value is a challenge. To assess how publicly funded in-kind health care affects the income distribution, we must estimate its monetary value to beneficiaries. We describe and compare three approaches to measuring the distributional consequences of government health spending: average cost of provision, willingness-to-pay, and health outcomes. In addition, we estimate the value of financial risk protection from insurance, which is a benefit of health spending that can be added to each of the aforementioned approaches. Average cost is the standard method used in benefit-incidence studies (Lustig, 2018). This method values utilization of each unit of care at the government’s average cost of provision, calculated with national accounts data and administrative records. Willingness to pay uses revealed preference to estimate compensating variations for health care subsidies. The health outcomes method estimates the effect of government health spending on mortality and values those mortality reductions in monetary terms. We provide example applications for each of these methods using a national cross-section from Ghana for 2012/13. We estimate a willingness to pay model for outpatient services and find that, on average, users value those services at less than what the government pays for them. The estimated marginal effect of health spending for outpatient care on inequality are modest and somewhat smaller than those for the average cost approach. In contrast, the health outcomes method finds that the marginal effects of health spending for three causes of death and five health interventions are very large. Health interventions to reduce malaria mortality such as indoor residual spraying and distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets are strongly progressive and the averted mortality from providing anti-malarial medication dwarfs the distributional effects of any other public expenditure or tax in Ghana. Adopting the health outcomes approach dramatically changes our assessment of how public spending in Ghana affects the welfare distribution. The benefit of financial risk protection from Ghana’s National Health Insurance Scheme equals 0.25% to 0.5% of income for the three poorest quartiles and between 0.5% and 1% of income for the wealthiest, yet insurance is still distributed somewhat more equally than income itself.
I32|Who is an internal migrant?|There is no internationally accepted definition of an internal migrant. Different surveys and academic papers use varied definitions that are open to subjectivity. Our paper stresses this issue and tests the sensitivity of results obtained by econometric analysis to the use of different defining criterion. Using four definitions of an internal migrant based on aspects of varied time intervals, purpose of migration and geographical shifts, we examine the determinants of the migration decision and the impact of migration on the householdâ€™s income. We employ Probit modelling and difference-in-difference Probability Score Matching to estimate the two questions, respectively. We find that a change in definition alters the target sample and therefore induces identification errors. In case of determinants, the magnitude and significance of variables capturing human and social capital, socio-demography and wealth of the household change across the four definitions. Additionally, having a migrant, increases the householdâ€™s income under two definitions, while negatively impacting the householdâ€™s income under the other two definitions. Therefore, it is pertinent to standardize the definition of an internal migrant before assessing the impact of migration. Our paper aims to bring this issue to the attention of international organizations and future researchers who work in the area of migration. It advocates for a standardized definition by proposing basic guidelines.
I32|Do Constraints on Women Worsen Child Deprivations? Framework, Measurement, and Evidence from India|This paper provides a framework for analyzing constraints that apply specifically to women, which theory suggests may have negative impacts on child outcomes (as well as on women). We classify women's constraints into four dimensions: (i) domestic physcial and psychological abuse, (ii) low influence on household decisions, (iii) restrictions on mobility, and (iv) limited information access. Each of these constraints are in principle determined within households. We test the impact of women's constraints on child outcomes using nationally representative household Demographic and Health Survey data from India, including 53,030 mothers and 113,708 children, collected in 2015-16. Outcomes are measured as multidimensional deprivations, utilizing UNICEF's Multidimensional Overlapping Deprivation Analysis index, incorporating deficiencies in children's access to water, sanitation, housing, healthcare, nutrition, education and information. We identify causal impacts using a Lewbel specification and present an array of additional econometric strategies and robustness checks. We find that children of women who are subjected to domestic abuse, have low influence in decision making, and limited freedom of mobility are more likely to be deprived.
I32|Grandparents, Mothers, or Fathers? Why Children of Teen Mothers do Worse in Life|Women who give birth as teens have worse subsequent educational and labor market outcomes than women who have first births at older ages. However, previous research has attributed much of these effects to selection rather than a causal effect of teen childbearing. Despite this, there are still reasons to believe that children of teen mothers may do worse as their mothers may be less mature, have fewer financial resources when the child is young, and may partner with fathers of lower quality. Using Norwegian register data, we compare outcomes of children of sisters who have first births at different ages. Our evidence suggests that the causal effect of being a child of a teen mother is much smaller than that implied by the cross-sectional differences but that there are still significant long-term, adverse consequences, especially for children born to the youngest teen mothers. Unlike previous research, we have information on fathers and find that negative selection of fathers of children born to teen mothers plays an important role in producing inferior child outcomes. These effects are particularly large for mothers from higher socio-economic groups.
I32|Inequality and the Economic Participation of Women in Sub-Saharan Africa: An Empirical Investigation|This study investigates the effect of inequality on female employment in 42 countries in sub-Saharan Africa for the period 2004-2014. Three inequality indicators are used, namely, the: Gini coefficient, Atkinson index and Palma ratio. Two indicators of gender inclusion are also employed, namely: female employment and female unemployment rates. The empirical analysis is based on the Generalised Method of Moments (GMM).The following main findings are established. First, inequality increases female unemployment in regressions based on the Palma ratio. Second, from the robustness checks, inequality reduces female employment within the frameworks of the Gini coefficient and Palma ratio.
I32|How Enhancing Gender Inclusion Affects Inequality: Thresholds of Complementary Policies for Sustainable Development|This study investigates how enhancing gender inclusion affects inequality in 42 African countries for the period 2004-2014. The empirical evidence is based on the Generalized Method of Moments. Three inequality indicators are used, namely, the: Gini coefficient, Atkinson index, and Palma ratio. The two gender inclusion measurements used include female labour force participation and female employment. The following main findings are established. There are positive net effects on inequality from the enhancement of gender inclusion dynamics. An extended threshold analysis is used to assess critical masses at which further increasing gender inclusion enhances inequality. The established thresholds are: (i) 55.555 â€œemployment to population ratio, 15+, female (%)â€ for the nexus with the Gini coefficient. (ii) 50 â€œlabor force participation rate, female (% of female population ages 15+)â€ and between 50 to 55 â€œemployment to population ratio, 15+, female (%)â€ , for the Atkinson index. (iii) 61.87 â€œlabor force participation rate, female (% of female population ages 15+)â€ for the Palma ratio.These established thresholds are worthwhile for sustainable development because, beyond the critical masses, policy makers should complement the gender inclusion policy with other measures designed to reduce income inequality. Some complementary measures that can be taken on board beyond the established thresholds could focus on enhancing, inter alia: information and communication technology, infrastructural development; financial inclusion and inclusive education.
I32|Inequality Thresholds, Governance and Gender Economic Inclusion in sub-Saharan Africa|Inequality and gender economic exclusion are major policy concerns facing sub-Saharan Africa in the post-2015 development agenda. The study provides critical masses of inequality that should not be exceeded if governance is to promote gender economic participation. The research focuses on 42 countries in sub-Saharan Africa using annual data spanning from 2004 to 2014. The empirical evidence is based on the Generalized Method of Moments. The following findings are established. First, inequality (i.e. the Gini coefficient) levels that completely nullify the positive effect of governance on female labour force participation are 0.708 for political stability, 0.601 for voice & accountability, 0.588 for government effectiveness, 0.631 for regulatory quality, 0.612 for the rule of law, and 0.550 for corruption-control. Second, inequality thresholds at which female unemployment can no longer be mitigated by governance channels include: 0.561 (for political stability) and 0.465 (for the rule of law). Third, inequality levels that completely dampen the positive impact of governance on female employment are 0.608 for political stability, 0.580 for voice & accountability, 0.581 for government effectiveness, and 0.557 for the rule of law. As the main policy implication, for good governance to promote gender economic inclusion, inequality levels should not exceed established thresholds.
I32|Income Levels, Governance and Inclusive Human Development in Sub-Saharan Africa|This study examines how income-driven governance affects inclusive human development in Sub-Saharan Africa with data for the period 2000-2012. The empirical evidence is based on the Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) and Tobit regressions. Nine bundled and unbundled concepts of governance are used: political (voice & accountability and political stability/no violence), economic (government effectiveness and regulation quality) and institutional (corruption-control and the rule of law) governances. The main finding is that â€˜middle incomeâ€™-driven governance has a higher effect on inclusive human development than â€˜low incomeâ€™-driven governance. Policy implications are discussed in the light of: (i) the contemporary relevance of findings; (ii) the pivotal role of a higher income level in the post-2015 sustainable development agenda; and (iii) inconsistent strands in the literature and in foreign aid policies.
I32|Homeownership Investment and Tax Neutrality. A joint assessment of income and property taxes in Europe|Western countries’ income tax system exempts the return from investing in owner-occupied housing. Returns from other investments are instead taxed, thus distorting households’ portfolio choices, although it is argued that housing property taxation might act as a counterbalance. Based on data drawn from the Statistics of Income and Living Conditions and the UK Family Resources Survey, and building on tax benefit model EUROMOD, we provide novel evidence on the interplay of income and property taxation in budgetary, efficiency and equity terms in eight European countries. Results reveal that, even accounting for recurrent housing property taxation, a sizeable ‘homeownership bias’ i.e. a lighter average and marginal taxation for homeownership investment, is embedded in current tax systems, and displays heterogeneous distributional profiles across different countries. Housing property taxation represents only a partial correction towards neutrality.
I32|Can Women's Self-Help Groups Contribute to Sustainable Development ? Evidence of Capability Changes from Northern India|This paper investigates a women's self-help group program with more than 1.5 million participants in one of the poorest rural areas of Northern India. The program has four streams of activity in micro-savings, agricultural enterprise training, health and nutrition education, and political participation. The paper considers whether there is any evidence that program membership is associated with quality of life improvement. Using new data on a variety of self-reported capability indicators from members and non-members, the paper estimates propensity score matching models and reports evidence of differences in some dimensions as well as significant benefits to those from the most disadvantaged groups?scheduled castes and tribes. The paper considers robustness and concludes that for some dimensions, there is evidence that the program has contributed to sustainable development through improvements in the quality of life.
I32|Persistenz von Selbstständigen in der Grundsicherung|Die vorliegende Untersuchung setzt sich mit der Situation von Selbstständigen in der Grund-sicherung auseinander. Ursächlich für den Bezug von ergänzenden Leistungen der Grundsi-cherung sind in den meisten Fällen deutlich rückläufige Einkommen. Tatsächlich ist die Ein-kommenssituation selbstständiger Leistungsberechtigter trotz guter Ausbildung und langer Arbeitszeiten noch deutlich schlechter als die der abhängig Beschäftigten in der Grundsiche-rung. Dennoch gelingt es den meisten Selbstständigen, die Hilfebedürftigkeit relativ schnell wieder zu beenden. Ein Teil von ihnen ist allerdings verhältnismäßig lange auf ALG II ange-wiesen. Da dies in den meisten Fällen betriebliche Gründe haben dürfte, ist hier möglicher-weise das der Selbstständigkeit zugrunde liegende Geschäftsmodell kritisch zu hinterfragen. Allgemein ist die Grundsicherung für Selbstständige jedoch ein sinnvolles Instrument, das es vielen ermöglicht, ihr Unternehmen nach einer Krise neu auszurichten und anschließend wieder auf eigenen Beinen stehen zu können.
I32|A deprivation-based assessment of energy poverty: Conceptual problems and application to Germany|In this paper, subjective and objective aspects of deprivation are used to derive an aggregated multidimensional measure of energy poverty. The proposed measure is based on deprivation with a direct relation to energy consumption, but it also accounts for excessive financial restrictions due to energy costs, it gives priority to low income households, and controls for economic energy use. Based on logistic regression, we find strong effects of income and energy expenditure on the likelihood of energy deprivation in Germany, but these variables only partially constitute energy poverty. Other aspects, e.g. employment status or housing conditions, play an important role as well.
I32|Lower and Upper Bounds of Inequality of Opportunity in Emerging Economies|Equality of opportunity is an important normative ideal that concerns politicians and the larger public alike. In spite of its wide acceptance, current estimation approaches in the literature suffer from severe data restrictions that lead to biased estimates of inequality of opportunity. These shortcomings are particularly pronounced for emerging economies in which comprehensive household survey data often is unavailable. In this paper, we address these issues by estimating lower and upper bounds of inequality of opportunity for a set of emerging economies. Thereby, we address recent critiques that worry about the prevalence of lower bound estimates and the ensuing scope for downplaying the normative significance of inequality.
I32|Análisis Cualitativo de Sinergias entre Estrategias de Protección Social y de Desarrollo Productivo: El Papel de la Estrategia Unidos y Familias en Acción en el Marco del Programa Familias en su Tierra|Este documento presenta el análisis cualitativo de complementariedades y sinergias entre los programas de protección social Estrategia Unidos y Familias en Acción, y el programa de inclusión productiva Familias en su Tierra, diseñados e implementados en Colombia por Prosperidad Social. Este estudio hace parte del Proyecto “Mejorando la Articulación entre Programas de Desarrollo Rural y Protección Social” financiado por el Fondo Internacional de Desarrollo Agrícola -FIDA-. El análisis se desarrolló a partir de la aplicación de 43 entrevistas semi-estructuradas a beneficiarios y no beneficiarios de estos programas en dos zonas del país: Montes de María y Urabá Antioqueño. Los resultados ofrecen luces sobre varios mecanismos a través de los cuales los programas alcanzan sus objetivos, así como los canales a partir de los cuales es posible la generación de complementariedades o sinergias entre programas de protección social e intervenciones de índole productivo. Los resultados cualitativos también complementan y permiten explicar los resultados del análisis cuantitativo.
I32|The Graduation approach for the reduction of extreme poverty: impact evaluation of Sembrando Oportunidades Familia por Familia in Paraguay|Rural poverty, a widespread problem for the Paraguayan government over the last decade –as well as for other economies in the region-, led to the implementation, in 2016 and 2017, of the “Sembrando Oportunidades Familia por Familia” pilot program, an initiative based on the graduation approach to reduce the incidence of extreme poverty in rural areas. Evaluating the intervention results is essential to understand the effectiveness of this approach in reducing poverty in the Paraguayan context, where the government is in charge of its implementation. For this evaluation, an instrumental-variable impact evaluation and a results evaluation were conducted, showing significant positive changes in the treated households’ productive capacity and savings behavior as well in their perception of wellbeing. These results are useful for the design of a program that can help to effectively overcome extreme poverty in this and other developing countries. This exercise is part of the set of evaluations carried out by the Platform for Evaluation and Learning of the Graduation Program in Latin America (www.plataformagraduacionla.info).
I32|La pobreza en Quibdó: Norte de carencias|A pesar de que la pobreza en Colombia se redujo considerablemente en las últimas cuatro décadas, Quibdó es la ciudad capital donde se mantienen los peores indicadores. El presente documento utiliza información cartográfica y espacial para caracterizar la pobreza de las comunas e identificar posibles trampas espaciales de pobreza en la capital chocoana. Los resultados muestran que la zona norte tiene los indicadores de pobreza y violencia más altos en la ciudad. No obstante las grandes inversiones en los últimos cinco años, se registra una persistencia en las condiciones de pobreza en Quibdó. Por ejemplo, el indicador de necesidades básicas insatisfechas continúa por encima del observado en varias ciudades capitales cuatro décadas atrás. Finalmente, el documento propone una opción de inversiones en varios sectores que podría ayudar a cerrar las brechas de pobreza a 2030. **** ABSTRACT: Besides an overall poverty reduction in Colombia in the last four decades, Quibdó remains as the capital city with the worst indicators. This paper assesses poverty in the communes of the city using spatial information and geographical maps attempting to identify possible spatial poverty traps. The results indicate that the north of the city faces the highest indicators of poverty and violence. Although public investment has increased in the last 5 years, the conditions of poverty persist. For example, the rate of unsatisfied basic needs remain higher than other capital cities four decades ago. To end with, the paper prioritizes investment in several sectors in order to bridge the poverty gap in 2030.
I32|Análisis de la Pobreza y Condiciones de Vida en Valledupar|En Valledupar la pobreza ha incrementado durante los últimos cuatro años, pasando de 27% en 2014 a 33,4% para 2017. La distribución del ingreso también sufrió un revés importante durante el mismo periodo de tiempo, cuando el coeficiente de Gini pasó de 0,42 a 0,46, lo que indica que en 2017 hubo una mayor concentración de la riqueza que en 2014 (DANE, 2018). Este documento estudia los principales factores que han incidido en el aumento de la pobreza y propone una serie de inversiones para contrarrestar la desmejora en las condiciones de vida de los valduparences. Los resultados indican que el deterioro en el mercado laboral (empleo, salarios e informalidad) y la calidad de la educación son los factores que explican el incremento en pobreza. Las inversiones propuestas en temas de educación, vivienda y trabajo, que reducirían la pobreza y generarían un entorno propicio para el desarrollo económico de Valledupar, requieren de $230 millones de dólares para los próximos 10 años, lo que implicaría un esfuerzo fiscal adicional por generar $22,8 millones de dólares adicionales anuales hasta 2030. **** ABSTRACT: Poverty rate increased six percentage points in the past four years in Valledupar (DANE, 2018). The income distribution deteriorated as well during the same period of time. This document studies the main factors that explain the rise in poverty in Valledupar during 2014-2017 and proposes a series of investments that will help the city to overcome this drawback in their economic and social development. The results show that the worsening in labor market conditions (wages, employment and informality rate) due to negative shocks in coal prices and low quality of education are the factors driving the poor performance of Valledupar in terms of poverty reduction. We propose a set of investments in education, labor policy and housing that cost $230 millions of dollars for the next 10 years, in order to create structural conditions for development and lower poverty.
I32|La Guajira: caracterización departamental y municipal|En este documento se describen los activos con que cuenta el departamento de La Guajira en cuanto a sus recursos naturales y talento humano, así como su infraestructura y sus instituciones. De igual forma, se analizan sus indicadores económicos y sociales y se identifican sus brechas internas y con respecto del resto del país. Esta región estratégica para el país, que es parte del Gran Caribe y que tiene frontera con Venezuela, tiene un gran potencial de desarrollo, pero también grandes desafíos en cuanto a ofrecer a su población condiciones dignas de vida y oportunidades para la reducción de la desigualdad, el reconocimiento de su diversidad cultural, el fortalecimiento de sus instituciones y la diversificación de su economía. A las acciones ya emprendidas por el Gobierno Nacional, en el marco de las órdenes dadas por la Corte Constitucional para asegurar la protección de la infancia y la adolescencia wayuu, hay que sumar un plan de inversiones que garantice el desarrollo productivo del departamento, concertado en un contrato plan o en un nuevo Pacto territorial.
I32|Indicador de Bourguignon y Chakravarty de pobreza multidimensional en Colombia|La pobreza es uno de los problemas sociales más importantes alrededor del mundo, un análisis preciso de este fenómeno es esencial en el planteamiento de políticas públicas encaminadas al mejoramiento de las condiciones de vida y el bienestar de los individuos. El objetivo central de este documento es proponer una medición alternativa de la pobreza multidimensional en Colombia, para ello se estimará el indicador de Bourguignon y Chakravarty, identificando a los hogares pobres a partir de dimensiones, variables y parámetros de estimación no utilizados en la metodología convencional. Uno de los resultados principales es que, si bien la incidencia de la pobreza se redujo notablemente de 2010 a 2016, la brecha y la severidad de la pobreza multidimensional no disminuyeron en la misma magnitud. Por lo tanto, millones de hogares colombianos no han presentado cambios significativos en su nivel de vida y bienestar. *** Poverty is one of the most important social problems around the world. It means that this issue should be essential in public policy and different strategies must be proposed in order to improve people’s lives and their welfare. The aim of this paper is to propose an alternative methodology of measurement of multidimensional poverty in Colombia, considering the Bourguignon and Chakravarty indicator and non-conventional dimensions and variables to identify poor households. One of the primary results is that even though headcount ratio of multidimensional poverty reduced remarkably from 2010 to 2016, gap and severity of multidimensional poverty did not decline in the same magnitude. Therefore, there are millions of households with several deprivations whose quality of live has not changed recently.
I32|Missing Poor in the U.S|"Given that poor individuals face worse survival conditions than nonpoorindividuals, one can expect that a steeper income/mortality gradient leads, through stronger income-based selection, to a lower poverty rate at the old age (i.e. the ""missing poor"" hypothesis). This paper uses U.S.state-level data on poverty at age 65+ and life expectancy by income levels to provide an empirical test of the missing poor hypothesis. Using airpollution as an instrument for mortality di§erentials, we show that instrumented changes in mortality differentials have a negative and statistically significant effect on old-age poverty: a 1 % increase in the mortality differential implies a 9 % decrease in the 65+ headcount poverty rate. Using those regression results, we compute hypothetical old-age poverty rateswhile neutralizing the impact of the income/mortality gradient, and show that correcting for heterogeneity in income-based selection effects modifies the comparison of old-age poverty prevalence across states."
I32|Using RCTs to Estimate Long-Run Impacts in Development Economics|We assess evidence from randomized control trials (RCTs) on long-run economic productivity and living standards in poor countries. We first document that several studies estimate large positive long-run impacts, but that relatively few existing RCTs have been evaluated over the long-run. We next present evidence from a systematic survey of existing RCTs, with a focus on cash transfer and child health programs, and show that a meaningful subset can realistically be evaluated for long-run effects. We discuss ways to bridge the gap between the burgeoning number of development RCTs and the limited number that have been followed up to date, including through new panel (longitudinal) data, improved participant tracking methods, alternative research designs, and access to administrative, remote sensing, and cell phone data. We conclude that the rise of development economics RCTs since roughly 2000 provides a novel opportunity to generate high-quality evidence on the long-run drivers of living standards.
I32|Households at risk of severe material deprivation: the cases of Italy and Spain|This paper documents how the phenomenon of severe material deprivation spread out in Italy and Spain in the recent past. These two European countries have experienced an increasing risk of poverty since the economic crisis, when more than 20% of households fell under the poverty line. Moreover, a considerable share of these households are also materially deprived. Stylized facts suggest that, despite pertaining to the same area, even before the onset of the Great Recession, they look different in relative terms, since they show heterogeneous severe material deprivation rates, below and above the EU average. The percentage for Spain is below the average, while the share for Italy is above the average and almost double that for Spain. The analysis reveals which households characteristics are associated to the risk of being severely materially deprived and whether the risk differs across Spain and Italy.
I32|Parental Child Care Time, Income and Subjective Well-Being: A Multidimensional Polarization Approach for Germany|Neither market income nor consumption expenditure provides an adequate picture of individual standard of living. It is time which enables and restricts individual activities and is a further brick to a more comprehensive picture of individual well-being. In our study we focus on a prominent part of time use in non-market services: it is parental child care which contributes not only to individual but also to societal well-being. Within a novel approach we ask for multidimensional polarization effects of parental child care where compensation/substitution of time for parental child care versus income is interdependently evaluated by panel estimates of society’s subjective well-being. The new interdependent 2DGAP measure thereby provides multidimensional polarization intensity information for the poor and the rich and disentangles the single time and income contribution to subjective well-being ensuring at the same time the interdependence of the polarization dimensions. Socio-economic influences on the polarization pole risk and intensity will be quantified by two stage Heckman estimates. The analyses are based on the German Socio-Economic Panel with 21 waves and robust fixed effects estimates of subjective well-being as well as the German Time Use Surveys 1991/92 and actual 2012/13 with detailed diary time use data. The empirical results discover the interdependent relations between parental child care and income under a common evaluation frame and contribute to the question of dimension specific targeted policies in a multidimensional polarization approach. Prominent result: compensation between parental child care time and income proved to be significant, but there are multidimensional regions with no compensation, where parental child care time deficit is not compensated by income. Interdependent multidimensional polarization by headcount and intensity increased significantly over the twenty years under investigation with remarkable risk and intensity differences between the polarization poles with different disentangled parental child care time and income contributions to subjective well-being.
I32|Internal Migration, Social Stratiﬁcation and Dynamic Effects on Subjective Well Being|Using German panel data and relying on internal relocation, this paper investigates the anticipation and adaptation of subjective well-being (SWB) in the course of migration. We hypothesize that SWB correlates with the process of migration, and that such correlations are at least partly socially stratiﬁed. Our ﬁxed-effects regressions show no evidence of any anticipation of SWB before the event of migration, but a highly signiﬁcant and sustained positive adaptation effect. In general, internal migration seems to lead to a long-lasting increase in SWB. This is found to be the case for almost all analyzed socioeconomic and socio-demographic subgroups. The migration distance, the reasons for migration, and the individuals’ socio-demographic characteristics do not appear to have any important effects on the overall observed pattern. Our results suggest that regional mobility is less a response to certain stressors, but is, rather, a response to an opportunity to improve job- or housing-related living conditions, and that these improved conditions are reﬂected in individuals’ SWB. Thus, migration under these circumstances is triggered by opportunities rather than by constraints.
I32|Explorando los cambios de la pobreza en Argentina: 2003-2015|Este trabajo explora los cambios en la pobreza de ingresos en Argentina durante el período 2003-2015 utilizando diversas metodologías de descomposición. Los resultados sugieren que la mejora generalizada en el mercado laboral luego de la crisis fue el principal factor detrás de la fuerte caída de la pobreza en el período 2003-2007. En contraste, la reducción de la pobreza durante la etapa 2007-2011 está asociada al papel más activo que tomó la política social. Finalmente, durante el período 2011-2015 ningún factor contribuyó significativamente a la reducción de la pobreza. This paper explores the changes in income poverty in Argentina during the period 2003-2015 using various decomposition methodologies. The results suggest that the generalized improvement in the labor market after the crisis was the main factor behind the sharp fall in poverty in the period 2003-2007. In contrast, the reduction of poverty between 2007 and 2011 is associated with the most active role played by social policy. Finally, during the period 2011-2015, no factor could contribute significantly to the reduction of poverty
I32|Pobreza Crónica en Datos de Corte Transversal: Estimaciones para Argentina|El objetivo de esta nota es contribuir a la medición de la pobreza crónica en un contexto de ausencia de paneles largos. Se propone asociar pobreza crónica a la alta probabilidad de haber sido pobre en los distintos escenarios del pasado. Se argumenta que la pobreza crónica así definida aproxima mejor a los hogares de alta vulnerabilidad que la típica caracterización en función de la insuficiencia de ingresos, o de un número limitado de atributos no monetarios.
I32|Evaluating time-varying treatment effects in latent Markov models: An application to the effect of remittances on poverty dynamics|To assess the effectiveness of remittances on the poverty level of recipient households, we propose a causal inference approach that may be applied with longitudinal data and time-varying treatments. The method relies on the integration of a propensity score based technique, the inverse propensity weighting, with a general Latent Markov (LM) framework. It is particularly useful when the interest is in an individual characteristic that is not directly observable and the analysis is focused on: (i) clustering individuals in a finite number of classes according to this latent characteristic and (ii) modelling its evolution across time depending on the received treatment. Parameter estimation is based on a two-step procedure in which individual weights are computed for each time period based on predetermined covariates and a weighted version of the standard LM model likelihood based on such weights is maximised by means of an expectation-maximisation algorithm. Finite-sample properties of the estimator are studied by simulation. The application is focused on the effect of remittances on the poverty status of Ugandan households, based on a longitudinal survey spanning the period 2009-2014 and where response variables are indicators of deprivation.
I32|Income Inequality, Poverty, and the Rule of Law: Latin America vs the Rest of the World1|This paper investigates the relationship between the rule of law and income inequality and poverty in twenty Latin American countries using an unbalanced panel over the period 1995 - 2014. These results are then compared to estimates for non-Latin American counties. Using feasible GLS panel methods, we finnd that in many cases, improvements to legal systems reduce inequality and poverty in Latin America while having the opposite effect in the rest of the world. Results are robust to different definitions of inequality and rule of law. Protection of property rights is the most significant rule of law indicator for Latin America economies.
I32|Economic Growth and Poverty in Cameroon: the role of Employment|This study investigates empirically the effect of employment in the transmission of economic growth to poverty change in Cameroon. Using data covering the period 1991 to 2017. We estimate two models: the employment intensity of growth model of Kapsos; and the Loayza and Raddatz model, which assesses the impact of sectoral employment intensity of economic growth to the change in poverty. Analyses highlight two main results. First, economic growth positively affects employment and negatively affects poverty rates. Second, the transmission of economic growth through employment is not effective in reducing poverty in Cameroon. These results show that in recent decades, economic growth has propelled the creation of employment in Cameroon. However, these employments, which are mostly precarious, generated by the informal sector, have not significantly reduced poverty.
I32|Decomposition of intra-household disparity sensitive fuzzy multi-dimensional poverty index: A study of vulnerability through Machine Learning|The traditional multi-dimensional measures have failed to properly project the vulnerability of human-beings towards poverty. Some of the reasons behind this inability may be the failure of the existing measures to recognise the graduality inside the concept of poverty and the disparities within the household in wealth distribution. So this work wants to develop a measure to estimate the vulnerability of households in becoming poor in a multidimensional perspective through incorporating the intra-household disparities and graduality within the causal factors. Dimensional decomposition of the developed vulnerability measure is also under the purview of this work. To estimate the vulnerability and dimensional influences with the help of artificial intelligence an integrated mathematical framework is developed.
I32|National System of Researchers - Conacyt and the fight against poverty in Mexico: Winds of change and generational change|Since the creation of the National System of Researchers (SNI) in 1984, research and technological development recognizes the work of researchers adhering to the SNI, by granting an economic stimulus, gradual and correlated to the level of importance of their productivity and scientific creation, whose purpose is to promote the development of science and technology in Mexico. The Council of Science and Technology (Conacyt), defines the policy line of action in the field of scientific and technological research, in accordance with the priorities that the National Development Plan, establishes as a priority in the search for a better state of economic development and social. Currently, one of the main problems facing Mexico is the poverty they present in large sectors of the population, both in rural and urban areas. The condition of poverty means that the population that suffers it suffers from economic marginalization and social exclusion, whose objective expression corresponds, among others, to the lack of opportunities for access to employment, health, education and the presence of food deprivation, being these conditions unfavorable This invites us to ask ourselves: how to tackle the fight against poverty and social exclusion, from the perspective of social research, in support of the elaboration of a public policy that social development in Mexico? In this sense, a first note invites us to reflect on the following: how to support, from the field of research and academia, the elaboration of public policy that seeks to direct more precise actions in the fight against multidimensional poverty and social exclusion? The scientific and social responsibility of the members of the SNI, and in particular, those whose specialty is the study of poverty, is to contribute to promoting, in a knowledge society, the generation of quality scientific articles, but also the generation of proposals for lines of action that allow the State, the design of public policy that seeks a more objective and transparent action in the use of public resources destined to actions to combat multidimensional poverty and social exclusion . In this way, it is important to recognize what is the total number of SNI researchers who study poverty as a specialty line? and what is the level of category that holds in the SNI and which institutions carry out research on poverty ?, in this way to get closer to what is the scheme of the generational change of researchers of the SNI, in the study of poverty in Mexico?
I32|Boosting quality education with inclusive human development: empirical evidence from sub-Saharan Africa|This study examines the importance of inclusive human development in promoting education quality in a panel of forty-nine Sub-Saharan African countries for the period 2000-2012. The empirical evidence is based on Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Fixed Effects (FE) and Quantile Regression (QR) estimations. It is apparent from the OLS and FE findings that inclusive human development has a negative effect on the outcome variable. This negative effect implies that inclusive human development improves education quality. This result should be understood in the light of the fact that the adopted education variable is a negative economic signal given that it is computed as the ratio of pupils to teachers. Therefore, a higher ratio reflects diminishing education quality. From QR, with the exception of the highest quantile, the tendency of inclusive human development in reducing poor quality education is consistent throughout the conditional distribution of poor education quality. Policy implications are discussed.
I32|Nota metodológica para la estimación del índice de exclusión social en localidades indígenas de Veracruz México<BR>[Methodological note for the estimation of the index of social exclusion in indigenous localities of Veracruz Mexico]|Resumen El combate a la pobreza reconoce como lacerante, la condición de marginación económica y exclusión social de la población que se ubica en condición de pobreza; pero más aún, la que se observa en la población hablante de lengua indígena, a la que se le confiere, por este solo hecho, un nivel de gravedad mayor para superar la pobreza. Estudios recientes han demostrado que la población indígena ha sido objeto de exclusión social (Medel, 2016; Tetreault, 2012; Rionda, 2010; Del Popolo et al., 2009; Banco Mundial, 2004; Uquillas et al., 2003; Appasamy, 1996 ). Sin embargo, en el caso de México, no hay un indicador para medir el grado de exclusión social. Nuestra propuesta es incorporar la exclusión social como un elemento para explicar la condición actual de pobreza en los pueblos indígenas. En este trabajo se presenta la propuesta metodológica para la construcción del índice de exclusión social de la población indígena en el Estado de Veracruz. El índice de exclusión social (ES) se construye como una suma ponderada de 16 diferentes indicadores, en su construcción se utilizan el método de componentes principales y como ponderadores los coeficientes de la primera componente. La importancia de índice de exclusión social se utiliza como elemento en la valoración del índice de pobreza multidimensional (Alkire-Foster), como aportación en la construcción del índice de pobreza multidimensional versión 2.0, reconociendo a la exclusión social como una dimensión faltante. Abstract The fight against poverty recognizes as lacerating, the condition of economic marginalization and social exclusion of the population that is located in poverty condition; but even more so, what is observed in the native language speaker population, which is conferred, by this single fact, a level of greater severity to overcome poverty. Recent studies have shown that the indigenous population has been subject to social exclusion (Medel, 2016, Tetreault, 2012, Rionda, 2010, Del Popolo et al., 2009, World Bank, 2004, Uquillas et al., 2003, Appasamy, 1996, ). However, in the case of Mexico, there is no indicator to measure the degree of social exclusion. Our proposal is to incorporate social exclusion as an element to explain the current condition of poverty in indigenous peoples. This paper presents the methodological proposal for the construction of the index of social exclusion of the indigenous population in the State of Veracruz. The social exclusion index (ES) is constructed as a weighted sum of 16 different indicators, the main component method is used in its construction, and the coefficients of the first component are used as weights. The importance of the index of social exclusion is used as an element in the assessment of the multidimensional poverty index (Alkire-Foster), as a contribution to the construction of the multidimensional poverty index version 2.0, recognizing social exclusion as a missing dimension.
I32|Effect of Disasters and Climate Change on Poverty and Inequality in India|This study assesses the impact of disasters and climate change on poverty and inequality in India from 1900 to 2018. Country level analysis shows that natural disasters, mainly flood, is increasing over time. Almost 41% of the total deaths in the period 1900–2018 occurred between 1991and 2018 due to natural disasters. Climate change variables show a whopping 545% increase in the CO2 emissions, 7% increase in the mean temperature, and a mammoth 835% increase in annual rainfall from 1960 to 2014. Poverty figures show that there is a 23.4% decline in poverty from 1993–94 to 2011–12. Inequality in India has increased from 0.33 in 1973–74 to 0.36 to 2011–12. The calculated correlation values show that the rate of poverty is negatively associated with CO2 emissions, annual mean temperature, and annual rainfall. A state-level analysis shows that the correlation between rainfall and inequality is positive. Statewise panel data model analysis from the period of 2004–05 to 2011–12 shows that natural disasters and climate change, which are measured by the change in rainfall, has a positive effect on state-level poverty and inequality in India. Finally, we suggest that eco-friendly economic growth strategies and redistributive policies are essential for sustainable economic growth in India.
I32|The impact of governance on poverty reduction : Are there regional differences in Sub-saharan Africa ?|This article attempts to explore the relationship between governance and poverty reduction. Throughout this work, we have tried to clearly answer the following questions: What is the effect of governance indicators on poverty reduction in sub-Saharan Africa? In this framework, the basic assumption was the existence of a direct effect of governance on poverty reduction. The study of this hypothesis was formulated in a static model applied to the data available on the countries of sub-Saharan Africa between 1996-2016. The results of our regressions show that governance indicators have a positive and negative effect on poverty reduction in sub-Saharan African countries. This result implies that governance factors play an important role in poverty and the primary role of government effectiveness. The relationship between governance and poverty reduction varies by stage of development. But notes significant differences between African regions. This supports our contention that governance has more impact on poverty reduction in the poorer regions than in rich sub-Saharan Africa. For example, the relationship between government effectiveness and poverty reduction is positive and significant for Central and Eastern Africa, it is not significant in Southern Africa is negative and significant in west Africa.
I32|Have economic growth and the quality of governance contributed to poverty reduction and improved well-being in African countries?|This study examines the impact of economic growth and quality of governance on poverty and well-being in African countries for the period 1996-2016. The static panel estimation method is used to estimate the equations. Although economic growth does not seem to have an effect on poverty, the results confirm that this growth leads to improved well-being in West Africa. Although corruption and the quality of regulation have been found to increase poverty, improving government efficiency appears to reduce levels of poverty. Similarly, the results also show that corruption and government effectiveness are associated with a deterioration of welfare, but the rule of law and the way and responsibility seem to improve well-being. This study shows that governance indicators in African countries address the issues of poverty and improving well-being. Economic growth has been cited as one of the main drivers of poverty reduction, and the persistent problem of poverty in African countries has raised doubts about the effectiveness of economic growth. Recent evidence has shown that growth in Africa has been accompanied by an increase in poverty. Increasing poverty can slow the improvement of well-being and create social unrest. The quality of governance can also influence the extent to which economic growth reduces poverty. This study shows that improvements in these institutional (government efficiency) and legal (rule of law) measures tend to decrease levels of poverty and increase well-being.
I32|Nota metodológica para la estimación del índice de pobreza multidimensional en el Estado de Veracruz 2010<BR>[Methodological note for the estimation of multidimensional poverty index in the State of Veracruz 2010]|This paper presents the methodological note for the construction of the multidimensional poverty index (IPM) in the State of Veracruz, based on the index developed by the Oxford Poverty & Human Development Initiative (OPHI), based on the work of (Alkire –Foster, 2007) and in which, we include the index of social exclusion as a relevant dimension, this being a contribution in the construction of the multidimensional poverty index version 2.0, where social exclusion is recognized as a missing dimension. The estimation of the multidimensional poverty index is weighted 5 dimensions: Dimension 1 (Education), Dimension 2 (Access to health services), Dimension 3 (Quality and services of housing), Dimension 4 (Assets in the home) and Dimension 5 (Social). The analysis of the 5 dimensions consists of 16 indicators, whose construction of counting methodology, identifying the minimum amount of deprivation dimensions to estimate the multidimensional poverty index. The source of information comes from the information of the General Census of Population and Housing 2010, corresponding to the information contained in the territorial integration at the locality level, for the dimensions and selected indicators, so it allows the analysis of the evolution of multidimensional poverty throughout the study period in the State of Veracruz. Thematic Area: Measurement and analysis of multidimensional poverty
I32|The impact of civil society and governance on poverty: Are there differences between the North and East Africa region?|This article attempts to study the impact of civil society and governance on poverty. In this work, we have tried to answer the following questions: what is the effect of civil society and governance on poverty in the region of North and East Africa? In this framework, the basic assumption was the existence of a direct and indirect effect of civil society and the quality of governance in reducing poverty. The study of this hypothesis was formulated in a static model applied to data available on the region of North and East Africa between 1996-2016. The results of our regressions show that civil society, has a positive effect in reducing poverty in East Africa, but negative in North Africa and the political and legal indicators, has a positive effect on poverty in the East African countries and administrative indicators, has a positive effect in North Africa. This result implies that civil society and governance quality factors play an important role in reducing poverty in East Africa as North Africa. The relationship between civil society, governance and poverty varies according to the stage of development. But notes significant differences between the region of North Africa and East. This supports our contention that civil society and governance has more impact on poverty in the East African region, the poorest than in the rich region of North Africa. For example, the relationship between civil society and poverty is positive and significant for East Africa, is negative and significant in North Africa. The relationship between governance (policy and legal indicators) and poverty is positive and significant for East Africa, but in North Africa only administrative indicators have a positive effect on poverty. This supports our claim that governance has more impact on poverty than civil society.
I32|The impact of remittancess on poverty : What relations in Sub-saharan Africa and latin America ?|This article examines the impact of international remittances on poverty in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America between 1996-2016. The results of our regressions show that international remittances have a positive effect in reducing poverty in Latin America but not significant in sub-Saharan Africa. This relationship between international remittances and poverty is significantly different between sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. This result implies that remittances play an important role in increasing household consumption and hence in reducing poverty. This supports our assertion that international remittances have more impact on poverty reduction in rich regions than in poor regions. This study shows that improvements in these attractiveness factors international remittances tend to decrease levels of poverty. It is also supported by the fact that in Sub-Saharan African countries, governments tend to invest in international remittances like other sources of external finance.
I32|Social Innovation and Social Policy: Empowerment of indigenous women the management of sustainable productive organizations in Vietnam and Mexico|The present proposal, as an area of opportunity, addresses the empowerment of indigenous women, as a mechanism that seeks to achieve the development of management skills of sustainable productive organizations in the short, medium and / or long term, create individual commitment to develop their own potentialities and to generate an answer for their social change and human development. This in support of the strategy to combat poverty and social exclusion, through the development of productive projects, through the management of sustainable productive organizations that seek to improve the living conditions and social position of indigenous women. The importance of the research is that it seeks to deepen the social exclusion processes present in indigenous women, in order to propose alternative solutions in order to overcome their condition of multidimensional poverty and that seek to strengthen the actions for empowerment in the development of their management capacities themselves that are elements that promote the development of sustainable productive organizations.
I32|Kia māia: Be bold, Improving the wellbeing of children living in poverty|Kiwis believe in giving people a fair go. Improving the wellbeing of children living in poverty fits with these values. Wellbeing is not just a trendy name for income or standard of living. Kia māia: Be bold shows how it is a powerful idea that goes to the heart of what “a fair go”' in life requires. We discuss how some people struggle to convert income and other resources into a good life. For those people, increasing income is not enough to increase their wellbeing. To address the negative effects of child poverty and give all Kiwi kids a fair go, additional support, often focussed on the needs of individuals and their families, will be required.
I32|A critique of the conceptualization of child poverty|Poverty measures have evolved over the years from the income-based poverty threshold to those that take into account non-income aspects of a person?s wellbeing, the popular one being the multidimensional poverty measure. In all these measures children have been taken for granted in terms of the unique nature and the multifaceted deprivations that may be associated with children and not adults. The employment of equivalence scales makes assumptions that go to the extent of looking at children in different contexts and households as being homogenous. A proper measure that takes into account individual idiosyncrasies may not be easy but the current measures that are being applied are to a greater extent underestimating the level of child poverty globally and specifically in developing countries. This paper is motivated by the understanding that there could be more poor children than we care but we are not able to count based on the existing measures of poverty. This paper presents a critique of the child poverty measures that exist and points out the fact that there is need to develop a dedicated and succinct measure of child poverty beyond the equivalence scales that relate child poverty to the household income poverty line.
I32|Capital humain dans les pays en développement: une estimation des eﬀets de la qualité de l’éducation sur les inégalités de revenu|La persistance des inégalités de revenu constitue un obstacle majeur à l’élimination de la pauvreté dans le monde et plus particulièrement dans les pays en développement (PED). L’objectif de cet article est de montrer que l’amélioration de la qualité du capital humain permet de réduire le niveau de la pauvreté grâce à ses eﬀets positifs sur les inégalités de revenu. Pour parvenir à cette ﬁn, nous construisons un nouvel indicateur de capital humain ajusté qui prend simultanément en compte la qualité et la quantité de l’éducation. Les effets de la variation de cet indicateur sont ensuite estimés sur la variation de l’indice de GINI d’inégalités de revenu de 45 PED. Les résultats montrent que l’amélioration du niveau du capital humain d’une unité entraîne une réduction des inégalités de revenu de 6,1%. Une extension de cette étude a permis aussi d’analyser les eﬀets du capital humain sur la pauvreté. Il résulte de cette analyse que des investissements qui favorisent une amélioration de la qualité du capital humain permettent de réduire significativement le taux de l’extrême pauvreté.
I32|Measuring Opportunity in U.S. Higher Education|In identifying whether universities provide opportunities for low-income students, there is a measurement challenge: different institutions face students with different incomes and preparation. We show how a hypothetical university's “relevant pool”–the students from whom it could plausibly draw–affects popular measures: the Pell share, Bottom Quintile share, and Intergenerational Mobility. Using a proof by contradiction, we demonstrate that universities ranked highly on the popular measures can actually serve disproportionately few low-income students. We also show the reverse: universities slated for penalties on the popular measures can actually serve disproportionately many low-income students. Furthermore, the Intergenerational Mobility measure penalizes universities that face relatively equal income distributions, which are probably good for low-income students, and rewards universities that face very unequal income distributions. In short, by confounding differences in university effort with differences in circumstances, the popular measures could distort university decision making and produce unintended consequences. We demonstrate that, with well-thought-out data analysis, it is possible to create benchmarks that actually measure what they are intended to measure. In particular, we present a measure that overcomes the deficiencies of the popular measures and is informative about all, not just low-income, students.
I32|Ethnic Inequality and Poverty in Malaysia Since 1969|Ethnic riots broke out in Malaysia in 1969, prompting a national effort at affirmative action favoring the poorer (majority) of “Bumiputera” (mainly Malays). Since then, Malaysia’s official poverty measures indicate one of the fastest long-term rates of poverty reduction in the world, due to both economic growth and falling inequality. Did ethnic inequality fall since 1969 and was that a key factor in the country’s success in reducing poverty and in managing inequality? New measures in this paper indicate a substantial decline in relative ethnic inequality. This brought down national relative inequality, though not enough to prevent rising absolute inequality, given the initial disparities. A new analytic decomposition of the rate of poverty reduction reveals that ethnic redistribution helped reduce poverty, although it was not as important as the overall rate of growth in household incomes. Despite past progress in reducing ethnic inequality, the responsiveness of the national poverty rate to ethnic redistribution remains high even today.
I32|An Empirical Total Survey Error Decomposition Using Data Combination|Survey error is known to be pervasive and to bias even simple, but important estimates of means, rates, and totals, such as the poverty and the unemployment rate. To summarize and analyze the extent, sources, and consequences of survey error, we define empirical counterparts of key components of the Total Survey Error Framework that can be estimated using data combination. Specifically, we estimate total survey error and decompose it into three high level sources of error: generalized coverage error, item non-response error and measurement error. We further decompose these sources into lower level sources such as a failure to report a positive amount and errors in amounts conditional on reporting a positive value. For error in dollars paid by two large government transfer programs, we use administrative records on the universe of program payments in New York State linked to three major household surveys to estimate the error components we define. We find that total survey error is large and varies in its size and composition, but measurement error is always by far the largest source of error. Our application shows that data combination makes it possible to routinely measure total survey error and its components. The results allow survey producers to assess error reduction strategies and survey users to mitigate the consequences of survey errors or gauge the reliability of their conclusions.
I32|Combining Administrative and Survey Data to Improve Income Measurement|We describe methods of combining administrative and survey data to improve the measurement of income. We begin by decomposing the total survey error in the mean of survey reports of dollars received from a government transfer program. We decompose this error into three parts, generalized coverage error (which combines coverage and unit non-response error and any error from weighting), item non-response or imputation error, and measurement error. We then discuss these three sources of error in turn and how linked administrative and survey data can assess and reduce each of these sources. We then illustrate the potential of linked data by showing how using linked administrative variables improves the measurement of income and poverty in the Current Population Survey, focusing on the substitution of administrative for survey data for three government transfer programs. Finally, we discuss how one can examine the accuracy of the underlying links used in the combined data.
I32|The use and misuse of income data and extreme poverty in the United States|More than half of all misclassified households have incomes from the administrative data above the poverty line, and several of the largest misclassified groups appear to be at least middle class based on measures of material well-being. In contrast, the households kept from extreme poverty by in-kind transfers appear to be among the most materially deprived Americans.
I32|Accounting for the Impact of Medicaid on Child Poverty|US Census Bureau poverty measures do not include an explicit need for health care or insurance nor do they consider health insurance benefits to be resources. Consequently, they cannot measure the direct impact of health insurance benefits on poverty. This paper reviews conceptual and practical considerations in incorporating health benefits and needs into poverty measures. We analyze the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches including variants of the Official Poverty Measure (OPM); the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM); using a threshold with medical out-of-pocket (MOOP) expenditures; a Medical Care Expenditure Risk (MCER) Index; willingness to pay (WTP) for Medicaid; and the Health-Inclusive Poverty Measure (HIPM; Korenman and Remler 2016). We present estimates of Medicaid’s impacts on child poverty, based on the HIPM. This paper was prepared as a background paper for the Committee on Building an Agenda to Reduce the Number of Children in Poverty by Half in 10 Years, of the Board of Children, Youth and Families of the National Academy of Sciences. The paper was submitted in October 2017 and embargoed until the release of the Committee’s report, A Roadmap to Reducing Child Poverty, in March of 2019.
I32|Food Stamps and America’s Poorest|The paper provides the first assessment of: (i) America’s progress in lifting the lower bound—the floor—of the distribution of real income; (ii) whether the country’s largest antipoverty program, SNAP (“food stamps”), helped do so. An operational method of estimating the floor is implemented on micro survey data spanning 30 years, with various robustness and significance tests. SNAP partially compensated the poorest, and helped stabilize the floor. Nonetheless, the floor has been sinking over the last 30 years. The efficiency of SNAP in lifting the floor has declined over time. Full coverage of the poorest would lift the floor appreciable.
I32|Fooled by the Cycle: Permanent versus Cyclical Improvements in Social Indicators|This paper studies the time-series behavior of a set of widely-used social indicators and uncovers two important stylized facts. First, not all social indicators are created equal in terms of the importance of cyclical fluctuations. While some social indicators such as the unemployment rate and monetary poverty show large cyclical fluctuations, other social measures such as the Human Development Index are, by construction, dominated by long-run trends. Second, a large fraction of the cyclical fluctuations in social indicators can be explained by the cyclical changes in income (proxied by real GDP per capita). Since cyclical income volatility is much larger in the developing world, these two critical facts raise fundamental issues regarding how permanent are improvements in social indicators (like the ones observed in many developing countries during the last commodity super-cycle). Finally, and relying on a global sample of industrial and developing countries, we dig deeper into the importance of cyclical versus permanent components by extending the seminal contribution of Datt and Ravallion (1992). In particular, we show that more than 40 percent of the fall in monetary poverty observed in Latin America and the Caribbean during the so-called Golden Decade can be attributed to cyclical changes in income.
I32|On Measuring Global Poverty|The paper critically assesses prevailing measures of global poverty. A welfarist interpretation of global poverty lines is augmented by the idea of normative functionings, the cost of which varies across countries. In this light, current absolute measures are seen to ignore important social effects on welfare, while popular strongly-relative measures ignore absolute levels of living. It is argued that a new hybrid measure is called for, combining absolute and weakly-relative measures consistent with how national lines vary across countries. Illustrative calculations indicate that we are seeing a falling incidence of poverty globally over the last 30 years. This is mainly due to lower absolute poverty counts in the developing world. While fewer people are poor by the global absolute standard, more are poor by the country-specific relative standard. The vast bulk of poverty, both absolute and relative, is now found in the developing world.
I32|Enhancing the social integration of Roma in Slovak Republic|Roma account for almost one-tenth of the population in the Slovak Republic. They live mostly excluded from the general population in concentrated settlements, separated neighbourhoods or ghettos. The majority live in poverty and face social exclusion in almost all aspects of everyday life. Only a small share of Roma work, and a majority suffer from long spells of unemployment, their educational attainment is low, and a large number are illiterate. Social exclusion is further exacerbated by rising general animosity and mistrust between Roma and non-Roma groups. This calls for immediate policy action. The government should ensure easy access to all public services and provide additional support for the disadvantaged Roma communities. Individual policies should be effectively coordinated, because the problems that the Roma are facing are interconnected. A necessary precondition for successful Roma integration is the support of the general population. Policy interventions towards Roma integration should be accompanied by measures to eliminate the prejudices among parts of the majority population against their fellow citizens.
I32|The Minimum Income Scheme as a poverty reduction mechanism:the case of the Basque Country|This paper analyses the impact of a Minimum Income Scheme (MIS), which operates in the Basque Country, one of the 17 Spanish Autonomous Regions, by assessing its efficacy in fighting poverty. We evaluate the effect or the MIS with respect to two different poverty measures. The first one is that defined by the administrative criteria of eligibility. The second one corresponds to Sen’s poverty measure that permits a simple decomposition of poverty into three different components, incidence, intensity and inequality. The results show that the MIS has reduced substantially all dimensions of poverty, even though there is scope for improvement both in coverage and efficiency.
I32|Perspectives on poverty in Europe: following in Tony Atkinson’s footsteps|I address four topics: how our capacities to monitor poverty in Europe have improved substantially over recent decades; how progress on EU poverty reduction has been disappointing and why this has been; conceptual and measurement issues; and the future direction of EU-level anti-poverty actions. I follow in the footsteps of a giant – my perspectives are essentially elaborations of points made by Tony Atkinson.
I32|Progressive tax reforms in flat tax countries|Much of the literature on flat tax reforms has highlighted the benefits of introducing flat personal income tax systems in transition economies. The advocated benefits of flat tax systems range from their simplicity, higher compliance and lower distortionary effects on growth and employment. These arguments have often been cited to support policy recommendations favouring the adoption of flat tax systems in Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries in the 1990s and the 2000s. However since income inequality is notoriously high in these countries, the question of introducing some progressivity in the tax system has come to the fore in both policy and academic circles. In this paper, we analyse the fiscal, redistributive and macroeconomic impact of (re-) introducing progressivity in a number of CEE countries with flat tax systems. Combining microsimulation and macro models, we find that a significant reduction in income inequality can be achieved by moving from a flat to a progressive tax system with positive, albeit negligible, macroeconomic and employment impact. The magnitude of these effects depends on country-specificities and tax system characteristics, due in particular to the existence of tax allowances and tax credits.
I32|How Enhancing Gender Inclusion Affects Inequality: Thresholds of Complementary Policies for Sustainable Development|This study investigates how enhancing gender inclusion affects inequality in 42 African countries for the period 2004-2014. The empirical evidence is based on the Generalized Method of Moments. Three inequality indicators are used, namely, the: Gini coefficient, Atkinson index, and Palma ratio. The two gender inclusion measurements used include female labour force participation and female employment. The following main findings are established. There are positive net effects on inequality from the enhancement of gender inclusion dynamics. An extended threshold analysis is used to assess critical masses at which further increasing gender inclusion enhances inequality. The established thresholds are: (i) 55.555 “employment to population ratio, 15+, female (%)”for the nexus with the Gini coefficient. (ii) 50 “labor force participation rate, female (% of female population ages 15+)” and between 50 to 55 “employment to population ratio, 15+, female (%)”, for the Atkinson index. (iii) 61.87 “labor force participation rate, female (% of female population ages 15+)” for the Palma ratio.These established thresholds are worthwhile for sustainable development because, beyond the critical masses, policy makers should complement the gender inclusion policy with other measures designed to reduce income inequality. Some complementary measures that can be taken on board beyond the established thresholds could focus on enhancing, inter alia: information and communication technology, infrastructural development; financial inclusion and inclusive education.
I32|Industrial Growth in Sub-Saharan Africa: Evidence from Machine Learning with Insights from Nightlight Satellite Images|This study uses nightlight time data and machine learning techniques to predict industrial development in Africa. The results provide the first evidence on how machine learning techniques and nightlight data can be used to predict economic development in places where subnational data are missing or not precise. Taken together, the research confirms four groups of important determinants of industrial growth: natural resources, agriculture growth, institutions, and manufacturing imports. Our findings indicate that Africa should follow a more multisector approach for development, putting natural resources and agriculture productivity growth at the forefront.

I32|Working Paper 03-19 - Medium-term projection for Belgium of the at-risk-of-poverty and social exclusion indicators based on EU-SILC<BR>[Working Paper 03-19 - Prévisions à moyen terme des indicateurs de pauvreté et d’exclusion sociale basés sur les données EU-SILC]|The Federal Planning Bureau has developed within the Nowcasting project a dynamic microsimulation model for nowcasting and medium-term forecasts (currently up to 2020) of indicators of poverty and social exclusion. Key messages of this project are that nowcasting and medium-term forecasting are now possible using a fully dynamic microsimulation model. The provisional results of the model suggest that the overall poverty risk would remain stable, but that of the 65+ subpopulation would decrease over time, while that of the younger population would show a small increase. Furthermore, the increase of overall ine-quality would come to a halt and the level of inequality would become more stable. Finally, the very low work intensity rate would continue its decrease, driven by the continuing increase of the employment rate among the working-age population.
I32|Fossil fuel subsidies, income inequality and poverty. Evidence from developing countries|The past two decades have witnessed widespread attempts to reform fossil fuel subsidies in developing countries. If the reforms are likely to improve economic efficiency, the expected effects on income distribution and poverty are more controversial. This paper reviews the recent literature that examines the impacts of fossil fuel subsidies and their reform on income inequality and poverty. It identifies the different channels that have been explored in the literature and surveys the empirical evidence on the importance ofthese channels in practice. Drawing on diverse country experiences, it also discusses why fossil fuel subsidies are particularly challenging to reform and highlights several ways in which efforts to reform may be feasible and successful.
I32|Long-run Economic, Budgetary and Fiscal Effects of Roma Integration Policies|Although, the need for an efficient Roma integration policy is growing in Europe, surprisingly little robust scientific evidence regarding potential policy costs and expected benefits of alternative policy options has supported the policy design and implementation so far. The present study attempts to narrow this evidence gap and aims to shed light on long-run economic, budgetary and fiscal effects of selected education and employment policies for the inclusion of the marginalised Roma in the EU. We employ a general equilibrium approach that allows us to assess not only the direct impact of alternative Roma integration policies but also to capture all induced feedback effects. Our simulation results suggest that, although Roma integration policies would be costly for the public budget, in the medium- to long-run, economic, budgetary and fiscal benefits may significantly outweigh short- to medium-run Roma integration costs. Depending on the integration policy scenario and the analysed country, the full repayment of the integration policy investment (positive net present value) may be achieved after 7 to 9 years. In terms of the GDP, employment and earnings, the universal basic income scenario may have the highest potential, particularly in the medium- to long-run.
I32|Perspectives on Poverty in Europe|I address four topics: how our capacities to monitor poverty in Europe have improved substantially over recent decades; how progress on EU poverty reduction has been disappointing and why this has been; conceptual and measurement issues; and the future direction of EU-level anti-poverty actions. I follow in the footsteps of a giant – my perspectives are essentially elaborations of points made by Tony Atkinson.
I32|Households and heat stress: estimating the distributional consequences of climate change|Recent economic research documents a range of adverse welfare consequences from extreme heat stress, including health, labor productivity, and direct consumption disutility impacts. Without rapid adaptation, climate change will increase the burden of heat stress experienced by much of the world?s population in the coming decades. What will the distributional consequences of this added heat stress be, and how might this affect optimal climate policy? Using detailed survey data of household wealth in 690,745 households across 52 countries, this paper finds evidence suggesting that the welfare impacts of added heat stress caused by climate change may be regressive. Specifically, the analysis finds that poorer households tend to be located in hotter locations across and within countries, and poorer individuals are more likely to work in occupations with greater exposure to the elements not only across but also within countries. These findings?combined with the fact that current social cost of carbon estimates do not include climate damages arising from the productivity impacts of heat stress?suggest that optimal climate policy, especially when allowing for declining marginal utility of consumption, involves more stringent abatement than currently suggested, and that redistributive adaptation policies may be required to reduce the mechanical inequities in welfare impacts arising from climate change.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
I32|The multifaceted relationship between environmental risks and poverty: new insights from Vietnam|Despite complex interlinkages, insights into the multifaceted relationship between environmental risks and poverty can be gained through an analysis of different risks across space, time and scale within a single context using consistent methods. Combining geo-spatial data on eight environmental risks and household survey data from 2010–2014 for the case study of Vietnam, this paper shows: (i) at the district level, the incidence of poverty is higher in high risk areas, (ii) at the household level, poorer households face higher environmental risks, (iii) for some risks the relationship with household-level consumption varies between rural and urban areas, and (iv) environmental risks explain consumption differences between households, but less so changes over time. While altogether these analyses cannot establish a causal relationship between environmental risks and poverty, they do indicate that Vietnam's poor are disproportionally exposed. Given growing pressures due to climate change, addressing such risks should be a focus of poverty reduction efforts.
I32|Objective vs. Subjective Fuel Poverty and Self-Assessed Health|Policies towards fuel poverty often use relative or absolute measures. The effectiveness of the official indicators in identifying fuel poor households and assessing its impact on health is an emerging social policy issue. In this paper we analyse objective and perceived fuel poverty as determinants of self-assessed health in Spain. In 2014, 5.1 million of her population could not afford to heat their homes to an adequate temperature. We propose a latent class ordered probit model to analyse the influence of fuel poverty on self-reported health in a sample of 25,000 individuals in 11,000 households for the 2011-2014 period. This original approach allows us to include a ‘subjective’ measure of fuel poverty in the class membership probabilities and purge the influence of the ‘objective’ measure of fuel poverty on self-assessed health. The results show that poor housing conditions, fuel poverty, and material deprivation have a negative impact on health. Also, individuals who rate themselves as fuel poor tend to report poorer health status. The effect of objective fuel poverty on health is stronger when unobserved heterogeneity of individuals is controlled for. Since objective measures alone may not fully capture the adverse effect of fuel poverty on health, we advocate the use of approaches that allow a combination of objective and subjective measures and its application by policy-makers. Moreover, it is important that policies to tackle fuel poverty take into account the different energy vectors and the prospects of a future smart and integrated energy system.
I32|How valid are synthetic panel estimates of poverty dynamics?|Abstract A growing literature uses repeated cross-section surveys to derive ‘synthetic panel’ data estimates of poverty dynamics statistics. It builds on the pioneering study by Dang et al. (‘DLLM’, Journal of Development Economics, 2014) providing bounds estimates and the innovative refinement proposed by Dang and Lanjouw (‘DL’, World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 6504, 2013) providing point estimates of the statistics of interest. We provide new evidence about the accuracy of synthetic panel estimates relative to benchmarks based on estimates derived from genuine household panel data, employing high quality data from Australia and Britain, while also examining the sensitivity of results to a number of analytical choices. For these two high-income countries we show that DL-method point estimates are distinctly less accurate than estimates derived in earlier validity studies, all of which focus on low- and middle-income countries. We also demonstrate that estimate validity depends on choices such as the age of the household head (defining the sample), the poverty line level, and the years analyzed. DLLM parametric bounds estimates virtually always include the true panel estimates, though the bounds can be wide.

I32|The vertical and horizontal distributive effects of energy taxes|This paper proposes a micro-simulation assessment of the distributional impacts of the French carbon tax. It shows that the policy is regressive, but could be made progressive by redistributing the revenue through a flat-recycling. However, it would still generate large horizontal distributive effects and harm an important share of low-income households. The determinants of the tax incidence are characterized precisely, and alternative targeted transfers are simulated on this basis. The paper shows that given the importance of unobserved heterogeneity in the determinants of energy consumption, horizontal distributive effects are much more difficult to tackle than vertical ones.

I32|Exits from the Poverty Trap and Growth Accelerations in a Dual Economy Model|We propose a simple theoretical dual economy model to study the dynamics of an economy in which individuals move out of a poverty trap. These dynamics are characterized by growth acceleration. This model implies that poverty reduction could, under some circumstances, cause growth, rather than the other way around. We define a measurement of the growth impulse that could be triggered by independent exits from poverty and correlate it with observed growth accelerations. This correlation is both positive and significant, and it passes various robustness checks.

I32|Family characteristics and macroeconomic factors in U. S. intragenerational family income mobility, 1978–2014|Family economic mobility has been a policy concern for decades, with interest heating up further since the 1990s. Using data that tracks individual families’ incomes during overlapping 10-year periods from 1978 through 2014, this paper investigates the relationships of factors — family characteristics and macro influences — to intragenerational mobility and whether the importance of those factors has changed over time. Family characteristics include both levels of work behavior and family structure and within-period changes in those factors, as well as time-invariant characteristics of the family head, such as race. Macro factors include indicators of GDP growth and inflation during each 10-year period. The positions families occupy in the income distribution and the degree to which they are stuck or able to move up (or slide down) over time are critical determinants of their current well-being and their children’s prospects.
I32|Rural Affordable Rental Housing : Quantifying Need, Reviewing Recent Federal Support, and Assessing the Use of Low Income Housing Tax Credits in Rural Areas|Recently, there has been significant interest in the high levels of rental cost burden being experienced across the United States. Much of this scholarship has focused on rental cost burdens in larger urban areas, or at the national level, and has not explored differences in the prevalence of rental cost burden in urban versus rural communities. In this paper, I find that rental cost burdens are a challenge facing both urban and rural communities. However, despite the need for affordable rental housing in rural communities identified, I find the amount of resources made available by the federal government to address this challenge are at a low point relative to recent history. My analysis of federal resource availability also finds one program has been an important and resilient tool for the development and preservation of affordable housing in urban and rural communities: the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program. Congress delegated much of the LIHTC program’s implementation to the states, whereby states choose many of the factors to prioritize when allocating LIHTCs to specific projects. Therefore, I explored each state’s qualified allocation plan to identify whether specific factors make it more or less likely rural areas will receive a “fair share” of LIHTC allocations based on their need relative to non-rural areas. My analysis did not identify a specific factor or set of factors that systematically increased or decreased the likelihood of allocations being proportionate to the relative needs of a state’s rural communities. However, I did identify a number of factors that by their very design appeared to affect positively or negatively the likelihood that specific types of projects or project locations would receive allocations. Interviews with industry stakeholders confirmed that many of these factors are affecting developer decisions and may be unintentionally disadvantaging smaller, more remote rural projects.
I32|Reaching the Hard to Reach with Intermediaries: The Kansas City Fed’s LMI Survey|Reaching hard-to-reach individuals is a common problem in survey research. The low- and moderate-income (LMI) population, for example, is generally hard to reach. The Kansas City Fed’s Low- and Moderate-Income Survey addresses this problem by sampling a database of organizations to serve as proxies for the LMI population. In this paper, I describe why the LMI population can be hard to reach. I then explore potential problems with using a nonrandom survey sample and address the empirical validity of the Kansas City Fed’s LMI Survey. I compare results from the survey using the standard sample to results from the survey using a random sample. I find that the results of the surveys using the standard and random samples are not significantly different and conclude that the use of a nonrandom sample is not a significant problem for the LMI Survey. I find that the series of responses from the LMI Survey are correlated with the things they should be correlated with, suggesting that the survey is empirically valid and does a good job of measuring economic conditions in LMI communities.
I32|Eradicating poverty by 2030: Implications for Income Inequality, Population Policies, Food Prices (and Faster Growth?)|The paper examines whether the planned eradication of poverty to the year 2030 part of the SDG strategy is compatible with the expected trends in key economic variables such as GDP growth, population growth, income inequality and food prices. To do so, the paper develops a comparativestatic, poverty-accounting model that allows to simulate to 2030 the impact on SDG1 of the fastest improvements recorded for the above four variables during the last 30 years. Numerous model simulations show that – even under the most favorable assumptions – between 16 and 28 countries (mainly from Africa) out of the 78 analyzed will not reach the SDG1 target. Policy suggestions on how to improve on such results are presented at the end.
I32|Enfoque de las capacidades|El enfoque de las capacidades es un marco conceptual apropiado para identificar no la felicidad o satisfacción de las personas, sino más bien, lo que estas pueden o no ser o hacer. En consecuencia, el enfoque de las capacidades se centra en la libertad real de las personas y se aleja (sin excluir) de los medios que permiten la libertad (ingresos y recursos). Sobre la base de lo anterior, el presente documento se fija como objetivo proporcionar una aproximación al enfoque de las capacidades.
I32|Financial Stress and Indigenous Australians|We examine the high levels of financial stress among Indigenous populations in Australia. We estimate separate models for the determinants of financial stress for Indigenous and non‐Indigenous households and show the importance of separately considering Indigenous disadvantage. We use these models to build equivalence scales for both groups. We find evidence consistent with financial stress being exacerbated by demand sharing (‘humbugging’). The evidence also suggests that financial stress is reduced by engagement in traditional hunting and gathering activities.
I32|Data Gaps, Data Incomparability, And Data Imputation: A Review Of Poverty Measurement Methods For Data‐Scarce Environments|Questions that often come up in contexts where household consumption data are unavailable or missing include: what are the best existing methods to obtain poverty estimates at a single snapshot in time? and over time? and what are the best available methods to study poverty dynamics? A variety of different techniques have been developed to tackle these questions, but unfortunately, they are presented in different forms and lack unified terminology. We offer a review of poverty imputation methods that address contexts ranging from completely missing and partially missing consumption data in cross‐sectional household surveys, to missing panel household data. We present the various existing methods under a common framework, with pedagogical discussion on their intuition. Empirical illustrations are provided using several rounds of household survey data from Vietnam. Furthermore, we also offer a practical guide with detailed instructions on computer programs that can be used to implement the reviewed techniques.
I32|To impute or not to impute ? a review of alternative poverty estimation methods in the context of unavailable consumption data|There is an increasingly stronger demand for more frequent and accurate poverty estimates, despite the oftentimes unavailable household consumption data. This paper offers a review of alternative imputation methods that have been employed to provide poverty estimates in such contexts. These range from estimates on a nonmonetary basis, estimates for specific project targeting or tracking trends at the national level, to estimates at a more disaggregated level, as well as estimates of poverty dynamics. The paper provides a concise and accessible synthesis, which serves as an introduction to the literature. The focus is on intuition and practical insights that highlight the nuanced differences between the existing methods rather than technical aspects.
I32|Defining and Measuring Workforce Development in the United States in a Post-Bipartisan Era|The bipartisan acceptance of a federal role in workforce development policy is no longer in play as a result of ideological differences in the definition of workforce development which arise from a lack of coherent and misunderstood outcomes. My attempt here is to posit a new definition for workforce development that explains what these activities actually are and to raise three criteria for outcome metrics that can be used to evaluate the success of workforce investment under this new definition. By suggesting the process of workforce development and by proposing metric criteria which we can use to measure progress, I believe that a new bipartisan consensus can re-emerge, while recognizing the limitations of federal public expenditure. This consensus can, then, be used to generate a more appreciative role of active labor market policy at the national level using a process-evaluation model.
I32|Understanding poverty dynamics in Rwanda|Poverty rates in Rwanda have fallen substantially in the last decades. So far, however, it is not well understood what has driven this poverty decline. Thus, in this paper, we rely on a newly available household panel dataset collected in 2010/11 and 2013/14 to investigate poverty and poverty trajectories in Rwanda. According to our estimates increased labor market participation among originally poor households - especially off-farm employment - has facilitated poverty escape. Even though overall poverty rates have declined, our analysis reveals that a non-negligible part of originally non-poor households have fallen below the poverty line between the two survey waves. The estimates suggest that lower educated households are more vulnerable of becoming impoverished.
I32|Multi-dimensional poverty among adults in Central America and gender differences in the three I’s of poverty: Applying inequality sensitive poverty measures with ordinal variables|The Alkire and Foster (2011) methodology, as the mainstream approach to the measurement of multi-dimensional poverty in the developing world, is insensitive to inequality among the multi-dimensionally poor individuals and does not consider simultaneously the concepts of efficiency and distributive justice. Moreover, the vast majority of empirical indices of multi-dimensional poverty in the literature overlook intra-household inequalities, an issue that is crucial to a better understanding of gender inequalities, because they equate the poverty status of the household with the poverty status of all individuals in the household. Consequently, using the general framework proposed by Silber and Yalonetzky (2013) and Rippin’s ideas on multi-dimensional poverty measurement (2013, 2017), we propose in this paper to depart somehow from the mainstream approach and take an individual-based and inequality sensitive view of multi-dimensional poverty when only ordinal (dichotomized) variables are available. We use such an approach to estimate multi-dimensional poverty among individuals aged 18 and 59 years living in Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica, shedding thus some light on gender differences in poverty and inequality in those countries. Overall, we find that individuals living in Guatemala have the highest probability of being multi-dimensionally poor, followed by the ones from Nicaragua; people living in Costa Rica, by contrast, have by far the lowest probability of being poor. In the middle appears Honduras and El Salvador, Hondurans having a larger probability of being multi-dimensionally poor than the Salvadorians. Regarding the gender gaps, the overall estimates suggest that the incidence and the intensity of multi-dimensional poverty in Central America are higher among females; inequality, however, is somewhat higher among males.
I32|Fertility, household size and poverty in Nepal|Population control policies keep attracting attention: by increasing the household size, having more children would directly contribute to a household’s poverty. Using nationally representative household level data from Nepal, we investigate the links between a household’s fertility decisions and variations in their size and composition. We show that the relationship between number of births and household size is positive when the mothers are young, but becomes negative as the mothers grow older. Elderly couples who had fewer children host, on average, more relatives who are outside the immediate family unit. This result sheds light on the heterogeneous relation between the number of children and household size over the life cycle. It also implies that reductions in a household’s fertility may have an ambiguous impact on its per capita consumption, which depends on how the household’s composition responds to new births and changes over time: in this sample, an old household’s per capita consumption is not affected by the number of births. We use the gender of the first-born child to instrument the total number of consecutive children.
I32|The Wall’s Impact in the Occupied West Bank: A Bayesian Approach to Poverty Dynamics Using Repeated Cross-Sections|In 2002, the Israeli government decided to build a wall inside the occupied West Bank. The wall had a marked effect on the access to land and water resources as well as to the Israeli labour market. It is difficult to include the effect of the wall in an econometric model explaining poverty dynamics as the wall was built in the richer region of the West Bank. So a diff-in-diff strategy is needed. Using a Bayesian approach, we treat our two-period repeated cross-section data set as an incomplete data problem, explaining the income-to-needs ratio as a function of time invariant exogenous variables. This allows us to provide inference results on poverty dynamics. We then build a conditional regression model including a wall variable and state dependence to see how the wall modified the initial results on poverty dynamics. We find that the wall has increased the probability of poverty persistence by 58 percentage points and the probability of poverty entry by 18 percentage points.
I32|The effects of remittances on poverty and inequality: Evidence from rural southern Morocco|In this paper, we examine the effect of migrants’ remittances on poverty and inequality. The survey data were collected in Morocco, in the rural areas of the region Souss-Massa-Draa. By applying an original approach, we estimate the counterfactual income of remittance-recipient households corresponding to a hypothetical value of its average income calculated for a scenario without remittances; this is then compared with its current income. We find that the poverty rate and the vulnerability of non-poor households are significantly dropped due to remittances. Our findings also suggest that remittance inflows have increased income inequality compared to the no-migration counterfactual situation.
I32|The impact of migrant workers' remittances on the living standards of families in Morocco: A propensity score matching approach|This article attempts to assess empirically the impact of remittances on household expenditure and relative poverty in Morocco. We apply propensity score matching methods to the 2006/2007 Moroccan Living Standards Measurement Survey. We find that migrants’ remittances can improve living standards among Moroccan households and affect negatively the incidence of poverty. The results show a statistically significant and positive impact of hose remittances on recipient households’ expenditures. They are also significantly associated with a decline in the probability of being in poverty for rural households; it decreases by 11.3 percentage points. In comparison, this probability decreases by 3 points in urban area.
I32|When social goals meet economic goals: the double dividend of extending free access to healthcare in Uganda|In recent years, the need for a better access to health services has become a social objective in many sub-Saharan African countries that seek to achieve the Millennium Goals for Development. Yet such pursuits raise questions about the appropriate balance between the social goals and economic objectives of poverty reduction policies, such that measures promoting agricultural growth might appear as a more effective strategies. This article explores how an improvement of health subsidies policy in Uganda experiment might meet both these social and economic goals. Focusing on the relationship between farmers’ health and agricultural productivity, we use a computable general equilibrium model and a non-parametric micro-simulation model to predict the effect of this policy. The results show that it is likely to increase both households’ access to health care and growth processes. They also show that in a context marked by scarce budgetary resources, it is possible to maximise the impact of this policy by reallocating subsidies toward the categories of health care with the greatest impacts on workers’ productivity or toward rural households.
I32|Poverty, Competition, Democracy and Ownership: a General Equilibrium Model with Vertical Preferences |We consider a general equilibrium model where individuals are at the same time workers, consumers and shareholders, with two possible ownership structures: egalitarian where all individuals share equally the firm's (firms') capital and concentrated where the owners of the firm(s) are negligible w.r.t the total population; and two possible market structures: Monopoly and Duopoly. The questions are, whether more competition generates more or less poverty for a given ownership structure; and whether a democratic choice between Monopoly and Duopoly leads to the alternative with less poverty. We consider four poverty indicators based respectively on Per Capita Income (PCI), Income Floor, Poorest and Income-Poor Population Size. When the ownership is concentrated, we show that Duopoly generates less poverty than Monopoly and that democratic choice between the two alternatives alleviates poverty according to all indicators apart from PCI. When the ownership is egalitarian, Duopoly may generate more or less poverty than Monopoly and democratic choice alleviates poverty regarding at least one poverty indicator and worsens poverty regarding at least another one, the four poverty indicators never converging. An empirical study on the effect of competition on poverty supports to some extent our theoretical findings.

I32|Optimal Cash Transfers with Distribution Regressions: An Application to Egypt at the Dawn of the XXIst Century|Social programmes for poverty alleviation involve eligibility rules and transfer rules that often proxy-means tests. We propose to specify the estimator in connection with the poverty alleviation problem. Three distinct stages emerge from the optimization analysis: the identification of the poor, the ranking of their priorities and the calculus of the optimal transfer amount. These stages are implemented simultaneous by using diverse distribution regression methods to generate fitted-values of living standards plugged into the poverty minimization programme to obtain the transfer amounts. We apply these methods to Egypt in 2013. Recentered Influence Function (RIF) regressions focusing on the poor correspond to the most efficient transfer scheme. Most of the efficiency gain is obtained by making transfer amounts varying across beneficiaries rather than by varying estimation methods. Using RIF regressions instead of quantile regressions delivers only marginal poverty alleviation, although it allows for substantial reduction of the exclusion of the poor.
I32|Standard Budgets in Spanish Economic History: a User’s Guide to Sources and Methods|In this paper the author documents a near absence of household budget microdata in the sources for nineteenth century Spain, both published and archival. The sources do however contain a rich set of standard budgets, which can contribute to a better understanding of the history of Spanish living standards. The paper is divided in three parts: first, the author describes standard budgets and their usefulness for cliometricians; secondly, he traces their history in the Spanish sources; finally, he sketches a few applications to issues in the period 1850-1905. The latter analysis suggests: a) a substantial variation in cost of living and expenditure patterns across provinces, sectors, and socioeconomic status; b) a sensible impact of alternative CPI weights on national price indices; c) poverty lines ranging between 1,110 and 1,300 euros per year – in 2016 prices – for the years 1850 and 1856.
I32|Poverty and Inequality in Francophone Africa, 1960s-2010s|The paper provides first generation estimates of poverty and inequality rates for three countries in francophone Africa – Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire and Gabon – in the aftermath of independence. Sources – a large collection of historical household budgets – are new, as is the method that allows to connect historical sources to modern household budget surveys, and to deliver nationally representative estimates. The second part of the paper identifies the trend of poverty and inequality in Côte d’Ivoire for the years 1965-2015; we find that mean income growth failed to reduce poverty during the fifteen years of economic boom post-independence (1965-1979) because of increasing inequality. Conversely, in the following period (1979-2015) poverty changes are mostly guided by the evolution of growth.
I32|No country for young people. Poverty and age in Italy, 1948-2018|The paper explores the changing risk of poverty for older and younger generations of Italians throughout the republican period, 1948 to the present day. We show that poverty rates have decreased steadily for all age groups, but that youth has been left behind. The risk of poverty for children aged 0-17, relative to adults over 65, has increased steadily over time: in 1977, children faced a risk of poverty 30 percent lower than the elderly, but by 2016 they are 5 times likelier to be poor than someone in the age range of their grandparents. This intergenerational reversal of fortune is unprecedented in Italy’s post-WW2 history. We also assess the impact of the Great Recession on living standards by age, finding that the young have been hit hardest, particularly in Southern regions. What explains the extra poverty risk associated with young age? Our analysis points to the welfare state, which offers better protection for the elderly than it does for the young and their families. We find that the impact of cash transfers on the incidence of child poverty is considerably lower in Italy than in most comparable countries. Overall, in the last seven decades, Italy has become no country for young people.
I32|Equity Criteria Based on the Dominance Principle and Individual Preferences: Refinements of the Consensus Approach|This paper examines the problem of the indexing dilemma in the context of an ordinal interpersonal comparison of individual situations and proposes a new class of equity criteria based on the dominance principle and individual preferences. First, we show that an interpersonal comparison ordering that satisfies the dominance principle and the monotonicity condition must be a consensus ranking, which requires that individual i's situation with consumption bundle x should be better than j's situation with y whenever all individuals strictly prefer x to y. Second, we propose a new class of equity criteria based on the worst evaluation of each person's situation, which is a class of ordering extensions of interpersonal rankings that respect the consensus condition. In addition, we show its representation theorem and characterize maximin orderings based on our criteria. Third, possibility and impossibility results between the Pareto principle and dominance methods are obtained. Then, we propose a class of median rules as another equity criterion that satisfies the weak Pareto and dominance principles.
I32|Understanding the mechanisms through which adverse childhood experiences affect lifetime economic outcomes|Over the past two decades, researchers have shown a growing interest in the role of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) – children’s confrontation with maltreatment and household dysfunction – in shaping lifetime opportunities. However, this is the first study to quantify the economic penalties of ACEs and identify the mechanisms which produce the relationship. We source data from the National Child Development Study to construct an ACE index based on prospective childhood information and estimate an earnings penalty of 7.3 percent for each additional ACE, a 53.1 percent higher probability of being welfare dependent, and a 34 percent higher probability of poverty at age 55, controlling for important background factors measured in childhood. The results are driven by parental neglect, a component of the ACE index based on teacher assessments. Observed differences in later-life earnings between children with and without neglect exposure can be fully explained by observable differences in human capital accumulated by age 33. The productivity loss in an economy due to parental failures to nurture and protect their children is likely to be high. Our findings contribute to a wider discussion on the multidimensionality and expanding definitions of childhood poverty.
I32|How to reduce energy poverty in Poland?|4.6 million people in Poland live in energy poverty. In order to significantly reduce the scale of this problem, more effective and better addressed public policy instruments are needed. We propose three new instruments. First, targeted fuel allowance, aimed at alleviating the symptoms of energy poverty. Second, advisory services and energy saving improvements. Third, thermal retrofit coupled with professional energy counselling. The latter two instruments are meant to eliminate the causes of energy poverty. Thermal retrofit is the most expensive but the most effective tool. Developing a mechanism for practical identification of energy poor households is a major challenge. It is to be tackled by local governments, especially social assistance centres.

I32|Measuring Unfair Inequality: Reconciling Equality of Opportunity and Freedom from Poverty|Rising income inequalities are widely debated in public and academic discourse. In this paper, we contribute to this debate by proposing a new family of measures of unfair inequality. To do so, we acknowledge that inequality is not bad per se, but that its underlying sources need to be taken into account. Thereby, this paper is the first to reconcile two prominent fairness principles, namely equality of opportunity and freedom from poverty, into a joint measure of unfair inequality. Two empirical applications provide important new insights on the development of unfair inequality both over time (in the US) and across countries (in Europe). First, unfair inequality shows different time trends and country rankings compared to total inequality. Second, average unfair inequality doubles when complementing the ideal of an equal opportunity society with poverty aversion. Furthermore, we show that an exclusive focus on top incomes may misguide fairness judgments.
I32|Growth, Mobility and Social Welfare|We propose a social welfare function to evaluate a proﬁle of income streams and compare the welfare gain of the actual proﬁle relative to the income proﬁle where the individual receives his ﬁrst period income in each period. We derive necessary and suﬃcient conditions for the welfare gain to be positive, and show how this welfare gain can be decomposed in a pure eﬀect of economic growth, a mobility eﬀect and a cost due to aversion to time ﬂuctuations given individuals’ ranks in the income distribution. The mobility eﬀect, generated by reranking in the income distribution has two components: a cost due to the time ﬂuctuations in incomes and a beneﬁt, due to the equalization in time averaged incomes. We illustrate the analysis using CNEF data for Australia, Korea, Germany and Switzerland. Our results indicate that the largest component of the welfare gain is the equalization of time averaged income, induced by reranking. After subtracting the cost of mobility due to the increase in time ﬂuctuations of individual income streams, the net eﬀect of mobility remains positive. In countries with high growth (Australia and Korea), the growth eﬀect is larger than the mobility eﬀect, but in countries with low growth (Germany and Switzerland), the opposite holds true.
I32|Multidimensional poverty measures for analysing educational poverty in European countries|This paper studies the degree of educational poverty in European countries by focusing on data from two editions of the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA): 2006 and 2015. We focus on students’ proficiency levels in various literacy domains and propose a multidimensional approach that enables the measurement of not only the incidence of educational poverty but also its depth and severity. Subsequently, we perform a microeconometric analysis of school factors that are associated with the probability of educational poverty using a Partial Proportional Odds Model. The main results demonstrate that in recent years, the incidence of educational poverty became more relevant in many countries, while most of them experienced a reduction of poverty depth and severity. Several school factors can be manipulated to avoid the trap of educational poverty, such as improving the disciplinary climate, adopting an adaptive style of teaching, and increasing the amount of instructional time.
I32|Do Developing Countries Enjoy Faster Poverty Reduction as Their Initial Poverty Incidences Decline over Time? A Dynamic Panel Analysis|Empirical evidence in the sparse literature on poverty convergence currently relies on cross-sectional analysis, where Less Developed Countries (LDCs) starting out poorer are found to have enjoyed no faster subsequent poverty reduction during the past three decades than those starting out richer, as initial poverty retards growth and makes it less effective in reducing poverty. Applying a dynamic panel approach to four panel data sets including two covering some 90 LDCs from 1977-2014 and two covering, respectively, 42 Ethiopian and 33 Rwandan regions during 1995-2010 and 2000-2010; this study finds that LDCs as well as Ethiopian and Rwanda regions do enjoy faster subsequent poverty reduction within themselves as their initial poverty incidences decline over time. Our analysis also finds initial poverty as having little direct effect on growth in LDCs, except in SSA where higher initial poverty is associated with faster growth.

I32|Does Workfare Work Well? The Case of the Employment Generation Program for the Poorest in Bangladesh|Evidence on the effectiveness of workfare as an anti-poverty program in developing countries is weak compared with the relatively well-established role of public works during economic crisis as a social safety net. This paper contributes to evidence building by examining the impact of a large-scale workfare program in Bangladesh, the Employment Generation Program for the Poorest. Taking advantage of the program's distinguishable feature of direct wage transfer to a person's bank account, the paper uses accessibility to local banks as an instrumental variable to identify the program's impacts on rural social assistance beneficiaries. Based on locality-by-time fixed effects models over two rounds of locality panel data, the analysis finds that the Employment Generation Program for the Poorest has contributed to increasing overall household consumption and reducing outstanding loans. In particular, expenditures on quality food and health care have significantly increased, which likely helps individuals continue to engage in income-generating activities in the labor market. However, the implementation costs and poor quality of public assets built through work projects could potentially undermine the program's efficiency. Moreover, further evidence is required on the impacts of work experience through workfare on subsequent labor market outcomes and the value of public assets, to assess the program's effectiveness compared with administratively simpler alternative instruments such as unconditional cash transfers.

I32|Errors in Survey Reporting and Imputation and Their Effects on Estimates of Food Stamp Program Participation|Accurately measuring government benefit receipt in household surveys is necessary when studying disadvantaged populations and the programs that serve them. The Food Stamp Program is especially important given its size and recent growth. To validate survey reports, we use administrative data on participation in two states linked to the American Community Survey (ACS), the Current Population Survey (CPS), and the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). We find that 23 percent of true food stamp recipient households do not report receipt in the SIPP, 35 percent in the ACS, and fully 50 percent in the CPS. A substantial number of true non-recipients are also recorded as recipients, especially in the SIPP. We examine reasons for these errors including imputation, an important source of error. Both false negative and false positive reports vary with household characteristics, implying complicated biases in multivariate analyses, such as regressions. We then directly examine biases in common survey-based estimates of program receipt by comparing them to estimates from our combined administrative and survey data. We find that the survey estimates understate participation among single parents, non-whites, and low-income households, and also lead to errors in multiple program receipt, and time and age patterns of receipt.
I32|Financial Inclusion, Shocks and Poverty: Evidence from the Expansion of Mobile Money in Tanzania|We estimate the effect of mobile money adoption on consumption smoothing, poverty and human capital investments in Tanzania. We exploit the rapid expansion of the mobile money agent network between 2010 and 2012 and combine this with idiosyncratic shocks from variation in rainfall over time and across space in an instrumented DiD methodology. We find that adopter households are able to smooth consumption during periods of shocks and maintain their investments in human capital. Results on time use of children and labor force participation complement the findings on the important role of mobile money for the intergenerational transmission of poverty.
I32|Different Versions of the Easterlin Paradox: New Evidence for European Countries|Richer people are happier than poorer people, but when a country becomes richer over time, its people do not become happier. This seemingly contradictory pair of findings of Richard Easterlin has be-come famous as the Easterlin Paradox. However, it was met with counterevidence. To shed more light on this controversy, we distinguish between five different versions of the paradox. These versions apply to either groups of countries or individual countries, and to either the long or the medium term. We argue that the long term is most appropriate for testing the paradox, and that tests of the paradox should always control for an autonomous time trend. Unfortunately, this requirement renders the long-term version of the paradox for individual countries untestable. We test all other versions of the paradox with Eurobarometer data from 27 European countries. We do so by estimating country-panel equations for mean life satisfaction that include trend and cyclical components of per capita GDP as regressors. When testing variants of the paradox that apply to groups of countries, we find a clear and robust confirmation of the long- and medium-term versions of the paradox for a group of nine Western and Northern European countries. Moreover, we obtain a non-robust rejection of the medium-term variant of the paradox for a set of eleven Eastern European countries. On the level of individual countries, the medium-term variant of the paradox clearly holds for the nine Western and Northern European countries, but is consistently rejected for Greece, Ireland, Italy, and Spain. In the case of the Eastern European countries, the medium-term version of the paradox is rejected for Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Poland. As the Western and Northern European countries have a high per capita GDP as compared to that of Southern and Eastern European countries, our results are in line with the finding of Proto and Rustichini (2013), who find a non-monotonic relation between per capita GDP and life satisfaction over time which is positive for poorer countries, but flat (or negative) for richer countries.
I32|Perspectives on poverty in Europe|I address four topics: how our capacities to monitor poverty in Europe have improved substantially over recent decades; how progress on EU poverty reduction has been disappointing and why this has been; conceptual and measurement issues; and the future direction of EU-level anti-poverty actions. I follow in the footsteps of a giant – my perspectives are essentially elaborations of points made by Tony Atkinson
I32|"Learning from the ""Best"": The Impact of Tax-Benefit Systems in Africa"|Redistributive systems in Africa are still in their infancy but are constantly expanding in order to finance increasing public spending. This paper aims at characterizing the redistributive potential of six African countries: Ghana, Zambia, Mozambique, Tanzania, Ethiopia and South Africa. These countries show contrasted situations in terms of income distribution. We assess the role of tax-benefit systems to explain these differences. Using newly developed tax-benefit microsimulations for all six countries, we produce counterfactual simulations whereby the system of the most (least) redistributive country is applied to the population of all other countries. In this way, we can decompose the total country difference in income distribution between the contribution of tax-benefit policies versus the contribution of other factors (market income distributions, demographics, etc.). This analysis contributes to the recent literature on the redistributive role of socio-fiscal policies in developing countries and highlights the role of microsimulation techniques to characterize how different African countries can learn from each other to improve social protection and reduce inequality.
I32|Misreporting of Government Transfers: How Important Are Survey Design and Geography?|Recent studies linking household surveys to administrative records reveal high rates of misreporting of program receipt. We use the FoodAPS survey to examine whether the findings of these studies of general household surveys using one or two states generalize to a survey with a narrow focus and across many states. First, we study how reporting errors differ from other surveys. We find a lower rate of false negatives (failures to report true receipt) in FoodAPS, likely partly due to the shorter recall period of FoodAPS. Misreporting varies with household characteristics and between interviewers. Second, we examine geographic heterogeneity in survey error to assess whether we can extrapolate from linked data from a few states. We find systematic differences between states in unconditional error rates but no evidence of substantial differences conditional on common covariates. Thus, extrapolating error rates across states may yield more accurate receipt estimates than uncorrected survey estimates.
I32|Exploring the relationship between subjective well-being and objective poverty indices : evidence from panel data in South Africa|This study investigates the relationship between subjective well-being and objective poverty indices such as income poverty and multidimensional poverty. Although they are popular indices, very few studies have analyzed their relationship using rigorous econometric approach. By applying the Blow-up and Cluster estimation of fixed effects ordered logit model to a panel data collected in South Africa, this study finds that both income and multidimensional poverties significantly aggravate subjective well-being. However, their effects are not robust to the inclusion of household income, implying that being below the poverty lines does not provide additional information to explain subjective well-being. Moreover, a large part of the variation in subjective well-being cannot be explained by these objective poverty indices, suggesting strong complementarity between subjective and objective welfare measures. This study also finds that multidimensional poverty index, constructed based on principal component analysis, performs better than the conventional approach, casting doubt on the conventional multidimensional poverty index.
I32|Long-run Economic, Budgetary and Fiscal Effects of Roma Integration Policies|Although, the need for an efficient Roma integration policy is growing in Europe, surprisingly little robust scientific evidence regarding potential policy costs and expected benefits of alternative policy options has supported the policy design and implementation so far. The present study attempts to narrow this evidence gap and aims to shed light on long-run economic, budgetary and fiscal effects of selected education and employment policies for the inclusion of the marginalised Roma in the EU. We employ a general equilibrium approach that allows us to assess not only the direct impact of alternative Roma integration policies but also to capture all induced feedback effects. Our simulation results suggest that, although Roma integration policies would be costly for the public budget, in the medium- to long-run, economic, budgetary and fiscal benefits may significantly outweigh short- to medium-run Roma integration costs. Depending on the integration policy scenario and the analysed country, the full repayment of the integration policy investment (positive net present value) may be achieved after 7 to 9 years. In terms of the GDP, employment and earnings, the universal basic income scenario may have the highest potential, particularly in the medium- to long-run.
I32|An Axiomatic Foundation of the Multiplicative Human Development Index10:56 2018/08/0210:56 2018/08/02|The aggregation formula in the Human Development Index (HDI) was changed to geometric mean in 2010. In this paper, we search for a theoretical justification for employing this new HDI formula. First, we find a maximal class of index functions, what we call quasi-geometric means, that satisfy symmetry for the characteristics, normalization, and separability. Second, we show that power means are the only quasi-geometric means satisfying homogeneity. Finally, the new HDI is the only power mean satisfying minimal lower boundedness, which is a local complementability axiom proposed by Herrero, Martinez, and Villar (2010).
I32|Universal Child Allowances in 14 Middle Income Countries: Options for Policy and Poverty Reduction|This paper uses data from 14 Middle Income Countries in the Luxembourg Income Study database to examine the position of children in the income distributions, and to calculate child poverty prevalence, to assess how far children receive transfers from state social protection systems compared to other age-groups. The results show that children are disproportionately concentrated in the lower quintiles and have higher child poverty prevalence than for adults, but receive lower social protection transfers on a per-capita basis across all 14 countries. The analysis then moves to consider how the introduction of a simulated ‘universal child allowance’ based on a new allocation of 1 percent of GDP across all 14 countries could be designed to achieve both universal and targeted, anti-poverty, outcomes. Different versions of simple static and purely arithmetic micro-simulations are used to examine how a universal approach that allocates transfers to all children aged 0-17 can be adapted to optimise poverty reduction – both for child and general poverty. These simulations examine changes to poverty reduction moving from household to individual level allocation, weighting higher levels of transfers to younger children and of ‘taxing back’ universal transfers to those with incomes in the highest three quintiles. The findings show that individual allocation and ‘taxing back’ from higher income quintiles have the largest poverty reduction effect across all 14 countries, while weighting transfers to younger children has different poverty reduction effects between countries – depending on age composition and co-residence. The results are discussed in the light of debates on ‘targeting’ verses ‘universal’ approaches to social protection.
I32|Do demographics prevent consumption aggregates from reflecting micro-level preferences?|Most simulated micro-founded macro models use solely consumer-demand aggregates in order to estimate preference parameters of a representative consumer, for use in policy evaluation. Focusing on dynamic models with time-separable preferences, we show that aggregation holds if, and only if, momentary utility functions fall in the Identical-Shape Harmonic Absolute-Risk Aversion (ISHARA) utility class, identifying which parameters of ISHARA utility functions are allowed to vary over time. Given this theoretical result, it should be easy to empirically reject the aggregation properties that the macroeconomic representative-consumer identification approach requires: it suffices to show that permanent incomes guaranteeing the same living standard across households of different size violate an affine relationship. In order to test the validity of this affine equation, we develop a vignette survey that produces appropriate data without demand-estimation restrictions imposed by models. Surprisingly, in six countries, this equation is not rejected, lending support to using consumer-demand aggregates.
I32|Poverty among the elderly: The role of public pension systems|The objective of this paper is to measure the impact of first-pillar public pensions spending on the prevalence of poverty among the elderly. Using data from 27 European countries from 1995 to 2014, we estimate the elasticity of the poverty rate among individuals aged over 65 years to per capita public pension spending. We show the existence of a nonlinear relationship between these two variables. The elasticity is negative and statistically different from 0 only beyond a level of spending of 685€ per capita. At the average value of 2,819€, it is estimated that the elasticity is about -1.45. This nonlinear relation is robust to the treatment of possible endogeneity and to different robustness checks like the variation of the poverty line, and the inclusion of country-specific differences in public pension plans.
I32|Child Monetary Poverty and Multidimensional Deprivations: Why They Differ|We analyze the causal effect of parental education on the potential mismatch between child monetary poverty and multidimensional deprivations. First, in a simple model of parental investment in child outcomes, we demonstrate that the misalignment between household monetary resources and parental education causes a mismatch. Indeed, a match between poverty and deprivation occurs whenever household consumption expenditure and parental education are correlated. Second, using micro-level data from Tanzania, we find that parental education has a negative effect on the probability that a monetarily non-poor child suffers some basic deprivations, and a positive effect on the likelihood that a monetarily poor child suffers no basic deprivations.
I32|Using the GB2 Income Distribution: A Review|To use the GB2 distribution for the analysis of income and other positively-skewed distributions, knowledge of estimation methods and the ability to compute quantities of interest from the estimated parameters are required. We review estimation methodology that has appeared in the literature, and summarise expressions for inequality, poverty, and propoor growth that can be used to compute these measures from GB2 parameter estimates. An application to data from China and Indonesia is provided.
I32|The Impact of REI on Italian Households' Income: A Micro and Macro Evaluation|In 2017, Italy's government introduced a minimum income scheme, the Reddito di Inclusione (Income Inclusion Programme, REI). REI is a selective, means-tested and conditional scheme that aims at supporting incomes of those most in need. Its structure was recently modified to reach a larger percentage of the poor. In this paper, we simulate the impact of REI on household incomes and evaluate its effects with respect to poverty alleviation and inequality reduction. The analysis is based on the 2015 wave of IT-SILC, the Italian module of European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions. Our results show that, under full take-up, REI will reach 45.8% of households in absolute poverty and 22.5% of those in relative poverty. It has a mild impact on the incidence of both types of poverty, while it is more successful in reducing their intensity. We also estimate that REI would contribute to raising GDP by 0.14 percentage points through an increase in private consumption.

We also assess the impact of the Great Recession on living standards by age, finding that the young have been hit hardest, particularly in Southern regions. What explains the extra poverty risk associated with young age? Our analysis points to the welfare state, which offers better protection for the elderly than it does for the young and their families. We find that the impact of cash transfers on the incidence of child poverty is considerably lower in Italy than in most comparable countries. Overall, in the last seven decades, Italy has become no country for young people.
I32|Growth, Employment, Poverty and Inequality in Tanzania|This paper shows that in Tanzania, economic growth contributes to job creation and employment opportunities, however, it does very little to curb income inequality. Using official data from various local sources compiled by the National Bureau of Statistics, the paper provides an explanation as to why the creation of wealth and employment opportunities in Tanzania fails to bring the level of poverty to a level roughly comparable to what is found in the region and to reduce inequality between the richer and the poorer segments of society.
I32|Female Economic Participation with Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Advancement: Evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa|This study complements existing literature by investigating how the advancement in information and communication technology affects the formal economic participation of women. The focus is on 48 African countries for the period 1990-2014. The empirical evidence is based on Ordinary Least Squares, Fixed Effects and the Generalized Method of Moments regressions. The results show that improving communication technology increases female economic participation with the following consistent order of increasing magnitude: mobile phone penetration; internet penetration, and fixed broadband subscriptions. The findings are robust to the control for heterogeneities across countries. Policy implications are discussed.
I32|Poverty and development in Tanzania|The paper investigates the relationship between development, as measured by the GNI per capita and lived poverty in Tanzania which is measured on the basis of whether and how often respondents go, in the course of one year, without food, water, medical care, cooking fuel and cash income. By using the data collected by Afrobarometer in Tanzania, we are able to create one set of indicators that capture the extension of lived poverty, that is what percentage of the respondents, experiences deprivation, but we also develop a series of indicators that capture the severity of lived poverty, that is how frequently respondents experience this problem. Our statistical analyses reveal that while Tanzanian progress along the developmental path did not have a significant impact on the extension of lived poverty, it made a large and significant contribution to reduce its severity.
I32|Understanding Sub-Saharan Africaâ€™s Extreme Poverty Tragedy|Motivated by a recent World Bank report on achieving of Millennium Development Goals which shows that poverty has been declining in all regions of the world with the exception of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), this study puts some empirical structure to theoretical and qualitative studies on the reconciliation of the Beijing Model with the Washington Consensus. It tests the hypothesis that compared to middle income countries, low income countries would achieve more inclusive development by focusing on economic governance as opposed to political governance. The empirical evidence is based on interactive and non-interactive fixed effects regressions and 49 countries in SSA for the period 2000-2012. The findings confirm the investigated hypothesis. As the main policy implication, in order to address inclusive development challenges in the post-2015 development agenda in SSA, it would benefit low income countries in the sub-region to prioritise economic governance. Other theoretical and practical contributions are also discussed.
I32|Human development thresholds for inclusive mobile banking in developing countries|This study assesses human development thresholds at which mobile banking mitigates poverty and inequality in 93 developing countries for the year 2011. Mobile banking entails: ‘mobile used to pay bills’ and ‘mobile used to receive/send money’, while the modifying policy indicator is the human development index (HDI). The empirical evidence is based on interactive quantile regressions. A summary of the findings shows that with increasing human development: (i) ‘mobiles used to pay bills’ contribute to reducing inequality in countries at the bottom and top ends of the inequality distribution, while (ii) ‘mobiles used to receive/send money’ have an appealing role in promoting inclusive development in all poverty distributions, with the exception of the top-end or 90th decile. The modifying thresholds of the HDI vary from 0.542 to 0.632 and 0.333 to 0.705 in inequality and poverty specifications, respectively. The relevance of the findings is discussed in light of the current transition from Millennium Development Goals to Sustainable Development Goals.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
I32|Basic formal education quality, information technology, and inclusive human development in sub‐Saharan Africa|This study assesses the role played by basic formal education on the impact of information technology on inclusive human development in sub‐Saharan African countries during the period 2000–2012. The study aims to answer one critical question: What is the relevance of basic formal education in the effect of mobile phone penetration on inclusive human development in sub‐Saharan Africa when initial levels of inclusive human development are taken into account? The empirical evidence is based on instrumental quantile regressions. The findings of this study show that poor primary education dampens the positive effect of mobile phone penetration on inclusive human development. This finding should be understood from the perspective that the education quality indicator represents a policy syndrome because of the way it is computed, notably, the ratio of pupils to teachers. Hence, an increasing ratio indicates decreasing quality of education. It follows that decreasing quality of education dampens the positive effect of mobile phone on inclusive development. This tendency is consistent throughout the conditional distribution of inclusive sustainable human development. Policy implications are discussed.

I32|How enhancing information and communication technology has affected inequality in Africa for sustainable development: An empirical investigation|This study examines if enhancing information and communication technology reduces inequality in 48 countries in Africa for the periods 2004–2014. Three inequality indictors are used, namely, the Gini coefficient, Atkinson index, and Palma ratio. The adopted information and communication technology indicators include mobile phone penetration, internet penetration, and fixed broadband subscriptions. The empirical evidence is based on the generalised method of moments. Enhancing internet penetration and fixed broadband subscriptions has a net effect on reducing the Gini coefficient and the Atkinson index, whereas increasing mobile phone penetration and internet penetration reduces the Palma ratio. Policy implications are discussed in the light of challenges to Sustainable Development Goals.
I32|ICT, Financial Access and Gender Inclusion in the Formal Economic Sector: Evidence from Africa|The study investigates the relevance of information and communication technology (ICT) in modulating the effect of financial access on female economic participation. Female economic participation is proxied by female labor force participation, financial access is measured with deposit and credit channels while ICT is proxied by mobile phone penetration, internet penetration and fixed broadband subscriptions. The focus of the study is on 48 African countries for the period 2004-2014 and the empirical evidence is based on Generalized Method of Moments. Policy thresholds are established at which, ICT modulates financial access to induce favourable effects on female economic participation. These policy thresholds are: (i) 160 mobile phone penetration (per 100 people) for the deposit channel and (ii) 2.166 and 0.75 fixed broadband subscriptions per 100 people for respectively, the deposit mechanism and credit channel. Overall the study supports the importance of ICT in moderating financial access for enhanced female economic participation.
I32|Does corporate social responsibility (CSR) impact on development of women in small-scale fisheries of sub-Saharan Africa? Evidence from coastal communities of Niger Delta in Nigeria|While women are often key actors in fisheries, they are commonly excluded from making fisheries management decisions, often due to cultural norms. The objective of this investigation is to assess the impact of a new CSR model of multinational oil companies (MOCs) on development of women in small-scale fisheries in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. A total of eight hundred artisanal fisherwomen were sampled across the coastal communities of Niger Delta. Results from the use of logit model indicate that artisanal fisherwomen have remained widely excluded from the General Memorandum of Understandings (GMoUs) interventions in small-scale fisheries due to cultural norms of the people. This implies that if the cultural norms of the Niger Delta communities continue to restrain direct participation of the artisanal fisherwomen from GMoUsâ€™ intervention, achieving gender equity and cultural change would be limited in the region. The findings suggest that since fisheries, which is the traditional source of livelihood of the people are no longer viable and have significantly declined due to environmental oil degradation, GMoUsâ€™ intervention structure could focus on women playing key roles in fisheries management and conservation decision in Niger Delta region of Nigeria.
I32|Corporate Social Responsibility Initiatives in Nigeria and Rural Women Livestock Keepers in Oil Host Communities|Purpose â€“ The purpose of this paper is to critically examine the multinational oil companiesâ€™ (MOCs) corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives in Nigeria. Its special focus is to investigate the impact of the global memorandum of understanding (GMoU) on rural women livestock keepers in the oil producing communities. Design/methodology/approach â€“ This paper employs a quantitative methodology. Data were collected from primary sources using participatory rural appraisal (PRA) technique. The use of participatory research technique in collecting CSR impact data especially as it concerns the small-scale women livestock keeper is based on the fact that it involves the people being studied, and their views on all the issues are paramount. The primary tool used for household survey (collection of the primary data) is a structured questionnaire which is divided into two sections. Section one of the instrument elicited information on the socio-economic characteristics of respondent, while the other section elicited information on the research questions. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the data so as to answer the research questions and test the hypothesis. To answer the research questions, descriptive statistics of measurement of central tendency was used, and the results were presented in tables and charts. While in testing the hypothesis, inferential statistical tool-estimation of logit model (of receipt and non-receipt of MOCs CSR through the GMoU by rural women livestock keepers as function of selected socio-economic and domestic empowerment variables) was used. Findings â€“ The findings shows that GMoU model is gender insensitive as rural women rarely have direct access to livestock interventions except through their husband or adult sons; which is attributed to the cultural and traditional context of the people, anchored in beliefs, norms and practices that breed discrimination and gender gap in the rural societies. Research limitations/implications - The structured questionnaire was directly administered by the researchers with the help of local research assistants. The use of local research assistants was because of the inability of the researchers to speak the different local languages and dialects of the many ethnic groups of Ijaws, Ogonis, Ikweres, Etches, Ekpeyes, Ogbas, Engennes, Obolos, Isokos, Nembes, Okirikas, Kalabaris, Urhobos, Iteskiris, Igbos, Ika-Igbos, Ndonis, Orons, Ibenos, Yorubas, Ibibios, Anangs, Efiks, Bekwarras, Binis, Eshans, Etsakos, Owans, Itigidis, Epies, Akokoedos, Yakkurs, etc, in the sampled rural communities. Practical implication â€“ If the rural women do not feel GMoUs efforts to eliminate discrimination and promote equality in the livestock sector, feminized poverty would create a hostile environment for MOCs in the region. Social implication â€“ The livestock development in Nigeria can only succeed if CSR is able to draw on all the resources and talents, and if rural women are able to participate fully in the GMoUs intervention plans and programmes. Originality/value â€“ This research contributes to gender debate in livestock keeping from CSR perspectives in developing countries and rational for demands for social projects by host communities. It concludes that business has an obligation to help in solving problems of public concern, and that CSR priorities in Africa should be aimed towards addressing the peculiarity of the socio-economic development challenges of the country and be informed by socio-cultural influences.

I32|Persistence in Food Insecurity and Poverty in Ethiopia| Using three rounds of data from the Ethiopia Socioeconomic Survey (ESS), we estimate a series of dynamic random effect probit models accounting for unobserved heterogeneity and the initial conditions problem using four measures of food insecurity and poverty. The descriptive analysis suggest higher levels of downward mobility and lower rates of exit for the food insecurity measures relative to food poverty and general poverty. There also appear to be lower levels of persistence in the subjective measure of food insecurity although for all measures close to the majority of the sample experience at least one period of food insecurity, food or general poverty. The estimation results provide some evidence of persistence or state dependence exists for subjective food insecurity, food and relative poverty measures. There is also evidence of cross effects so that being subjectively food insecure in the past increases the probability of being food poor and relatively poor in the current period.
I32|Climate Resilience Pathways of Rural Households. Evidence from Ethiopia|This paper explores the resilience capacity of rural Ethiopian households after the drought shock occurred in 2011. The work develops an original empirical framework able to capture the policy and socio-economic determinants of households’ resilience capacity by making parametric statistical assumption on the resilience distribution. To this end, the analysis employs a two-wave representative panel dataset aligned with detailed weather records while controlling for a large set of household- and community-level characteristics. The analysis shows that the majority of these factors affects significantly resilience capacity only in the group of households affected by the drought shock, suggesting that the observed effect relates to the adaptive capacity enabled by these factors, rather than a simple welfare effect. Three policy indications emerge from the findings of the empirical model. First, government support programmes, such as the PSNP, appear to sustain households’ resilience by helping them to reach the level of pre-shock total consumption, but have no impact on the food-consumption resilience. Secondly, the “selling out assets strategy” affects positively on households’ resilience, but only in terms of food consumption. Finally, the presence of informal institutions, such as social networks providing financial support, sharply increases households’ resilience by helping them to reach pre-shock levels of food and total consumption. Policies incentivizing the formation of these networks, through the participation of households to agricultural cooperative, agricultural associations, or community projects, may also help farmers in recovering their wealth level after a weather shock.
I32|Optimal Cash Transfers with Distribution Regressions: An Application to Egypt at the Dawn of the XXIst Century|Social programmes for poverty alleviation involve eligibility rules and transfer rules that often proxy-means tests. We propose to specify the estimator in connection with the poverty alleviation problem. Three distinct stages emerge from the optimization analysis: the identification of the poor, the ranking of their priorities and the calculus of the optimal transfer amount. These stages are implemented simultaneous by using diverse distribution regression methods to generate fitted-values of living standards plugged into the poverty minimization programme to obtain the transfer amounts. We apply these methods to Egypt in 2013. Recentered Influence Function (RIF) regressions focusing on the poor correspond to the most efficient transfer scheme. Most of the efficiency gain is obtained by making transfer amounts varying across beneficiaries rather than by varying estimation methods. Using RIF regressions instead of quantile regressions delivers only marginal poverty alleviation, although it allows for substantial reduction of the exclusion of the poor.
I32|Poverty and Inequality Dynamics in Manaus: Legacy of a Free Trade Zone?|This study contributes to the literature on the social impacts of Special Economic Zones by analyzing the dynamics of poverty and inequality in the Brazilian state of Amazonas, where the Free Trade Zone of Manaus (FTZM) is located. Using census data, micro-decompositions and counterfactual simulations, we show that if labor income was a major driver of poverty and inequality declines for the municipality of Manaus in the 2000-2010 decade, non-labor income was far more important in the rest of the state of Amazonas. Our contrasting results illustrate both the benefits and limitations of the influence of the FTZM. A better targeting of both social policies and training programs could improve distributional outcomes in the whole area.
I32|Wealth inequality in Italy: reconstruction of 1968-75 data and comparison with recent estimates|This paper provides a reconstruction of the joint distribution of Italian households’ income and wealth in the years ranging from 1968 to 1975. Exploiting the information available in some historical reports recently published by the Bank of Italy, the paper reconstructs synthetic microdata compatible with the aggregate results of sample surveys carried out in those years. In this way, inequality and poverty can be estimated by using the same statistical criteria that are used today, making an intertemporal comparison of the estimates possible. The concentration of household wealth shows a downward trend in the 1970s and ’80s, an increase in the years following the 1992-93 crisis and relative stability in the new century. In the period 1968-75 the concentration of wealth turns out to be greater than in recent years. The estimates of relative poverty show a decreasing trend until the 1990s and a subsequent increase; the upward trend of these indicators in recent years is steeper than that of the concentration indices. Migration flows have contributed significantly to the recent growth in the poverty indices.
I32|La pobreza en Santa Marta: Los Estragos del Bien|En 1985, el indicador de pobreza por Necesidades Básicas Insatisfechas (NBI) posicionó a Santa Marta como la ciudad con menor pobreza entre las ocho capitales de la región Caribe. Tres décadas más tarde, en 2017, Santa Marta fue la tercera ciudad con mayor pobreza monetaria en la región, solo superada por Riohacha y Valledupar. Este documento tiene tres objetivos principales: (i) realizar una caracterización espacial de la pobreza en Santa Marta, (ii) investigar las razones del rezago relativo en reducción de pobreza y (iii) proponer una serie de inversiones para superar dicho rezago. El análisis encuentra que el retroceso se debe en buena parte a la llegada masiva de desplazados que inició en la década de 1990. Por su parte, los mapas muestran la aparición de cinturones de miseria en las faldas de los cerros aledaños y en algunas zonas del perímetro urbano, en donde la pobreza coincide con la informalidad y el bajo logro educativo de la población. Estos y otros resultados, revelan prioridades de inversión en cuatro sectores: educación, vivienda, acueducto y alcantarillado, y empleo. *******ABSTRACT: In 1985, Santa Marta was the city with the lowest level of structural poverty in the Caribbean region. Three decades later, in 2017, Santa Marta had the third highest monetary poverty rate in the region, only lower than Riohacha and Valledupar. The purpose of this paper is threefold. First, to characterize poverty and its spatial dimension in Santa Marta. Second, to understand the causes of the lag in poverty reduction. And third, to propose a set of investments to overcome this lag. The analysis shows that one of the main factors associated with poverty in the city was the massive arrival of displaced people starting in 1990. The maps, meanwhile, show the appearance of misery belts in the surrounding foothills and in some areas inside the urban perimeter, where poverty is correlated with informality and low educational attainment of the population. All in all, results reveal investment priorities in four sectors: education, housing, water and sewage, and employment.
I32|La pobreza en Riohacha: diagnóstico, análisis y propuestas|El objetivo número uno de desarrollo sostenible de las Naciones Unidas dicta que para el año 2030 se debe erradicar la pobreza en todas sus formas y dimensiones en todo el mundo. Colombia ha realizado avances en esta línea y las cifras muestran que entre 2010 y 2017 la pobreza monetaria se redujo al pasar del 37,2% al 26,9%. Sin embargo, aún existen rezagos en esta materia y prueba de ello es Riohacha, ciudad que mantuvo constante su incidencia en 46,9% para este periodo de tiempo. El presente artículo realiza un diagnóstico detallado de la pobreza en la capital de La Guajira y presenta las inversiones necesarias para avanzar en su superación. Los principales indicadores revelan que el empleo informal, el bajo logro educativo y la falta de acceso a servicios básicos son las privaciones con mayor recurrencia en los hogares. Además, estas se concentran en la periferia y la zona rural dispersa, en donde coinciden con un alto porcentaje de población indígena. A partir de los resultados, se propone una intervención integral en cuatro sectores: educación, empleo, vivienda y servicios públicos, cuyo costo total se estima en 372,7 millones de dólares para el periodo comprendido entre 2019 y 2030. **** ABSTRACT: The number one sustainable development goal of the United Nations establishes that, by 2030, poverty should end in all its forms everywhere in the world. Colombia has made progress in this area: between 2010 and 2017, monetary poverty in the country fell from 37.2% to 26.9%. However, there are still challenges to overcome, and proof of this is Riohacha, a city that maintained poverty rate constant at 46.9% during this period. The main objective of this document is to present a detailed study of poverty in Riohacha and the necessary investments to advance in its solution. The main indicators reveal that informal employment, low educational attainment, and lack of access to basic services, are the most recurrent deprivations in households. In addition, these are concentrated in the periphery and the dispersed rural area, where there is also a large percentage of indigenous population. Based on the results, an intervention is proposed in four sectors: education, employment, housing, and public services. The total cost of the proposal is estimated at 372.7 million dollars for the period between 2019 and 2030.
I32|Women’s Empowerment and Family Health: Estimating LATE with Mismeasured Treatment|We study the causal effect of women’s empowerment on family health in India. We define treatment as a woman having primary control over household resources and use changes in inheritance laws as an instrument. Due to measurement difficulties and sharing of goods, treatment cannot be directly observed and must be estimated using a structural model. Treatment mismeasurement may therefore arise from model misspecification and estimation errors. We provide a new estimation method, MR-LATE, that can consistently estimate local average treatment effects when treatment is mismeasured. We find that women’s control of substantial household resources improves their and their children’s health.
