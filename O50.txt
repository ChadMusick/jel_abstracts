O50|Patterns and Determinants of Intergenerational Educational Mobility: Evidence Across Countries| This study measures the intergenerational persistence of education attainment, using internationally comparable data for parents’ and children’s education levels by age cohort for 30 countries, and identifies its determinants. The estimated intergenerational regression coefficients show that educational mobility worsened over generations in most countries, but its degrees varies considerably across countries and over time. The country-cohort panel regressions show that intergenerational educational mobility decreases with educational expansion, income inequality and credit constraints, and increases with per-capita GDP. The results also highlight the importance of progressive public expenditure on education for improving intergenerational educational mobility.
O50|Why are relatively poor people not more supportive of redistribution? Evidence from a survey experiment across 10 countries|"We test a key assumption of conventional theories about preferences for redistribution, which is that relatively poor people should be the most in favor of redistribution. We conduct a randomized survey experiment with over 30,000 participants across 10 countries, half of whom are informed of their position in the national income distribution. Contrary to prevailing wisdom, people who are told they are relatively poorer than they thought are less concerned about inequality and are not more supportive of redistribution. This finding is driven by people using their own living standard as a ""benchmark"" for what they consider acceptable for others."
O50|A false divide? Correcting beliefs about inequality aligns preferences for redistribution between right and left-wing voters|Are differences in preferences for redistribution between right- and left-wing voters amplified because of misperceptions of inequality? To address this question, we conduct a nationally representative, randomized survey experiment of 3,402 Australians, in which respondents are informed about either the level of national inequality and economic mobility, their position in the national income distribution, their household income per capita, or given no information. We show that correcting misperceptions of inequality reduces the gap between right- and left-wing voters‘ level of support for redistribution by at least 24 percent. This is predominantly due to right-wing voters becoming more supportive of redistribution.
O50|Innovation and Economic Growth: Does Internet Matter?|We analyze the relationship between economic growth and innovation taking into consideration the importance of the internet. To do so, we use a panel ARDL model, with data on a sample of 76 developed and developing countries in different geographic regions for the 1995–2016 period. Our findings provide empirical evidence of the positive role of innovation and internet in economic growth and the positive role of economic growth and internet in innovation. From these results, we derive several basic policy conclusions.
O50|Giant Oil Discoveries and Conflicts|This study investigates the impact of oil discoveries on conflict. We argue that rents from resources are only part of the resource curse story, with discoveries of natural resources being just as prominent. Using a new measure for oil discoveries for a global panel of countries between 1960 and 2012, we find a positive correlation between oil discoveries and conflict, controlling for regional effects and other conflict determinants. Further analysis by type of conflict reveals that the discovery of oil deposits increases intrastate conflict in relation to interstate conflict, more so ethnic violence within countries. These effects are evident within a year of discovering the oil, and are persistent for over ten years after the discovery. The results also indicate that North Africa and Middle East countries are the most affected by oil discoveries in relation to other global regions. We find similar positive effects on conflict with quantity of oil discovered, as well as the expectation of oil discoveries. Interestingly, while institutions have a significant non-linear effect on conflict, they appear to have no significant mitigating effect when interacted with oil discoveries. The implication of this result may allude to countries with natural resources needing more transparent institutions to alleviate the resource curse. Overall, we believe the results from this study will provide some further understanding to the complex nature involving natural resources and incidences of conflict.
O50|Trends in FDI and its role in Development and Convergence|The empirical study is based on 138 countries (and territories) for which there are available comparable data regarding FDI at UNCTAD, FDI/MNE database (www.unctad.org/fdistatistics) for 2000-2017. In order to analyse the relations between FDI and GDP per capita and the socalled Real Convergence, usually evaluated only based on expressing GDP per capita in international dollars PPP (Purchasing Power Parity), data for the global economy (represented by the group of 138 countries and territories, as W138), are for the period 2000-2018 from World Bank, and for the period up to 2024 from IMFforecast (IMF Report,April 2019).
O50|Do Social Enterprises Walk the Talk? Assessing Microfinance Performances with Mission Statements|We study mission drift in social enterprises by examining whether these organizations stick to the actual mission enshrined in their mission statements. We use data from microfinance organizations (MFOs), a homogeneous group of social enterprises which have been scrutinized—and sometimes criticized—for mission drift. We focus on three publicly recognized and non-mutually-exclusive microfinance social missions identified by previous studies: poverty alleviation, women's empowerment, and rural financial inclusion. Based on hand-collected data from 199 MFOs worldwide, our results suggest strong coherence between social missions and actual practices. Hence, we argue that, with respect to MFOs’ own stated social missions, mission drift is no serious concern. The trustworthiness of social mission statements makes them suitable evaluation tools for social enterprises.
O50|Bevölkerungs- und Wirtschaftsentwicklung in den mittel- und osteuropäischen Ländern|This publication is available in German language only. For a brief English summary see further below. Der Zustrom aus den mittel- und osteuropäischen Ländern (MOEL) spielte eine wichtige Rolle bei der Bevölkerungsentwicklung in Österreich und Wien zwischen 2000 und 2016. Dies hat auch zu einer signifikanten Veränderung der Beschäftigungsstruktur in Wien geführt, die teilweise zu einer Verdrängung inländischer und anderer ausländischer Arbeitnehmer führte. Die Studie gibt eine Einschätzung des aktuellen und zukünftigen Migrationspotenzials nach Österreich und Wien aus den MOEL und zwei Westbalkanländern, Bosnien und Herzegowina und Serbien. Die wirtschaftliche Entwicklung in den MOEL ist seit einigen Jahren sehr positiv, und auch die Prognosen deuten auf ein stetiges Wirtschaftswachstum mit deutlich höheren Wachstumsraten als im EU-Durchschnitt hin. Damit einhergehend hat sich die Arbeitsmarktsituation in diesen Ländern insgesamt verbessert. Dies und die allgemeine demographische Entwicklung in der Region führen zu einer Verlangsamung der Mobilitätsströme aus den MOEL. Dennoch ist die demographische Entwicklung in der Region und auf dem Westbalkan nach wie vor besorgniserregend, da die Bevölkerung (insbesondere jene im erwerbsfähigen Alter) schrumpft. Demographische Langzeitszenarien gehen davon aus, dass die Bevölkerung in der Region in den kommenden Jahrzehnten weiter stark zurückgehen wird. Diese Entwicklungen deuten auf eine Abflachung der Trends hin, wenn nicht sogar auf eine mittelfristige Schwächung der bestehenden Mobilitätsströme nach Österreich und Wien. Es gibt auch keine Hinweise darauf, dass sich die regionale Struktur der Migrationsströme in Hinblick auf die österreichischen Bundesländer stark verschieben wird. English Summary Population trends and economic development in Central and East European countries The influx from Central and East European countries (CEECs) played an important role in population trends in Austria and Vienna between 2000 and 2016. This has also led to a significant change in the employment structure in Vienna, partly resulting in the displacement of both domestic and other foreign workers. The study assesses the current and future migration potential to Austria and Vienna from the CEECs and two Western Balkan countries, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. Economic developments in the CEECs have been very positive for some years already and forecasts also point to steady economic growth with significantly higher growth rates than the EU average. In line with this, the labour market situation in these countries has generally improved. This and the general demographic developments in the region lead to a slowdown in mobility flows from CEECs. Nonetheless, demographic developments in the region and the Western Balkans remain worrying as population is shrinking and the working-age population even more so. Demographic long-term scenarios suggest that the population in the region will continue to shrink sharply in the coming decades. These developments point towards a flattening of trends, if not a weakening of existing mobility flows to Austria and Vienna in the medium term. Finally, there are no indications that the patterns of mobility flows to Austrian regions (i.e. with respect to individual provinces) will shift significantly.
O50|How Internal Violence Lowers Economic Growth: A Theoretical and Empirical Study|In this paper, we introduce a new variable called Internal Violence Index (IVI) and study its effects on economic growth both theoretically and empirically. The first part builds a stochastic endogenous growth model which demonstrates that Internal Violence harms economic growth. On the theoretical side, this paper is the first to introduce a fully-micro-founded endogenous economic growth model that illustrates the explicit effect of Internal Violence on long-run growth in a stochastic dynamic optimization in continuous time framework. On the empirical side, this paper is also the first to employ Linear Regressions and Instrumental Variables Estimations techniques to empirically study the impact of Internal Violence on economic growth. The empirical results corroborate the theoretical predictions that Internal Violence acts negatively on economic growth. The negative impact of Internal Violence on growth are maintained when we use alternative measurements of Internal Violence and subsamples of Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Non Least Developed Countries.
O50|Drivers Of Growth In Fast Emerging Economies: A Dynamic Instrumental Quantile Approach To Real Output And Its Rates Of Growth In Brics And Mint Countries, 2001-2011|We analyze the evolution of fast emerging economies of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China & South Africa) and MINT (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria & Turkey) countries, by assessing growth determinants throughout the conditional distributions of the growth rate and real GDP output for the period 2001-2011. An instrumenal variable (IV) quantile regression approach is complemented with Two-Stage-Least Squares and IV Least Absolute Deviations. We find that the highest rates of growth of real GDP per head, among the nine countries of this study, corresponded to China, India, Nigeria, Indonesia and Turkey, but the highest increases in real GDP per capita corresponded, in descending order, to Turkey China, Brazil, South Africa and India. This study analyzes the impacts of several indicators on the increase of the rate of growth of real GDP and on the logarithm of the real GDP. We analyze several limitations of the methodology, related with the selection of the explained and the explanatory variables, the effect of missing variables, and the particular problems of some indicators. Our results show that Net Foreign Direct Investment, Natural Resources, and Political Stability have a positive and significant impact on the rate of growth of real GDP or on real GDP.
O50|On the sustainability of maximizing GDP Growth|Sparked by Baumol’s revenue- versus profit-maximizing models of the firm, this paper using a growth model shows that if a nation seeks GDP-maximizing growth with capital expansion as driving force, the model could work only under the assumption that the consumers’ aversion to under-consumption, an unavoidable consequence of over-investment, remains constant, and the effects of under-consumption are not accumulative. Otherwise, it has to decelerate growth and ultimately converges to the neoclassical growth model with consumption optimality. The empirical evidence on growth models of ex-Soviet Union, China and Eastern Asia are examined to explore the extent to which the model captures the real world.
O50|Environmental Risks between Conceptualization and Action|Changes in the contemporary world materialized in particular through population growth and mobility, urbanization, and economic expansion also result in an increased exposure of people and assets to extreme events and impose, implicitly, adequate management of induced risks. The occurrence of natural and anthropogenic risk phenomena, known as hazards, puts a heavy tribute on disaster-sensitive human communities regardless of their level of development. The magnitude of the disasters and their increasing frequency and severity imply the need for their approach by the entire world community and for global action. Knowledge of risks becomes a sine qua condition in carrying out impact studies, risk prevention plans, spatial planning plans, and, in general, a condition for effective management of natural resources or sustainable development projects.
O50|A Panel Analysis of Income Inequality and Energy Use|This paper investigates the relationship between energy consumption and income inequality in an unbalanced panel of 147 countries over the period 1990 - 2014. Using a variety of panel and dynamic panel methods and controlling for other determinants of inequality, such as education, health, investment, etc., I find a large and strong negative relationship between access to energy and income inequality. Moreover, I demonstrate that greater access reduces the share of income enjoyed by the top 20% and increases the share for the bottom 20%. Results are less robust when the sample is divided into regions and economic 'blocs', but the overall results are unchanged.
O50|The PRC’s Long-Run Growth through the Lens of the Export-Led Growth Model|The People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) remarkable growth performance over the last 3 decades has been associated to very robust export growth, so much so that many refer to it as a clear example of export-led growth (ELG). Using the concept of the balance-of-payments equilibrium (BOPE) growth rate, which provides a framework to test the ELG hypothesis, we show that the PRC’s actual long-run growth is well approximated by its BOPE growth rate. This growth rate is given by the ratio of the growth rate of exports to the income elasticity of imports. We estimate the latter using the Kalman filter, which allows us to obtain a time-varying estimate of the PRC’s BOPE growth rate. We find that the average value of the PRC’s BOPE growth rate during 1981–2016 was 11%, but it varied significantly over time and declined notably after 2007. Today, it is estimated at a much lower 5.9%. We then discuss the determinants of the PRC’s BOPE growth rate and of the income elasticity of imports, with the help of the Bayesian model averaging technique. The analysis highlights the role of the composition of aggregate demand as the main driving force, both for its direct effects on the income elasticity of imports, and for the indirect effects on export growth via capital accumulation, in particular fixed asset investment. Our analysis has important implications to understand the PRC’s transition to a “New Normal” of a lower growth rate.
O50|In God We Learn? The Universal Messages of Religions, their Context-Specific Effects, and the role of Minority Status|We test whether major religious denominations have a uniform impact on education across the world. Using individual data from the World Values Survey for 77 countries, we find that no denomination consistently influences education and, in fact, for each denomination we study there are countries where its impact is significantly positive, significantly negative, or statistically insignificant. To explain this unexpected result, we relate our first finding to minority status and find that denominations that are a minority in a country have a positive effect on the level of education of their followers in that country. Both findings uphold a series of robustness checks, including changing the definition of minority religions, excluding outliers, and changing the measure of education.
O50|Higher education and economic development: can public funding restrain the returns from tertiary education?|This paper examines whether the contribution of tertiary education to economic growth and income per capita depends on the structure of public education budgets. The analysis resorts to a panel of 41 countries over the period 1970-2010. The empirical approach is based on system GMM regressions and Hierarchical Linear Models, which allow dealing with endogeneity concerns and parameter heterogeneity. The estimates show that budget imbalances against basic schooling seem to undermine the achievement of productivity gains from higher education.
O50|Genetic Diversity and Economic Development : Assessing the Key Findings in Ashraf and Galor (2013)|We replicate Ashraf and Galor (2013) and find that its conclusions concerning the association between human genetic diversity and economic development depend substantially on coding errors and sample selection. We correct the coding errors and add or update data on genetic diversity and population density from high-quality sources. We find little support for the hypothesis that variation in genetic diversity among subpopulations has a systematic relationship with economic development.
O50|The Role of Novelty-Seeking Traits in Contemporary Knowledge Creation|This paper hypothesizes and empirically establishes the persistent effects of novelty-seeking traits on crosscountry differences in scientifc knowledge creation. I use data on the prevalence of specifc allele variants of the human DRD4 exon III gene, which population geneticists have linked to the human phenotype of novelty-seeking behavior to examine its relationship to scientifc knowledge creation in society. The results suggest a positive and statistically signifcant linear relationship between both outcomes that is consistent with the hypothesis that the prevalence of novelty-seeking traits in society facilitates scientifc knowledge creation through benefcial human behaviors related to risk-taking and explorative behavior. The empirical fndings remain qualitatively unaffected when controlling for additional historical, biogeographical, and socioeconomic factors that appear as additional important determinants in the creation of scientifc knowledge in society.
O50|Determinants of foreign direct investment in fast-growing economies: evidence from the BRICS and MINT countries|Abstract The flow of foreign direct investment (FDI) into a country can benefit both the investing entity and host government. This study employed panel analysis to examine the factors that determine the direction of FDI to the fast-growing BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) and MINT (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Turkey) countries. First, we used a pooled time-series cross sectional analysis of data from 2001 to 2011 to estimate and model the determinants of FDI for three samples: BRICS only, MINT only, and BRICS and MINT combined. Then, a fixed effects approach was employed to provide the model for BRICS and MINT combined. The results demonstrate that market size, infrastructure availability, and trade openness play the most significant roles in attracting FDI to BRICS and MINT, while the roles of availability of natural resources and institutional quality are insignificant. To sustain and promote FDI inflow, the governments of BRICS and MINT must ensure that their countries remain attractive for investment by offering a level playing field for investors and political stability. BRICS and MINT governments also need to invest more in their human capital to ensure that their economies can absorb substantial skills and technology spillovers from FDI and promote sustainable long-term economic growth. This study is significant because it contributes to the literature on determinants of FDI by extending the scope of previous studies that often focused on BRICS only.
O50|Taxes and Economic Growth in OECD Countries: A Meta-Analysis|This paper uses meta-analysis to evaluate the results of 42 studies and 641 individual estimates of the effect of taxes on economic growth in OECD countries. Our analysis addresses a number of difficult coding issues such as: implications of the government budget constraint for interpretations of tax effects; units of measurement for economic growth rates and tax rates; implications of equation specifications that measure short-run, medium-run, and long-run effects; length of time period (annual data versus multi-year periods); and other factors. Our main findings are: Estimates in the literature are characterized by significant (negative) publication bias. Controlling for publication bias, we find that increases in unproductive expenditures funded by distortionary taxes and/or deficits have a significant, negative effect on growth; while increases in non-distortionary taxes to fund productive expenditures and/or government surpluses have a significant, positive effect. The estimated differences in these policies indicate that there is scope for tax policy to have a meaningful impact on economic growth. Finally, we find weak evidence that taxes on labour are more growth retarding than other types of taxes, while the evidence regarding other types of taxes is mixed.
O50|Testing a model of UK growth - a causal role for R&D subsidies|We show that a DSGE model in which subsidies to private sector R&D stimulate economic growth, following the predictions of semi-endogenous growth theory, can account for the joint behaviour of UK output and total factor productivity for 1981-2010. R&D subsidies are measured as government- funded R&D performed by the private sector as a proportion of total private sector R&D. We estimate and test the performance of the model using Indirect Inference, and also investigate the robustness of the results using a Monte Carlo exercise. Our f•ndings indicate that sharp cuts in R&D subsidies tend to have highly persistent growth e¤ects in the UK.
O50|Well-being Inequality in the Long Run|This paper provides a long-run view of well-being inequality at world scale based on a new historical dataset. Trends in social dimensions alter the view on inequality derived from per capita GDP. While in terms of income, inequality increased until the third quarter of the twentieth century; in terms of well-being, inequality fell steadily since World War I. The spread of mass primary education and the health transitions were its main drivers. The gap between the West and the Rest explains only partially the evolution of well-being inequality, as the dispersion within the developing regions has increasingly determined its evolution.

O50|Winner-Take-All Cities|Abstract: This chapter examines the phenomenon “winner-take-all cities.” Large segments of the modern economy have been shown to conform to a “winner-take-all” pattern as superstar talent draws a disproportionate share of economic rewards (Rosen 1981; Adler 1985; Frank and Cook, 1996). But cities also conform to a winner-take-all pattern in which a small group of global “superstar cities” (Gyourko et al., 2013) account for a disproportionate share of talent, economic activity, innovation, and wealth (Florida, 2017). We track the distribution of several key factors to identify and describe this pattern of winner-take-all urbanism in global cities, using novel data on venture capital-backed startups and billionaire wealth, which we compare to the distribution of economic activity and population. Following the literature on global cities (Beaverstock et al., 1999; Taylor and Walker, 2001), we also examine the disproportionate share of these activities that are concentrated in so-called “alpha” global cities. We find clear evidence of a winner-take-all urbanism across the global economy and the world’s cities.

O50|Two Blades of Grass: The Impact of the Green Revolution|We examine the impact of the Green Revolution, defined as the discusion of high-yielding crop varieties (HYVs), on aggregate economic outcomes in developing countries during the second half of the 20th century. We use time variation in the development and discusion of HYVs of 10 major crops, and the spatial variation in agro-climatically suitability for growing them, to identify the causal effects of adoption. In a sample of 84 counties, we estimate that a 10 percentage points increase in HYV adoption increases GDP per capita by about 15 percent. This effect is fully accounted for by a combination of the direct effect on crop yields, factor adjustment in agriculture, and structural transformation. Our analysis also reveals that the Green Revolution reduced fertility and that the reduction was only partly ofset by decreasing mortality rates. The net effect on population growth was therefore negative.
O50|Some Universal Patterns in Income Distribution: An Econophysics Approach|"This paper utilizes the econophysics ""two class"" (EPTC) approach to income distribution to derive certain empirical rules applying to all countries in the comprehensive World Income Inequality (WIID) database. This approach demonstrates that wage incomes follow an exponential distribution while property incomes follow a Pareto distribution, which leads to a simple and empirically robust approximation to the Lorenz curve. We in turn show that the per capita income of any bottom fraction (x) of the population is proportional to “inequality adjusted GDP per capita”, i.e. to (GDP per capita).(1-Gini), the constant of proportionality a(x) being solely a function of population fraction under consideration. This proposition is empirically robust across countries and over time in our large database. We focus on two patterns. The “1.1 Rule” in which the income per capita of the bottom 80 percent of a country's population, what we call the Vast Majority Income, can be calculated in every country as 1.1(GDP per capita).(1-Gini). Using the VMI in place of GDP per capita gives rise to different country rankings. Secondly, the “1.0 Rule” in which the per capita income of the bottom 70 percent is directly equal to inequality adjusted GDP per capita. Sen (1976) uses traditional welfare theory to arrive at inequality adjusted GDP per capita as a measure of social welfare while we use EPTC to arrive at it as a measure of the per capita income of the bottom 70 percent."
O50|Financial Development and Pre-historic Geographical Isolation: Global Evidence|Using cross-country differences in the degree of isolation before the advent of technologies in sea and air transportation, we assess the relationship between geographic isolation and financial development across the globe. We find that pre-historic geographical isolation has been beneficial to development because it has contributed to contemporary cross-country differences in financial intermediary development. The relationship is robust to alternative samples, different estimation techniques, outliers and varying conditioning information sets. The established positive relationship between geographic isolation and financial intermediary development does not significantly extend to stock market development.

Para ello, en primer lugar, se muestra a través de correlaciones no condicionadas que la corrupción está relacionada negativamente con variables asociadas al desarrollo económico. En segundo lugar, se cuantifican los efectos de la corrupción sobre el crecimiento económico; para ello, se estima un modelo de datos de panel dinámico para una muestra de 104 países durante el período 1980-2015; los resultados indican que una mejora en los índices de corrupción de los países de Latinoamérica y de Perú al nivel promedio de los países desarrollados incrementaría el crecimiento del PBI per cápita en un 0.8% y 0.6% más, respectivamente.
O50|Dissemination of Two Faces of Knowledge: Do Liberal-Democracy and Income-Level Matter?|Many researchers have examined the functional relationship between the level of realized total factor productivity (TFP) and innovation, and the positive effect new ideas have on productivity. But, how do diverse ideas drive productivity? And do the home country’s levels of income, civil liberties and political rights influence the spillover effects of innovation? In this research, I answer these questions by using a new dataset on scientific publication. I separate innovations into technical and managerial, and then explore their effects on the economy, using pooled mean group estimations in a dynamic heterogeneous panel setting of 60 countries for the period 1996 to 2014. The findings show that, for high-income countries, domestic innovations in management are a significant source of change in productivity. In contrast, the estimated results do not support the role of the domestic development of management innovation in middle-income countries. However, in the long run, international spillovers of management ideas positively affect the productivity of these latter countries. Regardless of which metric is utilized in the analysis, national spillovers of management ideas increase the productivity of countries with the most-liberal democratic regimes. However, in democratic countries where the regime is only partially liberal, domestic management innovations have a depressing effect on productivity. This last result differs over the long run, as international spillovers of management ideas contribute to higher productivity in less-democratic countries. The results show that, in high-income countries, the elasticity of TFP in respect to management innovation is almost twice as large as it is for technical ideas. The results also indicate that increasing the number of researchers does not enhance the development of management innovation.
O50|Twin peaks|Received wisdom suggests that most exporters sell the majority of their output domestically. In this paper, however, we show that the distribution of export intensity not only varies substantially across countries, but in a large number of cases is also bimodal, displaying what we refer to as twin peaks. We reconcile this new stylized fact with an otherwise standard, two-country model of trade in which firms are heterogeneous in terms of the demand they face in each market. We show that when firm destination-specific revenue shifteres are distributed lognormal, gamma, or Frechet with sufficiently high dispersion, the distribution of export intensity has two modes in the boundaries of the support and their height is determined by a country’s size relative to the rest of the world. We estimate the deep parameters characterizing the distribution of export intensity. Our results show that when the conditions for the existence of twin peaks are met, differences in relative market size can explain most of the observed variation in the distribution of export intensity across the world.
O50|Modi's 'Make in India' Industrial Reform Policy and East Asian Flying-Geese Paradigm|The on-going ‘Make in India’ campaign aims at manufacturing revival. Its characteristics resemble East Asian industrial reform and growth policies based on the flying-geese model which highlights ‘step-by-step’ changes in a country’s specialisation pattern and global competitiveness accompanied by economic growth. Unlikely, ‘Make in India’ comprises heterogeneous measures ‘simultaneously’ supporting industries in different development stages from labour and capital-intensive to high-tech industries and modern services. Moreover issues like world-market uncertainty discouraging export activities; poverty-reduction-oriented labour-industry promotion vs overall productivity increase; and complementary role of IT services for industrial modernisation and growth, will shape the success of India’s diversified industrial policy.

O50|Tourism and Economic Growth in Jordan: Evidence from Linear and Nonlinear Frameworks|This study investigates cointegration and causal effects between tourism and economic growth (EG) in Jordan. We use quarterly data from 1998Q1 to 2015Q4 on real gross domestic product and real international tourism receipts. Two empirical approaches are employed; Engle and Granger (1987) linear cointegration framework, and the nonlinear framework of Enders and Siklos (2001) cointegration test, in addition to Diks and Panchenko (2006) causality test. Empirical findings reveal the presence of a positive long-run relationship between tourism and EG. According to the linear approach there is a unidirectional causality from tourism to growth, thus, supporting the tourism-led growth hypothesis. Whereas, the nonlinear method, which seems to give more appropriate results, suggests a bidirectional causality, hence, confirming the feedback hypothesis that EG and tourism reinforce each other.
O50|The persistent effects of novelty-seeking traits on comparative economic development|The issue of novelty-seeking traits have been related to important economic attitudes such as risk-taking, entrepreneurial, and explorative behaviors that foster technological progress and, thus, economic development. However, numerous molecular genetic studies have shown that novelty-seeking bearing individuals are prone to certain psychological “disadvantages” such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), leading to occupational and educational difficulties in modern societies. Using a recent compilation of DRD4 exon III allele frequencies – a particular gene variant that population geneticists have found to be sometimes associated with the human phenotype of novelty-seeking behavior – this paper advances a new country-level measure on the prevalence of novelty-seeking traits for a large number of countries worldwide. The results suggest a stable non-monotonic inverted U-shaped relationship between the country-level DRD4 exon III allele frequency measure and economic development. This finding is suggestive of the potential “benefits” and “costs” of novelty-seeking traits for the aggregate economy.

The obtained empirical evidence reveals that lower regulations in the long run exert a significantly positive effect on TFP of OECD countries. Short run effects of regulation are not always statistically significant. The influence of regulatory changes is higher in countries with high levels of regulation. Also, the damaging effects of regulation are more intense in countries with low technology gaps. These results hold across a wide array of econometric specifications and variables that measure regulation and TFP.
O50|Decomposing changes in the conditional variance of GDP over time|A well established fact in the growth empirics literature is the increasing (unconditional) variation in output per capita across countries. We propose a nonparametric decomposition of the conditional variation of output per capita across countries to capture different channels over which the variation might be increasing. We find that OECD countries have experienced diminishing conditional variation while other regions have experienced increasing conditional variation. Our decomposition suggests that most of these changes in the conditional variance of output are due to unobserved factors not accounted for by the traditional growth determinants. In addition to this we show that these factors played very different roles over time and across regions.
O50|The impact of crude oil prices on financial market indicators: copula approach|Oil price changes have varying impacts on the financial indicators of global markets and economies. This study aims to explore the dependence structure between crude oil prices and stock market indices, as well as the exchange rates in a number of economies categorized with respect to their status as developing/emerging markets, and oil importer/exporter countries. Dependence structures in this study are evaluated in considerable depth using copula models. The broad time period covered allows the investigation of the effect of global financial crisis on the mentioned dependence structure. An additional feature of this study is the inclusion of 1 to 30-day analysis to capture the variation of dependence on duration change. To serve these aims, as well as ARIMA and GARCH models, various copula measures are used to illustrate the level of the association. Additionally, a special focus on the Turkish case is given to illustrate its sensitivity to oil prices. We find that exchange rates and stock indices of most oil exporter countries show higher oil price dependency, whereas, emerging oil importer markets are less vulnerable to price fluctuations. Considerable impacts were found for the global crisis and the continuing recent sharp decrease in oil prices.
O50|The changing of the relationships between carbon footprints and final demand: Panel data evidence for 40 major countries|Global warming and environmental pollution have led many countries to begin to implement measures to reduce the use of fossil fuels. However, emissions reductions may have been reached because of the displacement of emissions intensive production. The objective of this study is to analyze the relationships between the emissions caused by countries from a demand point of view, the carbon footprints and the demand for goods and services in these countries, and especially in the European countries. With this aim, a two-step process was carried out. Firstly, carbon footprints were calculated during the 1995–2009 period. Secondly, the EKC hypothesis between these carbon footprints and the total final demands were tested by using panel data and a multilevel mixed-effects model. The results show that the EKC hypothesis is not supported when considering carbon footprints with respect to final demand. It is also shown that carbon footprints are slightly increasing with respect to final demand beyond proportionality. The carbon footprint elasticities are different between countries, their values increasing with the final demand per capita of countries.
O50|How economic freedom affects opportunity and necessity entrepreneurship in the OECD countries|This research addresses the extent to which economic freedom, understood as market economy-oriented institutions and policies, matters for opportunity entrepreneurship and necessity entrepreneurship. To this end, we carry out a panel data dynamic analysis in the OECD countries during the period 2001–2012 by using the system Generalized Method of Moments estimator. We examine the relationship between the Fraser Institute's economic freedom index and its five areas, and both indicators from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor on opportunity entrepreneurship and necessity entrepreneurship. We find that economic liberalization tends to encourage opportunity entrepreneurship and to discourage necessity entrepreneurship. In particular, opportunity entrepreneurship seems to benefit from improvements in legal structure and security of property rights and in regulation of credit, labor, and business, while both aspects and more freedom to trade internationally seem to damage necessity entrepreneurship.
O50|REDD policy impacts on the agri-food sector and food security|Recent research shows that the combined contributions of deforestation, forest degradation and peat land emissions account for about 15% of greenhouse gas emissions. The REDD policy which preserves forests and values standing forests, enables substantial emission reductions. Since agricultural production and area expansion is a primary driver of tropical deforestation, REDD policies might limit the expansion possibilities of agricultural land use and therefore influence competitiveness of the agricultural sector, agricultural prices, trade patterns, agricultural production and therefore food security in the world. This paper studies the impact of REDD policies on the agri-food sector and food security with a global CGE model called MAGNET using a scenario approach. It focuses on the restrictions on agricultural land expansion within the REDD policy package. Simulation results show that REDD policies start to affect the agri-food sector in some lower developed countries if more than 15% of potentially available agricultural areas are protected from deforestation. A stringent REDD policy that protects 90% of land reserves that could potentially be used for agriculture production results in a global real agricultural price increase of almost 7.6%, and a worldwide agricultural production decrease of 1.7%. Regional differences are large, with real agricultural price changes ranging from 4% in North America to about 24% in Sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia. Food access rapidly deteriorates for low-income population in these regions in the case of high forest protection levels. Compensatory payments are necessary from a food security point of view if the level of forest protection increases. Our results indicate that from a food security perspective REDD policy should stop short of trying to protect more than 40% of global carbon if the compensation mechanism is not effectively implemented within REDD.
O50|Tax Structure and Economic Growth: Do Differences in Income Level and Government Effectiveness Matter?|We empirically examine the effects of both overall tax rate and changes in tax structure on growth by using data for more than 100 high, middle and lower income countries by employing the GMM estimation methods. We classify the countries by their income and their government effectiveness levels. We investigate whether the government effectiveness is important in affecting the nature of the relationship for non-OECD countries. Although there are some exceptions, our results don’t support the idea that overall tax rate or changes in tax structure have a significant effect on growth rate. We find that a shift from income to consumption and property taxes leads to a positive and significant effect on growth rate while holding overall tax burden constant. Our results also suggest that a shift from consumption and property taxes to income taxes has a positive effect on growth rate for low-income countries.
O50|Cross-national differences in entrepreneurial activity: role of culture and institutional factors|Abstract A review of literature in entrepreneurship and public policy suggests that the level of political freedom, corruption, and education are important antecedents to the rate of entrepreneurial activity in nations. However, empirical analysis of the effect these factors have on entrepreneurial activity across nations remains ambiguous. This study proposes that the cultural context of nations moderates the effect of these factors. Consistent with this argument, it investigates the role of individualism-collectivism in moderating the effect of political freedom, corruption, and education on entrepreneurial activity across nations. Macro-level data on 84 nations is obtained from multiple reliable sources and used to test the hypotheses. Results support the theorized arguments and suggest that individualism positively moderates the effect of political freedom, negatively moderates the effect of corruption, and positively moderates the effect of education, on the rate of entrepreneurial activity across nations.
O50|The Coase Mechanism and the Iteration Argument|The “iteration argument” presented in Schlicht (1996) shows that the allocation of property rights may generate inefficiencies, contrary to what the “Coase Theorem,” as commonly understood, asserts. The argument may be summarized by saying that markets (and bargaining) cease to function properly if several people are entitled and prepared to engage in the same externality-ridden activity and each of them has to be bribed individually from being the first offender. Given that the harm from pollution does not rise linearily with the amount of pollution, the sum-total of the damages produced when all of the potential offenders engage in the harmful activity may be smaller than the sum-total of the bribes which must be offered to prevent each potential offender from starting the offensive activity, even if the ensuing social damages exceed the associated private returns and an inefficient outcome is obtained. If pollution without permission by the community is not permitted, a different – and in this case efficient – outcome results. This note illustrates the argument by means of a simple example. It is an excerpt of Schlicht (1997).
O50|Twin Peaks|Received wisdom suggests that most exporters sell the majority of their output domestically. In this paper, however, we show that the distribution of export intensity not only varies substantially across countries, but in a large number of cases is also bimodal, displaying what we refer to as 'twin peaks.' We reconcile this new stylized fact with an otherwise standard, two-country model of trade in which firms are heterogeneous in terms of the demand they face in each market. We show that when firm-destination-specific revenue shifters are distributed lognormal, gamma, or Fréchet with sufficiently high dispersion, the distribution of export intensity has two modes in the boundaries of the support and their height is determined by a country's size relative to the rest of the world. We estimate the deep parameters characterizing the distribution of export intensity. Our results show that when the conditions for the existence of twin peaks are met, differences in relative market size can explain most of the observed variation in the distribution of export intensity across the world.
O50|Export performance and potential with regional partners: The case of a landlocked LDC, Nepal|"This paper assesses export performance and potentials for increased bilateral trade with regional partners of Nepal, a least-developed country (LDC) in South Asia. Following an overview of the country's export performance, and the distinct policy and logistical challenges it faces as a landlocked country, an econometric analysis of the determinants of bilateral exports is undertaken using the gravity modelling framework. The results suggest that the 'structural' factors such supply-side constraints, distance to markets, and cultural proximity as geographical and cultural proximity have mattered more than trade and other policy barriers imposed by destination markets. The paper also identifies partners to which Nepal appears to be ""under-exporting,"" and concludes that there is much room for the country to integrate further with regional markets if it were to overcome its supply side constraints."
O50|The role of human assets in economic growth: theory and empirics|In this paper, we introduce a new variable called Human Assets and study its effects on economic growth both theoretically and empirically. The first part builds an endogenous growth model which demonstrates that Human Assets increase economic growth. The second part employs the new Dynamic Common Correlated Effects Estimator for heterogeneous cross-sectionally dependent dynamic panels to empirically study the impact of Human Assets on economic growth. The results corroborate the theoretical predictions that Human Assets act positively on economic growth. The positive impact of Human Assets on growth is maintained when we use small sample bias corrections and sensitivity to the choice of lag orders. The paper also illustrates, theoretically and empirically, that the magnitude of the effect of Human Assets on growth is huge compared to most other determinants of economic growth. Finally, we discover that human capital does not affect the growth rate once we control for Human Assets.
O50|Recession and financial development: An empirical analysis|This paper mainly examine the sensitivity level of economic recession to the financial sector development by ascertaining whether such relationship is linear and contingent on trade openness, GDP per capita, financial openness, institution, democracy and fuels. We employ annual data of 129 countries from all part of the world spanning 1990-2010 and invoke Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimation method; we applied Sasabuchi test to verify the inverse U-shape and estimate the extreme point. We also used semiparametric and regional exclusion based regression for robustness check. The nexus between recession and financial development assessment suggest that, the nonlinearity and thus U-shaped relationship is operational; additionally, when financial development increases, it is accompanied by a reduction in the depth of recessions; and this, up to a certain threshold. Beyond this brink, financial deepening correlates with deep recessions. Additionally, we found that trade openness have a positive on economic recession independently to the estimation method. For robustness check, estimations results first confirm the baseline findings in terms of magnitude and significance in the correlation coefficients; then, highlight sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), South Asia (SASIA) and Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) as the order of continental/regional importance in increasing magnitude. Finally, the semiparametric regression show that, the results of the parametric part converge with the previous results in general, and bear out with illustration the functional form of the nonlinear relation between recession and financial development. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study examining this relationship using newly primary and hitherto almost unexploited “Rare macroeconomic disasters” data from Barro and Ursua (2012) which allow us to build a more specific proxy of the variable “economic recession”.
O50|An Empirical Study: Financial-Market Imperfections and Investment|Korean economy undergoes pre-modernized corporate governance. Financial-market imperfections assumed to be incorporated in equity ratio affect the sensitivity of internal funds to physical investment. Empirical analyses show that the effects of asymmetric information are significant. Theories predict that internal finance is less costly than borrowing or issuing equity. Higher cash flow from higher profits affects investment ratio. But, this marginal effect is decreased by equity ratio. If we assume that more imperfect financial market requires more equity than borrowing, we can see that agency costs change the way economic variables like cash flow affect physical investment. Cash flow plays two opposite roles for implementing investment. In the case of financial-imperfections, we can expect that firms with higher profits invest more. But, according to free cash flow hypothesis by Jensen (1986), managers with only a small ownership interest have an incentive for wasteful management. We can expect to see more wasteful activity in a firm with large cash flows. Our regression result shows that the former dominates the latter, so we get positive coefficient for cash flow variable on the physical investment.
O50|Asia-Pacific regional integration index: Construction, interpretation, and comparison|We develop a composite index to measure the degree of regional integration in Asia. The index comprises 26 indicators in six dimensions of regional integration, namely, trade and investment, money and finance, regional value chains, infrastructure and connectivity, free movement of people, and institutional and social integration. We use principal component analysis to apportion a weight to each indicator to construct dimensional sub-indexes, then follow the same procedure to weight the sub-indexes to construct the overall index. Asia is shown to be relatively well integrated along dimensions of trade and investment and the free movement of people, not so well integrated along the institutional and social dimension. Overall, Asia is somewhat more integrated than South America and Africa, but much less integrated than the European Union.
O50|Export survival and the dynamics of experience|Abstract This paper focuses on developing countries’ pioneer exports to the OECD and obtains several important results on export dynamics, linking export experience and export survival. Using product level data at the SITC 5-digit level for 114 developing countries over the 1962–2009 period, we show that prior export experience obtained in non-OECD markets significantly increases survival of pioneer exports toward the OECD. The experience does not need to last long, as gaining experience for more than two years does not confer any additional benefit. The effect of experience depreciates rapidly with time: a break in export experience prior to entering the OECD reduces the advantage on survival. Finally, the role of prior export experience is particularly relevant for survival in the first two years upon entry into the OECD. The geographic dynamic of export experience reveals that experience is acquired in neighboring, easy to access markets before reaching more distant, richer partners and ultimately serving the OECD with a higher probability of survival.
O50|FDI Flows to Latin America: A Pooled and Cointegration Analysis, 1980-2014|This paper estimates a pooled (fixed-effects) FDI investment function that seeks to identify some of the major economic and institutional determinants of net FDI flows to nine major Latin American countries during the 1980-2014 period. First, it develops a conceptual framework of analysis that seeks to identify some of the major economic and institutional determinants of FDI. Second, the paper gives an overview of FDI flows to Latin America during the 1990-2015 period, with particular emphasis on their contribution to the financing of gross capital formation. Third, an empirical model for FDI flows to Latin America is outlined and an economic rationale is provided for the included variables and their expected signs. Fourth, the estimates from a panel regression designed to explain the variation in FDI flows to Latin America during the 1980-2014 period suggests that market size (proxied by real GDP), credit provided by the private banking sector, government expenditures on education, and the level of economic freedom as measured by the Fraser Institute have a positive and significant effect. On the other hand, public investment spending, the volatility of real GDP and the real exchange rate have a negative and significant effect on FDI flows. The panel unit root tests on the residuals of the relevant panel regressions also suggest that there is a stable, long-term relationship among the included variables; i.e., the selected variables in the reported regressions are cointegrated over the relevant time period. Finally, the paper summarizes the major findings and offers some policy prescriptions for attracting FDI flows to the region and enhancing their positive direct and indirect effects.
O50|Post-conflict peacebuilding: A critical survey of the literature and avenues for future research|How and why do some civil wars end in a peace that endures while other civil wars re-ignite? The existing literature comes to contradictory and puzzling conclusions. For example, while some scholars and development practitioners argue that differences in post-conflict peace-building outcomes were to be explained by the intervention of the international community, other scholars focus on how a civil war ends -whether it ended in a government victory, a rebel victory or a negotiated settlement. By contrast, more recent studies find that states' attributes such as the level of economic development; pre-war level of democracy; the degree of ethnic fractionalisation; and state dependence on oil exports influence the outcomes of post-conflict peacebuilding. Although these explanations focus on different aspects and use different explanatory variables to explain the variation in post-conflict peacebuilding, they are complementary and overlapping in many important ways. This paper presents an in-depth review of a wide body of theoretical and empirical research on post-conflict peacebuilding. The review covers three stands of literature on peace and conflict research which include: (1) those that focus on the root causes of the initial conflict, (2) those that focus on how the original war was fought, and finally, (3) those that focus on post-conflict peacebuilding. The insights from this literature reveals that while existing studies on the transition from civil war to peace have yielded considerable insights, there are a number of weaknesses and gaps. Some policy conclusions are drawn and directions for future research are suggested.
O50|Estimation of Technical Change and TFP Growth Based on Observable Technology Shifters|This paper models and estimates total factor productivity (TFP) growth parametrically. The model is a generalization of the traditional production model where technology is represented by a time trend. TFP growth is decomposed into unobservable technical change, scale economies and observable technology shifter index components. The empirical results are based on an unbalanced panel data at the global level for 190 countries observed over the period 1996-2013. A number of exogenous growth factors are used in modeling four technology shifter indices to explore development infrastructure, finances, technology and human development determinants of TFP growth. Our results show that unobservable technical changes remain the most important component of TFP growth. The observable technology indices-based component is lower than the simple unobserved time trend model based one. By comparing the performance of the time trend and technology index models in terms of TFP growth rates, we arrive at the conclusion that the technology index model predicts a more realistic picture of the TFP growth pattern as compared to the traditional time trend model. Our results also indicate that technical change and TFP growth are negative across country groups and years in the technology index model influenced by the global economic crisis.
O50|Social Development And Ict Adoption. Developing World Perspective|The process of technology diffusion is complex, and one should bear in mind that multiple elements may be claimed as its essential determinants. Insofar, voluminous theoretical and empirical literature has been issued where attempts of identification of the latter has been made. However, we still lack adequate explanations for cross-country differences in new technology adoption; while demonstrated evidence is scattered and to a great extend it lacks robustness. This paper is designed to provide empirical evidence on the relationship between the process of ICT diffusion and social development across selected low-income and lower-middle-income countries during the period of 2000 and 2014. Its main target is to identify whether in low-income and lower-middle-income economies, ICT development and social development are correlated. It combines five logically structured sections. Section 1 is the introduction; Section 2 discusses literature review regarding ICT diffusion determinants. Next, Section 3 briefly presents data used in the research and explains methodological framework.Section 4 demonstrates results of empirical analysis, and Section 5 concludes.
O50|Efficient waste management practices: A review|Nowadays waste has become a vital part of our economy, as a by-product of economic activity. It originates from businesses, the government and households and following appropriate management techniques, it can be used as an input to economic activity for instance through material or energy recovery. Waste is produced by all activities and although it is a locally arising problem it has both local and global effects. Societies need to dispose their waste products creating a source of environmental pollution. Sustainable waste management requires the combination of skills and knowledge of physical sciences and engineering together with economics, ecology, human behaviour, entrepreneurship and good governance. This paper discusses extensively the policy framework and the legislative background around waste and its management in the EU and worldwide. In this way, it focuses on the treatment options for waste under the Circular Economy approach having in mind the idea of closing the loop and hence achieving a more efficient use of resources.
O50|Total factor productivity heterogeneity: channelling the impact of institutions|This paper aims to contribute to the debate on the determinants of differentials in firms’ productivity. We test the hypothesis that macro factors, especially the quality of local institutions, play a role in explaining firm productivity in Italy. To this end, following Fӓre et al. (1994), we decompose the Malmquist index of total factor productivity (TFP) change for approximately 7,500 manufacturing small and medium-sized firms, and we proxy province-level institutional quality using the IQI index (Nifo and Vecchione, 2014). The results of our stimations suggest that better local institutions might help firms better combine inputs, approach the optimal size, and ultimately be more productive.
O50|Economic Growth and Technological Progress in Turkey: An Analysis of Schumpeterian Mechanisms|This paper studies a second-generation Schumpeterian model to understand the nature of technological progress and economic growth in Turkey. It identifies some structural parameters numerically and tests whether certain Schumpeterian mechanisms work. Results show that, while horizontal (product) innovation works as determined in theory, vertical (process) innovation does not operate in the long run. Since the paper directly estimates the structural forms originating from the general equilibrium of the model economy, results do not carry any endogeneity bias. The paper also explains, in a quite transparent way, why the Turkish economy did not converge to frontier economies. The most appropriate policy under resource constraints is to strengthen the incumbent firms and support their growth, and the formation of new enterprises is not a policy priority.
O50|Financial Development and Geographic Isolation: Global Evidence|Using cross-country differences in the degree of isolation before the advent of technologies in sea and air transportation, we assess the relationship between geographic isolation and financial development across the globe. We find that pre-historic geographical isolation has been beneficial to development because it has contributed to contemporary cross-country differences in financial development. The relationship is robust to alternative samples, different estimation techniques, outliers and varying conditioning information sets.
O50|Effect of Trade Openness on Unemployment in Case of Labour and Capital Abundant Countries|This study examined the impact of trade openness on unemployment in case of capital-abundant and labourabundant countries. Inflation rate, economic growth, population growth and political rights have been used as control variables in our empirical analysis. For this purpose, the study used the data for the period of 1990- 2012 for 75 labour-abundant countries and 44 capital-abundant countries. IPS panel unit root test is used to check the normality and stationarity of the variables of interest and Mean Group and Pooled Mean Group heterogeneous panel cointegration techniques have been used to check the long run relationships among the variables of our study and to find the long run and short run parameters. In case of labour-abundant countries, trade openness has a significantly negative impact on unemployment in the long run. The variables of inflation rate and institutional quality also have negative and significant impact on unemployment. On the other hand, population growth is positively and significantly related with unemployment in the labour-abundant countries. While in case of capital-abundant countries, trade openness has a significantly positive impact on unemployment in the long run. The inflation rate also has negative and significant impact on unemployment. The impact of Population growth on unemployment is positively and significant. The coefficient of institutional quality remains statistically insignificant in case of capital-abundant countries.
O50|Analysis of Volatility in Gold Prices with the Markov Regime-Switching Models|Aim of this study is to determine winning and losing periods with Markov regime-switching models in the gold market. Monthly return data of BIST and London gold markets are used for the period July 1995-July 2015. Results show that Markov regime-switching models are more suitable than the linear model for analyzing the gold returns and also the probabilities of remaining within the same regime are high for the gold returns. Another finding is that two months lagged value of London gold returns affect BIST gold returns.
O50|The Effect of High-Skilled Emigration, Foreign Direct Investment, and Policy on the Growth Rate of Source Countries: A Panel Analysis|We study the effect of the high-skilled emigration rate on the growth rate of the source countries. We incorporate the foreign direct investment and the policy variables into the panel model and also their interactions with the high-skilled emigration rate, as they are related to the network externality that may be created by the high-skilled emigrants working abroad. We apply the static fixed-effects model and compare it with the results obtained in the dynamic panel model with system generalized methods of moments estimators. We find the negative effect of the high-skilled emigration rate by itself and in its interaction with the foreign direct investment only in the dynamic model. However, we find positive coefficient for the interaction of the high-skilled emigration rate and the civil liberties index, which holds across the static and dynamic specifications. This implies that the effect of the high-skilled emigration rate on the growth rate of the source countries can be positive, and the extent is larger for countries with 'poor' civil liberties. The developing countries with low levels of foreign direct investment inflows and 'poor' civil liberties can best benefit from the high levels of skilled emigration outward. Through finding significant interactions with other variables, we confirm that the high-skilled emigration should be considered along with other related variables in measuring its impact on growth. The implications offer suggestions for the international trade and aid policies.
O50|Financial Integration-Growth Nexus : A Quantile Regression Analysis|Our study aims to examine the role of economic development in moderating the relationship between international financial integration and economic growth, and we find that international financial integration has a positive impact on economic growth by and large. However, the growth impact of international financial integration does not exist in countries where economic development is too low or in highly developed countries. This suggests that policy makers, especially in developing countries, should ensure the presences of capabilities in order to gain from the financial market integration. The method involves a quantile regression technique on cross-sectional data of 73 countries.
O50|FDI in Central and Eastern Europeâ€™s (CEE) Agribusiness|Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) had adopted restricted industrialization policy until 1990. The economic and social transition started after 1990, providing free atmosphere for foreign investments in CEE. Due to such interference, the early eminent countries were replaced by new eminent ones. This article examines the affirmative as well as unimpressed role of foreign direct investment (FDI) in agribusiness in CEE during 1990sâ€“2000s. Like CEE, India was also a restricted economy until 1991. As a part of continuing reforms, India has recently allowed a bulk of FDI in agribusiness sectors which have prompted farmers and local industrialists to raise their voice against such decision. Agriculture, being a livelihood of major population, needs a better farmâ€“firm link through investment. Evidence from the CEE has proved many positive outcome of FDI. However, India cannot ignore some eccentric lessons from CEE.
O50|O poszukiwaniu przyczyn bogactwa i nędzy narodów w teorii Darona Acemoglu i Jamesa A. Robinsona|Celem artykułu jest analiza głównych koncepcji, jakie wysuwano w ciągu dwu stuleci rozwoju nauk ekonomicznych, próbując odpowiedzieć na fundamentalne dla ekonomii pytanie badawcze, a mianowicie: jakie czynniki warunkują rozwój gospodarczy poszczególnych krajów i społeczeństw? Przegląd i uporządkowanie istniejących stanowisk umożliwia uzyskanie niezbędnego punktu odniesienia dla oceny jednej z najnowszych koncepcji autorstwa Darona Acemoglu i Jamesa A. Robinsona spopularyzowanej w bestsellerowej monografii Why Nations Fail? The Origins of Power, Prosperity and Poverty [2012; wyd. polskie 2014]. Metodę badawczą pozwalającą na realizację powyższego celu stanowią pogłębione studia literaturowe. Najistotniejsze wnioski z przeprowadzonej analizy można sprowadzić do stwierdzenia, że: (1) gros autorów wskazuje wiele elementów istotnych dla rozwoju gospodarczego (teorie jednoczynnikowe zdarzają się sporadycznie), (2) ogół istniejących teorii można umieścić w ramach spektrum rozciągającego się od koncepcji, w których nadrzędna rola jest przypisana różnorakim komponentom środowiska naturalnego (co prowadzi do wysuwania różnych odmian hipotezy geograficznej), po wyjaśnienia, w których na pierwszym planie postawione są czynniki zależne od aktywności człowieka (co owocuje wariantami hipotezy instytucjonalnej). Koncepcja Acemoglu i Robinsona plasuje się zdecydowanie bliżej instytucjonalnego krańca wskazanego spektrum, choć wprowadzenie przez tych badaczy trudnego do akceptacji i obrony na gruncie ich własnych rozważań rozgraniczenia pomiędzy hipotezami: instytucjonalną i kulturową niesłusznie sugeruje, że instytucje można rozpatrywać niezależnie od ich kontekstu kulturowego oraz prowadzi do osłabienia wymowy ich skądinąd wartościowej teorii.
O50|Developing or Under-developing? Implications of Chinaâ€™s â€˜Going outâ€™ for Late Development|Since the turn of the century, Chinaâ€™s influence on world development has increased enormously. This paper seeks to analyse major attributes of the influence of Chinaâ€™s â€œgoing outâ€ , centring on the argument that the influence has been in the main conducive to the rest of the developing world. Specifically, this paper offers a critique of relevant, popular theses such as â€œChinaâ€™s neoliberalization crowds out world developmentâ€ , â€œChina under-cuts the conditions of the worldâ€™s working classâ€ , and â€œChina exhibits a tendency towards imperialismâ€ , etc. It is argued that, in the context of a neoliberal world economy that is increasingly speculation-oriented, Chinaâ€™s production-oriented activities can be seen as an important countervailing force. Whether this China influence is to continue to be conducive to world development in the future, or to turn to become detrimental, depends critically on the broader political-economic context.
O50|In God We Learn? Religions' Universal Messages, Context-Specific Effects, and Minority Status|We study the relationship between major religious denominations and individuals' levels of education, using the World Values Survey. In a first step, running country-by-country regressions, we report first-time evidence that no single denomination has a universal effect on education. Each denomination has a positive and statistically significant effect in some countries, a negative and statistically significant effect in others, and a statistically insignificant effect elsewhere. In a second step, we relate the sign of the impact of a denomination in a country to whether the denomination is a minority in that country. We find that denominations that are a minority in a country are more likely to be associated with a higher level of education, and less likely to be associated with a lower level of education in that country. In both steps, the findings are independent from the specification of the regressions used in the first stage to determine the sign of the impact of denominations on educational outcomes. The finding of the second step is moreover robust to defining minority denominations using various thresholds. It is robust to controlling for whether the denomination is a state religion, for the country's level of democracy, per capita GDP, or level of education, to introducing denomination- and country- fixed effects, and to controlling for the identity of the largest other denomination in the country.
O50|The impact of fiscal decentralization on growth, inflation and inequality in the Americas|This paper analyses the impact of fiscal decentralization on economic growth, inflation and Gini coefficients in 12 countries of the Americas. The findings suggest that the positive impact of this process has been more modest than anticipated, with revenue decentralization having a detrimental effect on economic growth and expenditure decentralization a positive one in developing nations of the Americas. Regarding the impact on income inequality, the results indicate that fiscal decentralization can play an important role in reducing this, particularly on the revenue side, but when decentralization is analysed in developing nations of the Americas only, fiscal decentralization is shown to accentuate rather than mitigate income inequality, which highlights the significant amount of work that is yet to be done before this process delivers on expectations. The findings for the impact of fiscal decentralization on price stability are inconclusive.
O50|Religious Differences and Civil War|Civil wars of today have deep roots in political and religious history. We examine how a society’s geographic distance to religious centers and the consequent historical differences between political rulers and religious segments of the population contributed to current levels of civil war. The theory is based on a political economy model that is centered on legitimizing function that religion plays for rulers vis-à-vis citizens. We test the resulting hypotheses using a new dataset that includes annual information on the religious and political histories of today’s nations since the year 1000. The results show that civil wars in the post-1960 period have been more likely in societies that experienced higher incidents of historical differences between rulers and a significant religious group before 1960. The results hold when we control for the geographic, historical, and institutional characteristics of countries. We address endogeneity concerns between religious differences and civil wars by exploiting variation across countries in their geographic distance to religious “capitals” of the world. Instrumental variable analysis indicates that the presence of historical religious differences that could be exploited by rulers accounts for a substantial portion of civil wars between 1960 and 2014. The results reflect the deep root effects of religious differences on current conflict.
O50|Intangible capital and sectoral energy intensity: Evidence from 40 economies|Intangible capital has been found to be an increasingly important source of productivity and economic growth. However, its effects on energy intensity have received little attention. Given the importance of reducing energy intensity, this study tests the relationship between sectoral intangible capital and sectoral energy intensity in 40 economies from 1995 to 2007 using data from World Input Output Database (WIOD). It is found that the increase in sectoral intangible capital is associated with the decline in sectoral energy intensity. The results remain robust given various forms of econometric specification (OLS, random effects, fixed effects and system GMM). Compared with previous literature, this study proposes a simple theoretical linkage between sectoral intangible capital and sectoral energy intensity, and for the first time confirms this relationship worldwide. This study also provides policies implications in promoting intangible investment and the knowledge economy.
O50|Financial Development and Geographic Isolation: Global Evidence|Using cross-country differences in the degree of isolation before the advent of technologies in sea and air transportation, we assess the relationship between geographic isolation and financial development across the globe. We find that pre-historic geographical isolation has been beneficial to development because it has contributed to contemporary cross-country differences in financial development. The relationship is robust to alternative samples, different estimation techniques, outliers and varying conditioning information sets.
O50|The Issue of Macroeconomic Closure Revisited and Extended|Léon Walras (1874) had already realised that his neo-classical general equilibrium model could not accommodate autonomous investments. In the early 1960s, Amartya Sen analysed the same issue in a simple, one-sector macroeconomic model of a closed economy. He showed that fixing investment in the model, built strictly on neo-classical assumptions, would make the system overdetermined, and thus one should loosen some neo-classical conditions of competitive equilibrium. He analysed three not neo-classical “closure options”, which could make the model well-determined in the case of fixed investment. His list was later extended by others and it was shown that the closure dilemma arises in the more complex computable general equilibrium (CGE) models as well, as does the choice of adjustment mechanism assumed to bring about equilibrium at the macro level. It was also illustrated through several numerical models that the adopted closure rule can significantly affect the results of policy simulations based on a CGE model. Despite these warnings, the issue of macro closure is often neglected in policy simulations. It is, therefore, worth revisiting the issue and demonstrating by further examples its importance, as well as pointing out that the closure problem in the CGE models extends well beyond the problem of how to incorporate autonomous investments into a CGE model. Several closure rules are discussed in this paper and their diverse outcomes are illustrated by numerical models calibrated on statistical data. First, the analyses are done in a one-sector model, similar to Sen’s, but extended into a model of an open economy. Next, the same analyses are repeated using a fully-fledged multi-sectoral CGE model, calibrated on the same statistical data. Comparing the results obtained by the two models it is shown that although they generate quite similar results in terms of the direction and - to a somewhat lesser extent - of the magnitude of change in the main macro variables using the same closure option, the predictions of the multi-sectoral CGE model are clearly more realistic and balanced.
O50|Financial Inclusion, Bank Concentration, and Firm Performance|This study focuses on the impact of financial inclusion and bank concentration on the performance of firms in developing and emerging countries. Using firm-level data for a sample of 55,596 firms in 79 countries, we find that financial inclusion, i.e., the distribution of financial services across firms, has a positive impact on firm growth. This positive impact is magnified when bank markets are less concentrated, a proxy for more competition among banks. We also find that more competitive banks favor firm growth only at high levels of financial inclusion, while bank concentration is particularly favorable to foreign and state-owned firms and increases firm growth at low levels of financial inclusion. In countries with limited financial deepening, the quality of the banking system (financial inclusion and bank competition) may be as important in promoting firm performance as its overall size.
O50|Which Institutions Promote Growth? Revisiting the Evidence|Recent research examining the growth impacts of institutions have found that institutions are important in fostering economic growth. By building a framework around the institutional taxonomy proposed by Rodrik (2005), our paper contributes to the literature in the following way. First, we confirm the result that “institutions matter” and show that dfferent types of institutions matter differently for growth. By applying a dynamic panel model, we find that market-creating and market-stabilizing institutions are important in fostering economic growth. We then extend this analysis and investigate whether countries at different levels of development could respond heterogeneously to changes in their institutional structure. We find that poor countries benefit the most from market creating institutions and institutions that support market stability. We also find some evidence that market legitimizing institutions such as “democracy” are not necessarily optimal for growth in poor countries. These results have important implications for countries that decide on the optimal strategy to improve their institutional framework.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
O50|What are the biggest obstacles to growth of SMEs in developing countries? – An empirical evidence from an enterprise survey|SMEs are drivers of economic growth and job creation in developing countries. It is paramount to determine the factors that hinder their growth. This paper uses the Enterprise Survey from the World Bank which covers data from 119 developing countries to investigate the biggest obstacles SMEs are confronting and the determinants that influence the obstacles as perceived by enterprise managers. The results show that SMEs perceive access to finance as the most significant obstacle which hinders their growth. The key determinants among firms' characteristics are size, age and growth rate of firms as well as the ownership of the firm. The latter – the role of the state in financing SME – is particularly intriguing. External reasons for the financing dilemma are also examined. It is shown that the main barriers to external financing are high costs of borrowing and a lack of consultant support.
O50|Do nations just get the inequality they deserve? The ‘Palma Ratio’ re-examined|"This paper aims to re-examine inequality in the current era of neo-liberal globalisation, with an emphasis on both highly unequal middle-income countries that have already implemented full-blown economic reforms (like Latin America and South Africa), and on OECD countries (like the US) now intent on replicating the inequality heights of the former. i) How do those middle-income countries end up having such unequal distributional outcomes? ii) Since oligarchies all over the world would gladly reproduce the same conditions, why until recently have only a few been able to get away with this degree of inequality? And iii) Why are there suddenly so many new entrants to the high-inequality club, especially from the OECD? In other words, how did Reagan and Thatcher and the fall of the Berlin Wall trigger a new process of ""reverse catching-up"", by which now it is the highly-unequal middle-income countries showing the advanced ones the shape of things to come? One might even argue that in the US not only is the 1% catching up with their Latin counterparts (who are used to appropriating between a quarter and a third of overall income), but that new developments such as Trump may be part of the same phenomenon: it is now the South that seems to show the North 'the image of their own future'. And regarding that future, it is tempting to say ""welcome to the Third World""! We are all indeed converging in this neo-liberal era but, somehow unexpectedly, this convergence is towards features that so far have characterised a number of middle-income countries - e.g. huge inequalities due to mobile élites creaming off the rewards of economic growth, and 'magic realist' politics (that may lack self-respect but not originality). I also discuss why Piketty's persistence with the neo-classical theory of factor shares - a pretty much obsolete 1950s-style approach to the distribution of income - prevents him from bringing our understanding of current distributive affairs forward as much as he might. His neo-classical analysis not only does not 'fit the facts' (he has to resort to questionable parameters), but also leads him into a methodology and social ontology that assumes that particularly complex and over-determined processes (like the distribution of income) are just the simple sum of their parts. Therefore, their account can be reduced to the algebraic description of individual constituents (e.g., inequality as basically an endogenous outcome of r>g - and that would be all). I also outline an alternative narrative regarding why inequality is becoming so extreme in formerly more enlightened affluent societies. I conclude that in order to understand current distributive dynamics what really matters is to comprehend the forces determining the share of the rich — and in terms of growth, what they choose to do with it!"
O50|Identification and Estimation of the Environmental Kuznets Curve: Pairwise Differencing to Deal with Nonlinearity and Nonstationarity|We propose an estimation strategy that accounts for two major problems raised in the empirical literature testing for the prevalence of the inverted U-shaped relation between environmental degradation and economic activity, namely the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. First, we use pairwise differencing to properly identify the income effect, and to make use of estimators that likely suffer less from heterogeneity, cross-sectional dependence, and other common factor problems. Second, we apply nonlinear-nonstationary parametric and non-parametric estimation techniques to estimate the pairwise differenced regressions, since panel unit root tests indicate that our income and emission series are integrated of order one. Our results for regional CO2 emissions systematically yield positive income effects while the estimated time effects do not compensate for these income effects sufficiently to generate an inverted U-shape for CO2 emissions.
O50|Population Aging and Inventive Activity|This research empirically establishes and theoretically motivates the hypothesis that population aging has a hump-shaped effect on inventive activity. We estimate this hump-shaped relationship in a panel of 33 OECD countries over the period 1960-2012. The increasing part of the hump captures the awareness that population aging requires inventive activity to guarantee current and future standards of living. The decreasing part reflects the tendency of aging societies to lose dynamism and the willingness to take risks. Policy-wise our analysis suggests that raising the awareness of individuals about the consequences of population aging may facilitate the adoption of strategies and policies encouraging inventive activity and economic growth.
O50|From fossil fuels to renewables: The role of electricity storage|Electricity storage represents a solution to curb carbon emissions by enabling more use of intermittent renewable energy. Our goal is to empirically analyze the determinants of innovation in electricity storage and its role in fostering technological innovations in renewable and conventional electricity generation. Using a global firm-level data set of electricity patents from 1963 to 2011, we find that better electricity storage promotes innovation not only in renewable energy but also in conventional technologies. Specifically, our estimates show that an additional storage patent increases the probability to apply for patents in renewable energy and efficiency-improving fossil fuel technologies two years from now by 1.09% and 0.65%, respectively. This implies that improved electricity storage technologies can boost the energy efficiency of conventional, fossil fuel-fired power plants as well as increase the use of renewable electricity. Thus, the ability of electricity storage to curb carbon emissions depends on: the competitiveness of renewable energy against conventional electricity generation, and conventional power generation mix as storage increases fossil-fuel efficiency and reduces ramping costs.
O50|Two Blades of Grass: The Impact of the Green Revolution|We examine the impact of the Green Revolution, defined as the diffusion of high-yielding crop varieties (HYVs), on aggregate economic outcomes in developing countries during the second half of the 20th century. We use time variation in the development and diffusion of HYVs of 10 major crops, and the spatial variation in agro-climatically suitability for growing them, to identify the causal effects of adoption. In a sample of 84 counties, we estimate that a 10 percentage points increase in HYV adoption increases GDP per capita by about 15 percent. This effect is fully accounted for by a combination of the direct effect on crop yields, factor adjustment in agriculture, and structural transformation. Our analysis also reveals that the Green Revolution reduced fertility and that the reduction was only partly offset by decreasing mortality rates. The net effect on population growth was therefore negative.
O50|Telecommunication externality on migration: Evidence from Chinese villages|We use a unique data set of Chinese villages to investigate whether access to telecommunications, in particular, landline phones, increases the likelihood of outmigration. By using regional and time variations in the installation of landline phones, our difference-in-difference estimation shows that the access to landline phones increases the ratio of out-migrant workers by 2 percentage points, or about 51% of the sample mean in China. The results remain robust to a battery of validity checks. Furthermore, landline phones affect outmigration through two channels: information access on job opportunities and especially timely contact with left-behind family members. Our findings underscore the positive migration externality of expanding telecommunications access in rural areas, especially in places where migration potential is large.
O50|Convergence in income distributions: Evidence from a panel of countries|There is growing evidence that countries' income distributions have changed significantly since globalization accelerated in the early 1990s. Using a large panel of Gini indices covering 81 countries between 1990 and 2010, we find strong evidence that inequality declined in nations that were initially highly unequal, while inequality increased in nations with initially low inequality. This pattern holds for both developed and developing countries, but developed countries' relative income distributions have converged at a more rapid pace. These findings are robust to the method of estimation, level of economic development, time horizon, data source or measure of inequality. Our results suggest that income distributions in countries are becoming increasingly unequal yet more similar to each other. Consequently, countries are beginning to coordinate their strategies to jointly reduce inequality through initiatives such as the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.
O50|The impact of government size on economic growth: A threshold analysis|We examine the nature of the relationship between government size and economic growth and identify the optimal level of government size using a large dataset through a novel and very general non-linear panel Generalized Method of Moments approach. We show that this relationship is statistically significant above and below the optimal level, even after splitting our sample to developed and developing countries. Finally, we find an asymmetric impact of government size on economic growth in both developed and developing countries around the estimated threshold.
O50|How did trade norms evolve in Scandinavia? Long-distance trade and social trust in the Viking age|As the saying goes, “it takes years to build up trust and only seconds to destroy it.” In this paper, we argue that this is indeed the case when explaining trust formation in Scandinavia. Hence, in an attempt to explain why the Scandinavian welfare states hold the highest social trust scores in the world today, we argue that one possible historical root of social trust may be the long-distance trade practices of the Viking age. To manage the risk of being cheated, trade between strangers in an oral world required a strong informal institution of trust-based trade norms out of necessity to deal with the risk of being cheated. In contrast to similar cases like the famous medieval Maghribi traders, who counted on writing (Greif, 1989), the punishment of cheaters could not be supported by written documents such as legal documents and letters, as the large majority of Vikings were non-literate. If a trader did not keep his word, social sanctioning by word of mouth was most likely the only method to discipline the cheater and prevent future free-rider behavior. The early rise of trust-based trade norms in Scandinavia is an overlooked factor in the region’s long-term socio-economic development and social trust accumulation. This result points to the importance of free trade today, especially in poor countries with low levels of economic development and high rates of non-literacy.
O50|Co-movement of international crude oil price and Indian stock market: Evidences from nonlinear cointegration tests|This article explores nonlinear cointegration between international crude oil price and Indian stock market in a multivariate framework for the period January 2, 2003 to July 29, 2011 by threshold cointegration tests which determine the structural breaks endogenously. The tests reject any long-run equilibrium relationship among the variables for the entire data span. In order to get better insight, threshold cointegration tests have been applied on three sub-phases; prior (phase I) and post (phase III) to most volatile phase (phase II) spanning from July 2, 2007 to Dec 29, 2008. The tests suggest existence of cointegration in phase III only. Toda–Yamamoto version of Granger causality tests reveals that movements of international crude oil price have impact on Indian stock market in phases II and III with no feedback effect. The findings also suggest that global crude oil price is exogenously determined.
O50|Foreign bank presence and business regulations|We examine the impact of foreign bank presence on a host countries’ business regulatory environment. We employ a panel dataset of 87 developing economies for the 1995–2013 period and measure the efficiency of business regulations using the indices from the Heritage and the Fraser datasets. Our results show that foreign bank presence exerts a positive impact on the efficiency of business regulations; however, we find no evidence in favor of a more pronounced positive effect when foreign banks originate from countries that have a more efficient business regulatory environment. Moreover, host countries’ administrative requirements and, particularly, bureaucracy costs benefit from a foreign bank presence; however, cost and time procedures to start a business do not.
O50|What works to improve the quality of student learning in developing countries?|We conducted a systematic review to identify policy interventions that improve education quality and student learning in developing countries. Relying on a theory of change typology, we highlight three main drivers of change of education quality: (1) supply-side capability interventions that operate through the provision of physical and human resources, and learning materials; (2) policies that through incentives seek to influence behaviour and intertemporal preferences of teachers, households, and students; (3) bottom-up and top-down participatory and community management interventions, which operate through decentralisation reforms, knowledge diffusion, and increased community participation in the management of education systems. Overall, our findings suggest that interventions are more effective at improving student performance and learning when social norms and intertemporal choices are factored in the design of education policies, and when two or more drivers of change are combined. Thus, supply-side interventions alone are less effective than when complemented by community participation or incentives that shift preferences and behaviours.
O50|Impact of economic, financial, and institutional factors on CO2 emissions: Evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa economies|Given the acceleration of economic changes in Sub-Saharan Africa economies (SSA), a better understanding of the relationship between economic growth and pollution is essential for policy makers. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of economic, financial and institutional developments on CO2 emissions for 25 SSA countries over the period 1996–2010. We use the reduced form modeling to control unobserved heterogeneity specific to countries and the GMM dynamic panel method to control endogeneity. We found no -evidence in our investigation for the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. Indeed, a monotonically increasing relationship with GDP is found more appropriate for CO2 emissions. The results confirm that political stability, government effectiveness, democracy, and control of corruption influence negatively CO2 emissions. On the contrary, regulatory quality and rule of law have a positive effect on CO2 emissions. The results confirm the importance of institutional frameworks in reducing carbon dioxide emissions since institutional quality not only affects carbon dioxide emissions directly, but also indirectly via economic growth and trade openness.
O50|Great ratios and international openness|The great ratios have been regularly used to calibrate the long-run properties of theoretical macroeconomic models; yet their stationarity is not supported by empirical studies unequivocally. This paper empirically tests whether the international openness governs the stationarity of the great ratios. By considering 21 OECD countries, our results show that the countries with relatively high openness are less likely to exhibit a balanced-growth-path equilibrium. By controlling for a potential endogeneity problem, the great ratios are less likely to be stationary if the economy runs a surplus trade balance.
O50|Manufacturing and economic development: The actuality of Kaldor's first and second laws|The objective of this paper is to evaluate the role of the manufacturing sector in the development process based on two laws of Kaldor. The first law states that the higher the growth of the manufacturing output, the more significant is the growth rate of the economy's product as a whole. The second law, known as the Kaldor–Verdoorn law, establishes a deterministic relation between the growth of manufacturing productivity and manufacturing output growth. This paper begins showing stylized facts of the production and exports of manufactured goods to show that these remain related to the income level of countries in recent years. Thereafter, a theoretical reflection on the importance of manufacturing in the process of economic development is performed, associating it to the manufacturing exports and to the exchange rate regime. Then, the paper performs a Kaldorian model systematization to assess the importance of manufacturing and its exports on the economic development. Econometric tests are performed based on a dynamic panel data for a sample of 63 middle and high-income countries, excluding major exporters of fuels for the period between 1990 and 2011, to analyze whether there is any difference in growth dynamics between these two groups. Estimates attest the occurrence of the two Kaldor laws, demonstrating that output growth in the manufacturing sector is essential to increasing economic growth and productivity, particularly in middle-income economies. The results also confirm that manufacturing exports are relevant to the development process and that the exchange rate contributes to this process in middle-income countries.
O50|Looking for a virtuous pattern of growth. Some insights for discussion|This paper addresses the current «manufacturing versus services» debate in relation to the question of how to unlock renewed economic growth, taking as point of departure the EC Communication For a European Industrial Renaissance. We present two criteria with which to evaluate the grounds for supporting economic sectors (either manufacturing or services): 1 The capacity to generate employment and 2 The ability to display a positive rate of productivity growth. The highly disaggregated PREDICT database is used in order to evaluate both sectors on these criteria. Our paper concludes that service sectors fulfil both of the above-mentioned criteria, whereas manufacturing sectors do not. The importance of service and manufacturing sub-sectors rooted in ICT and non-ICT R&D-intensive activities is also highlighted.
O50|An empirical analysis of bank concentration and monetary policy effectiveness|Purpose - Substantial research has been conducted on the direct effects of banking competition or lack thereof. However, little work has investigated how the market structure of banks can affect the transmission of monetary policy. The purpose of this paper is to investigate to what degree bank concentration dampens or enhances the response of manufacturing to monetary policy changes. Design/methodology/approach - To test how back concentration affects the transmission of monetary policy onto manufacturing value-added, the author regresses real value-added in manufacturing on bank concentration, monetary policy and the interaction of these two variables. The data set consists of a panel of 22 OECD countries across 59 manufacturing sectors from 1993 to 2005. Findings - The author finds that bank concentration has two distinct effects: growth in manufacturing is lower in countries with higher concentration and manufacturing is less responsive to monetary policy as well. A loosening of monetary policy by lowering interest rates has a significantly larger effect on growth in countries with lower banking concentration. Overall, a 1 per cent decrease in the monetary policy interest rate increases industrial growth by 0.049 per cent when the three-bank concentration ratio is equal to the sample average, but the same monetary policy change has roughly twice the effect if bank concentration is only 5 per cent lower, all else equal. Originality/value - The author is the first to measure how bank concentration alters the effectiveness of monetary policy using real economic activity as the output variable. The study is one of very few that has tied together inefficiencies created by bank concentration and the transmission of monetary policy.
O50|The visible hand: the role of government in China’s long-awaited industrial revolution| China is undergoing its long-awaited industrial revolution. There is no shortage of commentary and opinion on this dramatic period, but few have attempted to provide a coherent, in-depth, political-economic framework that explains the fundamental mechanisms behind China’s rapid industrialization. This article reviews the Embryonic Economic Development theory put forth by Wen (2016a). This article reviews the Embryonic Economic Development theory put forth by Wen . It illuminates the critical sequence of developmental stages since the reforms enacted by Deng Xiaoping in 1978: namely, small-scale commercialized agricultural production, proto-industrialization in the countryside, a formal industrial revolution based on mass production of labor-intensive light consumer goods, a sustainable ‘industrial trinity’ boom in energy/motive power/infrastructure, and a second industrial revolution involving the mass production of heavy industrial goods. This developmental sequence follows essentially the same pattern as Great Britain’s Industrial Revolution, despite sharp differences in political and institutional conditions. One of the key conclusions exemplified by China’s economic rise is that the extent of industrialization is limited by the extent of the market. One of the key strategies behind the creation and nurturing of a continually growing market in China is based on this premise: The free market is a public good that is very costly for nations to create and support. Market creation requires a powerful ‘mercantilist’ state and the correct sequence of developmental stages; China has been successfully accomplishing its industrialization through these stages, backed by measured, targeted reforms and direct participation from its central and local governments.

O50|Social development and ICT adoption. Developing world perspective|The process of technology diffusion is complex, and one should bear in mind that multiple both qualitative and quantitative elements may be claimed as its essential determinants. Insofar, voluminous theoretical and empirical literature has been issued where attempts of identification of the latter has been made. However, we still lack adequate explanations for cross-country differences in new technology adoption; while the demonstrated evidence is scattered and to a great extend it lacks robustness. Many claim that the speed of ICT diffusion is heavily predetermined of country`s economic achievements; while – in this perspective, high-income economies should faster adopt and use new technologies if compared to economically backward countries. This paper is designed to provide empirical evidence on the relationship between the process of ICT diffusion and social development across selected low-income and lower-middle-income countries during the period of 2000 and 2014. It main target it so identify whether in low-income and lower-middle-income economies, ICT development and social development (social empowerment) are correlated. It combines five logically structured sections. Section 1 is the introduction, while section 2 discusses literature review regarding ICT diffusion determinants. Next, section 3 briefly presents data used in the research and explains methodological framework. Finally section 4 demonstrates results of empirical analysis, and Section 5 concludes.
O50|Divergences In Competitiveness In Tourist Destinations In Baja California Sur , Divergencias De Competitividad En Destinos Turísticos De Baja California Su|Competitiveness is an important variable that keeps a place for an entity or over the competition. Evaluation and monitoring is needed to improve quality indicators and economic development. The tourism sector at the international and national level have developed methods of competitiveness that illustrate its application in the company, entities or countries. Mexico has achieved competitiveness by applying methodologies of the Technological Institute of Superior Studies of Monterrey, the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness and the Ministry of Tourism (SECTUR). The aim of this study was to apply a methodology that includes some dimensions of analysis proposed SECTUR to meet competitive challenges with a focus on destinations of Los Cabos, La Paz and Loreto for the period 2014. The results indicate divergences in competitiveness and existing productivity, which suggest areas of opportunity and improvement in the tourism sector of the State of Baja California Sur
O50|Ambient Air Pollution in China: Predicting a Turning Point|Abstract One of the most debatable questions among developmental economists and sinologists today is the question that deals with the time it would take China to reduce its current ambient air pollution levels to the levels acceptable by the World Health Organization. Some studies suggest that an increase in the standard of living would improve the environmental situation, a phenomenon that is termed the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). The objective of this study is to estimate the EKC and identify major factors leading to ambient air pollution in China during 2004–2013. We use time-series panel data in 27 provinces to estimate the variability in the levels of ambient air pollution as measured by particulate matter, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. Some policy implications are drawn.
O50|Cultural Dimension of Corruption: A Cross-Country Survey|Abstract This study investigates whether culture plays a major role in determining the corruption levels of countries. The cultural dimensions of Hofstede’s model and the worldwide level of corruption provided by the Corruption Perceptions Index were used. A cross-country survey of 98 countries was conducted using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. Three of the six main components of Hofstede’s model were found to have a significant influence on corruption, namely power distance, individualism-collectivism, and long- versus short-term orientation. National culture may explain the level of corruption in each of the countries. About half of the level of corruption in countries is explained by the national culture. Governments must acknowledge the role of culture in order to adopt the most appropriate policy decisions to fight corruption.
O50|Consumption Effects of Foreign Remittances in Jamaica|Abstract The term remittances refers to proceeds from the migration of labor that are sent to aid individuals remaining in the migrants’ home communities. In this paper, we investigate whether remittances alter the consumption pattern of recipient households in Jamaica. We present results from an Engel curve estimation specifically using the Working (1943) approach and a two-part fractional response model with instrumental variables to account for selection bias and endogeneity of remittances. The dependent variables are a subsample of the categories of consumption as defined in the Jamaican Survey of Living Conditions and include expenditures on food, schooling, health, gambling, alcohol and donations. We find that receipt of remittances significantly alters the recipient households’ expenditure allocations relative to other sources of income, although this effect occurs more through the participation decision. Overall, total effects of remittances are largest in the areas of luxury expenditures and home production, and to a lesser extent for education and grocery store purchases. These findings have significant implications for those remitting, those receiving, and governments looking to understand this large flow and less documented source of income.
O50|Genetic distance and cognitive human capital: a cross-national investigation|Abstract This paper explores the correlates of the intelligence quotient and cognitive ability by focusing on genetic distance to frontier nations. The results based on cross-sectional data from 167 countries suggest that genetic distance to global frontiers has a negative relationship with the employed human capital variables. Countries that are genetically far from leading nations tend to have lower levels of human capital with the negative correlation to the USA frontier averagely higher relative to the UK frontier. The sign is consistent and survives the control of macroeconomic, geographic, institutional and other covariates. Policy implications are discussed.
O50|Natural land productivity, cooperation and comparative development|Abstract This research advances the hypothesis that natural land productivity in the past, and its effect on the desirable level of cooperation in the agricultural sector, had a persistent effect on the evolution of social capital, the process of industrialization and comparative economic development across the globe. Exploiting exogenous sources of variations in land productivity across (a) countries; (b) individuals within a country, (c) migrants of different ancestry within a country, and (d) individuals residing in regions within a country, the research establishes that lower level of land productivity in the past is associated with more intense cooperation and higher levels of contemporary social capital and development.
O50|Models of university technology transfer: analyses and policies|Abstract Recent data on European countries show that innovation leaders perform better than economies with low levels of innovation investment and institutions that do not favor knowledge and technology transfer activities. This result confirms that to achieve a high level of performance, countries need a balanced innovation system performing well across all dimensions. More interestingly, the two most important indicators that have been driving increases in performance include new doctoral graduates and international scientific co-publications, that is, two channels of knowledge transfer from universities to firms. This special issue of the Journal of Technology Transfer is dedicated to the discussion of models of university technology transfer, mostly from a European perspective.
O50|De jure determinants of new firm formation: how the pillars of constitutions influence entrepreneurship|Abstract This paper provides empirical evidence supporting the view that constitutions are the primary and fundamental institutional determinant of entrepreneurship. It shows that some of the provisions contained in national constitutions are positively and significantly associated with a standard measure of entrepreneurial dynamics, namely the rate of new business density. Using for 115 countries a novel dataset containing the characteristics of the constitutions enacted in the world, applying an IV-GMM treatment to deal with the endogeneity of constitutional rules, and controlling for de facto variables, the paper finds that provisions about the right to conduct/establish a business, the right to strike, consumer protection, anti-corruption, and compulsory education promote higher rates of new firm formation. Contrasting results are instead obtained for provisions concerning protection of intellectual property rights.
O50|Parthasarathi Shome, The G20 Development Agenda: An Indian Perspective|In the aftermath of the global economic crisis during 2008-09, the group of 20 nations (G20) came together to implement a series of macro-economic and financial sector reforms to bring the world economy back on the path of stability. India, given its growing GDP and increased external sector orientation, became a crucial part of the group. Once the recovery process started since 2010, G20 moved on to adopt a series of development agendas, including provisions on food security, infrastructural augmentation, energy and environmental sustainability and so on. Given India’s unique position that allows coexistence of economic growth with livelihood challenges and considerations over environmental degradation, the new G20 development agendasmay significantly influence the country’sfuture policy choice and growth path. In this context, the recent volume edited by Shome is a well-structured and timely contribution to the literature, which analyses the G20 development agendas from an Indian perspective.
O50|Population Aging and Inventive Activity|This research empirically establishes and theoretically motivates the hypothesis that population aging has a hump-shaped effect on inventive activity. We estimate this hump-shaped relationship in a panel of 33 OECD countries over the period 1960-2012. The increasing part of the hump captures the awareness that population aging requires inventive activity to guarantee current and future standards of living. The decreasing part reflects the tendency of aging societies to lose dynamism and the willingness to take risks. Policy-wise our analysis suggests that raising the awareness of individuals about the consequences of population aging may facilitate the adoption of strategies and policies encouraging inventive activity and economic growth.
O50|Practical contribution for the assessment and monitoring of product market competition in the Portuguese Economy – estimation of price cost margins|This work project estimates price-cost margins for 163 Portuguese markets (defined at 3-digit level of CAE), with the aim of assessing the degree of product market competition. During the Economic and Financial Assistance Program of 2011-14, a set of product market reforms was implemented, with the objective of increasing competition in output markets. We provide a first assessment of the effectiveness of these reforms. We use Portuguese firm-level data to estimate price-cost margins, allowing for worker’s bargaining power. By then aggregating markets into sectors, our results allow us to conclude that the degree of competition did increase in most sectors
O50|Trends in the distribution of income between labor and capital: Factors, consequences and problems of adjustment|Inverse cyclical relations of trends in distribution of GDP between labor and capital components of value added (between compensation of employees, on the one hand, and gross operating surplus plus gross mixed income, on the other hand) to the trends in supply of labor and capital in the economy are elaborated in the article. Long waves and globalization influence on the economic policy of the USA and on personal income distribution in the country as well as economic, social and political consequences of such distribution are subjects of in-depth analysis. Adjustment of income distribution is presented in the article as a key problem to be solved by economics and form a part of the economic strategy adequate to the realities of the 21st century.
O50|The Challenge of Measuring Corporate Social Irresponsibility|In this paper, we develop a family of indexes to measure the social irresponsibility of firms. We define corporate social irresponsibility (CSIR) on the basis of firms' alleged involvement in human rights abuses. After a critical appraisal of the existing CSIR raw data and measures/indexes, we take a M-quantile regression approach to develop a family of CSIR indexes that overcome the limitations of existing measures. We apply our methodology to a sample of 380 large publicly-listed firms, observed over the period 2004-2012. Our analysis develops a family of CSIR indexes robust to firms' media exposure, size and industry specificities, and provides a measure of their accuracy..
O50|Drivers of Growth in Fast Emerging Economies: A Dynamic Instrumental Quantile Approach|This study complements the scarce literature on growth determinants in fast emerging economies of the BRICS and MINT by assessing the determinants throughout the conditional distributions of the growth rate and real GDP output for the period 2001-2011. An instrumenal variable (IV) quantile regression approach is complemented with Two-Stage-Least Squares and IV Least Absolute Deviations. The instrumentation process is dynamic. The following findings are established. First, while Gross FDI has a negative effect on economic growth, the impact of Net FDI is positive, with a higher magnitude in top quantiles of the distributions. Second, the positive effect of natural resources is more apparent in countries with low initial growth levels. Third, the impact of telecommunications infrastructure is not very significant. Fourth, whereas the incidence of bank credit is positive for GDP growth, it is negative for real GDP output. Fifth, while trade openness is positive in bottom quantiles of GDP growth, but for the highest quantile in real GDP output, it is consistently negative on real GDP output. Sixth, while the incidence of political stability is negative on GDP growth, it is positive on real GDP output, with the negative (positive) effect apparent only in top (bottom) quantiles of GDP growth (real GDP output). Policy implications are discussed.
O50|Is Poverty in the African DNA (Gene)?|A 2015 World Bank report on attainment of Millennium Development Goals concludes that the number of extremely poor has dropped substantially in all regions with the exception of Subâ€ Saharan Africa. We assess if poverty is in the African gene by revisiting the findings of Ashraf and Galor and reformulating the â€œOut of Africa Hypothesisâ€ into a â€œGenetic Diversity Hypothesisâ€ for a â€œWithin Africa Analysis.â€ We motivate this reformulation with five shortcomings largely drawn from the 2015 findings of the African Gerome Variation Project, notably: limitations in the conception of space, an African dummy in genetic diversity, linearity in migratory patterns, migratory origins and underpinnings of genetic diversity in Africa. Ashraf and Galor have concluded that crossâ€ country differences in development can be explained by genetic diversity in a Kuznets or inverted Uâ€ shaped pattern. Our results from an exclusive African perspective partially confirm the underlying hypothesis in a contemporary context, but not in the historical analysis. From a historical context, the nexus is Uâ€ shaped for migratory distance, mobility index and predicted diversity while for the contemporary analysis; it is hump shaped for ancestryâ€ adjusted predicted diversity. Hence from a withinâ€ Africa comparative standpoint, poverty is not in the African gene.
O50|Does regulatory discretion increase the unofficial economy? Evidence from panel data|One factor that contributes in the size of the shadow economy is the regulation of business activities. This paper provides empirical analysis of the effects of regulatory discretion on the unofficial economy. It adds to the previous findings by gathering evidence from a large data set of 162 countries for the 1999 to 2007 period. Going beyond simple correlation, it uses the Arellano-Bond estimator to investigate the dynamics and causal effects of regulation on the shadow economy. We find that increase in regulation increases the size of the shadow economy.
O50|Aid and growth: evidence from firm-level data|This paper explores the impact of foreign aid on firm growth for a panel of 4355 firms in 29 developing countries, 11 of which are in Africa. Using the World Bank Enterprise Surveys data and controlling for firm fixed effects, we find a positive impact of foreign aid on firms' sales growth. This result is robust to several checks, notably to the instrumentation of aid and to estimations on various sub-samples and on an extended cross-section sample of 93 countries. We then provide evidence that the positive effect of aid is especially strong for firms operating in sectors that are intensive in infrastructure and external finance, suggesting that aid may improve firm performance through the alleviation of infrastructure and financing constraints in developing countries.
O50|World Human Development: 1870–2007|" type=""main""> How has wellbeing evolved over time and across regions? How does the West compare to the Rest? What explains their differences? These questions are addressed using a historical index of human development. A sustained improvement in world wellbeing has taken place since 1870. The absolute gap between OECD and the Rest widened over time, but an incomplete catching up—largely explained by education—occurred between 1913 and 1970. As the health transition was achieved in the Rest, the contribution of life expectancy to human development improvement declined and the Rest fell behind in terms of longevity. Meanwhile, in the OECD, as longevity increased, healthy years expanded. A large variance in human development is noticeable in the Rest since 1970, with East Asia, Latin America, and North Africa catching up to the OECD, and Central and Eastern Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa falling behind."
O50|Economic Development As An Interrelation Between Wealth, Competitiveness, And Intellectual Capital - Empirical Evidences|The present article is based on the previous article that was published in The Procedia of Economics and Finance. This article proposes an index that measures the economic development by integrating national wealth, national competitiveness and intellectual capital in the same structure. There are used data from 40 developed, emerging and developing countries.
O50|Democracy and income: taking parameter heterogeneity and cross-country dependency into account|This paper investigates the relationship between income and democracy using common correlated effects (CCE) extended estimators which take into account the fact that democracy variables are highly correlated across countries and the possibility of heterogeneous effects of income on democracy in different countries. Using a wider database than ever, covering annual data from 1804 to 2010 for almost all countries, we show that overall, the effect of income on democracy is significantly negative when the time-series features of the data are taken into account, a result that comes from the low-income countries. This calls back into question the controversy about the empirical effect of income on democracy.
O50|Natural Experiments in Macroeconomics|A growing literature relies on natural experiments to establish causal effects in macroeconomics. In diverse applications, natural experiments have been used to verify underlying assumptions of conventional models, quantify specific model parameters, and identify mechanisms that have major effects on macroeconomic quantities but are absent from conventional models. We discuss and compare the use of natural experiments across these different applications and summarize what they have taught us about such diverse subjects as the validity of the Permanent Income Hypothesis, the size of the fiscal multiplier, and about the effects of institutions, social structure, and culture on economic growth. We also outline challenges for future work in each of these fields, give guidance for identifying useful natural experiments, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the approach.
O50|Foreign Fighters in Syria and Iraq and the socio-economic environment they faced at home: a comparison of European countries|The contribution looks at the gap in labour market and school outcomes between first and second generation migrants and non-migrants in European countries. It correlates these socio-economic data with the number of foreign fighters per million inhabitants. Far from offering a full, causal and micro-level model to understand the story completely, the contribution finds a clear and robust pattern across Europe.
O50|Financial Development, Financial Instability and Economic Growth: The Case of Maghreb Countries|The objective of this article consists in examining the interactions between the financial development, financial instability and economic growth in the Maghreb countries. The analysis covering the period of 1995-2013 relates to a sample of five countries of the region. By using the World Bank Data (2013) and the Heritage Foundation Data (2013), the panel vector autoregressive model estimation revealed that: (a) The financial development has positive effects on itself but a negative impact on the financial instability as well as a combined impact on the economic growth, (b) the financial instability has a negative impact on the financial development, a positive impact on itself and a combined effect on the economic growth, (c) The economic growth promotes the financial development and the financial instability; it has also a positive effect on itself, (d) finally, the financial liberalization in a less corrupt environment promotes the financial development.
O50|Oil-Growth Nexus in Oil Producing Countries: Macro Panel Evidence|The oil consumption-economic growth nexus is examined in a panel of oil producing countries over a long time span (1965-2012). Both, the ratio of oil production to primary energy consumption, i.e. oil self-sufficiency, and the persistence of the second structural oil shock were controlled for. The phenomenon of cross-sectional dependence that is present in the panel confirms that these countries share common spatial patterns, unobserved common factors, or both. The cointegration/long memory relationships as well as the panel data estimators’ appropriateness are analysed and discussed. A dynamic Driscoll-Kraay estimator, with fixed effects, was shown to be adequate to cope with the phenomena of heteroskedasticity, contemporaneous correlation, first order autocorrelation and cross-sectional dependence present in the panel. The results are consistent with the growth hypothesis, i.e. that oil consumption proves be a driver of economic growth. The second structural oil break (1979), reveals the long-lasting positive effect exerted by oil consumption on growth. The ratio of oil production to primary energy consumption has exerted a positive impact on growth. Thus, policymakers should take into account the benefits of promoting oil self-sufficiency, by reinforcing the use of endogenous resources.
O50|Risk Assessment in Construction Process in Nuclear Sector within the Central and Eastern Europe|This article assesses various risks arising within the process of building, running and decommissioning of nuclear units with the Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) where nuclear power is still perceived as a reliable and widely utilized energy source. The region is specific for its relations with Russia which is a dominant provider of technologies and fuel thanks to former ties between the region and the Soviet Union. The debate on building new nuclear producing units with Russian companies as potential contractors is thus echoing old concerns about the rise of Russian influence and one-sided dependency. The main conclusions are twofold. First, financing is the key issue to be addressed in order to conduct a successful project with current electricity prices undermining any new project not only in the region but also in Europe as a whole. Second, precise formulation of project documentation is crucial to avoid hidden costs, delays and potential disputes with contractors.

O50|Dinámica tecnológica internacional de los sectores productivos: un análisis empírico|Se propone una nueva metodología para evaluar las oportunidades de desarrollo económico asociadas a la presencia de las diversas industrias en la estructura económica de un país. Con tal propósito, se reinterpretan las herramientas de la literatura del “espacio de producto” a partir de conceptos neoschumpeterianos, procurando evaluar la sofisticación y transversalidad tecnológica de los sectores productivos, a objeto de caracterizar el actual paradigma tecnoproductivo y el papel de los diversos sectores en este. Mediante el trabajo con datos de exportaciones de 113 países y territorios en el período 2005-2009, se concluye que los “sectores clave” en la economía mundial son “Maquinaria Industrial”, “Instrumentos Científicos y Médicos” y “Farmacéutica”. Empero, los buenos resultados mostrados por sectores basados en tecnologías maduras sugieren la hipótesis de la sobrevivencia y superposición de sectores clave de diferentes etapas históricas —en una suerte de capas geológicas— debido a la persistencia de los sistemas tecnológicos previos.
O50|International technological dynamics in production sectors: An empirical analysis|A new methodology is proposed for evaluating the economic development opportunities associated with the different industries making up a country’s economic structure. To this end, neo-Schumpeterian concepts are used to reinterpret the tools afforded by the “product space” literature in an attempt to assess the technological pervasiveness and sophistication of different production sectors. The ultimate objective is to develop a description of today’s techno-productive paradigm and the differential role that the various sectors play in it. An analysis of export data from 113 countries and territories for 2005-2009 indicates that the key sectors in the world economy are: industrial machinery, scientific and medical instruments, and pharmaceuticals. The strong performance of sectors based on mature technologies suggests that key sectors originating in different stages in history can survive and overlap one another, much like geological strata, owing to the persistence of older technological systems.
O50|Exchange rate policy and export performance in a landlocked developing country: The case of Nepal|This paper examines the implications of Nepal's exchange rate policy for its export performance over the period 1980–2010. We first document Nepal's long-standing currency peg against the Indian rupee and that Nepal's real exchange rate appreciated substantially from the late 1990s. We then employ a gravity modeling approach to confirm that this real exchange rate appreciation has adversely affected Nepal's exports, especially to third-country markets. Nepal's exchange rate-related export competitiveness trap provides a motivation to reconsider the current peg.
O50|Lower bounds on inequality of opportunity and measurement error|I show that lower bound estimates of inequality of opportunity can have substantial measurement error, and that measurement error can vary considerably across samples. As a consequence, the traditional cross-country comparisons researchers make can be misleading.
O50|Productive energy use and economic growth: Energy, physical and human capital relationships|Ecological and biophysical economists and historians of economics consider that availability of energy inputs has played a key role in driving economic growth in industrialized and emerging economies. Nevertheless, being very sensitive to structural characteristics or stages of economic development, the strength of this link differs among countries. This study analyzes the role of energy in economic growth from a geographical standpoint by estimating an aggregate translog production function, with human and physical capital and productive energy use as production factors, within a growth framework. Panel data of 38 major countries for the period from 1995 to 2007 were used. The strength of the link between energy and growth is analyzed for the whole sample and the following relevant country groups: OECD, BRIC, NAFTA, East Asian, East European and EU15 countries. Obtained results show that the calculated productivity elasticities with respect to energy use are positive for all country groups. BRIC countries have higher elasticities, around 0.37, and EU15 countries have lower elasticities, around 0.12. Weak substitutability relationships between energy and capital are observed for all groups, except for BRIC and East European countries, which show complementarity relationships.
O50|The world trade network and the environment|This paper analyses the role of the world trade network on the environment. We rely on methods developed for social network analysis to identify the most important countries in connecting trade between all the other countries in the world trade network. We then estimate how the network or indirect effects from trade affect the environmental quality of a country. As the trade networks are endogenously determined by trade and environmental conditions, we use as instrumental variables the growth in the population of trade partners and the growth in the population of trade partners' partners to exploit exogenous variation in the world trade network. Once we simultaneously estimate the environmental, trade, income, and network equations using a three-stage least square procedure, we find that network effects harm the environmental quality of developed countries but improve the environment of developing countries.
O50|Terms of trade shocks and private savings in the developing countries|Economic agents in the developing countries are subject to tight credit constraints, which are more pronounced during bad state of nature. Thus, adverse shocks to commodity prices in the world market can force them to reduce savings by a larger amount than they would otherwise have. Empirical analysis using a dynamic GMM model and data from 45 developing countries confirm that most of the determinants of savings identified in the literature also apply to the developing countries. The transitory component in the terms of trade have a larger positive impact than the permanent component. This reflects the lack of access to foreign borrowing. Although the impact of terms of trade shocks is found to be asymmetric, the magnitude of the impact appears to be relatively small. Results show some differences in the response of savings in the three regions considered here. The results are, however, robust for alternative estimators and determinants.
O50|What underlies weak states? The role of terrain ruggedness|This article documents terrain ruggedness as an underlying cause of lack of state capacity. The paper contends that rugged topography poses significant costs to cooperation among the constituent groups within the state. This problem then translates into inability to commit to policies and under-provision of public goods, leading to such outcomes as poor protection of rule of law, limited tax revenue, civil violence, and ultimately, a weak state apparatus. Using several indicators capturing different dimensions of state capacity, the paper econometrically tests its argument in a sample of 187 independent countries and finds robust and clear evidence in favor of its reasoning. Further, the paper documents that delayed urbanization constitutes an important transmission mechanism for the significant role of terrain ruggedness in reduced state capacity.
O50|Minding Weber More Than Ever? The Impacts of State Capacity and Bureaucratic Autonomy on Development Goals|State capacity has attracted renewed interest over the last years, notably in the study of violent conflict. Yet, this concept is conceived differently depending on where the interest lies. In this article, we focus on bureaucratic autonomy as a distinct concept and discuss its connection to state capacity in detail. Using panel data over 1990–2010 and a novel indicator of autonomy, we estimate the separate effect of state capacity and bureaucratic autonomy on child mortality and tuberculosis prevalence. The evidence suggests that bureaucratic autonomy has a stronger impact than commonly used measures of state capacity or traditional macroeconomic variables.
O50|What does ‘‘entrepreneurship’’ data really show?|This book presents some of Zoltán J. Ács’ most important contributions since the turn of the the new millennium, with a particular intellectual focus on the knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship. This approach was shaped by three major events: the rapid globalization that occurred in the first decade of the 21st century; research on the role institutions have played in economic development during the past few decades; and the spread of entrepreneurial activity around the world following the collapse of communism at the end of the 20th century. This entrepreneurial activity has given rise to many questions of theory, measurement and policy.
O50|What does “entrepreneurship” data really show?|"We compare two ""entrepreneurship"" datasets: Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) captures early-stage entrepreneurship and World Bank Group Entrepreneurship Survey (WBGES) captures business registration. GEM data is higher in developing economies than WBGES data, but this reverses in developed countries. We find differences related to local institutional conditions, after controlling for economic development. A possible explanation is WBGES measures formal entry, whereas GEM measures intent. This can be interpreted as the spread between individuals who could potentially operate businesses in the formal sector - and those that actually do. Our findings suggest entrepreneurs in developed countries have greater ease and incentives to incorporate.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>"

Her ne kadar, her gösterge tek başına faydalı olsa da, genel makroekonomik performans düzeyini gösteren bileşik bir gösterge (endeks) araştırmacılara farklı hükümetlerin ve dönemlerin performanslarını kıyaslama ve sıralama olanağı verecektir. Bu çalışmanın temel amacı beş temel makroekonomik göstergeyi ─işsizlik oranı, büyüme hızı, cari işlemler dengesi, kamu bütçe dengesi ve enflasyon oranı─ kullanarak makroekonomik performans endeksi oluşturmak ve, çok partili dönemde (1950-2014), farklı siyasi ve yapısal evreleri analiz etmektir.
O50|Institutions and return predictability in oil-exporting countries|We study whether oil price changes have predictive power for stock market returns in oil-exporting countries, and we investigate the link between predictability and the quality of each country's institutions. Returns are predictable for half the countries we consider, and predictability is stronger when institutional quality is lower. We argue that the relation between predictability and institutional quality reflects the preference of countries with weaker institutions to consume oil windfalls locally rather than smooth out their impact by, for example, investing the proceeds internationally.
O50|The Middle Muddle: Conceptualizing and Measuring the Global Middle Class|Interest in the emergence of a global middle class has resulted in a number of attempts to identify and enumerate who belongs to it . Current research provides wildly different estimates about the size and evolution of the global middle class because of a lack of consensus on appropriate identification criteria for a person to be deemed to be middle class. We identify three competing and often conflated understandings in the literature on the subject. We further argue that for at least two of these understandings, the literature has been using inappropriate thresholds for identification. Using data from the Global Consumption and Income Project, we provide estimates of the size, composition and evolution of the global middle class for three competing understandings and contrast these to existing estimates.
O50|Paving the way for better telecom performance: Evidence from the telecommunication sector in MENA countries|Since the 1980s, developing countries started adopting telecom reforms due to pressures from international institutions. However, Middle East and North African (MENA) countries lagged in adopting such reforms. Even after introducing telecom reforms in the MENA region beginning in 1995, not all countries became better off in terms of various performance indicators. Therefore, this paper empirically assesses the effects of regulation, privatization and liberalization reforms, as well as their simultaneous presences, in the telecommunication sector on the sector's performance using a sample of 17 MENA countries for the period 1995-2010. We assume that different reforms are affected by institutional, political and economic variables with respect to the level of democracy, the legal origin, the natural resources rents per country and the year of independence from colonization. We correct for the endogeneity of telecom reforms, and we use IV-2SLS (Instrumental Variable-Two Stages Least Squares) estimation to analyze their effect on telecom performance in terms of access, productivity and affordability. We find that the privatization of the main incumbent operator and the fixed-line market's liberalization affect the sector's performance negatively in terms of fixed access and affordability. Moreover, we find that the simultaneous presence of an independent regulator and a privatized incumbent helps to eliminate the drawbacks on the sector performance resulting from privatization. However, the simultaneous presences of the other reforms in terms of regulation-competition and privatization-fixed competition do not help to improve the sector's performance
O50|Fuel for Economic Growth?|We set up an endogenous growth model in which the efficiency of both capital and fossil energy can be improved, whereas the efficiency of one alternative energy source is limited. With capital and energy as complements, there exist two steady states: one stagnant where energy is fully derived from the alternative energy source, and one with balanced growth where energy is fully sourced from fossil fuel. Heterogeneity in initial TFP levels can generate the Great Divergence. The demand for fossil fuel in technologically advanced countries drives up its price and makes fossil fuel too costly in less advanced countries that choose the alternative and stagnant energy input.
O50|Economic Potential Of Birding In Los Cabos Potencial Economico Del Aviturismo En Los Cabos|One of the most important ecotourism activities worldwide is birding. Mexico has great potential in birds, having more than 10% of species in the world, and its proximity to the United States, the largest emitter of birdwatchers (82,000 birdwatchers). However, this market is largely untapped, partly because of lack of knowledge, training and support both government and private. Baja California Sur has about 434 species. However there are no local companies dedicated to birdwatching. In this sense, the objective was to analyze the tourist potential of birding in Los Cabos, highlighting its features and the development of recommendations for this tourist destination.

O50|Calculating a Country’s Capital Input: A Review, and Calculations for the Turkish Capital Stock|This paper reviews the topic of calculating the capital input for a country, and calculates it for Turkey for the 1987-2013 period. The Turkish stock of machinery and equipment (henceforth equipment) is estimated roughly at around half of GDP in terms of value, while the stock of structures (i.e., homes, offices, industrial and mining structures, roads, bridges, etc.) at around 1.5 times GDP. The aggregate capital input is calculated by combining those two stocks according to their contributions to production rather than just their sizes. Since the depreciation rate is much higher for equipment than for structures, the marginal user cost (and therefore the marginal product) should be higher for equipment. The previous literature on the Turkish capital stock ignores this difference, implicitly putting too little weight on the highly cyclical equipment stock, which leads to an understatement of the cyclical variation in the capital input by about 40 percent.
O50|On the price elasticity of demand for trademarks|This paper provides econometric estimates of the fee elasticity of demand for international trademarks. The analysis focuses on monthly trademark applications submitted to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). The elasticity ranges from -0.31 to -0.42, which is in a similar range to the fee elasticity of demand for patents.
O50|Input-Output Networks and Growth Performances across Countries|This paper investigates the relationship between economic growth performances of countries and their structural input-output network characteristics. We employ a new centrality measure developed by Blöchl et al. (2011) for directed networks with self-loops to determine sectoral heterogeneities in IO tables of 33 OECD countries over the period 1995-2011. Relating the gini indices of these centrality measures to output growth reveals that countries with less heterogenous IO networks tend to grow faster. Such finding implies a key role for the inter-linkages across sectors in economic growth, and underlines the importance of designation of sectoral policy measures to counteract heterogeneity of IO networks.
O50|Does Democracy Promote The Rule Of Law?|Recent studies find that democracy increases economic growth but often do not address through what channels such an effect could travel. This study considers whether or not democracy strengthens the rule of law, an institutional measure purported to increase economic growth. Utilizing a panel dataset from 1984 to 2007 for 127 countries and both fixed effect and dynamic GMM methodologies, we examine whether democracy promotes the rule of law. We generally find a short run positive influence upon the rule of law although effects are greatest for low income countries.
O50|Income Inequality, State Ownership, and the Pattern of Economic Growth – A Tale of the Kuznets Curve for China since 1978|The lack of supposed trickle-down benefits for industrialization to reduce income inequality during China’s 30 years of post-reform economic growth appears to constitute an anomaly for the inverted U-shaped Kuznets curve hypothesis. Using an alternative inequality measure that depends on factor share and ownership, we show that in a transition economy with the state weight of capital less than its market counterpart, enhanced state ownership exacerbates inequality. Econometric evidence suggests that although the government attempts to balance the three goals of growth, equality, and state ownership in the short run, stubborn state ownership as well as lopsided growth patterns jeopardize equality in the long run and have therefore delayed the turning point in the inverted U-shaped Kuznets curve for China.

O50|Oil rents and economic growth in oil producing countries: evidence from a macro panel|In this paper, new approaches are taken to explore two new dimensions of the oil growth nexus that are relevant when focusing on oil producing countries. Based on panel regressions, we regress per capita income on the ratio of oil production to primary energy consumption and oil rents per capita, adding control variables and exploring a relationship analysis within a multivariate oil-growth nexus framework. The per capita oil consumption-economic growth nexus is examined in a panel of oil producing countries over a long time span (1970–2012), controlling for the exports of goods and services, the ratio of oil production to primary energy consumption, the oil rents, and international crude oil prices. The phenomenon of cross-sectional dependence that is present in the panel confirms that these countries share common spatial patterns, unobserved common factors, or both. The cointegration/long memory relationships, as well as the panel data estimators’ appropriateness, are both analysed and discussed. A dynamic Driscoll-Kraay estimator, with fixed effects, is shown to be adequate to cope with the phenomena of heteroskedasticity, contemporaneous correlation, first order autocorrelation and cross-sectional dependence, present in the panel. Oil consumption drives economic growth, but only on the short-run. The ratio of oil production to primary energy consumption has exerted a positive impact on growth in both the short- and long-run. Oil prices only exert a positive effect on growth in the short-run. Oil rents depress growth in both the short- and long-run, suggesting that it is more a curse than a blessing for the economies.

O50|The Effects of Child Mortality Changes on Two Income Groups and Macroeconomics|This study considers uncertainty about the number of surviving children. Under prohibition of child labor, a higher survival probability of a child can increase opportunities for education investment as the fertility rate declines with a temporary increase in the number of surviving children. However, per capita GDP may decrease until the start of education investment. When people accumulate their human capital, the effect of an increase in the survival probability would be ambiguous. By applying panel estimation, we examine economic development with the effect of child mortality on the fertility rate and number of surviving children.

We assume that different reforms are affected by institutional, political and economic variables with respect to the level of democracy, the legal origin, the natural resources rents per country and the year of independence from colonization. We correct for the endogeneity of telecom reforms, and we use IV-2SLS (Instrumental Variable-Two Stages Least Squares) estimation to analyze their effect on telecom performance in terms of access, productivity and affordability. We find that the privatization of the main incumbent operator and the fixed-line market's liberalization affect the sector's performance negatively in terms of fixed access and affordability. Moreover, we find that the simultaneous presence of an independent regulator and a privatized incumbent helps to eliminate the drawbacks on the sector performance resulting from privatization. However, the simultaneous presences of the other reforms in terms of regulation-competition and privatization-fixed competition do not help to improve the sector's performance.
O50|Factors explaining emerging economies’ growth slowdown|Over the past decade, emerging market economies have staged a period of impressive growth, boosting their share in world GDP. In recent years, however, growth in emerging markets has slowed substantially and is projected to remain sluggish for the foreseeable future. The aim of the article is to highlight several structural factors that can explain this synchronised slowdown. The article focuses on four structural factors that have already had an impact on the economic performance of emerging economies. These include the rebalancing of growth in China, with significant spillover effects on other emerging market as well as advanced economies ; the recent slump in commodity prices ; an excessive build-up of private sector leverage in Central and Eastern European countries in the run-up to the crisis and changing trends in global value chains. The article continues by looking at two factors that will play out in the more medium term, i.e. the middle-income trap – a sustained period of low growth following a period of high growth, largely attributable to a slowdown in productivity growth – and the gradual disappearance of the demographic dividend in some emerging market countries.
O50|Is the External Labor Migration an Economic Growth Factor: Econometric Analysis and Policy Implications for the CIS Countries|Recent intensification of CIS countries instability has led to an intensification of migration flows in the post-soviet space. By providing multidirectional impact on the various growth factors, migration may both accelerate the development of specific countries and slow it down. The paper determines the issue of receiving higher benefit from these processes - either labor-exporting (the countries of Central Asia, Ukraine) or labor-importing countries (Russia). Using international organizations databases and the instrumental variables regression methodology we confirmed the hypothesis that in general in the long term for developing labor-exporting countries high level of labor migration constrains economic growth, although there may occur contrary situation at certain development conditions. The calculated threshold value for labor migrant remittances defines the value that inversely changes the impact of migration process on economic growth. We estimated elasticity coefficients of economic growth for certain countries of Central Asia. We defined practical recommendations to increase economic growth inclusivity of these countries by providing special economic measures, such as accelerating development of small industrial businesses and creating large numbers of new sustainable jobs.
O50|Do que é feito um país campeão? Análise empírica de determinantes sociais e econômicos para o sucesso olímpico [What makes a country a champion? Empirical analysis of social and economic determinants for Olympic success]|This paper analyzes the social, economic and political determinants of Olympic success in post-war games. To this end, a panel data regression with fixed effects, using a sample of 102 countries for the years 1960 to 2012 was employed. The dependent variables used were: the sum of medals won by a country in a given edition of the Olympics and the total gold medals earned by a nation. The results obtained show that the most significant determinants for these variables are the GDP per capita, the autocracy level, the average total years of study and whether the country is hosting the Olympics.
O50|The Relationship Between Novelty-Seeking Traits and Comparative Economic Development|This paper suggests a theoretical framework and provides empirical evidence for a hump-shaped relationship between the fraction of novelty-seeking traits in society and current levels of per capita income. The hypothesis is that novelty-seeking traits produce two countervailing effects on aggregate productivity and hence economic development. The beneficial effect consists in explorative knowledge acquisition, which contributes significantly to the process of economic development. The detrimental effect results from a certain amount of this knowledge not being used reliably for capital accumulation due to the high fraction of individuals engaged in exploration rather than in production. One main conclusion of the empirical analysis is that the high fraction of novelty-seeking individuals in society engaged in short-run explorative knowledge acquisition prevent permanent settlement and therefore act as an obstacle to the development of centralized states, which are a precursor to modern industrial production.
O50|Financial Crises, Development, and Growth: A Long-term Perspective|Observed over long periods, the upward path of the output of most economies occasionally takes jagged steps down. More often than not, these events are associated with a variety of crises, including systemic banking stresses, exchange rate crashes, a burst of inflation, and a restructuring or default on sovereign debt. Using a large panel of countries over a long period, we document that crises are typically associated with lower medium-term growth. That may be a direct causal channel, a reverse channel, or the influence of some other factors on both growth and finance. But they tend to go together. Given that the forces for convergence of income across countries are estimated to be slow, going off track around a crisis will likely have long-lived consequences for relative economic development.
O50|An Overview of Millennials’ Coming of Age. The Emergence of Generation Y and its Underlying and Consequential Socio-Economic Aspects|With numbers approaching the mark of 100 millions worldwide, Generation Y (also known as the Millennials) is the fastest growing segment of today’s workforce. But they are also demanding consumers reshaping the marketplace through a unique set of values and characteristics deeply embedded in this generational cohort’s ethos. As a result, everybody in the business world is trying to better understand them, whether it’s from an inside-out perspective as in „How can we better serve our clients?”, or the vice versa - „How can we continuously motivate our employees?”. This paper aims at picturing the key aspects defining Generation Y, the underlying factors leading to their new reality and foreseeable economic consequences across the field.
O50|Comparative Analysis Of Innovative Activity Determinants In Selected Sme’S In Brazil And Poland. Results Of Empirical Researches|The basic goal of this article is an attempt to conduct comparative analysis of innovation determinants in companies of small and medium enterprises sector in Brazil and Poland. The comparison shall enable evaluation which determinants stimulate and which are barriers to innovativeness development in the SME sector in the researched countries. Additionally, such comparison shall indicate if and in what way the economical potentials, cultural differences and different historical conditions of the economic development of the researched countries influence the determinants of the innovative activity of the SME sector. The Authors put forward the following research hypothesis: H1: The determinants forming the innovative potential are similar for Brazilian and Polish companies of SME sector. In order to examine the hypothesis, the Authors have browsed the world literature on the subject of innovative actions determinants in companies with a special consideration of SME sector companies, they have presented the present condition of innovativeness in SME sector companies in Brazil and Poland (an Internet questionnaire has been used in the research) and they have conducted own empirical researches on the determinants influencing the innovativeness level. The received results have been subject to basic statistical comparative analysis and on this basis with the logical induction the Authors have made conclusions on the determinants of innovative activity in researched companies. The article includes the results of all the empirical researches conducted by the Authors in the years 2009-2013 and generally available data considering the innovativeness level in the researched countries.
O50|Human resources, physical resources and economic development: A foundation of human resource economics|Despite numerous studies on production inputs, such labour and capital, there is still a lack of systematic analysis on the crucial interaction between the human resources (HR) and physical resources (PR) in the process of economic development. Thus, the current paper aims to describe how these production resources would jointly determine the dynamics process of economic development. This holistic role of the HR in the economic development can be a foundation for the human resource economics.
O50|Government Debt and Economic Growth: Estimating the Debt Thresholds and Debt Intolerance|The surge of government debt during the post-global financial crisis and the ongoing euro zone sovereign debt crisis has begun raising concerns whether government debt levels have hit the tipping points. This study offers to contribute in the following ways: First, we find out whether the relationship between government debt and real GDP growth is weak for debt/GDP ratios below 90%. Second, we estimate different thresholds for groups of economies based on their debt regimes, political economy structures and types of political governance, geographical considerations, and income levels. Third, we find out whether there is a declining negative effect beyond the debt threshold. Our results find the debt thresholds to vary in the range of 84 to 114 percent of GDP. We estimate that every additional 10 percent rise in debt-to-GDP ratio beyond the debt threshold costs 10 to 30 basis points of annual average real GDP growth. We find that different groups of countries experience debt threshold at different levels. Debt thresholds are dependent not necessarily on economic factors alone, but on other factors such as political economies and governance structures, geographies etc. Debt thresholds are sensitive to horizon of analysis.
O50|Government Debt and Economic Growth – Decomposing the Cause and Effect Relationship|The rising government debt levels in the aftermath of global financial crisis and the ongoing euro zone debt crisis have necessitated the revival of the academic and policy debate on the impact of growing debt levels on growth. This study provides a data–rich analysis of the dynamics of government debt and economic growth for a longer period (1960–2009). It spans across different debt regimes and involves a worldwide sample of countries that is more representative than that of studies confined to advanced countries. This study observes a negative relationship between government debt and growth. The point estimates of the range of econometric specifications suggest a 10-percentage point increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio is associated with 23 basis point reduction in average growth. Our results establish the nonlinear relationship between debt and growth. Further, by employing panel vector auto regressions (PVAR) approach, this study decomposes the cause and effect relationship between debt and growth and offers an answer to the question – Does high debt lead to low growth or low growth leads to high debt? The results derived from the impulse–response functions and variance decomposition show the evidence of long-term effect of debt on economic growth. The results indicate that the effect is not uniform for all countries, but depends mostly on the debt regimes and other important macroeconomic variables like; inflation, trade openness, general government final consumption expenditure and foreign direct investment.
O50|Government Debt and its Macroeconomic Determinants – An Empirical Investigation|In the context of rising government debt levels in advanced economies and the ongoing euro zone debt crisis, there has been a revival of academic and policy debate on the impact of growing government debt on economic growth. This data-rich study offers an econometric investigation of the macroeconomic determinants of government debt and answers the much-debated question – What factors influence the government debt in a sovereign country? The study provides analyses for economy groupings, political governance groupings and income groupings of countries in addition to the full sample. Panel Granger causality testing is employed to establish causality running from the determinants of debt. The results of the full sample analysis reveal that real GDP growth, foreign direct investment, government expenditure, inflation and population growth have negative effect on debt. Gross fixed capital formation, final consumption expenditure, and trade openness have positive effect on debt. The results for different country groupings bring out some interesting implications.
O50|Defining Country Size: A Descriptive Analysis of Small and Large States|This paper defines the size of 215 countries using population and land area dimension. The statistical technique of cluster analysis was used to identify the groups of states that share the same characteristics of population and land area, and 83 countries were classified as small. From the descriptive analysis small size does not imply lower economic development/performance compared to large states. However, the economies of small states are more vulnerable. Proximity to developed markets, degree of economic freedom and openness to foreign markets were identified as the main factors explaining differences in economic performance among small states.
O50|Drivers of Growth in Fast Emerging Economies: A Dynamic Instrumental Quantile Approach|This study complements the scarce literature on growth determinants in fast emerging economies of the BRICS and MINT by assessing the determinants throughout the conditional distributions of the growth rate and real GDP output for the period 2001-2011. An instrumenal variable (IV) quantile regression approach is complemented with Two-Stage-Least Squares and IV Least Absolute Deviations. The instrumentation process is dynamic. The following findings are established. First, while Gross FDI has a negative effect on economic growth, the impact of Net FDI is positive, with a higher magnitude in top quantiles of the distributions. Second, the positive effect of natural resources is more apparent in countries with low initial growth levels. Third, the impact of telecommunications infrastructure is not very significant. Fourth, whereas the incidence of bank credit is positive for GDP growth, it is negative for real GDP output. Fifth, while trade openness is positive in bottom quantiles of GDP growth, but for the highest quantile in real GDP output, it is consistently negative on real GDP output. Sixth, while the incidence of political stability is negative on GDP growth, it is positive on real GDP output, with the negative (positive) effect apparent only in top (bottom) quantiles of GDP growth (real GDP output). Policy implications are discussed.
O50|On the link between real exchange rate misalignment and growth: theory and empirical evidence|This paper analyzes the effect of real exchange rate (RER) on economic growth both theoretically and empirically. The first part builds an endogenous growth model which illustrates that an RER appreciation reduces the growth rate in the centralized and decentralized economies. Additionally, the model shows that taxes have a negative effect on growth. The second part employs the new Cross-Sectionally Augmented Distributed Lag Estimator to empirically study the impact of RER misalignment on economic growth. The results demonstrate that RER misalignment acts harmfully on growth. Thus corroborating what we found theoretically. The empirical findings also confirm the adverse effect of taxes on growth. The negative impact of RER misalignment on growth are maintained when we use alternative measurements of RER misalignment and subsamples of developed and developing countries. Finally, we discovered that very large misalignments have even greater damaging impacts on growth.
O50|Economic stratification - The remedy and demise of humanity|The paper shows that the world economic stratification, as well as that of all natural, social and political systems is a natural law and a prerequisite for progress. Stratification itself may mean, however, both the remedy, but also the demise of systems, by exacerbating social inequalities. The database includes the evolution of gross domestic product per capita for different time frames at European level and worldwide. The main methods employed in processing database are the indices method and expectation values of position (quartile values) used to assess the structure of Europe and world countries according to the size of the gross domestic product. In Europe, for a century, stratification has increased visibly. If in 1913, the richest country in Europe achieved a GDP per capita of 3.94 times higher compared to the poorest country, in 2013 the ratio is 13.82 to one. The status of key statistical indicators that characterize the polarization of the world by size of gross domestic product, demonstrates that stratification is less pronounced inside continents, becoming however severe, worldwide. In this regard, it is alarming that in 1994, 75% of world countries were making only 7% of the GDP per capita in the richest country (Monaco). Given that information has now become increasingly more fluid, one can include among beneficiaries, the least developed countries. Circulation of information is, however, under the command of polarizing forces, belonging to the same great powers of the world. In this way, by means of more refined methods, the benefits of progress preserve world hierarchies.
O50|Testing the Relationships between Energy Consumption, CO2 emissions and Economic Growth in 24 African Countries: a Panel ARDL Approach|This study complements existing literature by examining the nexus between energy consumption (EC), CO2 emissions (CE) and economic growth (GDP) in 24 African countries using a panel ARDL approach. The following findings are established. First, there is a long run relationship between EC, CE and GDP. Second, a long term effect from CE to GDP and EC is apparent, with reciprocal paths. Third, the error correction mechanisms are consistently stable. However, in cases of disequilibrium only EC can be significantly adjusted to its long run relationship. Fourth, there is a long-run causality running from GDP and CE to EC. Fifth, we find causality running from either CE or both CE and EC to GDP and inverse causal paths are observable. Causality from EC to GDP is not strong, which supports the conservative hypothesis. Sixth, the causal direction from EC to GDP remains unobservable in the short term. By contrast, the opposite path is observable. There are also no short-run causalities from GDP, or EC, or EC and GDP to EC. Policy implications are discussed.
O50|La Distribución de la Productividad Mundial: Convergencia y Divergencia en el Periodo de la Posguerra|En el periodo de la posguerra se han visto cambios sustanciales en la productividad laboral en el mundo. Este artículo documenta cuatro hechos estilizados sobre la distribución de la productividad mundial. Primero, existe una disparidad enorme y creciente entre las colas de la distribución. Segundo, ésta disparidad incrementó rápidamente en la década de 1980, se desaceleró en la siguiente década, y finalmente se estabilizó a mediados de los años 2000. Tercero, existe substancial movilidad de países hacia adelante y hacia atrás. Cuarto, la cola superior es más sensible a mejoras en capital humano, mientras que la cola inferior es más sensible a mejoras en tecnología. El artículo termina señalando que, por lo menos en el futuro más cercano, la distribución productividad mundial podría seguir siendo caracterizada por divergencia en los países más cercanos a la cola inferior, y convergencia y adelantamiento en los países más cercanos a la cola superior.
O50|Agricultural (Dis)Incentives and Food Security: Is There a Link?|Using the World Bank database “Distortions to agricultural incentives,” this paper analyzes the impact that agricultural (dis)incentives have on food security for a wide sample of countries over the 1990–2010 period. We adopt a continuous treatment approach applying generalized propensity score matching to reduce potential biases stemming from differences in observed country characteristics. The results provide strong evidence of self-selection and heterogeneous food security impacts at different levels of policy intensity. Estimates of the dose-response functions show that both discrimination against agriculture and large support for it lead to poor performance in the availability, access, and utilization dimensions of food security.
O50|Corruption perception, income level and growth in post-communist countries: evidence from panel data|In this paper we use the corruption augmented Mankiw-Romer-Weil theoretical framework to study the empirical relationship between corruption perception, the level of per capita income and the rate of growth in post-communist countries. Our empirical study is based on the country-level panel data for 27 post-communist countries during the period 1994–2013. Our estimation results show that corruption perception is negatively related both to the level of per capita income and the rate of economic growth. However, only the relationship between corruption perception and the level of per capita income is statistically significant.
O50|Orta Gelir Tuzağı ve Türkiye'nin Konumu Açısından Bir Değerlendirme|The issue investigated in this paper is quite important on the grounds that Turkey is mentioned among the countries in middle income trap and it is challenging to overcome this trap. The quality of the workforce, and accordingly workforce’s relatively low wage profile, economic policy and structural factors are selected as explanatory variables. In this paper, the issue is discussed in details in the context of explanatory variables by examining the strategic moves of the selected countries and appropriate road map is tried to be drawn.
O50|Orta Gelir Tuzağında Türkiye: 2023|The aim of this study is to search the ways for Turkey to overcome the middle-income trap. The main problem of developing countries is that growth rate gets stationary after a certain level. Some measures can be taken to prevent the economy from remaining stagnant. This study focuses on the causes of the middle-income trap and the ways to overcome this trap. Besides, a comparison between Turkey and other developing countries is made with the help of descriptive analysis.
O50|In Search of a Strategy for Making Growth More Pro-Poor in the Philippines|Despite the large and expanding literature on pro-poor growth, quantitative studies identifying potential determinants of pro-poor growth remain scarce. This paper addresses this lacuna in the literature for the case of the Philippines. The main driver of rural poverty reduction has shifted from agricultural to non-agricultural growth in the Philippines, but agricultural investments can be still effective in areas with underdeveloped infrastructure. Non-agricultural income growth, on the other hand, can be made more pro-poor by reducing child mortality, facilitating international labor migration, investing in roads, and reducing income inequality. © 2015 The Earth Institute at Columbia University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
O50|A Measure of Distance and Social Polarization: Political and Historical Roots|We propose a distance measure between religions or other social groups which is based on historical interactions between them. In particular we assume that ruling people from another group drives a wedge between the ruling and ruled groups. Our measure allows for discounting of earlier historical interactions. The measure satisfies the distance axioms. Building on an existing literature on polarization, we use our distance to define an index polarization. We illustrate our index using data on historical religious ruling relations, and current religious composition of countries. The index can be useful for researchers studying conflict and growth.
O50|The Impact of Social Beliefs on Microfinance Performance| We apply a panel of 331 microfinance institutions from 37 countries to investigate the relationship between social beliefs and microfinance financial performance over the period of 2003–2011. We find that microfinance institutions in countries with higher levels of trust and more collectivist culture have lower operating and default costs and charge lower interest rates. These results provide the first large cross‐country evidence that social beliefs are important determinants of microfinance performance. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
O50|Creating the Environment for Entrepreneurship through Economic Freedom|In this paper we argue that the ability of people to freely trade, enter into contracts, and start businesses in a system of private property and the rule of law is crucial for productive entrepreneurship. One measure of how freely individuals can engage in economic activity is the Economic Freedom of the World (EFW) index. After examining the economic policies that harm economic freedom and possibly entrepreneurship, we highlight the correspondence between economic freedom and a number of measures of entrepreneurship. We conclude with some thoughts regarding future research involving economic freedom and entrepreneurship.
O50|Income Inequality, TFP, and Human Capital|A fruitful recent theoretical literature has related human capital and technological development with income (and wages) inequality. However, empirical assessments on the relationship are still scarce. We relate human capital and total factor productivity (TFP) with inequality and discover that, when countries are assumed as heterogeneous and dependent cross-sections, human capital is the most robust determinant of inequality, contributing to increase inequality, as predicted by theory. There is evidence of great heterogeneity on the eﬀects of TFP and Openness across countries. These new empirical results open a wide avenue for theoretical research on the country-speciﬁc features conditioning the causal relationship from human capital, technology and trade to inequality.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
O50|The Out of Africa Hypothesis of Comparative Development Reflected by Nighttime Light Intensity|This research establishes that migratory distance from the cradle of anatomically modern humans in East Africa and its effect on the distribution of genetic diversity across countries has a hump-shaped effect on nighttime light intensity per capita as observed by satellites, reflecting the trade-off between the beneficial and the detrimental effects of diversity on productivity. The finding lends further credence to the hypothesis that a significant portion of the variation in the standard of living across the globe can be attributed to factors that were determined in the distant past.
O50|On the World Productivity Distribution: Recent Convergence and Divergence Patterns|The post-World War II period has seen substantial changes in labor productivity around the world. Motivated by these changes, this article documents four facts about the world productivity distribution. First, there is a large and increasing disparity between the tails. Second, this disparity rapidly increased in the mid-1980s, slowed down in the next decade, and stabilized in the mid-2000s. Third, overtime, there has been substantial forward and backward mobility of countries and regions. Fourth, the upper tail of the distribution is more sensitive to improvements in human capital, while the lower tail is more sensitive to improvements in efficiency.

O50|Soil biota as a natural resource for the restoration of degraded chernozems|The role of biota as a natural resource for the restoration of degraded chernozems of the Republic of Moldova is under discussion till nowadays. The status of biota of old-arable chernozems in conditions of the green manure applications has been evaluated statistically. Two experimental sites located in the central and southern zone of the Republic of Moldova have been tested by soil biological indicators during 2010-2012. The application of vetch as a green manure had created conditions for the improvement of the biota’s vital activity in chernozems which had been degraded as a result of a long-term arable use. The number of invertebrates increased from 48.1-55.0 to 71.6 - 78.0 ex m-2, the number of Lumbricidae family – from 25.6-38.0 to 43.3-68.0 ex m-2. The effect of green manure was manifested in the increase of share of Lumbricidae family in the total number of invertebrates by 12.1-20.8 %. The microbial biomass content in the arable layer of soils rose up in average by 1.4-1.5 times. The humification processes intensified as a result of the interaction between the fresh organic matter and the soil biota. Biological parameters did not reach the level of soils under natural vegetation. Management with the green manuring for the biota’s restoration of degraded soils and for the improvement of soil quality and environment has been recommended.
O50|Κρίση, Σύγχρονος Καπιταλισμός Και Ταξικές Ανακατατάξεις<BR>[Economic Crisis, Modern Capitalism and Class Realliances]|The economic crisis that inflicted Greece is international in character and its cause is in the decreasing profitability of capital which from a certain point onwards leads to the stagnation of profits, discourages new investment, reduces production and increases unemployment. If these are combined with the large public debt and the austerity economic policies that were pursued before and after the advent of the Troika, we may explain the vehemence with which the crisis affected the Greek economy. The crisis may also lead to new class realliances and furthermore show the direction and the requirements for the contemplation of an alternative economic policy.
O50|Are there Asymmetric Causal Relationships between Tourism and Economic Growth in a Panel of G-7 Countries?|The aim of this paper is to analyse the relationship between tourism activity and economic performance for G-7 countries. This paper attempts to answer two questions. Firstly, it will look at whether economic growth causes increased tourism activity for Italy, Canada, Japan, France, the UK, the US and Germany. Secondly and most importantly, the paper will address the question of whether increased tourism activity causes economic growth for these countries. That is, the authors aim to examine whether the tourism led hypothesis is valid for any of these countries. This is done by applying the asymmetric panel causality test suggested by Hatemi-J (2011) to these countries for the period 1995-2012. This approach is an attempt to find out which tourism shocks, negative or positive, have a greater impact on economic performance and which of the GDP shocks have a greater impact on tourism activity for each country. The results show that there is a causal relationship between tourism activity and economic growth, with GDP actively causing tourism activity for Canada, Germany, France, Italy and Japan. In this case, Canada and Germany are the only two countries where a symmetric causal relationship is found. More importantly, the results further show that tourism activity causes GDP growth for Germany, France, Italy and US. Germany, France, and the US, however, are the only three countries where a symmetric causal relationship is found. Further, one could conclude that the TLGH is not valid for G-7 countries given that positive tourism activity shocks do not lead to positive economic output shocks for any of the countries.
O50|Metals and Engineering Vision 2025|Abstract European metals end engineering industry has managed to keep its position in global competition. Germany has become the leading manufacturer of machines and equipment. Metals and engineering products are used in nearly all industries and businesses, and especially due to emerging economy growth the demand outlook is favourable. New materials, new production methods, like additive manufacturing, and new moving power solutions improve the products’ raw material and energy efficiency. Increasing application of information and communication technology raises the effectiveness of production and products. Thanks to automation and robotics machines can be substituted for human labour in inconvenient and hazardous environments. Industrial internet creates new business opportunities.
O50|Do Exchange Rate Regimes Matter for Economic Growth? - I regimi dei tassi di cambio influenzano la crescita economica?|The implications of exchange rate regimes on economic growth have received renewed attention in the aftermath of the recent global financial crisis. Creating both bivariate and tripartite regime classifications the present study examines their impact on growth for 156 nations spanning the period 1999-2012. Using several robustness checks including de facto measures of regime flexibility, I find fixed regimes lower growth in the full sample, advanced and low income countries as well as in Africa, South America, and North Central Americas and the Caribbean. On the other hand intermediate regimes promote growth in emerging markets and in the Asian continent. - Le implicazioni dei regimi dei tassi di cambio sulla crescita economica sono ritornati ad essere oggetto di analisi. Adottando una articolata classificazione dei regimi dei tassi di cambio questo lavoro ne esamina l’impatto sulla crescita per 156 paesi nel periodo 1999-2012. Controllando la robustezza dei modelli, comprese alcune misure de facto di flessibilità del regime di cambio, i risultati evidenziano che i regimi di cambi fissi rallentano la crescita, sia nei paesi ad economia avanzata che in quelli a basso reddito, ed anche in Africa, Sud America, Nord e Centro America e Caraibi. Regimi intermedi invece hanno promosso la crescita nei mercati emergenti e nei paesi asiatici.
O50|Do government private subsidies crowd out entrepreneurship?|Although several studies have found a negative relationship between government spending and entrepreneurship, much debate remains regarding the components of government spending responsible for this association. We contribute to the literature by specifically exploring the relationship between government private subsidies and entrepreneurship. By combining macro-economic government spending data with individual level entrepreneurship data, we find a negative association between the share of private subsidies and entrepreneurship. However, findings are less straightforward when we delve deeper into the components of private subsidies and its association with different kinds of entrepreneurship.
O50|The link between economic growth and growth volatility|This paper investigates the relationship between economic growth and growth volatility through simultaneous equations system. By employing the identification through heteroskedasticity method of Rigobon (Rev Econ Stat 85:777–792, 2003 ) and using a panel of 158 countries over the period 1960–2010, we find that output volatility is detrimental to economic growth, suggesting that stabilization policies to mitigate short-run economic fluctuations contribute to long-run economic growth. And economic growth accelerates output variability, supporting the feedback effects from growth to the volatility. The evidence is robust to a number of sensitivity tests.

O50|Structural modernisation and development traps. An empirical approach|This paper explores the relationship between trajectories of structural modernisation and the ability of countries to escape poverty and middle-income traps. The analysis is based on a newly created index of structural modernisation. For each country, the index calculates the productivity gap with respect to the world frontier in activities that typically represent the modern sector of the economy, and weights this relative productivity by the employment share of those activities in the total labour force. The index is calculated for 114 countries from 1960 to 2014. A country is defined as trapped if it takes longer than a benchmark period to move from one income category to another. The analysis shows that expansion of the size of the modern sector without a process of absorption of technology for reducing the technology gap is not enough to ensure steady growth. Inversely, reducing the technology gap in just few sectors will produce an enclave economy that is doomed to stagnate.
O50|Access to electricity and socio-economic characteristics: panel data evidence from 31 countries|The case study literature on access to electricity highlighted a number of socio-economic variables linked to it. The purpose of our research is to check whether these variables also show up in panel data/cross-country regressions and to assess their relative strength. Our results support the widespread belief that electrification plans in developing countries should target rural areas and extensively rely on renewable energy sources. They should also be accompanied by measures fostering human capital accumulation and the involvement of local population. These general results need to be gauged within each country's specific context, carefully considering its own complexities. Therefore, our results complement, rather than substitute the available case study literature.
O50|Economic growth and crime against small and medium sized enterprises in developing economies|Several studies have explored the relationship between economy-level crime rates or individual-level crime and economic growth. However, few studies have examined the relationship between economic growth and crime against firms. Using data for about 12,000 firms in 27 developing countries this study finds that economic growth is negatively associated with crime. This relationship is stronger for small and medium firms than large firms. The study also explores several economy-wide factors and their influence on the growth–crime relationship for small and medium enterprises. The results are robust to various sensitivity checks.

O50|Capital and Income Inequality: Some Facts and Some Puzzles (Update of WP 12/28 published in October 2012)|Using a broad number of indicators from an updated data set on human capital inequality for 146 countries from 1950 to 2010, this paper documents several facts regarding the evolution of income and human capital inequality. The main findings reveal that, in spite of a large reduction in human capital inequality around the world driven by a decline in the number of illiterates of several hundreds of millions of people, the inequality in the distribution of income has hardly changed. In many regions, the income Gini coefficient in 1960 was very similar to that in 2005. Therefore, improvements in literacy are not a sufficient condition to reduce income inequality, even though they improve life standards of people at the bottom of the income distribution. Increasing returns to education, external effects on wages of higher literacy rates or the simultaneous concurrence of other exogenous forces (e.g., globalization or skill-biased technological progress) may explain the lack of correlation between the evolution of income andeducation inequality.
O50|Higher Education’S Contribution Into Economic Performance And Innovativeness Of Latvia: Exploratory Research|A detailed investigation of higher education’s contribution to economicnperformance and innovativeness inLatvia is necessary because of contradictory facts in the socio-economic reality of Latvian higher education. Despite the fact that investment in theLatvian higher education system results in high participation, the economic and innovation returns, i.e., the profitability of the resulting highly educated labour force, are low. The analysis of the literature has shown that there are other factors that determine higher education’s contribution to economic performance and innovativeness and enable highly skilled specialists to potentially turn their knowledge into innovation and national income; e.g., the quality of higher education and the level of technological development in business. We conducted an empirical analysis of a set of indicators that are potentially significant to economic performance and innovativeness, and concluded that, first, higher education’s contribution to economic performance and innovativeness differs depending on the stage of the country’s economic development; and second, that a country’s ability to attract and retain talented people becomes more significant at each stage of economic development. In Latvia both theability to attract and retain talented people and the level of technological development are poorly developed,which results in low economic and innovative returnsfroma relatively large number of highly skilled specialists.
O50|Economic Growth in Developing Countries: Is Landlockedness Destiny?|" type=""main"" xml:id=""ecpa12096-abs-0001""> This paper examines the determinants of economic growth in developing countries within the standard growth regression framework, with special attention being paid to the experience of landlocked developing countries (LLDCs). The results confirm that the landlockedness hampers economic growth, but the magnitude of negative impact is sensitive to alternative estimation methods. However, the analysis suggests that good governance, trade openness and coordinating infrastructure development with neighbours explain the significant aspect of the inter-country differences in growth rates among LLDCs. The results also suggest that African landlocked countries are not different from the other LLDCs. Contrary to the “resource curse” hypothesis, natural resources seem to contribute to economic growth of LLDCs."
O50|State history and economic development: evidence from six millennia|Abstract The presence of a state is one of the most reliable historical predictors of social and economic development. In this article, we complete the coding of an extant indicator of state presence from 3500 BCE forward for almost all but the smallest countries of the world today. We outline a theoretical framework where accumulated state experience increases aggregate productivity in individual countries but where newer or relatively inexperienced states can reach a higher productivity maximum by learning from the experience of older states. The predicted pattern of comparative development is tested in an empirical analysis where we introduce our extended state history variable. Our key finding is that the current level of economic development across countries has a hump-shaped relationship with accumulated state history.
O50|Has the income share of the middle and upper-middle been stable over time, or is its current homogeneity across the world the outcome of a process of convergence? The 'Palma Ratio' revisited|"In an article published in Development and Change in 2011, I suggested an alternative measure of inequality to the Gini - a ""19th Century statistic"" - which has subsequently become known as the ´Palma Ratio'. In this new article, I revisit the argument for such a measure. Using new data, I examine whether the current remarkable homogeneity in the income share of the middle and upper-middle around the world - the foundation of the so-called 'Palma Ratio' - is an historically stable stylised fact, or whether it is a new phenomenon, the outcome of a process of convergence towards the current '50/50 Rule' (a state of affairs in which half of the population in each country located within deciles 5 to 9 tends to appropriate about 50 per cent of the national income). Although partly written in response to a comment on my 2011 paper, this article has evolved to become a further attempt at contributing to the literature on inequality and the statistics to measure it. As in my 2011 paper, in this one I also conclude that if we want to understand why inequality is so unequal across the world we have little choice but to keep reminding ourselves of what I believe to be the most crucial of all distributional stylisedfacts (highlighted by the sub-title of that article): ""The share of the rich is what it's all about."" The logic of the 'Palma Ratio' is precisely to emphasise this fact - as well as to draw attention to the increasingly artificial (i.e., self-constructed) foundations of growing inequality (as opposed to Piketty, I believe that 'r' is currently so much greater than 'g' as a direct result of human agency, and not as a supposed inevitable outcome of the workings of the invisible hand…). And if one not only wants to understand why inequality is so unequal across the world, but also get closer to understanding why growth is also so diverse, what we should write in our noticeboards is: ""It's all about the share of the rich, and what they do with it"". This is particularly important to understand if we really want to do something about inequality (and growth), because as someone rightly said long ago, philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point now is to change it."
O50|Income Inequality and Technological Adoption| We relate technological adoption (of different technologies) with income inequality. In the process, we discover that some technologies, such as aviation, cell phones, electric production, internet, telephone, and TV, are skill-complementary in raising inequality. We construct standardized indexes of skill-complementary technological adoption for modern information and communication technologies (ICT), older ICT, production and transport technologies. We find strong evidence that older ICT and transport technologies (and less frequently modern ICT) tend to increase inequality. Additionally, we discover that results are much stronger in rich countries than in poor ones. Our results are quite robust to a series of changes in specifications, estimators, samples, and measurement of technology adoption. These results may bring insights into the design of incentive schemes for technology adoption.
