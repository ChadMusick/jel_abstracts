D29|Technology heterogeneity in European industries' energy efficiency performance. The role of climate, greenhouse gases, path dependence and energy mix|Assessment of industrial-level energy efficiency development is a critical research topic that has infiltrated in the global battle against climate change. A balanced panel of fourteen European industries from twenty-four countries for the period 1995-2011 is introduced into a metafrontier framework. Reflecting the divergent views on the importance of desirable and undesirable outcomes in the pursuit of energy efficiency, the proposed approach estimate industrial performance by prioritizing either economic or environmental criterion incorporating technological heterogeneity. It is found that small-scale economies exhibit persistent high energy efficiency scores. Regarding energy efficiency determinants, path dependence phenomena have a strong presence, climate characteristics occurs, while energy mix displays linear but also non-linear relationships. Finally, regardless of the method employed, there is a strong evidence of conditional and unconditional convergence.
D29|Police Patrols and Crime|An influential literature has used the aftermath of terrorist attacks to estimate large effects of police street deployment on crime. However, the elasticities obtained in these settings may not easily extrapolate to more standard circumstances. This paper exploits a natural experiment that aimed to increase police presence in more than 6,000 well-defined areas, by economically-realistic amounts and under relatively normal circumstances. Using data transmitted by GPS devices worn by police officers, we first document exogenous and discontinuous changes in patrolling intensity. We do not find that these increases in patrolling were accompanied by corresponding decreases in crime. The standard errors are small enough to reject relatively small elasticities. We discuss and empirically evaluate explanations for our findings.
D29|The Origins of the Division of Labor in Pre-modern Times|This research explores the historical roots of the division of labor in pre-modern societies. It advances the hypothesis and establishes empirically that intra-ethnic diversity had a positive effect on the division of labor across ethnicities in the pre-modern era. Exploiting a variety of identification strategies and a novel ethnic level dataset combining geocoded ethnographic, linguistic and genetic data, it establishes that higher levels of intra-ethnic diversity were conducive to economic specialization in the pre-modern era. The findings are robust to a host of geographical, institutional, cultural and historical confounders, and suggest that variation in intra-ethnic diversity is the main predictor of the division of labor in pre-modern times.
D29|Managing Strategic Change and ERP Implementation under Distinctive Learning Styles: Quantitative case of Burberry PLC|This paper examines the effective strategic change management and Enterprise Resource Planning implementation under distinctive learning styles namely; diverging, converging, assembling, and accommodating learning styles through case of Burberry brand at Bicester Village, Cheshire Oaks, and Chatham Place. Additionally, paper investigates the strategic changes and organizational factors in relation with the ability to adopt change and successful ERP implementation. Total 87 respondents were approached through snowball, purposive, and convenience sampling. Findings revealed that accommodating learning style is the most influential learning style that significant positively affects the ERP implementation process. Interestingly, all learning styles (diverging, converging, assimilating, and accommodating) have statistically significant correlation with organizational change process. Additionally, complexity is the most critical organizational component affecting employees' ability to accept changes.
D29|Trust and signals in workplace organization: evidence from job autonomy differentials between immigrant groups|While much work has considered trust’s effect on workplace organization, particularly the granting of job autonomy, this relationship remains essentially a black box, lacking insight on the deeper process underlying employers’ ultimate trust or autonomy decision. I seek to unpack the trust-organization nexus, focusing on the role of employers’ inferences about employees’ trustworthiness. Integrating extant literatures, I posit that employers use group membership—and specific group-level traits—as an observable signal concerning individual employees’ trustworthiness and decide how much autonomy to grant to employees that have similar observable individual-level qualities but belong to different, easily recognizable social groups. Empirical analysis of job autonomy differentials between groups of migrants with different ethnonational identities reveals systematic patterns of variation that cannot be explained on the basis of observable employee traits alone. Hence, the evidence strongly supports the signalling value of group membership, demonstrating an important real-world feature of trust governing workplace organization.
D29|A New Approach In Quality Function Deployment And It?S Application|In today?s world it is necessary to ensure sustainable development. Quality Function Deployment model is a dynamic model that can help to achieve this objective. Quality Function Deployment model has been widely used in the manufacturing industry and its use in the services industry is also felt these days. The literature available on the model generally presents the conceptual framework of the model. The authors have attempted to present through this paper the computations involved in reaching to the solution of the QFD model by way of a toy problem. The paper outlines computations for Goal, Raw weight and Priority scores. By knowing their values the practitioners can take judicious decisions regarding product design, quality improvement, market competition, etc.
D29|Unemployment and online labor|Online labor markets experienced a rapid growth in recent years. They allow for long-distance transactions and offer workers access to a potentially 'global' pool of labor demand. As such, they bear the potential to act as a substitute for shrinking local income opportunities. Using detailed U.S. data from a large online labor platform for microtasks, we study how local unemployment affects participation and work intensity online. We find that, at the extensive margin, an increase in commuting zone level unemployment is associated with more individuals joining the platform and becoming active in fulfilling tasks. At the intensive margin, our results show that with higher unemployment rates, online labor supply becomes more elastic. These results are driven by a decrease of the reservation wage during standard working hours. Finally, the effects are transient and do not translate to a permanent increase in platform participation by incumbent users. Our findings highlight that many workers consider online labor markets as a substitute to offline work for generating income, especially in periods of low local labor demand. However, the evidence also suggests that, despite their potential to attract workers, online markets for microtasks are currently not viable as a long run alternative for most workers.
D29|Exploring the Impact of ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 Certification on Financial Performance: The Case of Companies listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange|The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 certification on the financial performance of Romanian companies listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange (BSE). Based on audited financial statements of a population of 67 non-financial companies listed during 2013-2015 and using regression models, this paper shows, for the first time in Romania, that companies listed on BSE, implementing complex management systems (quality – environmental and/or occupational health and safety) perform better, and that their performance is directly linked to the complexity of the management systems implemented.
D29|Productivity and the Allocation of Skills|We use linked employer-employee data from 2004–2012, combined with individual qualifications data from 1994–2012, to study how graduates with different skills fare in the labour market in the six years after studying. We find that graduates experience improvements in earnings, and that they systematically move between jobs, industries and locations in a pattern that is consistent with their securing better job matches, particularly for high level STEM graduates. We then estimate joint production function and wage equations to see how the skill composition of a firm’s employees correlates with productivity, and compare this with how the skill composition correlates with its wage bill. Our results suggest that degree graduates make a growing positive contribution to production in the six years after graduation, with associated wage growth. There is variation in relative productivity and wages across groups of graduates that differ by field of study and level of qualification.
D29|An integrated dataset of Italian firms: 2005-2014|In this paper we describe the steps followed to build a new dataset covering the universe of active private non-financial firms in Italy between 2005 and 2014. The construction of the dataset is the outcome of a collaboration between the Bank of Italy and the Italian National Statistical Agency and made use of statistical, administrative and fiscal sources. The dataset, that contains information on firms’ location, legal form, date of incorporation, industry classification, employed persons, turnover and value added, is suitable for studying the evolution of the Italian productive sectors since the mid-2000s.
D29|Public Policy As A Tool For Floriculture Development In The Municipality Of Tepetlixpa Mexico State, Politica Publica Como Herramienta De Desarrollo Para La Floricultura Del Municipio De Tepetlixpa Estado De Mexico|One problem facing the flower industry in Mexico, is a low linkage between government sectors responsible for supporting resources to producers. There are shortcomings in the management, dissemination and application of various types of programs that provide financial resources. These programs include national, state and municipal development at the federal level, the public body responsible for implementation is the Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural development, Fisheries and Food (SAGARPA). Such support programs must be permeated by t federal, state and municipal government with the intention of promoting the development of the region. This paper examines these government programs
D29|Why do manufacturing firms produce services? Evidence for the servitization paradox in Belgium|The increasing role of services in GDP results from the growing share of service industries, but also from the fact that firms produce services along with goods. This paper investigates the determinants of service provision by manufacturing firms. First, it develops a model of differentiated products with, on the demand side, complementarities between the firm’s goods and services, and, on the supply side, rivalry in the allocation of expertise between the production of goods and the provision of services. Second, it provides an econometric assessment of the determinants of servitization for manufacturing firms, using a fractional Probit model with heterogeneity, controlling for endogeneity with respect to unobserved firm characteristics. Both the theoretical model and empirical estimates point to a non-linear relationship between servitization and firm productivity. The relationship is further shaped by the sector environment as well as intrinsic characteristics of the goods and services supplied.
D29|Reproduction Structure and Technological Progress in Economy: The Role of Talents as Capital|"Human activities in concrete production are diversified from product manufacturing, service production to management technology. Technological progress is organized into such various human activities. This paper is written on our “Talents capital hypothesis”, after surveying the genealogy of economic thought since Smith, and, carefully examining the theoretical basis of the hypothesis. The concept “Talents capital” comprehensively captures the human activities. The hypothesis is that realistic technological progress should be based on qualitative development of ""Talents capital"", that is, accumulation and succession of production-related knowledge and technology, embodied in workers group (=personal owner of individual enterprises as well as employee (including corporate officer) in general enterprises) ."
D29|Managing Change and Strategic Thinking: Evidences from Hospitality and Tourism Sector of the UK|This qualitative paper examines the strategic thinking and managing change in complex business environment in the hospitality and tourism sector of the UK through the cases of Hilton London Canary Wharf and Hilton London Tower Bridge. For the purpose of analysis, researchers explored the research phenomenon under different models including TALC model and IBTEE Model. Using convenience sampling, researchers interviewed face-to-face 12 Line Managers and 30 employees through open-ended semi-structured interview questions regarding change management process and obstacles interlinked with it. Findings revealed that although Hilton hotels have adapted changes to some extent but there is still more room for further improvement. The management of the selected hotels highly relies on the training purpose for the effective change adaption whereas coaching and research is lagging behind. The biggest constraint during effective change adaption is the diverse background of the workforce as most are from the multicultural backgrounds. Moreover, the communication, ritual, and cultural barriers are causing issues in the change process. Lastly, the recommendations are given for consolidating effective change management at workplace.
D29|Economic downturn and volunteering: Do economic crises affect content generation on Wikipedia?|In this paper, we address the impact of surging unemployment on online public good provision. Specifically, we ask how drastically increased unemployment affects voluntary contributions of content to the online encyclopedia Wikipedia. We put together a monthly country-level data set, which combines country specific economic outcomes with data on contributions to the online encyclopedia. As a source of exogenous variation in the economic state we use the fact that European countries were affected by the financial crisis in the US in September 2008 with different intensity. For European countries, we find that the economic downturn is associated with more viewership, which channels higher participation of volunteers in Wikipedia expressed in editing activity and content growth. We provide evidence for increased information search online or online learning as a potential channel of the change in public goods provision, which is a potentially important side effect of economic downturn.
D29|Does Wikipedia matter? The effect of Wikipedia on tourist choices|We document a causal influence of online user-generated information on realworld economic outcomes. In particular, we conduct a randomized field experiment to test whether additional information on Wikipedia about cities affects tourists' choices of overnight visits. Our treatment of adding information to Wikipedia increases overnight visits by 9% during the tourist season. The impact comes mostly from improving the shorter and incomplete pages in Wikipedia.
D29|Mobile applications and access to private data: The supply side of the Android ecosystem|"We analyze the data collection strategies of 65,000 developers in the market for mobile applications and track 300,000 applications over four years. Many apps belong to developers with multiple apps. This fact generates variation in the privacy behaviors of the same developer for our analysis. We uncover three stylized facts: First, developers ""learn"" to use increasingly intrusive data strategies as they become more experienced. Second, intrusive data collection is most likely in apps that target the 13+, and 16+ age category, which raises concerns for the protection of young app consumers. Third, even within developers, critical and atypical permissions predict problematic usage of private user data most successfully. Our findings inform both regulators and scientists who wish to model supply in the market for mobile apps."
D29|In brief... Rapid response policing: the impact on crime detection|Rapid response policing not only boosts crime detection but also reduces the time it takes to find the offenders. That is the central finding of analysis of data from the Greater Manchester Police by Jordi Blanes i Vidal and Tom Kirchmaier. Their research examines whether it is worth police officers aiming to get to the scene of a crime as soon as possible after being alerted by a member of the public. They find that faster response times make it more likely that victims or witnesses will name a suspect. In contrast, longer response times reduce the likelihood of crimes being detected, especially thefts and robbery.
D29|The Efficiency Of Differentiated Learning - Independent Learning Situations Versus Collaborative Learning|Current Romanian education emphasizes pupil group action in learning situations frontal organized, independently or in micro-groups. Thus, differentiated learning suffers, because it requires an individualized learning, and not just individual; there is necessary to alternate the organizing forms of learning situations, so they to produce progress in pupils’ learning. Using the method of the experiment, the undertaken research project has studied the impact of organizing individual learning situations compared to harmonizing the organizing forms of cooperative learning on pupil achievement in primary education. The experiential research sample consisted of 2 teachers and 56 pupils of class II. The control group comprised a class of 27 pupils, who have carried on an individual learning activity. The experiential group comprised 29 pupils who have carried out an activity based on the harmonizing different organizing forms of collaborationlearning. In the final assessment test, the results obtained by pupils confirmed the research hypothesis, demonstrating that in order to efficiently achieve the differentiated learning there is required a combination of organizing forms of learning and a stimulus for pupils’ collaborationwhich to increase their motivation for learning.
D29|Economics of leadership and hierarchy|This paper explores leadership within hierarchical organizations. For each hierarchy, I consider a dynamic signaling game in which each player observes only the actions of his direct superiors before choosing his action. At the top of the hierarchy are the leaders, who learn the state from nature. The hierarchy controls the flow of information and the timing of the game, and determines the equilibrium output and welfare. I show that the welfare-optimal hierarchy is the chain, because it maximizes the incentive of players to “lead by example” for their subordinates. The chain remains optimal even in the presence of verifiable or unverifiable costly information acquisition by the leaders.
D29|The effect of charitable giving on workers’ performance: Experimental evidence|We investigate how donating worker earnings for voluntary extra work, a form of corporate social responsibility, affects worker behavior. Participants entered data for 60minutes, with piece-rate pay. They could then stay for up to another 30minutes; we varied the piece-rate pay and whether it was paid to the worker or to charity. When this piece-rate is high, workers produce more for own pay than when their earnings go to charity. However, with low piece-rates, this relationship reverses. There is also little difference in performance between paying workers a small amount and not paying anything at all.
D29|Explaining Estimated Economies of Scale and Scope in Higher Education: A Meta-Regression Analysis|Abstract Numerous studies have investigated economies of scale and scope in higher education as a means of providing public and private providers of college and university teaching, research and other services and their stakeholders with knowledge of the cost structures that underpin provision in this economically and socially important sector. However, debate continues on the precise nature of the economies of scale and scope in higher education given the mixed findings, largely because of significant institutional and other differences across studies. To address this, we employ meta-regression analysis to explore not only the overall level of scale and scope economies across more than 40 international studies conducted in Australia, the US, the UK, Italy, China, and elsewhere since the early 1980s, but also those factors that potentially affect their presence in the higher education sector. Our findings suggest that functional form and allowances for managerial efficiency have a significant impact on the estimated scale economies. In contrast, for scope economies, the key discriminating factors appear to be when the analysis was conducted, the diversity of the sample, and the national level of economic development.
D29|Institutional Thickness Revisited| Over the last two decades, the notion of institutional thickness has become a key reference for a large body of work that has sought to provide profound insights into the link between institutions and regional development. However, only few attempts have been made to reassess the concept, to improve its methodology, and to reflect on its empirical application. The aim of this article is to revise the original concept of institutional thickness. We draw on and seek to contribute to current work in economic geography and related disciplines on the role of organizations and institutions in regional development. We identify some crucial limitations and provide suggestions for how they can be addressed. It is argued that much can be gained by (1) explicitly elaborating on the relation between the organizational and institutional dimensions of thickness, (2) moving beyond overly static views on thickness, (3) developing a multiscalar approach to thickness, and (4) identifying features for assessing thickness in absolute and relative terms.
D29|Industrial Enterprises' Innovation Efficiency And The Influence Of Capital Source: Based On Statistical Data Of Industrial Enterprises In Jiangsu Province|This study chooses industrial enterprises with great innovative capacity and above a designated size in Jiangsu as the research object to examine the real mechanism of their innovative activities. We apply the DEA model to calculate the technical efficiency, technical progress, and total factor productivity (TFP) of industrial enterprises from 1999 to 2009, finding that technical progress is the most significant factor in increasing TFP. In order to ensure the efficient flow of capital and labor, the empirical results of this study provide useful evidence to promote the industry frontier technical progress and to improve the average efficiency level.
D29|The Formalization of a Generic Trading Company Model Using Software Agents as Active Elements|Business environment simulation often requires unique knowledge based on the modeler’s experience. However, even experience based simulation models need some extent of abstraction and formalization in order to achieve results that are expected. Business process simulation models usually incorporate several essential components such as the model of trading functions that reflect customer behavior, procurement functions for modeling company inputs and the optimization of production & logistics functions. When modeling management decisions, a management function model with a loopback to company economic outputs is also needed. As a solid foundation of such complex business simulations, an abstract multi-agent architecture of a trading company model is proposed. The abstract model is inhabited with active entities – software agents and a method of registering their actions in a simulation run log is proposed. This approach combines the basic notions of abstract agent archi tectures with process mining methodology. Finally, the correctness of our software-agent system is verified and a validation is provided showing that the proposed system fits the real data company outputs.
D29|Sharing Economy: Nutznießer oder Opfer institutioneller Inkonsistenzen?<BR>[Sharing Economy – Beneficiary or Victim of Institutional Inconsistencies?]|Zusammenfassung Die Ökonomie des Teilens hat sich–gestützt auf Internetplattformen–in viele Wirtschaftsbereiche hinein ausgedehnt. Hat das neue Transaktionsmodell das Potenzial, die Wirtschafts- und Gesellschaftsordnung grundlegend zu transformieren? Dabei fanden die Transaktionen zunächst noch innerhalb des bestehenden institutionellen Gefüges statt. Doch mit ihrer zunehmenden Bedeutung zeigen sich Konflikte und institutionelle Inkonsistenzen. Wie die Aktivitäten in der Sharing Economy zu differenzieren sind und welche Regeln entsprechend angewandt werden sollten, sind Fragen, die der konstruktiven Diskussion bedürfen.
D29|The Efficiency of (strict) Liability Rules revised in Risk and Ambiguity|In this paper we revise the results about the efficiency of (strict) unlimited, then limited liability in inducing optimal investment in prevention by injurers. Risk and ambiguity are considered. We assume that the potential injurer whose activities cause a risk of environmental accident can reduce the probability of accident by investing in prevention. In the risky model, we recover that limited liability does not always induce low prevention. Contrary to the arguments enhanced by Beard (1990) and Lipowski-Posey (1993), outside lending, absent from our model, does not explain this result. In the ambiguous context, we implement the Non-Extreme Outcome (NEO) expected utility model (Chateauneuf et al., 2007) to represent the injurer’s beliefs and decisions. When ambiguity matters and prevention also affects the injurer’s subjective beliefs, none of the results with risk hold. In particular, the injurer can overinvest in prevention under both unlimited and limited liability.
D29|Particularly financial and political risk insurace|In this study I wanted to achieve a synthesis regarding the main characteristics of insurance and financial risk of the policy in the current Romanian economy. For this purpose we used to achieve a rich documentation of scientific material, eloquently addressed issue.Content addressed scientific approach contains specific concepts used in the literature of domestic and foreign insurers in the market.
D29|The current context of social economy in Romania|Through this study, I have intended to make a synthetized analysis of the social economy sector which, in the current economic context of Romania, has a strong influence on the public policies framework in the field of employment growth in social economy. A complex, scientific and relevant material for the issue discussed here has been used, along with a series of official statistical data in the field of social economy. The scientific approach taken has dwelt upon some conceptual distinctions which should correctly position the place and the role that the entitites may have within social economy and which will generate benefits for the entire society. The scientific approach of conceptual delimitations went on to correctly position the place and the role it may have in the social economy entities which will generate benefits for society.
D29|The Effect of Police Response Time on Crime Detection|Police agencies devote vast resources to minimising the time that it takes them to attend the scene of a crime. Despite this, the long-standing consensus is that police response time has no meaningful effect on the likelihood of catching offenders. We revisit this question using a uniquely rich dataset from the Greater Manchester Police. To identify causal effects, we exploit discontinuities in distance to the response station across locations next to each other, but on different sides of division boundaries. Contrary to previous evidence, we find large and strongly significant effects: in our preferred estimate, a 10% increase in response time leads to a 4.6 percentage points decrease in the likelihood of detection. A faster response time also decreases the number of days that it takes for the police to detect a crime, conditional on eventual detection. We find stronger effects for thefts than for violent offenses, although the effects are large for every type of crime. We identify the higher likelihood that a suspect will be named by a victim or witness as an important mechanism though which response time makes a difference.
D29|Key leaders in social networks|This paper examines optimal targeting and sequencing strategies in the setup proposed by Ballester et al. [3]. The setup features payoff externalities and strategic complementarity among players, who non-cooperatively determine their contributions. We first analyze a two-stage game in which players in the leader group make contributions before the follower group. We construct an exact index to identify the (single) key leader, and demonstrate that the key leader can differ substantially from the key player who most influences the network in the simultaneous-move game. Using Taylor expansions on the strength of network effects, we establish an isomorphism between the optimal leader group selection (targeting) strategy and the classical weighted maximum-cut problem. This approach leads to some design principles for unweighted complete graphs and bipartite graphs.

D29|Relationship Between Job Satisfaction, Psychological Contract, Type Of The Job Contract, And The Years Of Service: Evidences In Higher Education, Relacion Entre La Satisfaccion Laboral, El Contrato Psicologico, El Tipo De Vinculacion Y La Antiguedad: Evidencias En Educacion Superior|This investigation aims to establish the relationship between job satisfaction, psychological contract, type of the job contract, and the years of service of a group of teachers in a private university located in BogotÃ¡. The research is descriptive, itÂ´s not about experimental design ex post-facto. The sample consisted of one hundred and thirteen teachers who work in an engineering department of a private university. The data shows a relation between job satisfaction and the type of job contract. There is no relation between job satisfaction and years of service, there is no relation between psychological contract and type of job contract, and there is no relation between years of service and job satisfaction. These data provide foundation to further investigations about the variables that affect the level of job satisfaction of university teachers.
D29|The competitiveness and development strategies of provinces in China: a data envelopment analysis approach|This paper explores the development strategies of Chinese provinces by synthesizing the dimensions of a competitiveness index and the Data Envelopment Analysis model. After documenting the close relationship between real GDP per capita and competitiveness, we introduce a production approach to study competitiveness and develop various possible strategies facing a province. In particular, while coastal provinces should consider innovating new technologies and institutions to improve competitiveness, western provinces may adopt a proportional development strategy that simultaneously enhances every aspect of its competitiveness. Further, the proportional development strategy for competitiveness is found to reduce regional disparity. The policy implications from our framework could not have been achieved had the analysis been solely based on the conventional methods of studying the competitiveness index.

D29|Modelling the relationships between the use of STEM* skills, collaboration, R&D and Innovation among Australian Businesses|This paper investigates the relationship between the use of STEM/Non-STEM skills, collaboration, R&D and innovation, including novelty of innovation, among Australian businesses. The analysis employs standard probit modelling using the 2010-11 and 2011-12 ABS Business Characteristics Survey data. Results show that the use of STEM skills and collaboration in R&D are very strongly associated with an increase in the likelihood of innovating. The combined impact of collaboration in R&D, expenditure in R&D, and the use of STEM skills on the probability of having a ‘new to the world’ type of innovation is also found to be strong.
D29|Quantum macroeconomics theory|The quantum macroeconomics theory is formulated for the first time, assuming that the business cycle has the discrete-time oscillations spectrum in analogy with the electronics excitations discrete-time spectrum in the Bohr’s atom model in the quantum physics. The quantum macroeconomics theory postulates that the discrete-time transitions from one level of GIP((t), GDP(t), GNP(t) to another level of GIP((t), GDP(t), GNP(t) will occur in the nonlinear dynamic economic systems at the time, when: 1) The land, labour and capital resources are added / released to the production/service processes in the form of quanta; 2) The disruptive scientific/technological/financial/social/political innovation is introduced, creating the resonance conditions necessary to amplify/attenuate the value of GIP((t), GDP(t), GNP(t), during the evolution process of the nonlinear dynamic economic system in the time domain. The authors think that the general information product on the time GIP((t), the general domestic product on the time GDP(t), and the general national product on the time GNP(t), are the discrete-time digital signals (the Ledenyov discrete-time digital waves with the Markov information) in distinction from the continuous-time signals (the Kitchin, Juglar, Kuznets, Kondratieff continuous waves), because of the discrete-time nature of the disruptive scientific/technological/financial/social/political innovations. The authors apply the quantum macroeconomics theory to research and develop a new software program for the accurate characterization and forecasting of GIP((t), GDP(t), GNP(t) dependences changes in the economies of scales and scopes in the time domain for the use by the central / commercial banks.
D29|Too much EMU? An investigation of technology gaps|Although European Single Market (ESM) has been widely perceived as a model for regional integration, there continues to be considerable debate about the impact of this integration on the EU regions. Studies in this field have mainly investigated the convergence-divergence issue, while the effect of ESM on regional performance has attracted few empirical studies. The non-parametric metafrontier framework used in this study, as a first stage of analysis, is exploited to account for the heterogeneity between the Italian regions in the whole period and in two distinct time periods before and after EMU implementation. In a second stage, using a partial least squares model, the technology gaps estimated for each period have been regressed, investigating possible factors that may have affected regional performance. Our findings reveal a significant improvement for the Italian regions since ESM implementation, a paradoxically unchanged behavior for efficiency performance in the Centre-North regions, and clear identification of specifically which regions performed better in terms of the technology gap. The inclusion of variables related to regional trade performance in the model indicates that trade balance is of major importance.
D29|The Effect of Unemployment Benefits on the Duration of Unemployment Insurance Receipt: New Evidence from a Regression Kink Design in Missouri, 2003-2013|We provide new evidence on the effect of the unemployment insurance (UI) weekly benefit amount on unemployment insurance spells based on administrative data from the state of Missouri covering the period 2003-2013. Identification comes from a regression kink design that exploits the quasi-experimental variation around the kink in the UI benefit schedule. We find that UI durations are more responsive to benefit levels during the recession and its aftermath, with an elasticity between 0.65 and 0.9 as compared to about 0.35 pre-recession.
D29|Obstacles to Export Strategy implementation in Zimbabwe?s clothing value chain|This paper investigates the barriers to the implementation of the export strategy in the clothing sector of Zimbabwe. The government of Zimbabwe in its efforts to stimulate trade and socioeconomic development has formulated a five year export strategic blue-print for the resuscitation of clothing value chain. However, to date, no visible movement towards the implementation of the export strategy has materialised. The sector is on the brink of collapse due to the influx of cheap foreign imports. The welfare and livelihood of over two million people dependent on the sector are severely threatened due the continued non-performance of the sector. An understanding of the barriers to strategy implementation improves strategy implementation success.A case study design was used in this research. Firstly, desk research on industry reports and the media was conducted followed by key informant interviews to understand the barriers causing inertia in the implementation of the export strategy. Cotton farmers? representatives, cotton ginners association, the spinning industry , garment manufacturers, clothing retailers, workers? unions and government representatives were important sources of information towards the discovery of the barriers. From the research, leadership, consensus and commitment deficiencies could be the major barriers (among others) militating against the implementation of the export strategy in the clothing value chain. There is also a lack of trust among the value chain actors leading to the dislocation of efforts resuscitate the sector. Trust building may be needed to align the different value chain relationships and actions to enable the successful implementation of the export strategy in clothing sector of Zimbabwe. The successful implementation of the export strategy in the sector is expected to regenerate the whole economy as the viability of the clothing sector has a ripple effect from agricultural input suppliers to retail functions of the economy.
D29|Relationship between Telecommunications Investment and Total Factor Productivity|This study examines diverse production functions and total factor productivity (TFP) levels of 29 OECD countries by using regional data for the 2003-2013 period and related determinants. First, the relationship between TFP and capital and that between TFP and labor are negative (-). Second, communications equipment investment by type has a negative effect on TFP in which communications capital is considered by type, providing support for the productivity paradox. Third, imports have a negative (-) relationship with TFP, whereas the degree of openness has a positive (+) relationship. Finally, the Asian region has a positive effect on TFP, whereas the American region has the greatest negative effect.
D29|Measuring Technical Efficiency in a Small-Scale Fishery: A Stochastic Frontier Analysis to an Inland Fishery in the North Side of Mexico| This research carries out a technical efficiency assessment for a small-scale fishery in Mexico. Technical efficiency (TE) is measured as the deviation of the firm (i.e. fisher) production from the best practice production frontier (Kumbhakar and Lovell 2000). Under TE, fishing production is assumed to be stochastic because the fishing is sensitive to different random factors including weather and other environmental influences (Squires et al. 2003). The analysis of TE of small-scale fisheries is relevant for several reasons. There is a little information on the small-scale fisheries real contribution to livelihoods and economies in developing countries (FAO 2009). The information on small-scale artisanal and recreational fisheries is scarcer and harder to track with 12 million fishers compared with 0.5 million in industrialized countries (Worm et al. 2009). Indeed, while this type of fishery is common in countries like Mexico, the number of analyses assessing their efficiency is very limited. These small-scale fisheries have the potential to generate significant profits and be more resilient to shocks and crises; two important elements to poverty alleviation and food security. But at the same time, these small-scale fisheries may overexploit stocks, harming the environment and generating only a marginal profit level (Gordon 1954; Anderson 1986). Aiming to identify and assess the variables that constrain TE, this research seeks to provide information that would help in the development of guidance as how to remedy production inefficiencies and provide information to define the strategies to use on the assistance of the fishing communities. Improving TE enhances harvest and may contribute to better use and distribution of scarce resources. It may even help to deal “partially” with the open access problem, but clearly, the decision maker need to be careful because increasing the catch may lead to a probable overexploitation of the resource, making the open access problem a more severe problem. Thus, TE output is a partial solution subject to the existence of a fishery management institution that procures the sustainable use of the fishery. As the fishers become more efficient they provide more food and increase their competitiveness representing a way to improve their profit and alleviate the poverty. Overall, while improving TE is only a part of the puzzle, a comprehensive analysis is required to improve the management of the fisheries. This analysis use data from the Lázaro Cárdenas reservoir (LCR), a small-scale fishery where commercial fishers face weak governmental regulation; as a result, the lake has been overharvested and used inefficiently (Tovar et al. 2009), introducing a classic common property situation. From a total of 148 fishers registered in the three cooperatives, only about 100 were active at the time of the survey. 111 fishers were interviewed, and then our survey is basically a census. From 111, only 89 observations were used after dropping one outlier and 21 others because of missing values. It is desirable to have proficient fishers but, what factors constrain efficiency? Aiming to contribute in the knowledge of small-scale fisheries, this study seeks to estimate the drivers of TE in LCR. The research hypothesis is that fisher skills and education level are the main contributors to technical efficiency. The empirical model to estimate TE follows Squires et al. (2003) and Grafton et al. (2000), using the production frontier approach proposed by Battese and Coelli (1995). The model includes labor, effort capacity (eci) to measure the fishing effort, and factor capacity (fci) to measure the inputs used in the fishing activity. Both eci and fci, result from a linear combinations of other variables to account for very different technologies. Effort capacity captures the energy used to move the vessel based on the fisher’s expenditure on gasoline and a dummy variable if the fisher rows the boat. Factor capacity is a proxy of capital stock, and it is a function of the number of nets used by the fisher and a dummy identifying if the fisher angles. Therefore, the model approach allows for the possibility that any fisher can use motor and row and use the net and angling. The technical efficiency equation to estimate the contribution of various factors to a fisher’s inefficiency includes the education level, the number of years of fishing experience, the time (years) that the fisher has using the boat, the number of persons in home to assess the family size of the fisher, the size of the boat, and three dummies to indicate if the fisher has taken a class to improve his fishing techniques, if the fisher shares the boat, and if fishing is the primary source of income. The model equations were jointly regressed using a maximum likelihood procedure, using the program Frontier 4.1 (Coelli and Henningsen 2011) in the statistical package “R.” The model tests favors a Cobb Douglas over a Translog, and it supports the truncated over the half normal distribution. In the production function variables, labor, eci and fci are significant and positive, and variables such as education, fishing experience, and training have a negative sign, thus they have a positive effect on efficiency. In other variables, time using the motor has a negative effect on efficiency; and family size and fisher income have a significant a positive effect to increase efficiency. The results are policy relevant. Knowing the factors that constrain TE brings a guide for policy makers to consider how efficiency can be improved. If the stock does not decline, it may increase the fishers’ revenue and hopefully reduce the poverty. However, it should be carefully assessed. As the fishery is a resource of open access, improvements in TE without restrictions on entry may lead to a faster collapse of fishery. Improving the net income of the fishers and avoiding the overexploitation of resource stock both need to be tackled. It is not an easy task, restrictions in the open access to control the overexploitation without a correct economic assessment could leave the fishers in more poverty. Moreover, measures implemented on the technology side partially solve the problem (Grafton 2006). Improving the fishing capital (nets, motors, boats) is one policy option, but it may be more effective improving the education level of the fishers. This research shows one element of the puzzle by emphasizing key variables to improve the efficiency, but a comprehensive analysis is required to improve the management. Previous research has emphasized the relevance of technology and fisher’s skills to improve the management of the fishery (Salas 2007; Hilborn 2007a; Grafton et al. 2006; Anderson 1986). This research not only corroborates previous research done for large fisheries, but also contributes in the knowledge of TE in small-scale fisheries. As Squires et al. (2003), Esmaeili (2006), and Akanni (2008, 2010), this assessment has a relatively high TE. This finding is interesting to corroborate in future research to see if most small-scale fisheries have a similarly high TE.
D29|¿Innovar para exportar o exportar para innovar?: Un análisis a nivel de firma de la industria manufacturera chilena,1995-2010|Properly identify the relationship between export and innovation is key to designing efficient policy instruments. However, there is still no consensus on how has to be the direct causal relationship between innovation and export. In this paper the authors develop an empirical analysis for the Chilean manufacturing sector which seeks to unravel this relationship. Specifically, an econometric model for various industrial sub-sectors of the Chilean economy for the period 1995-2010, controlling for the level of productivity of each signature, among other variables is presented. Unlike other studies, we consider the total expenditure on innovation rather than just R&D, which can cover a wider range of activities that seek productive within the firm improvements spectrum, while increasing the number of companies that are studied. The results show that in most subsectors, the export propensity or put another way: participation in global market cause, in Granger terms, an increased effort in innovation. Specifically, for the subsectors of minerals and base metals, and metal-mechanical, mutual Granger causality is presented. Finally, for the subsectors wood and paper no statistical significance was evident of Granger causality between innovation and export in any sense. With these results, some policy conclusions for Chile are discussed in relation to instruments of export promotion and innovation.
D29|Which firms benefit from foreign direct investment? Empirical evidence from Indonesian manufacturing|Despite growing concern regarding the productivity benefits of foreign direct investment (FDI), very few studies have been conducted on the impact of FDI on firm-level technical efficiency. This study helps fill this gap by empirically examining the spillover effects of FDI on the technical efficiency of Indonesian manufacturing firms. A panel data stochastic production frontier (SPF) method is applied to 3318 firms surveyed over the period 1988–2000. The results reveal evidence of positive FDI spillovers on technical efficiency. Interesting differences emerge however when the samples are divided into two efficiency levels. High-efficiency domestic firms receive negative spillovers, in general, while low-efficiency firms gain positive spillovers. These findings justify the hypothesis of efficiency gaps, that the larger is the efficiency gap between domestic and foreign firms the easier the former extracts spillover benefits from the latter.
D29|The Return to R&D and Seller-buyer Interactions: A Quantile Regression Approach|In this paper we analyze whether a firm’s return to its R&D stock is affected by seller-buyer interactions. We suggest that firms that are in close contact with their customers will be relatively more sensitive to their customers’ needs, and therefore adjust their R&D activities accordingly. This, in turn, will boost sales and increase the return to R&D. To the extent that seller-buyer interactions are costly, large and productive firms will have an advantage in overcoming such costs. We test these hypotheses using a fixed effects quantile regression framework. Results suggest that large firms active in industries characterized by frequent seller-buyer interactions have a higher return to R&D than other firms.
D29|Corporate Elearning Impact On Employees|This paper examines the impact of corporate eLearning on employeesâ€™ productivity, job satisfaction, overall job performance, and organizational commitment. The theoretical framework proposed was to determine whether eLearning usage has any correlation with these variables. This discussion is supported by conducting an online survey from ten educational institutions and two international corporations. The results concluded that eLearning usage by employees had varying correlations with job productivity, job performance, job satisfaction and organizational commitment. It was determined that the use of technology alone will not yield desired results; corporations need to determine a balance between eLearning strategies and managerial support.
D29|Significance Of The Eu Funds In Investments Of Small And Medium-Sized Enterprises|Nowadays competitiveness of enterprises is determined by the size and range of implemented investment projects. The investments need to involve necessary resources. In the case of the SME sector, enterprises have limited financial assets. Therefore, Poland’s accession to the European Union and the opportunity to use its funding is a chance for development of this sector. The aim of the paper is to discuss the significance of EU funds in investments of SMEs and to present the most important advantages and barriers to their spending. The research methods used in this paper are: study of literature and analysis of secondary data. The research material comprises programming documents and the results of research carried out at the request of the European Leasing Fund, the Polish Agency for Enterprise Development and the Polish Confederation Lewiatan. Conclusions: EU funding is an attractive source of financing investments for enterprises. It is one of the most affordable forms of obtaining capital. Acquisition of additional financial means can determine the start of an investment, extend its scope, increase its rate and improve its quality. However, in practice the share of EU funds in financing SMEs investments is still small and entrepreneurs face many barriers to using this form of support. Major obstacles include: excessive bureaucracy, strict procedures, over-scrupulous office workers, lengthy verification of payment applications, as well as delays in payments to beneficiaries.
D29|Design of Financial Derivatives: Statistical Power does not Ensure Risk Management Power|This paper presents a modelling framework for analysis of financial derivatives. The framework analyzes the derivative from the perspective of a producer who has uncertain quantity of production. Quantity has a statistical relationship to an index number, or risk factor, and the producer can buy a derivative on the index number, which provides the producer with an indirect hedge against low quantity. A practical concern is how to create such an index number: one approach is to define the index as an estimated regression equation with maximal explanatory power across some set of possible equations. I use my framework to conduct a simulation experiment that shows picking an index with maximal explanatory power can lead to a financial derivative with suboptimal efficiency. In other words, I show that it is possible for one index to have lower statistical power than another but higher risk management power. This result is due to the fact that statistical power is measured over all values of quantity, whereas losses only occur for low quantity and it is sufficient (in some cases) for the index to have strong explanatory power for low values of quantity to serve as an effective risk management tool.
D29|Changing Political Economy, Policies, and Journalism: The conflicts between journalists, media organizations and the government in Taiwan (2003-2013)|Over the last decade, the media environment in Taiwan has changed dramatically. A global magazine 'Foreign Policy', on 20th February 2014, specifically discussed these issues and described Taiwanese media as sensationalist without depth. In deed, the exaggerated and lurid news contents are the productions of Taiwanese journalism; however, the most important question worthy of examining is the phenomenon or the problem embedded in the political economy, the policies and the journalistic field in Taiwan. This research focuses on how the changing political economy and policies have changed media environment and the conflicts journalists have struggled towards media organizations and the government from 2003 to 2013. In 2003, the government in Taiwan announced a policy, governmental product placement, in order to promote policies or governors in news without informing audiences or readers the news was purchased by the government. This policy has changed the media environment in Taiwan for more than ten years due to the so- called democratic government using money to manipulate journalism and interfere with the production of news. This paper explores how governmental product placement has influenced the media environment and the conflicts of individual journalists with the government and media organizations from 2003 to 2013. The concepts of Bourdieu, the critical political economy of journalism and the crisis of neoliberalism are the theoretical framework of this research. This research adopted semi-structured, in-depth interviewing to do fieldwork in Taiwan from 17th July to 21st September 2013 and interviewed 30 journalists working for the most influential 13 TV stations. The informants were 7 males and 23 females with 2 to 21-year working experiences. Their positions were junior journalists, senior journalists, TV presenters and chief editors.The findings of this research are mainly four aspects: First, news in Taiwan has become definitely a commodity with very clear selling and purchasing deals. Sometimes, it might be buy one get one free deal. Sometimes, news might be not for individual sale, but for a package sale with advertisements. Second, journalists towards the conflicts against professional journalism might choose to compromise due to ?salary?. Without enough economic capital, they do not dare to fight. They choose to survive rather than fight for professional journalism. Even though few journalists try to fight for professionalism, finally, they might be disappointed and choose to leave the journalistic industry.Third, even though journalists try hard to accumulate their capital, when they achieve higher positions, they are satisfied with what they own, the economic, cultural, social, and symbolic capital. They might complain the media environment, but they see no reasons to fight for professional journalism. Fourth, the government in Taiwan might interfere with the process of news production. The government might directly ask journalists to report the specific angels or even ask to check the news content beforehand. The roles of media organizations are essential; if media organizations allow the government to check the news before broadcasting, journalists might suffer more conflicts and struggle more.
D29|Does Tenure Make Researchers Less Productive? The Case of the “Specialist”|Many studies suggest that research productivity falls after tenure is granted. We have however limited choice-theoretic understanding of why this should occur. With some simplifying assumptions, we rationalize this as follows. Scholars are assumed to be “specialists”: their research productivity consists in transforming Ph.D. chapters into publishable papers. We show how a department that hired such a scholar provides incentives to maximize research productivity. We show his research productivity and publication paths are then characterized by a “bang-bang” solution, i.e., either he works with maximum or minimum effort. The department sets the scholar’s wages proportional to the department’s impatience to spur his productivity, and only succeeds if he turns out to be more impatient than the department. The paper provides a novel perspective on academic productivity and the tenure system.
D29|A quantitative model of the human capital contribution to the value of a project|This paper proposes a conceptual frame for assessing the economic contribution attributable to the human capital in a project in the product market. The starting point is the rejection of the assumption of human capital as commodity, which is implicit in nearly all discussions about the economic value of a project in the product market. Once the management team has already climbed a particular learning curve, this experience translates into a well-defined assembly of skills and know-how “honed in house” that are not marketable and that become the basis of sustained competitive advantage during the life of the project. In this model, the specificity of the in-house developed knowledge is encoded by the parameters of a function that represents the responses of the team to aspiration levels proposed by central management, vis-à-vis its perceptions of market conditions. How the net present value of the project depends on those parameters reflects the weight of the human capital. This approach reveals that the contribution of the human capital component to the value of a project does not follow any simple additive rule, and that the notion of added value comes mainly from comparing the team’s performance with that of competing management teams
D29|Spillovers in networks of user generated content: Pseudo-experimental evidence on Wikipedia|I quantify spillovers of attention in a network of content pages, which is challenging, because such networks form endogenously. I exploit exogenous variation in the article network of German Wikipedia to circumvent this problem. Wikipedia prominently advertises one featured article on its main site every day, which increases viewership of the advertised article. Shifts in the viewership of adjacent articles are due to their link from the treated article. Through this approach I isolate how the link network causally influences users' search and contribution behavior. I use a difference-in-differences analysis to estimate how attention spills to neighbors through the transient shock of advertisement. I further develop an extended peer effects model which relaxes the requirement of an exogenously given network. This model enables the estimation of the underlying spillover. Advertisements affect neighboring articles substantially: Their viewership increases by almost 70 percent. This, in turn, translates to increased editing activity. Attention is the driving mechanism behind views and short edits. Both outcomes are related to the order of links, while more substantial edits are not.

D29|Targeted information release in social networks| As a common practice, various firms initially make information and access to their products/services scarce within a social network; identifying influential players that facilitate information dissemination emerges as a pivotal step for their success. In this paper, we tackle this problem using a stylized model that features payoff externalities and local network effects, and the network designer is allowed to release information to only a subset of players (leaders); these targeted players make their contributions first and the rest followers move subsequently after observing the leaders' decisions. In the presence of incomplete information, the signaling incentive drives the optimal selection of leaders and can lead to a first-order materialistic effect on the equilibrium outcomes. We propose a novel index for the key leader selection (i.e., a single player to provide information to) that can be substantially different from the key player index in Ballester (2006)and the key leader index with complete information proposed in Zhou and Chen (2013). We also show that in undirected graphs, the optimal leader group identified in Zhou and Chen (2013) is exactly the optimal follower group when signaling is present. The pecking order in complete graphs suggests that the leader should be selected by the ascending order of intrinsic valuations. We also examine the out-tree hierarchical structure that describes a typical economic organization. The key leader turns out to be the one that stays in the middle, and it is not necessarily exactly the central player in the network.
D29|Productivity As Registered Transfers Between Economic Entities. A Theoretical Intuitive Approach|This paper aims at courageously building the design of a conceptual system of thinking economics, conceived as an alternative to the routine one. In this purpose, methodologically, the paper is, pointing out several of our main conceptions that are developed in our researches, also several recent set of ideas and most recent works in the economic literature concerning the topic of productivity. Part of a larger research, our approach blame the common practice in economic life and, as well, in economics theoretical analyses concerning the conceiving and assessing productivity, as being almost exclusively quantitative and formal (ignoring important qualitative and causal aspects of the economic complex process). The organization and building of the paper is made in the logic of presenting the key concepts that are the pillars of the presented system of thinking, starting with the recent context of the New Long Crisis, with the requirements of the concept of knowledge society, with references to the European Union approaches, presenting our opinion concerning the value state and meaning, and finding them in the actual economic growth concept, which is presented as responsible for the entering in the New Long Crisis. Several roots from the genuine liberalism are invoked, in the more recent scientific environment of the service economy, which brought important new ideas and understandings concerning the general design of an economic activity (be it material or immaterial), the intellectual core of all human acts, the servicity approach, recovering the genuine conception on value and productivity. The debate results in pointing out several capital common misunderstandings which give occasion to (and even require) alternative approaches and conclusions, approaches which are conceived as (and can be) useful for developments in better directions that are solving problems on the very long time. The occasion is used also for reminding a most recent conception on an alternative economy.
D29|¿Puerto o playa? Un análisis económico del conflicto entre la ciudad de Trujillo y el puerto de Salaverry|Salaverry es un pequeño puerto localizado a pocos kilómetros de la ciudad de Trujillo, al norte del Perú. Moviliza alrededor de 2.5 millones de toneladas de carga al año, en su mayoría, granel seco. Desde 1982, ENAPU, la empresa estatal que opera el puerto, ha venido reduciendo sus costos de dragado mediante el alargamiento de un molón retenedor de arena, solución que ha alterado el equilibrio dinámico de la costa y causado la virtual desaparición de las playas de Trujillo. Desde el punto de vista de las políticas públicas, el problema se vuelve aún más complejo si se toma en cuenta el alto costo de las obras necesarias para detener la erosión de las playas (US$ 150 millones), el incremento de la demanda por más y mejores servicios ambientales, y lo poco probable que resulta concesionar al sector privado una operación que genera una externalidad negativa tan seria. El objetivo de este estudio es el de examinar el conflicto entre el puerto de Salaverry y la ciudad de Trujillo desde el punto de vista económico, y determinar cuál es su solución más eficiente mediante análisis determinísticos y probabilísticos desde los puntos de vista público y privado. Los resultados indican que: (i) el terminal portuario de Salaverry no genera recursos suficientes para operar sin un subsidio, menos aún para pagar el costo de la reparación ambiental; (ii) para concesionar el terminal al sector privado, el gobierno deberá otorgar un subsidio cercano a los US$ 25 millones; y, (iii) cerrar el puerto no es recomendable, pues si bien mantenerlo operativo le costaría a la sociedad US$ 175 millones, cerrarlo le generaría costos por US$ 322 millones.

D29|Zmiany rol zarzadczych lekarzy w szpitalach: czego mozemy sie nauczyc od Brytyjczykow? (Change of managerial roles of doctors in hospitals: what can we learn from the British?)|This paper surveys the attitudes to managerial roles shown by Polish and British doctors and their evolution over the past decades. The paper is based on a review and analysis of literature, policy documents, healthcare statistic sand semi-structured interviews. Results of this research show that in the past doctors were reluctant to assume managerial roles in the UK system, whereas they were actually keen to do so in the Polish one. Changes in both countries (more market orientation in both countries, UK state policy) changed the doctors’ attitude to management. In the UK, doctors are at the moment more interested in taking on managerial responsibilities, while in Poland they are less interested in doing so in public hospitals due to the financial incentives attached to clinical work. In private hospitals, however, doctors understand the need for collaboration with general managers and other professional groups.
D29|The emergence of the empresas recuperadas por sus trabajadores: A political economic and sociological appraisal of two decades of self-management in Argentina|The crisis of Argentina�s neoliberal model that escalated throughout the 1990s, driven in part by the zealousness of how IMF-sanctioned structural reforms were implemented, would eventually culminate in the model�s temporary implosion over the years spanning the turn of the millennium. For workers living through this crisis, traditional union tactics would prove unresponsive to the neoliberal juggernaut, while the state was on the defensive as business bankruptcy, informal work, unemployment, and poverty rates soared to unprecedented levels during this period. But the crisis of neoliberalism that so deeply affected the everyday lives of Argentina�s working people and their families also proved to be, for some of them, an opening for experimenting with other possibilities for organizing production and economic life. As businesses increasingly failed, more and more workers from a broad cross-section of Argentina�s urban-based economy began taking matters into their own hands by occupying and self-managing the troubled workplaces that had been employing them as worker cooperatives. Today throughout Argentina, almost 9,500 workers selfmanage over 200 empresas recuperadas por sus trabajadores (worker-recuperated enterprises, or ERTs) in sectors as varied as printing and publishing, media, metallurgy, health provisioning, foodstuffs, shipbuilding, waste management, construction, education, tourism, and energy. The aim of this working paper is to provide a political economic and sociological overview of the rise and establishment of ERTs in Argentina over the past two decades. It does so in order to introduce ERTs to readers that might not be familiar with the Argentine experience of workplace conversions to worker cooperatives and their recent historical emergence. It also gives context to what is arguably, as I will detail in forthcoming research, a new form of hybrid social economy organization�a �solidarity worker cooperative/work integration social enterprise.� In this respect, ERTs are a type of hybrid labour-managed firm that uniquely formed, in the Argentine political economic and sociological context, from out of the takeover and conversion of a formerly investor-owned or proprietary business into a worker cooperative by workers themselves.
D29|Spillovers in networks of user generated content: Evidence from 23 natural experiments on Wikipedia|Endogeneity in network formation hinders the identification of the role social networks play in generating spillovers, peer effects and other externalities. This paper tackles this problem and investigates how the link network between articles on the German Wikipedia influences the attention and content generation individual articles receive. Identification exploits local exogenous shocks on a small number of nodes in the network. It can thus avoid the usually required, but strong, assumptions of exogenous observed characteristics and link structure in networks. This approach also applies if, due to a lack of network information, identification through partial overlaps in the network structure fails (e.g. in classrooms). Exogenous variation is generated by natural and technical disasters or by articles being featured on the German Wikipedia's start page. The effects on neighboring pages are substantial; I observe an increase of almost 100 percent in terms of both views and content generation. The aggregate effect over all neighbors is also large: I find that a view on a treated article converts one for one into a view on a neighboring article. However, the resulting content generation is small in absolute terms.
D29|Almost Anonymous Implicit Contracting|Economists use relational or reputational concerns to explain the implicit enforcement of contracts. Both mechanisms require special assumptions concerning contracting parties' identities; in particular, these assumptions would not hold in one-period settings in which outcomes cannot affect reputation. In such a setting, this paper shows how a signaling mechanism can support the implicit enforcement of contracts that Pareto improve upon the null contract. Furthermore, this mechanism is independent of the discount factor and can outperform the relational contract in a range of cases. We find empirical support for our theory using contracts from nancing alliances in the biotech industry.
D29|Economic Features Of Processed Fruit Production In Serbia| There are various possibilities of fruit processing regarding assortments of both semiprocessed and finished fruit products. Within a wide assortment of processed fruit products, there are semi-processed fruit products which can be directly marketed or used as raw materials in further stages of processing, thus causing different economic effects. This paper displays the indicators of economic effects (production value, production costs (especially direct costs), and the difference between production value and total production costs) in all stages of a certain type of fruit processing. The obtained results indicate that advanced stages of fruit processing entail an increase in costs, but these increased costs eventually enable higher revenues. Fruit processing is cost-effective due to the fact that fruit processing value is higher than the market value of fruits. The fruit processing value in compote production is on average 48.87% higher than the fruit market value. In semi-processed fruit production (fruit puree and pitted crushed fruits Rotativa2), the fruit processing value is on average 14.83% higher than the fruit market value.

As a general rule, the firms’ hedging demand decreases with the correlation between firms’ internal funds and investment opportunities. We show that when the hedging demand of a firm is high in the case where investments are strategic substitutes, its hedging demand is low in the case where investments are strategic complements and vice versa. Finally, we also propose another interpretation of our model in terms of technical choice.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D29|The Business Environment in the Transition|Following the collapse of planning, new small and medium-sized firms rapidly emerged in all transition economies. Using firm level data, we investigate the interaction between the widespread opportunities for new business activities such firms faced and their business environment. The business environment includes physical infrastructure, the availability of an educated labour force, provision of administrative and judicial services, the control of corruption and crime, and the stability of the macroeconomic environment. By comparing how different elements of the business environment affected firms in formerly planned economies with those in economies outside transition, we document not only the challenges faced by transition firms but also the effects of the planning legacy.
D29|Almost Anonymous Implicit Contracting|Economists use relational or reputational concerns to explain the implicit enforcement of contracts. Both mechanisms require special assumptions concerning contracting parties' identities; in particular, these assumptions would not hold in one-period settings in which outcomes cannot affect reputation. In such a setting, this paper shows how a signaling mechanism can support the implicit enforcement of contracts that Pareto improve upon the null contract. Furthermore, this mechanism is independent of the discount factor and can outperform the relational contract in a range of cases. We find empirical support for our theory using contracts from nancing alliances in the biotech industry.

Dicho factor está relacionado con las trayectorias individuales y colectivas que han consolidado las OPD en interacción con redes de apoyo, aportando elementos de identidad que enriquecen sus prácticas, posibilitan la cogestión de proyectos productivos y la promoción de valores compartidos. La metodología aplicada se inscribe en la complementariedad de los métodos cuali-cuanti, a partir de lo cual se trabaja con una muestra a criterio de diez OPD, mediante técnicas como la entrevista, talleres interactivos y encuestas. Los resultados establecen que las OPD son estrategias a través de las cuales la población se moviliza en la búsqueda de mejores condiciones de vida, desarrollando distintas interacciones en las que es posible la construcción del Factor C en forma de energía social y solidaridad.
D29|Presence of Check‐Off Programs and Industry Concentration in the Food Manufacturing Sector|The authors examine industry concentration for the U.S. food manufacturing sector. This study is the first to examine whether particular subsectors within the food manufacturing industry, which operate in the presence of industry-funded check-off programs such as marketing orders, are more or less concentrated than industries without such research and marketing programs. The authors find evidence to the hypothesis that industries with demand-enhancing check-off programs have lower concentration relative to industries without these programs.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D29|State ownership and control in the Czech Republic|We analyze the extent of the integrated control of the state over privatized firms during the post-privatization decade (1995–2005) in the Czech Republic. During this period the integrated control potential of the state resembled a corporate pyramid. While pyramidal control was not fully utilized, the golden share in the hands of the state substantially enhanced its ability to control firms. In terms of corporate performance we show that state control resulted in declining and even negative corporate performance. Integrated state control was shown to be mostly inferior when compared with private types of ownership. State ownership positions are in striking contrast with the lack of capacity to push corporate performance in order to collect larger tax volumes. Lack of focus and inter-agency cooperation as well as the simple inefficiency of the state bureaucracy are the most likely reasons behind our findings.

D29|Job design and innovative work behavior enabling innovation through active or low-strain jobs?|Promoting the innovative potential of employees is a main challenge for HR professionals. Previous studies already stressed the role of job design for employee innovativeness. Building on the work of Karasek & Theorell (1990), we focus on the relation between job design, work engagement and innovative work behaviour (IWB). The results show that job control is positively related to both IWB and work engagement, job demands are negatively related to work engagement, yet their relation to IWB is more ambiguous. Significant interaction effects between job demands and job control variables in both the relation with work engagement and IWB are found, yet their nature differs significantly. We find that active jobs (high control and high demands) are related to lower levels of IWB in comparison to low-strain jobs (high control, low demands), which has major managerial consequences.
D29|Measuring of Efficiency in the Public and Private Sector - Current Research Approaches|The issue of performance efficiency is one of the basic issues in private and also in public sector. When comparing the effectiveness of subjects across these sectors the differences in their characteristics must be taken into account. With regard to these differences should be chosen the appropriate parameters for the measurement and comparison of results. The aim of this paper is to approach the issue of measuring performance efficiency in the public and private sector with reference to the related literature.
D29|Global Economic Crisis: Experience Of Turkey As The Model Of Recovery|Between the years 1820-2008, there have been many economic crises in the World. Each of the crises had different intensity, scope and dimension. 2008 global crisis also had distinctive features. Starting with U.S. financial crisis, with a domino effect of financial instruments, the crisis deepened and shifted to global dimension without any discontinuity. Effects of the 2008 global crisis, as countries could not reach financial balance and could not implement policies that would restart economic growth, has continued untill today. Turkey, especially after 2000, by establishing a firm banking sector, strong financial discipline, and by making reforms, built up a confidence atmosphere that brought about a 10% economic growth with help of the driving force of flexible of the private sector during the 2008 global crisis. In this study a summary of the global economic crisis is provided, before talking about reasons of the crisis in detail. Data about the measures taken and applications made by Turkey, as a model of a recovery from the global economic crisis, constitutes the main part of this study. In addition, predictions would be made about the new dimensions of the global economic crisis.
D29|No institution is a free lunch: a reconstruction of Ronald Coase|The two major contributions of Ronald Coase, written at distant points of his long life, have been often interpreted as different and, somehow, contradicting views of the merits of the market mechanism. We argue that the underlying point of the two articles is the same and it can be summarized by the statement that no institution is a free lunch. When the unity of the Coasian theory is properly understood, it offers a powerful challenge to standard neo-classical production theory and opens new analytical tools to understand and to compare the institutions of production.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D29|Private and public incentive to reduce seasonality: A theoretical model|In this article, the authors present a theoretical model to investigate the private and social incentives to reduce seasonality in a given market. They assume that consumers derive different utilities from the consumption of the same good in different seasons. The seasonal product differentiation is modelled along the lines of Gabszewicz and Thisse (Price Competition, Quality and Income Disparities, 1979) and Shaked and Sutton (Relaxing Price Competition through Product Differentiation, 1982). The authors assume that it is possible for a firm to invest in order to reduce the degree of the demand seasonality. They show that, for a wide set of parameter configuration, the optimal effort to reduce seasonality is higher from a social welfare perspective, as compared to the private producer perspective. The tourism market can represent an application of the present model. However, unlike most available literature in this field, their model provides a microeconomic basis for the evaluation of investments aimed at reducing seasonality, rather than taking a macroeconomic approach.
D29|Intra-Firm Trade Law - Contract-Enforcement & Dispute Resolution in Transnational Corporations|While intra-firm trade accounts for at least one third of world exports, we know very little about the institutions which are employed to resolve intra-firm trade conflicts. According to Oliver Williamson, courts are not accessible and conflicts resulting from intra-firm trade are resolved by directives based on the authority of ownership instead (law of forbearance). Williamson's description of the law of forbearance, however, depicts an ideal typical form of a firm, which is characterised by low incentive intensity and high administrative costs. Yet, in order to improve on these attributes, large transnational enterprises changed their organisational structure in the past decades. Nowadays, large-scale enterprises usually have a decentralised structure and use intra-firm pricing and incentive systems. Against this backdrop, Williamson's description of the contract law regime of intra-firm trade appears all too general. This paper addresses the question of how contract enforcement in transnational corporations is institutionally organized on the basis of preliminary results of expert interviews conducted with officials from transnational corporations. In a first step we illustrate that conflicts originating in intra-firm transactions are basically of the same type and nature than conflicts arising out of market transactions. We argue that the settlement of these disputes is of relevance both for legal (e.g. corporate and tax law) and economic reasons (e.g. coordination, control and motivation functions of profit centers). In a second step we analyze the governance mechanisms which are employed by transnational corporations to resolve intra-firm trade conflicts.
D29|Regional Headquarters Capabilities as Key Facilitator of the Coordination of Transnational Business Activities|Transnational corporations (TNCs) recently face a dilemma: they coevally have to exploit global-based as well as locally enrooted business opportunities ('glocal dilemma'). This brings the aspect of formal and informal coordination to an issue. In our conceptual paper we focus on formal coordination and employ a capability-based perspective to address the specific coordination role regional headquarters (RHQ) as structural coordination tool play in this context. Based on a framework borrowed from entrepreneurship theory, we outline necessary capabilities of RHQs to be able to carry out their coordinative function in a sufficient way. Our paper enhances existing knowledge by highlighting the up to now widely disregarded coordinative power of RHQ structures subject to specific competences.
D29|In the Need of Speed - The Impact of Organizational Learning on the Competitiveness of Born Transnationals|The globalization process stimulates more and more start-ups entering international markets at their earliest convenience. Supported by modern IT and logistics systems, this option is available for many ventures that become more and more independent from their country of origin. For transnational companies, as heterarchical networks without typical internal hub structures and a high degree of responsiveness, this holds particularly true. This is the reason why this paper focuses the 'born transnational' type of international entrepreneurship. The question arises how international ventures achieve international competitiveness. This paper argues that the pace and the alignment of processes of external and internal learning are of utmost importance. Knowledge generation, absorption, integration, and company-wide transfer play a pivotal role in this regard. Insofar, the research question of the paper is: What are the factors that accelerate organizational learning of 'born transnationals'? Based on competence-based theory and a particular model of organizational learning, the paper presents research propositions on the learning process of Ôborn transnationals'.
D29|Transport Fleet Sizing By Using Make And Buy Decision-Making|Cost reduction is among the main quoted reasons for logistics outsourcing, while transport capacities and operations are among the most outsourced logistics areas. However, according to transaction costs theory, there is often room for transport insourcing. Furthermore, nowadays many authors stress that mixed solutions can give better results than “make” or “buy” alternatives.“Make or buy” decision-making normative models, methods, and procedures in transport planning are not much explored. Instead, research is rather focused on carrier selection techniques, whereby it is supposed that outsourcing transport capacities is the most suitable solution. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the body of literature on classical “make-or-buy” decision-making in transport fleet sizing in a non-logistics enterprise. It goes beyond the basic “make or buy” decisionmaking, and intermediate solutions (i.e., “make and buy”) are explored. Practical directions are given according to theoretical principles, and a case study is used to exemplify the main deductions.The research also has practical implications. Many enterprises in transition economies have faced the question of what to do with their in-house transport fleets. The obtained results are of interest to merchants and manufacturing enterprises that already have a private transport fleet and are considering how to rationalize it.

Endüstride faaliyet gösteren firma sayısı ve büyüklüğü yoğunlaşma düzeyinin oluşmasında önemli faktörlerdir. Piyasadaki yoğunlaşma düzeyini ölçmenin en bilinen yöntemleri piyasadaki en büyük firmaların piyasa paylarının toplamından oluşan N-Firma yoğunlaşma oranı ve endüstrilerde rekabetçi olmayan davranışları belirlemede kullanılan Herfındahl-Hirschman indeksidir. Çalışmada N-Firma Yoğunlaşma Oranları (CR4 ve CRg) ve Herfındahl-Hirschman İndeksi yardımıyla Türk otomotiv sektöründeki yoğunlaşma düzeyi analiz edilmiştir. Yapılan analiz sonucunda CR4-e göre yerli binek ve yerli hafif ticari, CR8’e göre ise yerli hafif ticari ve ithal hafif ticari araç sektöründe yüksek düzeyde yoğunlaşmanın olduğu görülmüştür. Herfındahl-Hirschman İndeksi analizi sonucunda da yerli hafif ticari ve yerli binek araç sektöründe monopolcü rekabet piyasa yapısı söz konusu iken ithal binek ve ithal hafifi ticari araç sektöründe düşük yoğunlaşma oranı olduğu ve bunun neticesinde daha rekabetçi bir yapının geçerli olduğu görülmüştür.

We study the allocations generated by a system where life is organised on the basis of economic principles consistent with the ideas of the anarchist philosophers of the 19th and 20th centuries. The «anarchic model» turns out to be, in general, inefficient in terms of allocations, as opposed to the system generated by the capitalistic firms and by a «communist» organisation; on the other hand, in anarchy the equity principle, interpreted as symmetry in allocations, always obtains.

D29|THE STATE OF SME’s ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RATIONALITY| The paper analyse the economic rationality of SMEs (Small and medium size enterprises) trough some pertinent indicators that revels the importance of SME for the employment market and for the entire economy. Despite their adaptability these entities have faced always different problems and the most noticeable has been the need of capital infusion. The paper proposes a new type of capital infusion in Romania: the private equity investment. We explore the venture investment mechanism and its implications at economic level for the SME. To identify the economic impact of venture capital, European preliminary figures provided by EVCA (European Venture Capital Association) will be analysed to determine if private equity capital represents a solution for capital infusion in SMEs.
D29|Information, Uncertainty, and Subjective Entitlements in Bargaining|More often than not production processes are the joint endeavor of people having different abilities and productivities. Such production processes and the associated surplus production are often not fully transparent in the sense that the relative contributions of involved agents are blurred; either by lack of information about the actual performance of collaborators or because of random noise in the production process or both. These variables likely influence the surplus sharing negotiations following the production. By means of a laboratory experiment, we systematically investigate their role for the whole bargaining process from opening offers to (dis)agreements and find that uncertainties in surplus production and (even) a very coarse performance information lead to bargaining asymmetries. In addition, we find that bargainersâ€™ subjective entitlements are also influenced by performance information and the randomness inherent in the production process. These differences in subjective entitlements together with the differences in entitlements between better and worse performers influence the whole bargaining process and significantly contribute to the differences in bargaining outcomes. Keywords: bargaining; performance information; randomness in production process; entitlements; experiments.

The reverse of this happens as well. The decisions made could bring the company in a positive area or in a very profitable position. The results of the decisions about management, coordination, organise, control and supervision which are considered as management function are not investigated in the companies. In this study the relationship between realizations and expectations about management function is tested. The area composed of errors are considered as management areas. Since the data belonging to the companies operating under the holding are a component of a whole, panel data of the companies are used. Panel regression analysis is undertaken using the financial variables of 8 companies between 1999 and 2008 in the research. In our analyses made in order to investigate the determinants of net sales it is found that personal expenses have a great impact whereas cost of material variable has a limited effect on net sales. Also, the profitability of the companies is investigated. According to research results sales it is found that personal expenses have a small coefficient whereas cost of material variable has a relatively greater effect on net sales than the other variables. Finally, it is found that there is a positive and significant relationship between the net sales and the profitability of the companies. It shows us that bigger companies have a higher probability of obtaining more profits. This finding shows us that companies could increase their profitability in case companies grow due to mergers.

D29|Intellectual Capital Evaluation Models|The evaluation and measurement of intellectual capital is an issue of increasing importance for companies because of the staleness of the traditional accounting systems which do not provide relevant information regarding the value of a company. Thus, specialists are working to identify a model for assessing intellectual capital that can be easily implemented and used. The large number of proposed models but also the major differences between them emphasizes the fact that the specialists are still far from having reached a consensus. Still, there is no model accepted by most of the companies. The article aims to achieve a brief description of some of the most important models in intellectual capital.
D29|Private and public incentive to reduce seasonality: a simple theoretical model|This paper presents a theoretical model to investigate the incentive of private producer and policy-maker to reduce seasonality in a given market, where consumers derive different utilities from the consumption of the good in different seasons. The (seasonal) product differentiation is modeled along the lines of the contributions of Gabszewicz and Thisse (1979) and Shaked and Sutton (1982). We take into consideration that investments are possible to reduce the degree of seasonality. We show that, for a wide set of parameter configuration, the policy maker finds it optimal to make more effort to reduce seasonality as compared to private producers. The theoretical conclusion is consistent with empirical and anecdotical evidence, especially in the field of tourism markets.

In their turn, production chains reflect into road traffic in the geographical areas where the district extends. The reconstructed traffic exhibits a pattern that has been observed, but not foreseen, by policy makers.

The study data was collected through a multi-stage random sampling technique from 90 farmers in 2009. The coefficients for education and extension were negative and significantly related to total factor productivity (TFP) at 10%level of probability. The coefficients for age, fertilizer and access to credit were positive and significant at 1% level of probability. The coefficients for gender and household size were negative and significant at 1% level of probability. The results calls for policies aimed at provision of inputs especially fertilizer and credit targeted mostly on women farmers. Policies on increased education and extension contacts and birth control should be advocated for
D29|VAT and Tax Credits: A Way to Eliminate Tax-Evasive Use of Transfer Prices?|In this paper we compare income taxes to VAT and tax credits to tax deductions in terms of their ability to distort factor prices, provide fair taxation, avoid tax-evasive transfer pricing and induce Pareto improvement of tax policies. On the base of theoretical discussion and thought experiments we conclude that VAT is due to its nature superior regarding these requirements. We also have found out that a wider use of tax credits within VAT would be useable to prevent profit shifting. Some adjustments of VAT compared to current practice are needed to achieve the best results. More rigorous proofs, both theoretical and empirical are needed.
D29|Can Profit-shifting be Resolved by Penalization?|We examine contemporary practice of transfer pricing rules enforcement in this paper. We have used neoclassical microeconomic framework with transfer price estimated via comparable uncontrolled price method. We have found that if vertically integrated multinational enterprise (MNE) has possibility to evade tax through transfer pricing, then it produces higher quantity of final product, than it would if no possibility of tax evasion existed. Secondly we have found that although nowadays’ transfer pricing rules require use of enforcement instruments (penalty), there is no penalty high enough to extinguish tax evasive transfer pricing totally, and if market for the product produced in country with high tax rate is perfectly competitive or there is monopolistic competition, no optimal penalty can be found. That changes at oligopolistic, monopolistic or duopolistic market of that product - there we could find optimal penalty.

D29|IT and Beyond: The Contribution of Heterogeneous Capital to Productivity|This article explores the relationship between capital composition and productivity using a unique, detailed dataset on firm investment in the United States in the late 1990s. I develop a methodology for estimating the separate effects of multiple capital types in a production function framework. I back out the implied marginal products of each capital type and compare these with rental price data. I find that although most capital types earned normal returns, information and communications technology capital goods had marginal products substantially above their rental prices. The article also provides evidence of complementarities and substitutabilities among capital types and between capital types and labor.
D29|Output and Productivity Performance of Hong Kong and Singapore's Transport and Communications Sector, 1990 to 2005| This paper uses the industry of origin approach to analyze value added and labor productivity outcomes arising from progressive liberalization of government and from statutory board control of transport and communications in Singapore. The paper compares these outcomes with those from the market-orientated, more privatized transport and communications sector in Hong Kong, for the benchmark year 2004 and a review period from 1990 to 2005. The study is among the first to carefully compare labor productivity in specific sectors between the two countries. Although Singapore generally recorded higher levels of labor productivity, there was some catch-up by Hong Kong in the later part of the review period. There was also substantial variation in labor productivity performance within sectoral branches in the two sectors. The study suggests there is some evidence that the different political-economic structures and policy approaches to deregulation and liberalization played a role in determining productivity performance in the transport and communications sectors in Singapore and Hong Kong. The analysis infers a potential, increasing focus on privatization as the driving force for further liberalization of the transport and communications sector in Singapore. Copyright 2009 The Authors.

D29|Industry concentration in South African manufacturing industry: Trends and consequences, 1972-96|This paper examines industry concentration for the South African manufacturing sector over the 1972-1996 period, for the three digit industry classification. The paper notes both the high level of industry concentration in South African manufacturing, and a rising trend in concentration across a wide range of industries. The paper further explores the impact that industry concentration has on a wide range of indicators of industry performance. We find that increased concentration serves to lower output growth, raise unit labour costs, and to lower labour productivity. The impact on employment, total factor productivity and investment rates based on bivariate examinations of the data are ambiguous. The paper concludes by examining the impact of concentration on employment and investment rates using a dynamic heterogeneous panel estimation methodology. We find that increased concentration unambiguously lowers employment. For investment rates, increased inequality of market share serves to raise investment rates, while falling firm numbers for any given inequality of market share lowers investment rates. The difference can be interpreted as the distinct impact that the pursuit of managerial objectives (large market share promoting further productive capacity expansion) and that market contestability (under falling numbers of firms in an industry, monopolistic incentives to curtail productive capacity rise) have on investment.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

This rule differs from the one obtained by Sen for the case of identical agents. We also show for a large class of sharing rules that if Nash equilibrium yields efficient allocations, the production function displays constant returns to scale, a case in which cooperation in production is useless.
D29|Considerations regarding the Formulation of the Organisational Strategy through Simulation Techniques|The complexity, dimension and the scope of the economic problems specific to the correct development of organisational strategie require, on the one hand, the structuring and systematisation of their entire simulation activity in view of solving them. On the other hand, they require the adequacy of a relative independence resulted from the very nature of thinking, personality and professional education of those who wants to promote a certain type of organisational strategy. In other words, we can consider that the stages of creating a strategy simulation, although they are not compulsory, they cannot be entirely neglected, because there is minimum number of stages and sub-stages for which the optional character is not permitted. The entire decisional simulation cycle of a strategy obeys the three research levels: analysis, designing and management of the simulation activity.
D29|Budget deficits as devices for appropriating extra funds: An investigation of sharing rules|This paper considers a model with a sponsor and several bureaus to analyse the role of sharing rules. Various incentives for budget overspending are identified; among them the overspending of budgets due to soft budget constraints. Four different sharing rules are also considered that differ with respect to their strategic properties and whether the share is exogenous or endogenous. The results show that sharing on the basis of egalitarian principles yields a lower budget deficit than sharing based upon relative deficits both in symmetric and asymmetric games. The ranking of deficits that follow from sharing based upon relative budgets and sharing that equalises ex-post debt ratios is shown to depend on the properties of the health production function.

In this paper, learning curves arising out of routing problems are investigated by means of numerical simulations, whereas some properties of the learning curves arising out of sequencing problems are analyzed by means of a computational model. In both cases, the arousal of organizational learning curves is conceived as the emergence of routines. In both cases, the conditions for this to occur are that (i) there are sufficiently many novel possibilities of arranging the units composing the organization, and that (ii) these units are sufficiently many and sufficiently flexible.
D29|Detection of Possible Tax-Evasive Transfer Pricing in Multinational Enterprises|In this paper we analyze possible source of tax evasion in the multinational entity (hereinafter “MNE”). We show that the tax obligation of the whole MNE depends on the ownership structure of companies, which form MNE and that the structure could be described by matrix form. Therefore the basic tax optimization tasks of MNE via transfer pricing can be understood as linear programming problems. In addition we propose a way to identify possible tax evasion realized via transfer pricing in MNE.

We highlight organizations' capacities to adapt and contribute to institutional changes by implementing economical activities and participating to policy making processes. We show that organizations play a key role in the regulation of farm sectors, and that their success depends on the institutional and organizational thickness they have contributed to create in each sector and responds to a path-dependent logic. ...French Abstract : Nous menons une étude comparative de quatre filières agricoles au Costa Rica, qui repose sur une analyse dynamique des comportements des acteurs des filières au regard des changements institutionnels liés à la libéralisation économique. Les organisations de producteurs agricoles, qui jouent un rôle clé dans la régulation des filières, ont opté pour des comportements stratégiques différents. Nous mettons en évidence les capacités de ces organisations à s'adapter mais également à contribuer aux changements institutionnels en mettant en place des activités technico-économiques de transformation et commercialisation et en participant aux processus de négociation des politiques. Nous montrons que leur succès dépend de la densité institutionnelle et organisationnelle qu'elles ont contribué à créer au sein de chaque filière et s'inscrit dans une logique de dépendance au sentier.

If it is true that people express themselves about organizational issues in ambiguous terms then one needs to address this ambiguity instead of the ‘problems’ to find an answer on the methodological question.
D29|Investment Behavior Of U.S. Firms Over Heterogeneous Capital Goods: A Snapshot|Previous research has shown that the composition of investment and capital can matter for investment dynamics and productivity. However, very little is known about the composition of investment at the micro level. The goal of this note is to help fill this knowledge gap by assessing the nature of the cross‐firm variation in investment composition using micro data from the 1998 Annual Capital Expenditure Survey (ACES), a sample of roughly 30,000 firms drawn from the private, nonfarm economy. The data reveal substantial variation that can be characterized by heterogeneous lumpiness of investment in the asset‐type dimension. The data also show that some of the variation in investment composition is due to the state of firms’ total investment; specifically, computers account for a significantly larger share of firms’ incremental investment than of lumpy investment.
D29|Forest Management : Are Double or Mixed Rotations Desirable?|In this paper, we study a particular uneven-aged forest stand management pattern that is often advocated in practice. The forest structure under consideration is similar to a normalized forest à la Faustmann, with the following difference: rather than being single aged, each forest tract contains trees of two age classes so that it is submitted to a form of selective cutting. Each harvest involves all of the older trees and only a fraction of the younger ones; hence the name mixed rotation. Trees left standing at harvest help stimulate natural regeneration and improve various environmental and amenity characteristics of the forest. We model this effect by using a cost function that varies with respect to the harvest rate of younger trees. We derive the properties that this cost function must exhibit in order some form of mixed rotation to be superior to the conventional single rotation à la Faustmann; we also characterize the mixed rotation in terms of duration and the harvest rate of younger trees, and we compare its properties with Faustman's rule.
D29|El mercado venezolano en las exportaciones colombianas: dependencia de los exportadores en 2006|En este documento se analiza el comportamiento reciente de las exportaciones a Venezuela. A nivel de firma, se analiza la dependencia de los ingresos frente a las ventas realizadas al vecino país en 2006. Para esto se utilizó la base de comercio exterior del Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadística ( dane ), y los balances de la Supersociedades. Esta revisión muestra que las ventas a Venezuela han crecido de manera importante en el último año, y representan una porción significativa del total de exportaciones del país. A nivel de firma, se observa que la mayoría de las empresas concentraron en Venezuela una porción significativa de sus ventas al exterior, pero éstas no fueron la principal fuente de sus ingresos operacionales. No obstante, un número reducido de firmas, que efectuaron una parte importante de las exportaciones a dicho país, registraron una alta dependencia de sus ingresos operacionales. Se encontró también que los exportadores a Venezuela tienden a especializarse en unos pocos mercados, en lugar de diversificar destinos. Ésta tendencia se ha reforzado durante el auge de los últimos años, pues una proporción alta de exportadores a Venezuela abandonó los demás destinos a los que vendía para atender únicamente éste mercado.

D29|Reflexiones de economía política: la justicia social en la obra de Léon Walras|Este documento presenta una interpretación del pensamiento económico, político y social de Léon Walras. Su obra, además de ser un llamado al uso del lenguaje matemático, como herramienta explicativa de las relaciones económicas, es un intento por conectar la naturaleza propia del interés material y la justicia social. Su propuesta de una política monetaria que ordena progresivamente la combinación de cuatro sistemas monetarios (monometalismo plata, bimetalismo, billón regulador y monometalismo oro), mientras que el Estado por medio de un impuesto único a la renta se convierte en copropietario de la tierra, constituyen una reflexión sobre la propiedad y las instituciones, que favorecen la actividad económica. El pensamiento walrasiano muestra una coherencia interna de sus argumentos más compleja que la simple percepción reduccionista realizada a su modelo de equilibrio general.
D29|Efficiency measurement and regulation in US telecommunications: A robustness analysis|The paper investigates the robustness of different efficiency measures that can support the implementation of diverse forms of incentive regulation in the context of US telecommunications. Comparisons, in terms of an output orientation, are considered for efficiency scores obtained from data envelopment analysis (DEA), distance function (with corrected ordinary least squares and a random effects model) and distance function embedded in a stochastic frontier framework (with time-invariant, time-varying efficiencies or with inefficiency effects). Similar to the previous empirical literature, one finds, in most cases, only a moderate consistency across the different approaches. In fact, the different spectrum of techniques imposed varied degrees of structure in the error term and indicated non-negligible discrepancies across the different measurement approaches in terms of the ranking structure, degree of persistence and best- and worst-practice patterns.
D29|How can we Study Innovation Systems? - introducing an actor-centralised perspective|The systems of innovation approach has helped advocating a view on innovation as dependent on the interaction over time between different actors and brought the role of institutions to the center of interest. However, the approach has remained a general framework rather than evolved into an analytical tool for the study of the dynamics of innovation activities. In this discussion paper, we introduce the concept of innovation system services, defined as the set of factors that have a significant potential influence on the opportunities of a certain groups of actors to perform a certain type of activities efficiently. We suggest that the relevant innovation system for the actors-activities nexus at hand can be defined as this set of system services. We examine this analytical framework in a case study on R&D investments of multinational enterprises in Sweden. In this context, innovation system services are defined as the set of external factors that the case study suggests to have significant impact on the decisions of MNEs to invest in R&D in Sweden. The focus on services allows us to analyse the influence of an innovation system on the long-term development of R&D in Sweden in a structured and coherent manner and to identify critical dynamics.

Nous étudions un cas particulier d'aménagement forestier inéquien qui est recommandé dans la pratique actuelle. La structure de la forêt est similaire à une forêt normalisée à la Faustmann avec la différence suivante: au lieu d'être équien, chaque lot comporte deux classes d'âge; il est soumis à une forme de coupe sélective. À chaque récolte, on coupe tous les arbres les plus vieux ainsi qu'une fraction des arbres les plus jeunes; d'où le nom de rotation mixte. Les arbres non coupés aident la régénération naturelle et améliorent diverses caractéristiques environnementales et esthétiques de la forêt. Nous modélisons cet effet en utilisant une fonction de coût qui varie avec le taux de récolte des arbres jeunes. Nous dérivons les propriétés que cette fonction de coût doit satisfaire pour que la rotation mixte soit préférable à la rotation standard à la Faustmann; nous caractérisons la rotation mixte en termes de durée et de taux de récolte des jeunes arbres, que nous comparons avec le cas de Faustmann.
D29|Corporate abilities|This brief paper aims to discuss (as a review) the notion of organisational/corporate abilities, a term that, albeit frequently used in the business world, often presents ambiguities in terms of its meaning. We tried to uncover an exact definition for it using different approaches, as well as models of organisational description and/or diagnostic value; however, none of these could provide us with a distinct answer. As the paper could not afford to undertake the introduction of every single approach that has so far been laid down in this subject, we cannot endeavour to formulate our own definition; our work only serves to illustrate that the concept has deeper meanings and thus cannot be used without interpretation. It can have different meanings, which sometimes inhibits the factual description of a given scenario, even though that is what terminologies are usually for. We have concluded that an accurate definition of the concept would be essential, as those specialising in organisational science could benefit from its standardised use.
D29|Entrepreneurial Morality: Some Indications from Greece|In countries with relatively small firms, entrepreneurial morality is determined by the influences that shape the values, the personality and the character of entrepreneurs as owners and managers of their enterprises. To shed some light on the processes involved we estimate an ordered probit model using data from 1643 enterprises, which were collected in Greece in the spring of 2006. We find that localized and generalized morality, the family and the educational environment, the level of education, the size of firms, and the moral factors that contribute to success in business, determine entrepreneurial morality in a statistically significant way. By contrast, even though we experimented with such other influences as the age of enterprises, the gender of entrepreneurs, the location of schools where they grew up, etc., none of them turned out to exert perceptible impacts.
D29|Two Lyapunov Functions for Flexible Organizations|Since the second half of the past century, increasingly flexible organizational forms are appearing among firms. However, while hierarchies are easily described, too few mathematical tools are available for flexible organizations. In this article, two Lyapunov functions are proposed in order to assess the state and trend of flexible organizations. The first of these functions is based on information waste. The second function is based on duplication of operations. The underlying idea is that firms tend towards organizational configurations where waste of information and duplication of operations are minimized.

D29|On the Necessity of Using Average Cost as a Base for Transfer Price|Both older and recent literature on transfer pricing is not unified about the opinion whether optimal transfer price should be equal to marginal cost of supplying company and set by centralized decision (of vertically integrated multibusiness enterprise headquarters) or whether it should be set by negotiation or even set on level of market (arms-length) price. Those, who argue for setting transfer price by negotiation or at the market price base their arguments on market imperfections like information asymmetry, motivation of managers, et cetera. This paper deals inter alia with problem of methodology transfer pricing mathematical modelling. We prove that optimal transfer price should be equal to average cost of the supplying division plus part (or whole) economic profit of the multibusiness enterprise, independent on the market conditions at the market of either intermediate or final product. Setting transfer price on the level of marginal cost is inefficient and would earlier or later lead to loss of multibusiness enterprise’s ability to compete its rivals. Applicability of results of our research on multinational enterprises gives us possibility to use it for further research on optimal design of transfer pricing rules setting and of multinationals’ taxation.
D29|Food chain management for sustainable food system development: a European research agenda| Food Chain Management is a rather new research domain. As a consequence, the domain and the research challenges within the domain are not yet clearly defined. This corresponds with the variety in the definition of food chains and networks that might focus on either closely cooperating enterprises along the value chain with an executive coordination element or, alternatively, on a network of enterprises in dynamically evolving business relationships. Management challenges in closely cooperating enterprises are closely linked to challenges in enterprise management and can draw on research in this domain; however, management activities in and for networks involve additional challenges that require focused research engagement. The dependency of all participants in the chain on consumers as the ultimate customers and the dependency of the quality of final products on the engagement of all participants in the production and distribution of products require new managerial activities and, in turn, support by research. This article discusses the background of future research needs and formulates priority challenges for managerial improvements toward an increased sustainability of the food sector. &lsqb;JEL classifications: Q010, Q130, D290, L140&rsqb; © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
D29|Factores estratégicos de éxito de las empresas de inserción|Work integration social enterprises are an emerging reality in the Spanish State, and both the number of such enterprises and the resources allocated to this area by the different regional Authorities are increasing exponentially. However, the studies carried out to date are largely descriptive or explanatory, and have hardly touched on aspects relating to the management of these enterprises. In this article we set out to identify the fundamental factors linked to the business success of work integration social enterprises as an evaluation of the efficiency of such projects. The proposed hypothesis links a set of factors taken from the literature, which are considered independent variables, with the dependent variable of success. The hypotheses have been proven by an empirical analysis based on a telephone survey.

D29|Favoriser l’innovation radicale dans une entreprise multidivisionnelle. Extension du modèle ambidextre à partir de l’analyse d’un cas|(VF)Le modèle d’organisation ambidextre constitue l’une des réponses avancées par la littérature pour développer des innovations radicales dans les grandes entreprises. Il met en avant la coexistence d’unités dédiées à l’exploitation et d’autres à l’exploration et au développement de ces innovations. L’articulation de ces unités, à la fois séparées et intégrées, a été peu étudiée. Sur la base d’une étude longitudinale d’une nouvelle unité organisationnelle créée pour favoriser l’innovation dans une grande entreprise multidivisionnelle, nous ca-ractérisons plusieurs modes d’intégration situés à des niveaux dif-férents et fondés sur des mécanismes variés.(VA)The obstacles to the development of radical innovation in established firms have been widely studied. The ambidextrous organization is one of the answers proposed by the literature. In this organization, specific units are dedicated to the exploration, others to the exploitation and development of radical innovation. But the integration of these specific units into the rest of the firm has not been studied in detail. Our research is based on a longitudinal analysis of a new organisational entity created to enhance innovation in a multidivisional firm. We specify the activities deployed by this specific entity and the way it is integrated into the firm. We also show how this unit participates in divisional reconfiguration.

The state of five competitive forces in both industries will depend always of evolution of these industries and government policies of the different countries of the world. For example if these industries are growing and if the govern permit others companies can enter into industry and can help to promote the competition in these industries, that is good for buyers, because they can choose where want to purchase something and what products or goods are according to their necessities or that permits to maximize their utility and it is according to their money amount available for it.
D29|Recent trend of village and small enterprise sector: exploring and exploiting its opportunities in the North Eastern Region of India touching upon its profile and barriers|Development of village, micro and small enterprises in India has a special significance with regard to bridging up the disparities between urban and rural sectors of the economy on the one hand and the more industrialized and the less industrialized states on the other. It would also channelize to the mainstream the forces of development in the rural and remote areas presently strewn with the immense possibilities of manufacturing and service activities. Mahatma Gandhi had envisioned this long back, but Indian planners exhibited their preference to development of large-scale industries first. However, after having taken a step further to globalization and liberalization, India has recognized the relevance of small enterprises. Enactment of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 is an instance of the action taken in the wake of this recognition. The North Eastern Region (NER) of India comprises eight states: Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura, all well known for their handicrafts. The Schedule Tribes form the majority of population there. Most of these states are hilly and have remained agriculturally as well as industrially backward. Promotion of small enterprises is most suitable for their timely development. In this paper we present a statistically detailed profile of small enterprises in the NER. We explore the possibilities of development of the small enterprises sector and discuss the constraints on the same.
D29|Impact des infrastructures publiques sur la productivité des entreprises au Sénégal<BR>[Impact of public infrastructures on firms productivity in Senegal]|This paper intends to measure the effects of public infrastructures on firms’ productivity from a sample of 10 subsectors of the Senegalese modern sector. The model used for that purpose is based on the decomposition of the Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth which includes the contribution of the capital of infrastructures. Innovative econometric techniques such as Fully Modified OLS (FMOLS) are made use of guaranteeing the robustness of estimates. Our findings reveal that public capital significantly contributes to the productivity growth through cost reduction. Moreover, over the period 2000 – 2004, the growth rate of the public infrastructures is considered to be satisfactory since it is located beyond the minimal level required to improve the PTF.

Thus, the network reconstructs collective decision-making by the productive system. This model focuses on the decision to invest in novel fields of activity, which requires that managers recognize the emergence of a new technological pattern. Recognizing the value of information is not obvious, since it depends on a firm's mental categories. For instance, in 1964 Olivetti sold its electronics division in the firm belief, well supported by a tradition of excellence in mechanics, that computers would never substitute typing machines.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

We cover a diversity of rankings: U.S., worldwide, E.U., those of developed academic nations and those of developing academic nations. Each method rests on a specific goal: while some identify top-notch research, others reflect quantity and thus are able to discriminate down the ranking. We also document novelties in ranking-construction such as sensitivity analysis, parallel rankings, instant updates and journal weights based on impact-adjusted impact factors.
D29|Productivity development and privatisation of the potable water and sewage sector in Chile|The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of privatisation on productivity development in the Chilean potable water and sewage sector. We have access to high quality firm level data making it possible to study the effects on a firm level. Productivity development is studied by means of a Malmquist productivity index. Total productivity is divided into efficiency change and technical change. These three components are then analysed against privatisation with the use of a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. The main result is that we do not find any significant effects of privatisation on productivity development.
D29|Reputation, trust and the dynamics of leadership in communities of practice|The aim of this article is to propose a theoretical framework describing the internal organization of communities of practice in a dynamic perspective. More precisely, we argue that communities of practice adopt some specific patterns of internal organization where some of their members obtain a leadership status. Leaders contribute to cognitive advance of the community of practice by providing members with a consistent and coherent vision of its objectives. We identify two of their attributes as important for allowing them to fulfil their task: informational mimesis and mediation. Finally, we propose a simulation model describing the emergence of leadership as the outcome of a self-organizing process. We find that leaders correspond to members who are characterized by higher levels of activity in the community. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2006

Such an analysis is a challenge in and of itself, since the service sector covers a broad range of activities, with different market dynamics and trajectories, making generalization difficult. This article seeks to contribute to this analysis, examining the definition of cluster based on the experience of the so-called Recife Medical Hub, a group of companies located in close physical proximity. We wanted to determine whether the elements on which the concept of cluster is based could also be applied to the service sector. To this end, we sought to reconcile different theoretical references: the literature on industrial districts, on economic transactions and innovation economy, all focused on the industrial sector, with the specifics of health care, the subject of this study.
D29|Microeconomics of Knowledge: African Case|Since the process of globalization era, we can always lived in economics of knowledge. The cicle of economics founded on knowledge are compost by three components: the investment in knowledge; the production and the diffusion of information technology and communication (ITC) and the institutional mechanisms that favor the access to knowledge (Foray, 2004). By fact the economics are divided in Micro and Macroeconomics, this work has as objective to approach theme “Microeconomics of Knowledge” based on African case. We concluded that, in general analysis, South Africa and Tunisia are the countries of the selected with better performance in microeconomics of knowledge, and Angola, Chad and Ethiopia are poor countries in this area of knowledge. High rates of adult alphabetization can stimulate companies and firms to employ skilled personal according to their necessities and this personal can and it is ready to work with advanced technology and to effect R&D for development of their activities.
D29|Entrepreneurship and Economic Theory|Let us define entrepreneurship as creativity and the evolution of novelty. Let us suppose, the main thesis of the chapter, that entrepreneurship is an action that does not differ from everyday action such as walking, driving, or chewing gum. If the definition and supposition are granted we can conclude that the theory of everyday action, such as walking or chewing gum, is one and the same as the theory of evolution. The conclusion is definitely strange if not extraordinary. It is based on a subtle but subversive thesis: There is no difference between everyday action and creativity or evolution. This conclusion is extraordinary only because it goes against the dominant dogmas in economics (i.e., neoclassical theory) and evolutionary biology (i.e., neo-Darwinian theory). Both dogmas draw a radical divide between action and evolution. For neo-Darwinian theory, action is phenotype ultimately determined by genotype—while the genotype evolves according to another mechanism. For neoclassical economics, action is determined by rational calculation of the efficient allocation of given resources—while resources evolve according to another mechanism. To undermine the radical divide between the theory of action and the theory of evolution, this chapter shows how everyday action—from walking, fetching water, to fishing—is entrepreneurial at first level of approximation—and hence should be the basis of the theory of evolution.

D29|Deslocalizaciones y empleo cooperativo. El caso de Fagor Electrodomésticos, S. Coop|This paper looks at the question of industrial relocation and its impact on cooperative employment from a theoretical and empirical perspective. In defining and contextualising the relocation phenomenon, the paper starts by analysing its scale, causes and some of its consequences in the context of globalisation. Following this theoretical analysis, the paper then embarks on a case study of economic and social aspects in the international expansion of Fagor Electrodomésticos S. Coop. Fagor is attempting to consolidate its position in the European domestic appliance market in a climate in which production is being concentrated and relocated in the east and the threat of Asian competition looms large. It is doing so by pursuing an international growth strategy that has led to it setting up in countries such as Morocco, Argentina, Poland and France. The paper thus sets out to examine the business, economic, social and cooperative implications of this strategy. By way of conclusion, we put forward some possible strategies for the cooperative world to deal with the challenge of globalisation and relocation.
D29|Evaluación y gestión eficiente en el sector público: aspectos organizativos e institucionales|The present article gives details about the organisational and institutional aspects that have influence on the development of an efficient public management and on the function of the evaluative systems of public activities. These processes, that allow an efficient management of information, are analysed from an Organisation Economy focus, and which are at the same time the bases of the adequate function of the systems of intern and extern control. Likewise, the basic demanded requirements are checked for the establishment of the incentive systems that are based on results, which is an essential instrument at the securing an efficient public management. The optimum election of the instruments used in the development of the public management is also analysed from an organisational perspective. The article concludes on a comparison of two types of an organisational architecture; a decentralized one with an autonomy in the operational management, and another one which is centralised and has an hierarchy when adopting management decisions.
D29|A Measure of Media Bias|"We measure media bias by estimating ideological scores for several major media outlets. To compute this, we count the times that a particular media outlet cites various think tanks and policy groups, and then compare this with the times that members of Congress cite the same groups. Our results show a strong liberal bias: all of the news outlets we examine, except Fox News' Special Report and the Washington Times, received scores to the left of the average member of Congress. Consistent with claims made by conservative critics, CBS Evening News and the New York Times received scores far to the left of center. The most centrist media outlets were PBS NewsHour, CNN's Newsnight, and ABC's Good Morning America; among print outlets, USA Today was closest to the center. All of our findings refer strictly to news content; that is, we exclude editorials, letters, and the like. ""The editors in Los Angeles killed the story. They told Witcover that it didn't ‘come off’ and that it was an ‘opinion’ story.… The solution was simple, they told him. All he had to do was get other people to make the same points and draw the same conclusions and then write the article in their words"" (emphasis in original).

The economic and policy environment in Ukraine has changed since reform began in 1991. Many policy changes have exerted offsetting economic pressures on efficiency. Enterprise privatization and the liberalization of prices and trade put upward pressure on technical efficiency, whereas start-stop land privatization efforts, unpredictable government intervention, and slow developments in the credit and labor markets put downward pressure on efficiency. We found that technical efficiency appears to have improved slightly over the 1991-1996 period, suggesting that the positive forces had more impact.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

A shadow cost function is specified, and the deviation of shadow from actual prices is modeled as a function of the level of economy-wide inflation, as well as other conditioning variables like budget deficits and changes in inflation rate. It is found that inflation is associated with significant allocative costs in most Greek manufacturing sectors. Measures of cost gains resulting from Greece's convergence towards the EMU are provided and the policy implications are explored.

To answer this question, an exploratory study focused on ten french worker cooperatives in 1998 and 1999, during which we conducted interviews with their managing directors. The results show that three forms of collective entrepreneurship can be distinguished and that these forms depend on the context and the management of these worker cooperatives.

Information systems exist to increase an organization’s ability to create value using intellectual capital. A theoretical explanation of value might therefore be useful to increase the likelihood that IS/IT professionals would design and deploy systems in ways that increase value for stakeholders. This paper proposes Satisfaction Attainment Theory (SAT) as causal model of value creation. An organizational stakeholder is a person whose wellbeing might be advanced by an organization. Perceptions of value have reference to some object-of-value. The term, object, in the context of this paper, means anything to which one could ascribe value – e.g. goods, services, states, or outcomes. SAT assumes that people hold multiple, conflicting goals, and so must sacrifice the yield of some goal to attain others. It posits that an individual automatically and subconsciously sets an expectation for some level of utility from attaining a goal and assesses the likelihood that a goal will be attained. It also posits that individuals automatically and subconsciously assess yield the yield of a Set of Salient Goals (SSG). Any perceived Shift in the Yield Assessment (SYA) for the salient set of goals is automatically accompanied by an affective arousal proportional to and with a valence in the direction of the perceived SYA. SAT proposes that the value of an object is a positive function of the SYA that occurs when an individual contemplates sacrificing the yield of other goals to obtain the yield that could be derived from the object. Value is therefore created by making an individual aware of an opportunity to attain a positive SYA by sacrificing the yield of one set of goals to attain the yield of another set.
D29|On and off the beaten path: How individuals broker knowledge through formal and informal networks|Although informal networks are often emphasized as facilitating knowledge transfer, we use network data obtained from a multi-unit high-tech firm to show that the formal network also significantly contributes to inter-unit knowledge transfer. Individuals centrally placed in a network are, in addition, more involved in knowledge transfer, especially, the evidence suggests, in the case of the formal network. Focusing on the brokerage roles that individual fulfill, we find that knowledge transfer between units is more likely to occur through externally oriented brokers than internally oriented brokers in the formal network, but not in the informal network. Overall, the results show that there is more than one path to transfer knowledge.
D29|"""Managing for Outcomes"" in the New Zealand Public Management System"|Managing for Outcomes is the process by which central agencies and Ministers are seeking to promote a results focus within the New Zealand public management system. This paper argues that if a results focus is to truly be introduced to the New Zealand public management system then all aspects of the wider system will need to be amended, in order to support a general cultural change. In promoting this view the paper provides a summary of the system as it currently stands and considers how the structural, financial, strategic and performance management elements of the wider public management system could be amended to support an outcomes focus within the core New Zealand public service.
D29|Does Work Time Flexibility Work? An Empirical Assessment of the Efficiency Effects for German Firms|In this paper we assess the impact of flexible work time schedules on firm efficiency using representative establishment data for Germany. Following the approach by Battese and Coelli (1995), we estimate a stochastic production frontier and the determinants of technical efficiency simultaneously. The innovation of our study is that we draw on technical efficiency instead of productivity to appraise the success of flexible working hours. The results indicate that while the use of work time schedules with moderate flexibility is positively related to technical efficiency, highly flexible work time arrangements seem to be negatively correlated with an efficient organization of the work flow. However, these efficiency losses should not be interpreted as causal effects, because highly flexible work time schedules are most likely to be introduced in struggling firms.
D29|Increasing quasiconcave production and utility functions with diminishing returns to scale|In microeconomic analysis functions with diminishing returns to scale (DRS) have frequently been employed. Various properties of increasing quasiconcave aggregator functions with DRS are derived. Furthermore duality in the classical sense as well as of a new type is studied for such aggregator functions in production and consumer theory. In particular representation theorems for direct and indirect aggregator functions are obtained. These involve only small sets of generator functions. The study is carried out in the contemporary framework of abstract convexity and abstract concavity.
D29|Impactos del comercio justo del vino. Tres casos de empresas colectivas de productores en Chile|The export of finished products such as wine fulfils one of the objectives of fair trade which is to let the producing countries obtain maximum revenue. The authors studies three organizations that are part of the fair trade wine sector: Los Robles, a sexagenarian winemaking cooperative; El Corazón, a cooperative that is a providing member of Los Robles; Sagrada Familia, a relative young organization present in the alternative market from its foundation. These three organizations are associated with the same organization of fair trade: Oxfram-Wereldwinkels. After presenting the reality of wine-growers, the authors analyzed the three organizations by defining their emerging conditions, their governance structure and their value chain activities. They then evaluated the impacts of being part of the movement of fair trade. After finding that these impacts were different in each case, the authors concluded that the performance of fair trade was closely linked with a mutual relationship between the participants. Furthermore, the authors indicate the importance of cooperation in commercial fair trade not only between the North and South, but also within the organizations located in the South.
D29|Risk taking in selection contests|We study selection contests in which the strategic variable is degree of risk rather than amount of effort. The selection efficiency of such contests is examined. We show that the selection efficiency of a contest may be improved by limiting the competition in two ways; a) by having a small number of contestants, and b) by restricting contestant quality. The results may contribute to the understanding of phenomena like promotion processes in large firms, selection of fund managers and research tournaments.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D29|An assessment system for rating scientific journals in the field of ergonomics and human factors|"A method for selecting and rating scientific and professional journals representing the discipline of ergonomics and human factors is proposed. The method is based upon the journal list, impact factors and citations provided by the Institute of Scientific Information (ISI), and the journal list published in the Ergonomics Abstracts. Three groups of journals were distinguished. The ""ergonomics journals"" focus exclusively on ergonomics or human factors. The ""related journals"" focus on other disciplines than ergonomics or human factors, but regularly publish ergonomics/human factors papers. The ""basic journals"" focus on other technical, medical or social sciences than ergonomics, but are important for the development of ergonomics/human factors. Journal quality was rated using a maximum of four categories: top quality (A-level), high quality (B-level), good quality (C-level)) and professional (P-level). The above methods were applied to develop journal ratings for the year 2003. A total of 24 'ergonomics journals', 58 'related journals' and 142 'basic journals' were classified."
D29|"""De Mens is de Maat van Alle Dingen""; Over Mensgericht Ontwerpen van Producten en Processen"|"""Man is the measure of all things"". On human-centered design of products and processes. The discipline of ergonomics studies the interaction between man and the designed technical and organizational environment. In product ergonomics, this knowledge is used to develop user-friendly products and in production ergonomics to design human-friendly (production) processes. Beside social goals, ergonomics can contribute to economic goals of an organization. With user-friendly products, a company can deliver benefits to its customers, which exceed those of competing products. With human-friendly production processes, a company can increase labor productivity and consequently can reach important cost-reductions. The growing consciousness of the importance of humans (customers and workers) for the success of organizations, implies that ergonomics can have a strategic value for the management of organizations. The chair of Ergonomics Management addresses the questions how ergonomics knowledge and methods can be used in the decision-making and design processes of organizations, and what can be the resulting business benefits."
D29|Dos caras de la capacidad empresarial: una alternativa a la noción popular|Entrepreneurship has become a prominent and strategically important issue when talking about the driving forces of prosperity and job creation. However, entrepreneurship seems to be poorly defined. The paper studies central assumptions by questioning what many contemporaries take for granted. The paper shows that it is necessary to define the term “entrepreneurship”. Recent arguments should distinguish the difference, sometimes contradictory, between the phenomenon of dynamic fast growing firms and that of the emergence of new microenterprises of the self-employed that have neither the intention nor the possibility of growing. Economic policy debate should specify more precisely what is really meant when talking about entrepreneurship.
D29|Transformaciones en la agricultura colombiana entre 1990 y 2002|The Colombian agrarian sector suffered a significant transformation of its structure of production during the nineties. A whole range of crops and productive activities that were supported in previous decades by commercial protection policies and different types of subsidies collapsed, while some permanent and other labor intensive crops (fruits and vegetables) and live stock breeding were able to grow. These changes in the structure of production have important redistributive implications not only between classes of producers but also between producers and consumers.
D29|Vote Buying Through Resource Allocation in a Government Controlled Sector|Standard spatial models of political competition give rise to equilibria in which the competing political parties or candidates converge to a common position. In this paper I show how political polarization can be generated in models that focus on the nexus between pre-election interest group lobbying and electoral competition.
D29|On the production of victory: Empirical determinants of battlefield success in modern war| Using a data set of historical battles from 1600 to 1973, this paper analyzes the empirical determinants of tactical success in modern war. Based on a reduced form approach we consider key elements of military theory as production factors for combat success as an output of a military production function. The paper focuses on the relationship of material and non-material factors to battlefield success, and especially on the role of superior force strengths. Contrary to the emphasis on technology which can be found in the recent literature, our estimation results indicate that numerical superiority has retained its crucial role for battlefield performance throughout history. In general, human elements of warfare, like leadership, morale and surprise, have continued to be important determinants of battle outcome despite technological progress in weapons.
D29|Community Perceptions of Unmeasured Quality Improvement in Goods and Services|Because of the costs involved in such exercises, current productivity measures do not necessarily fully take into account changes in the quality of goods and services over time. This paper outlines the derivation of measures that lead to quantification of the “community preference for its perceptions of improved unmeasured quality” in products. The measures are based on the proposition that individuals behave in such a manner as to maximise their quality of life. This is expressed by the individual’s choices in her purchase of quantity, quality and type of goods and services. This choice reflects her particular trade-offs, given her level of spending. The government is responsive to the community’s choices in terms of the services it produces. In aggregate, this is expressed in an economy by the choice of goods and services purchased. The measures that are derived are not grounded in production theory, but the “payment for output” measure can be related to theory assuming competitive markets and profit maximising, efficient firms. This paper first shows the development of a “payment for output” of goods and services from an entity measure. From this the “community preference for output increases” measure was developed. Using the mining industry as a basis and the wholesaling industry as a check, a measure of changes in the “community preference for its perceptions of improved unmeasured quality” in other entities in an economy is derived. These two community preference measures for an entity are relative to what is on offer in the whole economy and are not absolute measures, in contrast to productivity (incorporating changes in measured quality) estimates. For Australia as a whole in the 1989-90 to 1998-99 period, the annual multifactor productivity (MFP) increase was 1.64 percent and the annual increase in community preference for its perceptions of improved unmeasured quality was 0.31 percent. The addition of the two measures therefore represents an increase of 19 percent on the MFP figure alone. A measure of the efficiency of an economy in responding to changing community preferences is also derived.
D29|Talfahrt der Ausrüstungsinvestitionen gebremst - erste Lichtblicke im Geschäftsklima der Leasingbranche|Nach den neuesten Ergebnissen des ifo Konjunkturtests Leasing zeigen die Werte für das vierte Quartal 2001 eine leichte Verbesserung. Bei der Beurteilung der aktuellen Geschäftslage gewannen die positiven Einflüsse etwas an Gewicht: Fast jedes dritte Leasingunternehmen bewertete die Lage als günstig. Auch die Aussichten hellten sich auf, die Geschäftserwartungen für das erste Halbjahr 2002 wurden mit vorsichtigem Optimismus bedacht: 29% der Testteilnehmer erwarten einen günstigeren Geschäftsverlauf. Um jedoch von einem eindeutigen Hinweis auf eine Trendwende sprechen zu können, müssen sich die Zukunftseinschätzungen der Unternehmen mehrmals hintereinander verbessern.
D29|Leasing: Mit kleinen Schritten aus der Talsohle|Nach den neuesten Ergebnissen des ifo Konjunkturtests Leasing hat sich das Geschäftsklima wieder verschlechtert. Die geglätteten Werte zeigen aber nach oben, das Geschäftsklima dürfte die Talsohle nun durchschritten haben. Die konjunkturelle Erholung schreitet aber nur langsam voran, das Geschäftsklima ist noch ein gutes Stück vom vergleichbaren Vorjahreswert entfernt. Die aktuelle Geschäftslage hat sich weiter verschlechtert, dennoch überwogen noch immer - wenn auch nur knapp - die günstigen Geschäftslageurteile. Jedes fünfte Unternehmen bewertete im zweiten Quartal die aktuelle Lage als günstig, 68% als zufriedenstellend, aber 12% der Testteilnehmer empfanden die Lage mittlerweile als schlecht. Die Unternehmen setzten weniger Vertrauen in die kommenden Entwicklung als noch im März. Für das Gesamtjahr 2002 ist daher kaum noch eine positive Wachstumsrate der Leasinginvestitionen zu erwarten, sondern eher Stagnation. Die schwache Investitionskonjunktur schlägt sich auch in den Beschäftigtenzahlen nieder: Das Beschäftigungswachstum verlor bereits seit den Sommermonaten 2000 an Tempo. Nach den Befragungsergebnissen hielten sich Personaleinstellungen und -abgänge die Waage. Insbesondere die kleineren Gesellschaften haben ihr Personal in etwa gehalten, die größeren haben dagegen eher Mitarbeiter entlassen. Die Erwartungen für die nächste Zeit sind unverkennbar von Vorsicht geprägt, die Beschäftigung dürfte deshalb auch im dritten Quartal im Großen und Ganzen stagnieren.
D29|Theoretical consistency property applied to the micro-economic modelling with flexible functional forms|The paper brings a survey of flexible functional forms and summarizes the theoretical properties of several economic functional types (indirect utility, cost, expenditure function and the appropriate input demand systems). The notions of flexibility of the functional fonn (relating to the character of its parameters), consistency with the economic theory (considered in contexts of producer and consumer behaviour) and the domain of applicability (towards admissible values of independent variables) are discussed. The comparative example based on the TRANSLOG and the generalized Leontief unit cost function is chosen to elucidate the main topic of the article.
D29|Punctuality - A Cultural Trait as Equilibrium|A people's culture, norms and habits are important determinants not just of the quality of social life but of economic progress and growth. In this paper we take the view that while the importance of culture is undeniable, the innateness of culture is not. We work here with a single example and demonstrate how a human trait which is widely believed to be cultural is at the same time a matter of choice. The example that we shall work with concerns punctuality. We show that punctuality may be simply an equilibrium response of individuals to what they expect others to do. The same society can get caught in a punctual equilibrium or a non-punctual equilibrium.
D29|Racionalidad y cooperación entre firmas. Examen del comportamiento habitual de las industrias griegas|The aim of this empirical research was to test the influence of some social factors such as social norms, habits and routines, which are actually constraining the entrepreneurial strategy. In order to measure the extent of these influences we have focused on informal arrangements and cooperation between firms, including informal relations, trust links, family links etc. Firms having long term informal relations benefit from lower costs of making transactions enforceable, including the costs of information and planning, and furthermore protect themselves from the hazards of opportunism. In doing so, firms do cooperate consciously adopting patterns of behaviour that largely exceed market arrangements. This is true not only for non-competing firms (i.e. firms with client-customer relations) who have developed in that direction a nexus of diverse long-term strategies, but also for competing firms producing identical goods.
D29|The Investment Acceleration Principle Revisited by Means of a Neural Net|The investment acceleration principle is a heuristic for modeling investment time series out of consumption time series. The model presented herein develops a disaggregated accelerator equation whose coefficients are the weights of a Kohonen neural net that represents firms' decision-making. According to this model, investments take place when managers recognize emerging technological patterns. Furthermore, a technique borrowed from the theory of self-organizing systems is used in order to disentangle innovation-driven investments from plant- replication investments.
D29|Information Structure and Behaviour of a Textile Industrial District|This article presents a model of the structure of the information flows that underlie the creation of production chains between thousands of small textile firms located in Prato, central Italy. Contrary to most textile industry of western Europe and north America, Prato did not die out once average salaries in the region rose towards the world's highest. The reason is that Prato was able to switch from a competitive advantage based on low prices to a competitive advantage based on the aesthetical features and variety of textiles. Analysis of the structure of production chains can explain the performance of this distributed production system throughout its evolution. The model reconstructs interactions of ten types of Pratese firms from 1946 to 1993 on a scale 1:1.
D29|Nuove tecnologie e cambiamenti organizzativi: alcune implicazioni per le imprese italiane|The recent literature on the productivity gains due to the adoption of information and communication technologies (ICT) has stressed the importance of the complementarities between ICT and organizational change. The ICT enable to process and diffuse a large amount of information. The reduction in information costs facilitates a higher level of coordination. The organizational implementation of ICT requires two prerequisites: the codification of the organization processes and their standardization, necessary to allow a full information exchange among the different processes. The introduction of ICT is less costly and more effective in those kinds of internal and external corporate activities that prior to the change are already formalized. ICT diffusion is therefore faster in large firms and in the supply chains they dominate. The 2001 Survey on the investment of industrial firms with more than 50 employees (Invind) by the Bank of Italy shows a high degree of diffusion of the PCs, and other types of hardware in the Italian firms; most of them seem to use the Internet. There seems to be a clear link between firm size and the rate of adoption of the new technologies. The impact of new technologies on organizational change is still moderate and appears strongly related to firm size.
D29|Gouvernement d’entreprise et confiance : une comparaison internationale|[eng] Corporate Governance and Confidence . The referring corporate governance approach considers that the firm manager has a central position towards the other stakeholders (SH) : shareholders, employees, financial creditors. These SH invest specific capital into the firm. The mechanisms protecting each SH’s investment are compared in an international perspective. Trust exists when the mechanisms are uncompleted. The American and German models are dominant. In Germany, the shareholders have to grant an important trust to the firm manager whereas the financial creditors and the employees are enjoying important protection mechanisms. In the US, the protection mechanisms are playing inverse roles. . JEL classifications : G30, D29 [fre] L’approche du gouvernement d’entreprise retenue donne une place centrale au dirigeant par rapport aux autres stakeholders (SH) : actionnaires, salariés et créanciers financiers.

Y sont distingués les mécanismes ex ante, d’exit, de suivi actif et passif. La confiance existe quand ces mécanismes sont lacunaires. Les modèles américains et allemands sont dominants.

D29|Gouvernement d’entreprise et innovation|[eng] Corporate Governance and Innovation . Any attempt to address the relationship between corporate governance and innovation needs to distinguish the organisational and the institutional level of analysis. At the organisational level, the economic literature doesn’t give any response, as theories of the firm focusing on governance issues (whether it is shareholder or stakeholder model) fail to take into account the innovation process. At the institutional level, the author argues that the « short-termism bias » of outsider systems is not a convincing argument in favour of insider systems and that these two different corporate governance structures may help or hinder different types of innovations and investments. . JEL classifications : G30, D29, O31 [fre] Pour expliciter l’effet du gouvernement d’entreprise sur l’innovation, il est nécessaire de distinguer deux niveaux d’analyse, le niveau organisationnel et le niveau institutionnel. Au niveau organisationnel, les modèles shareholder et stakeholder s’appuient sur des constructions théoriques de la firme dans lesquelles le processus d’innovation est absent. Au niveau institutionnel, si l’argument de courtermisme du modèle outsider paraît peu pertinent, en revanche, l’hypothèse d’une influence de la structure de gouvernance sur la structure de l’investissement, et notamment la répartition entre investissement de R& D et investissement en capital fixe, est partiellement démontrée par divers travaux. .

D29|Determining Depreciations As A Two-Stage Problem|Within the framework of a hierarchical model, the paper determines depreciation rates for exhaustible facilities. It hierarchically integrates an investment model with a production model combining the tactical investment calculus with the operational cost accounting level. Using the anticipation procedure of hierarchical planning, depreciation rates, as part of the contribution margin of the operational production model, influence the anticipated cash flow of the net present value (NPV) criterion of the investment level. Hence, using a two-stage procedure depreciation rates are determined as NPV-optimal cost parameters. The paper fully accounts for a stochastic environment and compares numerically the two stage cost evaluation with linear depreciations.
D29|Creative Work Systems in Destructive Markets|"In the United States, the past twenty years have been marked by significant restructuring of both financial and physical corporate assets designed to strengthen firms' relative market position either voluntarily or in response to the threat of take-over. Firms have also restructured work systems in an effort to improve production efficiency, product quality and flexibility. While most studies find that these new workplace techniques generate substantive productivity and quality gains and financial results that are equal if not superior to those associated with more traditional work systems, in the U.S., they have proven difficult to maintain. Diffusion is slow and not extensive; and even the most promising cases have either failed or come under extreme pressure, both internal and external. Using the productive systems approach, our study examines the inter-relationship between ""creative"" work systems and ""destructive"" markets using a sample of U.S. manufacturing firms in the metalworking, jet engine production and steel processing industries."
D29|Betriebliche Altersversorgung: Neue ifo Erhebung zeigt Stabilisierungstendenzen|Die achte Erhebung des ifo Instituts zur Situation der betrieblichen Altersversorgung ergab, dass in der westdeutschen Industrie der Anteil der Beschäftigten, die mit einer betrieblichen Altersversorgung rechnen können, weiter gesunken ist (von 65% auf 64%). Im westdeutschen Handel stagniert der Anteil bei etwas unter 30%. In der Industrie der neuen Bundesländer erhöhte sich der Anteil der begünstigten Beschäftigten seit 1996 von 10% auf 16%, im Handel stieg der Verbreitungsgrad von 17% auf 20%. Allgemein standen einem weiteren Ausbau der betrieblichen Altersversorgung hauptsächlich wirtschaftliche Probleme entgegen. Die Finanzierung durch Entgeltumwandlung erhöht zwar die Chancen einer weiteren Verbreitung, wegen des damit verbundenen Lohnverzichts dürfte jedoch nur ein Teil der Beschäftigten diese Option wahrnehmen.
D29|Managerial career concerns, privatization and restructuring in transition economies|We set up a dynamic adverse selection model to explain how career concerns may induce managers in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to restructure their firms. It is shown how government monopsony power over managers led to the ratchet effect under the socialist economy, even under reforms coming short of privatization. The introduction of a managerial labour market, through privatization, introduces competition for managers and eliminates the ratchet effect, thereby inducing managers to restructure. Prospects of privatization also provide incentives to restructure even when managerial skills are asset-specific, provided insider control is strong enough to give managers enough rents from privatization. The model is consistent with the empirical evidence on restructuring of SOEs in transition economies.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D29|Free trade, business strategy and globalisation| This paper links the economist's analysis of free trade with the business strategist's analysis of the forces behind the globalisation of competition. It is argued that, although the drive to globalisation may seem different from the seeking of superior outcomes in competitive markets, this may be only because the modem reference point for competition is inappropriate. However, reference back to classical ideas of competition shows that both the advantages of globalisation, and its disadvantages, had been anticipated by classical writers of the eighteenth century, most notably by Adam Smith.
