B50|How economics forgot power|The article discusses a recent book publication by Philip Pilkington, in which an interesting and novel reconceptualizing of the investment (accumulation) process and economic growth is proposed. The gaze and critique through which the book is examined underlines certain theoretical similarities found in the Latin American economic discourse during the 1950´s, denominated as “Latin American structuralism”, in Anglo Saxon or European academia. Central to its perspective is the examination of economic formations and its agents as a configuration of power asymmetries.
B50|Subordinate financialization in emerging capitalist economies|In the explosion of literature on financialization, there is a much smaller but growing interest in what the phenomenon means for emerging capitalist economies (ECEs). We hold that for agents located in ECEs, the encounter with financialization is from a subordinate position: first, in relation to global production, ECE firms occupy subordinate locations in global production networks, providing cheap labor and raw, or at best, intermediate inputs; Second, in relation to global finance, ECEs are structurally subordinated to ACEs, that is, both trade and the most liquid capital markets are denominated in the currency of ACEs. Subordination in production means firms based in ECEs are able to capture less of the value created than firms higher in the hierarchy and must pay more to hedge macroeconomic risk. In circulation, strategies may emerge in ACEs wherein increased household indebtedness and/or asset market inflation maintain aggregate demand. In finance, ECEs’ subordinate position in relation to money and capital markets means that capital inflows are predominantly short-term, seeking financial yields rather than assuming productive risk. The results are continued volatility, external vulnerability and subordination to the currencies of the ACEs, which themselves serve to further deepen domestic financialization. We conclude that, while by no means pre-destined, financialization as experienced in ECEs may serve to further cement their subordinate position in the global structure.
B50|Inequality and Stagnation by Policy Design|"This paper argues the mainstream economics profession is threatened by theories of the financial crisis and ensuing stagnation that attribute those events to the policies recommended and justified by the profession. Such theories are existentially threatening to the dominant point of view. Consequently, mainstream economists resist engaging them as doing so would legitimize those theories. That resistance has contributed to blocking the politics and policies needed to address stagnation, thereby contributing to a political vacuum which is being filled by odious forces. Those ugly political consequences are unintended, but they are still there and show the dangerous consequences of the death of pluralism in economics. The critique of mainstream economists is not about ""values"" or lack of ""change"": it is about academic practice that suppresses ideas which are existentially threatening."
B50|How to Pay for the Green New Deal|"This paper follows the methodology developed by J. M. Keynes in his How to Pay for the War pamphlet to estimate the ""costs"" of the Green New Deal (GND) in terms of resource requirements. Instead of simply adding up estimates of the government spending that would be required, we assess resource availability that can be devoted to implementing GND projects. This includes mobilizing unutilized and underutilized resources, as well as shifting resources from current destructive and inefficient uses to GND projects. We argue that financial affordability cannot be an issue for the sovereign US government. Rather, the problem will be inflation if sufficient resources cannot be diverted to the GND. And if inflation is likely, we need to put in place anti-inflationary measures, such as well-targeted taxes, wage and price controls, rationing, and voluntary saving. Following Keynes, we recommend deferred consumption as our first choice should inflation pressures arise. We conclude that it is likely that the GND can be phased in without inflation, but if price pressures do appear, deferring a small amount of consumption will be sufficient to attenuate them."
B50|Convergence of actual, warranted, and natural growth rates in a Kaleckian-Harrodian model|This paper describes a hybrid post-Keynesian and classical/neo-Marxian model with a 'center of gravity' where the actual, warranted, and natural growth rates coincide. In the model, investment determines saving in the short run, while investment depends on anticipated demand. The Keynesian stability is assumed not to hold, so the model features short-run Harrodian instability, which is bounded by a ceiling and floor. The resulting Kaleckian-Harrodian model is shown to produce some key stylized facts as long-run tendencies, to exhibit wage-led behavior, and to produce depressions in some circumstances.
B50|Was ist falsch an der Arbeitswerttheorie? Wie Wert wirklich gebildet wird<BR>[What is wrong with the labor value theory? How value is really made]|"In this article it is shown that the labor value theory according to Marx is flawed in a central aspect: Neither the surplus value nor the value is produced. Value is a social relationship that is formed on the social level between exchange partners. Potential goods are produced as reference points for possible value relationships. They are shaped by manpower, machine and nature. On this basis, the description of value formation deviates from the classical interpretation of labor theory, and the value is no longer perceived as a subjective singularity (as a generated ""work value"", that can only be an expectation value) but as a real relationship between humans."

B50|More is different ... and complex! the case for agent-based macroeconomics|Abstract This work nests the Agent-Based macroeconomic perspective into the earlier history of macroeconomics. We discuss how the discipline in the 70’s took a perverse path relying on models grounded on fictitious rational representative agent in order to try to pathetically circumvent aggregation and coordination problems. The Great Recession was a natural experiment for macroeconomics, showing the inadequacy of the predominant theoretical framework grounded on DSGE models. After discussing the pathological fallacies of the DSGE-based approach, we claim that macroeconomics should consider the economy as a complex evolving system, i.e. as an ecology populated by heterogenous agents, whose far-from-equilibrium interactions continuously change the structure of the system. This in turn implies that more is different: macroeconomics cannot be shrink to representative-agent micro, but agents’ complex interactions lead to emergence of new phenomena and hierarchical structure at the macro level. This is what is taken into account by agent-based models, which provide a novel way to model complex economies from the bottom-up, with sound empirically-based microfoundations. We present the foundations of Agent-Based macroeconomics and we discuss how the contributions of this special issue push its frontier forward. Finally, we conclude by discussing the ways ahead for the fully acknowledgement of agent-based models as the standard way of theorizing in macroeconomics.
B50|Teaching International Monetary Economics. Two different views|This paper presents a critical analysis of the way in which international monetary economics is normally taught. The objective of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, we show how the most popular international economics manuals deal with exchange rate theory and its link with balance of payments equilibrium. In particular, we stress how the models proposed in these manuals cannot explain one of the biggest macroeconomic problems of our time, that of the imbalances of the balance of payments. On the other hand, we put forward an alternative Keynesian model. Assuming neither full employment nor balanced trade over the short or long run, the paper is intended as a new contribution to the post-Keynesian analysis of exchange rate theory. Finally, our model gives an original insight into the relationship between Liquidity Trap and structural economic imbalances in modern economies.
B50|Secular Stagnation and Income Distribution Dynamics|This paper contributes to the literature on secular stagnation by estimating a measure of potential output growth for the post-war US economy derived from a novel model specification that allows for the cyclical interactions between income distribution, represented by the trajectory of the labor share of income, and economic activity, as measured by capacity utilization. The results obtained show that potential output growth exhibits a gradual decline that predates the Great Recession and follows the downward trajectory of the labor share of income, thus suggesting the existence of an important long-run relationship between income distribution and output growth in the USA.
B50|Karl Marx: An early post-Keynesian? A comparison of Marx's economics with the contributions by Sraffa, Keynes, Kalecki and Minsky|"This paper compares Marx's economics with those by Sraffa, Keynes, Kalecki and Minsky. The paper takes an ""ex post"" view on the matter and rather looks at the output side of the respective authors, but not at the input side. This means no attempt is made at studying in a systematic way, if and to what extent Sraffa, Keynes, Kalecki and Minsky were individually influenced by Marx's work. First, the relationship between Marx's theory of value and Sraffa's reformulation of the classical theory of prices and distribution is reviewed. Then the relationship between Marx's and Keynes's monetary theory is examined relying on an interpretation of Marx's theory of value as a ""monetary theory of value"". Next, some light is shed on the Marx-Kalecki connection focusing on Marx's theory of simple and extended reproduction and the built-in, although not fully elaborated ""principle of effective demand"" and the related theories of distribution and accumulation. Finally, Marx's and Minsky's views on financial instability and crises are scrutinised. It is concluded that Marx should not be considered as an ""early post-Keynesian"" but rather as an important forerunner of modern post-Keynesianism, with certain similarities, but also some important differences, and several areas of compatibility."
B50|Economic Theory ten years after the crisis: Just tweaking around the edges? and/or A bit of repair at the seams?|It is my intention to address, primarily within the scope of mainstream macroeconomic theory, three of the questions making up the main theme of the conference, namely: How a very problematic theory continues to survive and dominate both the policy and the academic scene. What are the processes in the economy and the society that sustain its dominance? What is the condition of the economic Orthodoxy (particularly under its current form of the New Macroeconomic Consensus, that is the hybrid of mild neoliberalism with conservative New Keynesianism)? A good many orthodox economists hold the view that there is no necessity for a paradigm shift. On the contrary, a mere evolution towards a more pluralistic discipline would suffice. Hence the title of my talk.

B50|Distribution, wealth and demand regimes in historical perspective|Most empirical macroeconomic research limited to the period since World War II. This paper analyses the effects of changes in income distribution and in private wealth on consumption and investment covering a period from as early as 1855 until 2010 for the UK, France, Germany and USA, based on the dataset of Piketty and Zucman (2014). We contribute to the post-Keynesian debate on the nature of demand regimes, mainstream analyses of wealth effects and the financialisation debate. We find that overall domestic demand has been wage-led in the USA, UK and Germany. Total investment responds positively to higher wage shares, which is driven by residential investment. For corporate investment alone, we find a negative relation. Wealth effects are found to be positive and significant for consumption in the USA and UK, but weaker in France and Germany. Investment is negatively affected by private wealth in the USA and the UK, but positively in France and Germany.
B50|No one is alone: Strategic complementarities, capacity utilization, growth, and distribution|A longstanding criticism to Keynesian and Kaleckian growth theories is the question: why would firms operating with underutilized capacity still accumulate capital stock? This paper offers an answer by analyzing the choice of capacity utilization and accumulation in a strategic setting. The argument hinges on the Keynesian notion of user cost of capital. We argue that firms have incentives to wait to see what other firms are doing before adjusting their own utilization, which we capture through a marginal user cost of own utilization decreasing in average utilization. Accordingly, interactions among firms involve strategic complementarities: it is profit-maximizing to increase own utilization with average utilization. Since the latter is a reasonable proxy for demand, (i) the analysis provides a rationale for treating desired utilization as endogenous to demand at the firm level. In general equilibrium: (ii) capital accumulation coexists with underutilization; (iii) if firms were able to coordinate on a common utilization rate, utilization would be strictly higher than in equilibrium. The implications for growth and distribution depend on how the model is closed: (iv) with a distributive closure, equilibrium growth and profitability are both strictly below their socially-coordinated counterpart; (v) with an exogenous labor supply closure, the equilibrium labor share is strictly smaller than under coordination. Hence, (vi) there are mutually beneficial bargaining opportunities for both capital and labor. Moreover, (vii) demand policies have multiplier effects. The slow recovery from the Great Recession in the US provides a prime example of the relevance of equilibrium underutilization. Finally, we use stateby-sector data from the BEA to validate our hypothesis: (viii) our estimation results provide strong and robust support for the relevance of strategic complementarities in the US.
B50|Distribution-led growth through methodological lenses|"This paper presents a methodological discussion of two recent ""endogeneity"" critiques of the Kaleckian model and the concept of distribution-led growth. From a neo-Keynesian perspective, it is criticized because it treats distribution as quasi-exogenous, while in Skott (2017), distribution is viewed as endogenously determined by a series of (exogenous) institutional factors and social norms, and therefore one should focus on these instead of the functional distribution of income per se. The paper discusses how abstraction is used in science and economics, and uses the criteria proposed by Lawson (1989) for what constitutes an appropriate abstraction. Based on this discussion, it concludes that the criticisms are weak, although the issues raised by Skott provide some interesting directions for future work within the Kaleckian framework."
B50|Two Harvard Economists on Monetary Economics: Lauchlin Currie and Hyman Minsky on Financial Systems and Crises|In November 1987, Hyman Minsky visited Bogota, Colombia, after being invited by a group of professors who at that time were interested in post-Keynesian economics. There, Minsky delivered some lectures, and Lauchlin Currie attended two of those lectures at the National University of Colombia. Although Currie is not as well-known as Minsky in the American academy, both are outstanding figures in the development of non-orthodox approaches to monetary economics. Both alumni of the economics Ph.D. program at Harvard had a debate in Bogota. Unfortunately, there are no formal records of this, so here a question arises: What could have been their respective positions? The aim of this paper is to discuss Currie's and Minsky's perspectives on monetary economics and to speculate on what might have been said during their debate.
B50|Economics and Economic Methodology in a Core-Periphery Economic World| This paper uses a core-periphery distinction to characterize contemporary economics, economic methodology, and also today's world economy. First, it applies the distinction to the organization of contemporary economics through an examination of the problem of explaining economics' relations to and boundaries with other disciplines. Second, it argues that economics' core-periphery organization is replicated in a similar organization of the use and practice of contemporary economic methodology in economics. Third, it draws on the use of the core-periphery thinking in economics itself and the uneven development of the world economy to provide possible foundations for economics and economic methodology being organized in core-periphery terms. Fourth, the paper briefly discusses three as a potential countervailing forces operating on the development of contemporary economics that might work against its core-periphery organization.

B50|Toward a new microfounded macroeconomics in the wake of the crisis|The Great Recession that followed the financial crisis of 2007 is not only the largest economic crisis after the Great Depression of the 1930s, it also signals a crisis of economics as a discipline. This is not only the consequence of the inadequacy of mainstream macroeconomics, and specifically the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) workhorse model, to forecast such a huge event, or at least to detect the worrying tendencies towards it. Even more relevant is the choice to explicitly avoid the modeling of large crises (that for someone is a motivation for not attacking pre-crisis DSGE models focused on the analysis of small deviations from the steady-state), so denying the intrinsic nature of capitalism, a system that necessarily proceeds through cycles and (extended) crises. The replies of the DSGE approach to critics have led to extensions regarding for instance the role of financial frictions, heterogeneous agents, and bounded rationality (though typically in the form of quasi-rational expectations). The alternative paradigm of agent-based (AB) macroeconomics can take into account all these elements at once within an evolutionary modeling framework based on heterogeneity and interaction, so capable to endogenously reproduce complex dynamics, from small fluctuations to large crises, due to innovation and industrial dynamics, rising inequality and financial instability, and so on. The integration between AB macroeconomics and the (post-Keynesian) stock–flow consistent approach represents a promising way for the future development of this research field.
B50|The Institutionalist Theory of the Business Enterprise: Past, Present, and Future|This paper examines the historical developments of the institutionalist theory of the business enterprise since early 1900s. We will examine the major contributions in order to find the theoretical characteristics of the institutionalist theory of the business enterprise vis-à-vis evolving capitalism. The paper begins with a discussion of the present state of the institutional theory, looks back on the original ideas of Veblen and Commons, and goes on to later contributions, such as Gardiner Means, John Kenneth Galbraith, William Dugger, and Alfred Eichner. The paper concludes with a discussion as to what should be done for the further development of the institutionalist theory of the business enterprise.
B50|Theoretical and Methodological Context of (Post)-Modern Econometrics and Competing Philosophical Discourses for Policy Prescription|"This research article was championed as a way of providing discourses pertaining to the concept of ""Critical Realism (CR)"" approach, which is amongst many othe forms of competing postmodern philosophical concepts for the engagement of dialogical discourses in the area of established econonetric methodologies for effective policy prescription in the economic science discipline. On the the whole, there is no doubt surrounding the value of empirical endeavours in econometrics to address real world economic problems, but equally so, the heavy weighted use and reliance on mathematical contents as a way of justifying its scientific base seemed to be loosing traction of the intended focus of economics when it comes to confronting real world problems in the domain of social interaction. In this vein, the construction of mixed methods discourse(s), which favour that of CR philosophy is hereby suggested in this article as a way forward in confronting with issues raised by critics of mainstream economics and other professionals in the postmodern era."
B50|The changing dynamics of short-run output adjustment|Much of macroeconomic theorizing rests on assumptions that define the short-run output adjustment of a mass-production economy. The demand effect of investment on output, assumed much faster than its supply effect, works through employment expanding pari passu with changes in capacity utilization while productivity remains constant. Using linear Structural VAR and Time-Varying Parameter Structural VAR models, we document important changes in the short-run output adjustment in the USA. The link between changes in employment, capacity utilization and investment has weakened, while productivity became more responsive following demand shifts caused by investment since the early 1990s.
B50|Liberalism, Islam and the idea of Mankind|Religious war and the separation of Church and state affairs in the global north contributed in the emergence and implementation of various ideologies. Instead of its positive impact these ideologies became a source of extreme violence and corruption across the planet. Liberalism, non-intervention in the socio-economic affairs of mankind is considered as an advanced state of mankind ideological evolution and End of History. In addition, it is believed that liberalism is free from internal contradiction and which can be settle by an alternate ideology. In sharp contrast, Muslims believes that beside other one of the unresolvable contradictions between liberalism and Islam is the gnosis of human being which the present study will undertake. Question to be explored that what concept of man has been held by economists (Liberals/Islamic) in their analysis of the behaviour of individual man, and to what extent they have universalized their concept of the individual to mankind?
B50|Liberalism, Islam and the idea of Mankind|After the defeat of Marxism and the triumph in the war in Iraq, pundit in the global north labelled neoliberalism as the End of History and last form of mankind ideological evolution. It is believed that neoliberalism successfully satisfied all the previous ideological contradiction. In contrast, Muslims believe that besides others one of the prominent and unresolvable contradictions between Neoliberalism and Islam is the gnosis of humanity which the present study will undertake. In this paper using the methodology of library research we will explore how the liberal and Islamic economists conceptualize man in their analysis of human behaviour and the degree to which the concept of man has been universalized.
B50|The commodities boom and the profit squeeze: output and profit cycles in Brazil (1996-2016)|The aim of the present paper is to contribute to the understanding of the recent Brazilian crisis by arguing that it was related to a cyclical profit squeeze that took place between 2010 and 2014, following the long cyclical expansion that started in 2003. To do so, the cyclical trajectories of output and profit rates in the Brazilian economy, throughout the five business cycles that took place between 1996 and 2016, are examined by resorting to the part of the framework established by Weisskopf (1979) that focuses on cycles. The results indicate that profit squeezes are rare in the Brazilian economy, possibly due to the truncated character and the weakness of the business cyclesâ€™ expansions. However, a profit squeeze did took place in the last cycle partly as result of the commodities boom, which attenuated the foreign vulnerability of the economy and allowed for a longer than usual expansion.
B50|Normal utilization as the adjusting variable in Neo‐Kaleckian growth models: A critique|As well‐known, the canonical Neo‐Kaleckian growth model fails to reconcile actual and normal rates of utilization in equilibrium. Some recent contributions revive an old proposal for solving this problem—making the normal rate of utilization an endogenous variable that converges to the actual utilization rate—justifying it with new, micro‐founded premises. We argue that these new justifications for the convergence of normal to actual utilization do not stand closer scrutiny. First, the proposed microeconomic model relies on various restrictive assumptions, some of which are mutually inconsistent. Second, the derivation of the macroeconomic adjustment mechanism from the microeconomic analysis involves a logical leap that can be justified only by a very arbitrary assumption with little economic justification. Finally, we discuss the way in which this mechanism has been incorporated into the Neo‐Kaleckian growth model by proposers of this approach. We show that, even if one puts aside, for the sake of argument, the first two points, the existence of autonomous components of demand is sufficient to invalidate the resulting macroeconomic model.

B50|Reclaiming the University: transforming economics as a discipline|Economics as a discipline is currently in disarray. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, academic experts, students, commentators, practitioners and politicians all questioned the status of academic economics and many called for a ‘new economic thinking’. Nearly a decade later, however, there is little evidence of a transformation in research and teaching. The present study first clarifies what is meant by a transformation of economics as a discipline, since this remains an ill-defined term and may be interpreted in very different ways. It then establishes the conditions of a successful transformation of the discipline in terms of intra-disciplinary and extra-disciplinary factors. The paper argues that economics as a discipline cannot be expected to trigger this transformation by itself (i.e. via self-regulation), since the ‘market for economic ideas’ is prone to market failure. In addition, the influence of external factors and actors on the market may serve to distort the congruence between the individual researcher’s utility and societal welfare. External incentives are therefore required to establish constitutional guardrails that ensure fair competition between ideas.
B50|Introducing minimum wages in Germany: Employment effects in a post Keynesian perspective|There has been a long discussion about the employment impact of minimum wages and this discussion has recently been renewed with the introduction of an economy-wide, binding minimum wage in Germany in 2015. In traditional reasoning, based on the allocational approach of modern labour market economics, it has been suggested that the impact is clearly negative on the assumption of a competitive labour market and clearly positive on the assumption of a monopsonistic labour market. Unfortunately, both predictions conflict with the empirical findings, which do not show a clear-cut impact of significant size in any direction. As an alternative, a Post Keynesian twosector model including an employment market is presented here. Its most likely prediction of a negligible employment effect and a sectoral shift is tested against the German case of an introduction of a statutory minimum wage in 2015. Despite substantial wage increases in the low wage sector, our empirical analysis reveals very low overall employment loss of about 33,000 labourers as a result of a small sectoral shift from low wage industries to higher wage industries.
B50|Postkeynesianismus: Ein heterodoxer Ansatz auf der Suche nach einer Fundierung|In diesem Beitrag geht es darum, den Postkeynesianismus als paradigmatische Alternative zum herrschenden neoklassischen Mainstream etwas näher kennenzulernen. Es zeigt sich sehr schnell, dass der Postkeynesianismus keine einheitliche Denkschule darstellt, sondern vielmehr eine Vielzahl von theoretischen Ansätzen darunter zu verstehen ist, die eine Reihe von methodologischen und epistemologischen Gemeinsamkeiten aufweist und die einige identitätsstiftende Postulate verbindet. Zum konkreten Nachvollzug dieser Postulate aus dem axiomatischen Kern des Postkeynesianismus wird dann darauf verzichtet, dass Kaleidoskop postkeynesinaischer Theorie mit kaleckianischer, kaldorianischer oder gar sraffianischer Grundlage aufzuzeigen, sondern es wird vielmehr nur ein Postkeynesianismus - die monetäre Theorie der Produktion - in seiner paradigmatischen und formalen Struktur beleuchtet und die darauf aufbauende Theorie der Marktteilnahme als alternative Theorie der Wirtschaftspolitik dargelegt.

B50|Underdevelopment and unregulated markets: Seven reasons why unregulated markets reproduce underdevelopment|After World War II only a few developing countries were able to catch up to real GDP per capita levels prevailing in developed countries. These successful countries in almost all cases came from Asia and did not follow the free market doctrine in the tradition of the Washington Consensus. There must be theoretical explanations as to why underdevelopment is reproduced and most countries in the world do not catch up. This essay reviews different economic approaches which attempt to explain the lack of convergence. A first group of approaches focuses on the lack of sufficient productivity development (free trade, global value chains, negative terms of trade effects, abundance of scarce resources, premature deindustrialization); the second group focuses on problems to trigger sufficient growth (distorted financial systems, high restrictions on macroeconomic demand management). Countries can suffer from several of these factors, which can explain why development is only possible with the support of comprehensive government policies.
B50|"The ""Modern Monetary Theory"": An extension of Radical Political Economy"|The rupture of the nexus between monetary and fiscal policies, which derives from the supranational transfer of the monetary sovereignty by the states, is the origin of the great macroeconomic imbalances that shake today some nations inserted in the European integration process. In this paper we try to show the so-called Modern Monetary Theory, from which underlies the urgency of recovering the monetary-fiscal bond, and consequently, the need of conceiving public finances in a functional way. In contrast to the orthodox recommendations, which suggest fiscal balance and austerity as macroeconomic stabilization measures, the MMT contemplates the government and nongovernmental sectors balances as one, being desirable, therefore, fiscal expansion in recession periods to achieve full employment, without neglecting the one related to price stability. Thus, the implementation of job guaranteed programs would act as a powerful corrector of the supply-side imbalance in the labor market, meanwhile stimulating social and/or environmental improvements in the countries concerned, favoring higher levels of well-being in them ultimately.
B50|Imprecision|This paper surveys the various modes of imprecision and seeks to clarify the concept of imprecision, to account for the pervasiveness of the phenomena, and to explain why we have to come to terms with it throughout our cognitive affairs. The structure of these deliberations will be as follows: Having set the stage for considering imprecision (in section 1), it will briefly elaborate upon each of them (in section 2). Next comes a discussion of two of the main ramifications of imprecision, namely vagueness (section 3) and oversimplification (section 4). There follows (in section 5) a consideration of why imprecision is inevitable in our cognitive dealings, and why this feature of investigation actually admits of an evolutionary explanation. The paper concludes (in section 6) with a retrospective glance at the overall situation from a philosophical point of view. Overall, the discussion is of an analytical cast, seeking to clarify the conceptual nature and operational bearing of imprecision within the cognitive scheme of things.

B50|Capital structure theory: Reconsidered|In the mainstream of the academic field of finance, the Modigliani and Miller's (1958) proof of capital structure irrelevance theory, has been praised as the cornerstone of modern scientific finance. However, the capital structure irrelevance theory is based on a set of assumptions, which are both unrealistic and contradictory to the main assumption of the mainstream academic finance. This paper shows that by making more appropriate assumptions, capital structure becomes relevant. The paper, on a foundational ground, argues that since the results of sophisticated mathematical models change as soon as their underlying assumptions are changed, the claim about the scientific nature of the mainstream academic finance becomes questionable.

B50|Wage-led versus profit-led demand: what have we learned? A Kaleckianâ€“Minskyan view|The Bhaduriâ€“Marglin model has become a widely used workhorse model in heterodox macroeconomics and has given rise to two dozen or so empirical studies, which at times have given conflicting results. Neo-Kaleckians and neo-Goodwinians have applied different estimation strategies, with the former typically estimating behavioural equations, while the latter have often used reduced-form demand equations. Further differences include the lag structure, the output measure, the control variables and the sample. This paper, first, tries to clarify the terms of the debate. While neo-Kaleckians interpret the model as a medium-term, partial-equilibrium goods market model, neo-Goodwinians are interested in the interaction of demand and distribution and regard the model as a long-run model with short-run cycles. Second, we elaborate a Kaleckianâ€“Minskyan view of the economy as characterised by a wage-led demand regime and cycles driven by financial fragility. Many of the reported results may suffer from omitted variable bias as they do not include financial control variables. At least in the recent past, financial effects on demand have been much larger in size than distribution effects. A wage-led Minsky model with a reserve-army distribution function gives rise to pseudo-Goodwin cycles.
B50|The restructuring of the European land armaments industry: Between political incentives and economic pressures|Within the context of the restructuring of the European defense industry since the end of the cold war, this article addresses the land armaments sector in general, and armored vehicles in particular. The industry is generally divided into the aerospace, naval, land, and electronics sectors, of which aerospace and electronic are highly internationalized while the land and naval ones remain fragmented and nationally based. Economic characteristics of the land armaments industry—lower R&D costs and longer production runs—still permit the predominance of a nationally-focused production model, yet post-cold war market changes toward lighter platforms, and resulting synergies with the civilian truck industry, imply a comparative weakening of state sovereignty and, consequently, stronger market contestability as compared to the other defense industry sectors.
B50|Minsky Models: A Structured Survey|Minsky's ideas have recently gained prominence in the mainstream as well as in the heterodox literature. However, there exists no agreement upon the formal presentation of Minsky's insights. The aim of this paper is to survey the literature and identify differences and similarities in the ways through which Minskyan ideas have been formalized. We distinguish between the models that focus on the dynamics of debt or interest, with no or a secondary role for asset prices, and the models in which asset prices play a key role in the dynamic behavior of the economy. Within the first category of models, we make a classification between (i) the Kaleckiâ€“Minsky models, (ii) the Kaldorâ€“Minsky models, (iii) the Goodwinâ€“Minsky models, (iv) the credit rationing Minsky models, (v) the endogenous target debt ratio Minsky models and (vi) the Minskyâ€“Veblen models. Within the second category of models, we distinguish between (i) the equity price Minsky models and (ii) the real estate price Minsky models. Key limitations of the models and directions for future research are outlined.
B50|A Short Walk on the Wild Side: Agent-Based Models and their Implications for Macroeconomic Analysis|I discuss recent advances in agent-based modelling applied to macroeconomic analysis. I first present the building blocks of agent- based models. Furthermore, by relying on examples taken from recent works, I argue that agent-based models provide complementary or new lights with respect to more standard models on key macroeconomic issues like endogenous business cycles, the interactions between business cycles and long-run growth, and the role of price vs. quantity adjustments in the return to full employment. Finally, I discuss some limits of agentbased models and how they are currently addressed in the literature.
B50|The Fragility of Emerging Currencies Since the 2000s - a Minskyan Analysis|The currencies of a few emerging market economies (EME) have being following a specific dynamic since the early 2000s: they are strongly connected to financial markets internationally, appreciating in moments of tranquility and presenting sharp depreciations in peaks of uncertainty. What is the mechanism behind this specific dynamic that contradicts mainstream exchange-rate theories? To answer this question, this article applies the Minskyan framework to the context of money managers and their portfolio allocation decisions. The approach allows the analysis of these currencies through money managers’ decisions, putting forward that these might float according to their balance-sheet constraints - reasons not related to the currencies themselves, but to money managers’ assets, liabilities, and currency mismatch. The result is a dynamic characterized by deviation-amplifying system, the opposite of the equilibrium-seeking mechanism needed for clearing markets, and high frequency of depreciations associated to the global extent of these institutions’ balance-sheet.
B50|Macroeconomic Policy in DSGE and Agent-Based Models Redux: New Developments and Challenges Ahead|The Great Recession seems to be a natural experiment for economic analysis, in that it has shown the inadequacy of the predominant theoretical framework - the New Neoclassical Synthesis (NNS) - grounded on the DSGE model. In this paper, we present a critical discussion of the theoretical, empirical and political-economy pitfalls of the DSGE-based approach to policy analysis. We suggest that a more fruitful research avenue should escape the strong theoretical requirements of NNS models (e.g., equilibrium, rationality, representative agent, etc.) and consider the economy as a complex evolving system, i.e. as an ecology populated by heterogenous agents, whose far-from-equilibrium interactions continuously change the structure of the system. This is indeed the methodological core of agent-based computational economics (ACE), which is presented in this paper. We also discuss how ACE has been applied to policy analysis issues, and we provide a survey of macroeconomic policy applications (fiscal and monetary policy, bank regulation, labor market structural reforms and climate change interventions). Finally, we conclude by discussing the methodological status of ACE, as well as the problems it raises.
B50|Corporate financialisation in South Africa: From investment strike to housing bubble|This article reveals the processes of financialisation in the South African economy by tracing the sources and destinations of NFCs’ liquidity. The paper argues that rather than the volume of NFCs’ financial investment, the composition of financial assets is crucial to assess corporate financialisation in the country. Non-financial businesses in South Africa fundamentally transformed theur investment behaviour during the 1990s, shifting from more productive uses such as trade credit towards highly liquid and potentially innovative (and therefore risky) financial investment. Following the direction of financial flows the article shows that – fuelled by foreign capital inflows – companies’ financial operations contributed to the price inflation in South African property markets.
B50|The Research Excellence Framework 2014, journal ratings and the marginalization of heterodox economics|The Research Excellence Framework (REF) is the main research assessment for universities in the UK. It informs university league tables and the allocation of government research funding. This paper analyses the evaluations of the REF 2014 for Economics, Business, Politics and History. We analyse, first, from which journals, articles have been submitted; second, to what extent journal ratings and impact factors predict the REF´s evaluations; third, how many articles from heterodox economics journals have been submitted. We find that a small group of journals dominate the outputs submitted. Journal ratings and impact factors explain 86 to 89% of the variation in the output evaluations for Economics. These values are lower but still substantial for other disciplines. Few papers from heterodox economics journals were submitted to Economics. Overall, the REF in its present form marginalises heterodox economics, pushes it out of the discipline and endangers pluralism in economics research.
B50|The effect of pro-shareholder income distribution on capital accumulation: evidence from Japanese non-financial firms|Over the past decades, there has been a change in the pattern of capital accumulation, especially in developed countries. Although the profit rate and profit share recovered after the 1980s and 1990s, the rate of capital accumulation remained stagnant in many developed countries in the same period. This phenomenon is called “investment-profit puzzle” because the movement of the rate of capital accumulation is thought to be mainly determined by that of the profit rate or profit share. In this study, I examine the effect of financialization on the “investment-profit puzzle” in the Japanese economy. The profit rate and profit share of Japanese NFCs began to recover from the mid-1990s, whereas the rate of capital accumulation did not recover during the same period. This study reveals that pro-shareholder income distribution, namely, the rise in profit share that is evoked by financializationin in Japanese NFCs is the main cause of the “investment-profit puzzle” in the Japanese economy. In Japanese non-manufacturing industries, increasing profit share depress domestic demand and capital accumulation while it contributes to profit rate recovery. The trend of non-manufacturing industries determines the “investment-profit puzzle” in the Japanese economy.
B50|Profit rates in the developed capitalist economies: a time series investigation|This paper examines whether there is empirical evidence to support the hypothesis of secular decline in the economy-wide profit rates as predicted by classical economic theories. We specifically consider profit rates in the OECD economies based on the national accounts data contained in the Extended Penn World Table database. In our analysis we use linear trend, Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests, and also allow for structural breaks and instabilities in the series. Results suggest that profit rates in OECD economies exhibited a wide variety of patterns, including stochastic and deterministic trends, random walk, reversals, as well as stability. Secular decline (fluctuation around falling deterministic trend) hypothesis is supported for Canada, Portugal and the USA, while secular rise is witnessed for Greece and Norway.
B50|Financialisation: Dimensions and determinants. A cross-country study|The financialisation literature has grown over the past two decades. While there is a generally accepted definition, effectively financialisation has been used to describe very different phenomena. This paper proposes a multi-faceted notion of financialisation by distinguishing between financialisation of non-financial companies, households and the financial sector and using activity as well as vulnerability measures of financialisation. We identify seven financialisation hypotheses in the literature and empirically investigate them in a cross-country analysis for 17 OECD countries for the 1997-2007 period. We find that different financialisation measures are only weakly correlated, which suggests the existence of distinct financialisation processes. There is strong evidence across all sectors that financialisation is closely linked to asset price inflation and correlated with a debt-driven demand regime. Financial deregulation encourages financialisation, especially in the financial and household sector. By contrast, there is limited evidence that market-based financial systems tend to be more financialised, meaning financialisation can occur with large banks. Foreign financial inflows do not seem to be a main driver. We do not find indication that a secular investment slowdown precedes financialisation. Overall, our findings suggest that financialisation should be understood as variegated process, playing out differently across economic sectors in different countries.

B50|Endogenous Technical Change In Alternative Theories Of Growth And Distribution|This paper surveys the last two and a half decades of nonâ€ neoclassical literature on endogenous technical change and the functional income distribution. We distinguish between classicalâ€ Marxian and postâ€ Keynesian models, and analyze them under three different assumptions on the determinants of technical change: capital accumulation, income distribution, and labor market tightness. The balanced growth implications of alternative models are compared with neoclassical exogenous and endogenous growth theories. Despite the strong differences in the assumptions regarding the substitutability between capital and labor, the role of different classes in society, and whether or not productive factors are fully employed, the various alternative models can be classified in a way that highlights remarkable similarities with their neoclassical counterparts. Both neoclassical and alternative theories of endogenous growth: (i) have shown that longâ€ run growth is sensitive to investment decisions, and (ii) rely on a linear spillover from the stock of knowledge to the production of innovations. The comparison highlights the different channels emphasized by competing theories: saving behavior and market structure in the neoclassical theories, as opposed to income distribution, the state of the labor market, and investors' behavior in alternative theories.
B50|Evolutions and Contradictions in Mainstream Macroeconomics: The Case of Olivier Blanchard| This article traces the complex intellectual path of Olivier Blanchard, a personification of the controversial evolution of macroeconomic research over the last three decades. After contributing to consolidation of the core of mainstream macroeconomics, Blanchard recently suggested ‘rethinking’ some of its key aspects to take stock of the lessons of the 2008 Great Recession, which he witnessed as the International Monetary Fund’s Chief Economist. This welcome discussion, which according to Blanchard should open mainstream macroeconomics to heterodox thinking, has so far produced a certainly interesting albeit theoretically contradictory synthesis and limited policy consequences. The most paradigmatic aspect of this rethinking of macroeconomics is represented by the abandonment in teaching of aggregate supply and demand in favor of a revival of the IS–LM model complemented by the Phillips curve. While this change of perspective does allow for the instability of ‘natural’ equilibrium to be emphasized, a deeper reading may prove incompatible with the neoclassical foundations of the mainstream approach.
B50|Intertemporal propensity to consume|Abstract Cross-sectionally estimated Engel curves tend to exhibit shapes that imply ultimately decreasing marginal propensities to consume as income rises. This suggests at first sight a tendency to slow down in private consumption. This tendency has to be reconsidered taking into account the fact that Engel curves usually shift significantly over time. We introduce the notion of “intertemporal propensity to consume” to shed more light on the drivers and patterns of the evolution of Engel curves. Using this notion, we are able to identify and measure the direction of the expansion path of consumption as time goes by, while controlling for household characteristics and price levels. Using German household data, we show that, over time, the intertemporal propensity to consume systematically offsets the consumption paths implied by the marginal propensity to consume that is derived cross-sectionally at one point in time. We claim that this difference between marginal and intertemporal propensity to consume should be ascribed to variations in the socioeconomic structures that occur over time and that may be linked both to the supply side (innovation and technical change) and the demand side (learning dynamics of consumers). We also show that changes in relative prices play a minor role in the evolution of Engel curves.
B50|Profitability or Industrial Relations : What Explains Manufacturing Performance Across Indian States?|We use a state-level panel data set for the period 1969-2005 to analyze the relative importance of profitability (rate of profit) and industrial disputes (man-days lost to all industrial disputes per worker) in explaining cross-state variations of manufacturing sector performance in India. Using three different measures of manufacturing performance â€“ net value added, investment and employment â€“ we find that profitability is more significant than industrial disputes in explaining the variation of manufacturing sector performance across Indian states.

B50|Reconciling facts with fiction: Minimum wages in a post-Keynesian perspective|There has long been a discussion about the employment impact of minimum wages and this discussion has recently been renewed with the introduction of an economy-wide, binding minimum wage in Germany in 2015. In traditional reasoning, based on the allocational approach of modern labour market economics, it has been suggested that the impact is clearly negative on the assumption of a competitive labour market and clearly positive on the assumption of a monopsonistic labour market. Unfortunately, both predictions conflict with the empirical findings, which do not show a clear-cut impact of significant size in any direction.
B50|Understanding Financial Instability: Minsky Versus the Austrians|Although Minsky’s interpretation of Keynes’s macroeconomics and essential message clashes with authoritative alternative interpretations, it has become increasingly influential during the years following the Global Financial Crisis, even in mainstream circles. This paper offers a critical evaluation of Minsky’s Financial Instability Hypothesis from the perspective of the alternative Austro-Wicksellian paradigm. Although some of the similarities and/or analogies between Minsky’s approach and that of the Austrian School suggest a more than merely superficial affinity between the two theoretical frameworks and although some scope for cross-fertilization between both approaches can be found, both theoretically and empirically, at a fundamental conceptual level both theories remain incompatible and difficult if not impossible to reconcile, in particular in terms of fundamental causality and in terms of policy conclusions and prescriptions. Despite the fact that Minsky’s policy conclusions are multifaceted and somewhat eclectic, they manifest a lack of familiarity with the conclusions of the Austrian analysis of the problems of central planning by Big Players such as Big Bank and Big Government. Both approaches also offer contrasting interpretations of the historical experience of the Global Financial Crisis.
B50|From Information To Theory. A Logical Approach|The paper focuses on the logical path from information acquiring to theory elaborating. To this end, the entire chain from signal – sign – information – knowledge – theory is examined and clarified from a logical point of view. Mainly, the passing from one to another of the chain components is analyzed in order to get the general mechanisms of theories emerging. The paper has a strong general and abstract character, so its results can be applied both to natural sciences and to social sciences like economics.
B50|The case for increasing returns (2): the methods of planning horizons|In neoclassical economics, substitution assumptions support equilibrium models in closed systems shunning interdependence. On these grounds an array of frames show outcomes as stable, efficient, unique and determinate. Heterodox economists say equilibrium models sidestep practical knowledge and the rich reality of economic behavior. Rigor or realism, mainstream or radical, ecological, institutional, socio-cultural: economics invites a wide diversity of assumptions, once short-term models of substitution are opened to question. The answers are blurred by applications; there is clarity in a simplicity shielded from mundane detail. This paper addresses the methodological impact of planning horizons, increasing returns and complementarity, and their proper representation in economic constructions. Horizonal economics can be construed as extending orthodox standards into a realm of time, but for its subtler ramifications. Increasing returns make our relations complementary and not substitutional, loosening the tight deductions from mainstream models of choice. The horizonal extension of our received theory of price applies time to cost and demand curves, showing Marshallian scissors (supply and demand) cut outward and downward with expanded horizons. Static conceptions appear in horizonal groups, suggesting complete theories of price should specify agents’ horizons, with no further radical impact: the trouble emerges with increasing returns and complementarity. Horizons stem from unbounded causality; if all we do ripples outward forever in nature and society, the relevant field of inquiry for economics is interdependent: this is the case for bounded rationality as an analytical limit to economic conceptions. In turn, interdependence suggests a use of network constructs to frame complex systemic cascades, and networks open a door to complementarity and increasing returns in transport and information exchange. The gaping maw of increasing returns and complementarity opens, swallowing down neat traditions such as stability, equilibrium, marginalism, partial analysis, supply and demand depictions of price, etc. The methodological lesson of this shift to network contexts and dynamic complex systems supersedes some of our favored doctrines and the analyses on which they stand. Without decreasing returns and substitution, neoclassical arguments simply do not work. Heterodox approaches - and their intelligent application - are required in this setting. The paper offers a few guidelines to an unexplored domain of fundamental departures.
B50|Reason-Based Choice And Context-Dependence: An Explanatory Framework|We introduce a “reason-based” framework for explaining and predicting individual choices. The key idea is that a decision-maker focuses on some but not all properties of the options and chooses an option whose “motivationally salient” properties he/she most prefers. Reason-based explanations can capture two kinds of contextdependent choice: (i) the motivationally salient properties may vary across choice contexts, and (ii) they may include “context-related” properties, not just “intrinsic” properties of the options. Our framework allows us to explain boundedly rational and sophisticated choice behaviour. Since properties can be recombined in new ways, it also offers resources for predicting choices in unobserved contexts.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
B50|A multi-sectoral balance-of-payments-constrained growth model with sectoral heterogeneity|This study builds a multi-sectoral balance-of-payments-constrained growth model that incorporates structural heterogeneity between sectors and countries, such as differences in labor productivity, price competition, shares of exports and imports, and the quality of commodities. The model in the current paper generates more comprehensive results than those presented by Thirlwall (1979), Blecker (1998), and Araujo and Lima (2007), even though it contains their properties and reproduces their implications. Furthermore, compared with these existing works, the current model sheds more light on the relationship between the trade structure, international competition, productivity dynamics, and economic growth. It also shows the differences between industrial and macroeconomic phenomena, by presenting an example that illustrates how changes in nominal wages, the Kaldor–Verdoorn effect, and the degree of market competition in both countries affect economic growth in the home country.
B50|A Comprehensive Plan to Confront the Retirement Savings Crisis| The plan proposes a simple, immediately effective solution to address the fundamental flaws in today’s broken retirement system. It details a single, sustainable framework - Guaranteed Retirement Accounts (GRAs) - to allow Americans to save consistently, generate the returns necessary, and retire with guaranteed lifelong income. And by repurposing lopsided subsidies and strategically using existing government infrastructure, this plan can be implemented with no new taxes, bureaucracy or increase of the federal deficit.
B50|The Financialisation of Health in England and Wales; Lessons from the Water Sector|This is a Foresight paper prepared for the EU-funded research project, Financialisation, Economy, Society and Sustainable Development, FESSUD. Drawing on lessons from the provision of water in England, the paper anticipates future developments in the provision of health, exploring the increasing role of finance and financial cultures. This is captured in the term “financialisation” which has recently emerged in academic literature to account for the rapid expansion of financial assets and financial activity in the economy, and the expanding reach of the financial sector into traditionally non-financial areas of economic and social life. The paper starts with an overview of the context in which financialisation has evolved within, and impacted upon, the National Health Service (NHS). Two contextual elements stand out. First, since the 1980s, the NHS has been subject to incremental reforms to introduce market-mimetic structures. These reforms accelerated with the introduction of the 2012 Health and Social Care Act (HSCA). This legislation has only just begun to have an impact at the time of writing (December 2015), but the extent of private sector involvement in health provision is likely to increase rapidly as a result of the Act. The second significant aspect of the context for financialisation is the growing financial deficit in the NHS which creates an important backdrop to the HSCA reforms. Irrespective of the proximate as well as the deeper reasons for this, it provides for a narrative of “unaffordability” and “inefficiency”, itself taken as a rationale both for greater private sector intervention and as justification for NHS trusts to increase revenue from private sources. However, the paper shows that this narrative thread does not fit with global data which indicate that the NHS is broadly in line with OECD averages for spending on GDP, and health outcomes. The paper considers four mechanisms by which financialisation is affecting the health service in England. First, financing in the sector is allocated on the basis of internal “markets” which mimic financialised structures (regardless of ownership or provision). An institutional division between the “purchaser” and “provider” of health services within the NHS has been refined over the years since it was first introduced in the early 1990s. Health providers are remunerated via a complex “pricing” system known as Payment by Results (PBR) so that transactions between state agencies are delineated in financial terms. Second, financial processes have become embedded in the sector via the process of tendering to both NHS and private service providers. A growing proportion of services has been contracted to private companies, particularly in the wake of the 2012 HSCA. Aside from creeping privatization, this process brings financial practices into the provision of health services, with, for example, health commissioners required to observe competition law even where contracts are awarded to state organisations. Third, under the 2012 HSCA, the cap on the proportion of income that NHS providers can raise from private patients has increased from 2% to 49%, leading to an increase in private patient income within some NHS hospitals. Global finance is becoming more closely integrated with health provision as a result with new partnerships developing between NHS providers and private investors. Finally, since the early 1990s most new capital investment in the NHS has been undertaken through the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) where the private sector finances the design, build and operation of hospitals and these are then leased back to the NHS Trust over a period of decades. These contracts have proven to be costly for NHS hospitals but highly lucrative for (often institutional financial sector) investors in PFI contracts. The paper then considers the nature of the private companies that are involved in healthcare. Health providers are often owned by larger conglomerates for which health is one of many assets in a diverse investment portfolio. The paper compares the changes taking place in health with developments in the water sector in England which has been privatized since 1989 and where financial structures, processes motives and investors have long been established. In both sectors, processes associated with financialisation mean that services are increasingly distanced from the materiality of provision and instead are interpreted in terms of the revenue stream that they can provide to investors. Innovative financial practices have been adopted to boost shareholder returns. In terms of Foresight, health provision is in the process of a fundamental transition from a public service to a financial asset, as has happened in the provision of water in England. The result is expected to be a considerable deepening in the cultures of individualisation and commodification of the health system. This is likely to be associated with a fragmented service and greater inequality in a number of respects: government spending on health will be transferred ultimately to global private finance, boosting the earnings of financial investors; the state will be left with the most difficult (and expensive) to treat as these are of least interest to the private sector; a two-tier system will emerge, with the poorest left with a severely weakened second-rate health system; labour rights are expected to be weakened as employment structures become fragmented across different health providers. Such developments threaten to undermine the core principles on which the NHS was founded. Furthermore, these changes will be difficult to reverse as the ability of the public sector to pose an effective alternative to private and financialised provision of health will be considerably debilitated.
B50|The Changing Face of Economics? Ethical Issues in Contemporary Economic Schools as a Consequence of Changes in the Concept of Human Nature|The last financial crisis combined with some recent social trends (like growing inequality or environmental problems) inspired many contemporary economists to the re-evaluation of actual economic knowledge in the search for solutions to these problems. Modern economic schools (especially heterodox ones) stress the meaning of ethical issues in economics more often. The thesis of the paper is that this revival of the ethical face of present economics depends very strongly on the changing assumptions of human nature within economics and other disciplines which work alongside economics, such as social psychology or business ethics, for instance. In order to prove the thesis, the paper provides an evaluation of current economic schools, especially within the heterodoxy, in search of their ethical aspects, and presents them as a result of the changing assumptions about human beings within those schools. This ethical dimension of human beings manifests itself in different ways, which can be perceived as a result of it being based on different ethical schools and different psychological and philosophical assumptions about human nature. Therefore, the paper also considers the current developments of the view on human beings in contemporary schools of economic ethics.
B50|Economics as a Discipline of Instrumental Reason. Looking at Economics as a Science from the Perspective of the Frankfurt School of Philosophy|The article is built around the analysis of The critique of instrumental reason by Horkheimer, applied to issues connected with the philosophy of economics. Positive economics is under-stood as an example of a discipline where the pragmatic paradigm has been implemented. Therefore, economics functions within the boundaries of what Horkheimer called instrumental rationality. The starting point is the intellectual source shared by economics and the Frankfurt School, namely Kant’s philosophy of rationality. In the first part of the article, three of Kant’s ideas that are fundamental to economics are presented, and then the development of their application in philosophy of science, as seen by Horkheimer in 1947, is laid out. The second part of the article consists of enumerating various distinctive features of economics that set it apart from other social sciences and which constitute factors for which it can be considered a realm of the reign of ‘instrumental rationality’, with all the threats such an approach provokes. The above-mentioned features concentrate on treating humans in economics as a means, not as a goal. This aspect of the philosophy of science of the Frankfurt School (unlike its critique of capitalism as an economic system) has not been widely received.
B50|Hyperbola Economics Towards A Utopian Economy|The HEU geometrically holds in the two dimensional (2D) planes using topology for the 1st and the 3rd and, 2nd and 4th quadrants. The EES (2013, and the 2nd edition, 2014) algebraically holds also in the two dimensional planes but, consistently with hundred thousands of equations and each calculation or measurement. In the mean time, all the HEU data and all the EES data are always and wholly consistent with each other, since both data sets commonly use the same KEWT (Kamiryo Endogenous World Table) series of databases; currently KEWT 9.15 (the 9th, 1960-2015). Basic character of the mechanics commonly to the EES and the HEU comes from the hyperbola system under the market principles. The system results in instant, dynamic, and steady balances, in the 2D planes, with no exception nor probability, where theories=practices=forecasted values. The market principles are an assumption, since the market principles vertically holds by goods, services, and software however are reinforced by the hyperbola system. The hyperbola system, as a whole system, reinforces the market principles horizontally and reciprocally. Further, basic character of the mechanics above is such a fact that the macro level is the first and the micro level is the second; adversely from the common sense in the literature. A true reason/cause comes just from the income difference in tax redistribution between before and after tax redistribution in GDP. Functionally, the EES and the HEU are policy-oriented while the reinforcements by the market principles are strategy-oriented. Similarly, equality is divided into macro and micro functions. At the macro level, a country has its own individuality: culture, civilization, history and tradition. Thus, macro-equality accepts specified individuality by country. At the micro level, households are tied up with real wages and enterprises with the profit maximization. Shortly in another way, whole policies are reinforced by variety of strategies in micro economies. Concretely in detail: (1) pages 4, 5, and 6 in the HEU yearly show essential structures of GDP; (2) page 205 sums up the stream to geometric from algebraic using fundamental equations; (3) page 249 clarifies Paul Krugman¥¯s basic idea or the differences between US, Canada, Japan, China, and UK; and (4) Appendix 3, pages 430-496 illustrates G20 and G7 as a whole system. In the above illustrations by country and by item, the author realizes, Japan uniquely differs from other countries in the world. The item is the ratio of taxes to GDP, 1960-2015. The ratio in Japan has been continuously decreasing while those in all the other countries show an increasing trend, robustly or fluctuating, decreasing temporarily or in a specific year(s), or moving in a cyclical trend, normally and differently. What does this mean for future economic decision-making by government? Is there any regrettable result in maintaining consumption and national economy? Which is efficient and effective for a country to take, the market principles or government policies? Can national policies conquer any discrepancy or mistaking results? What is the true reason/cause? The literature cannot explain the reason pertinently at all, Prof. Kamiryo perceives. The above questions are all solved by the following illustrations on pages 435, 441, 453, 459, 465, 471, 477, 481, 483, and 489, in Appendix 3. In particular, the difference between actual and endogenous data tells us everything; such ratios as profit, net investment after economic depreciation, taxes, and the rate of return. These pages are respectively 453, 459, 465, and 471. Plainly speaking, Japanese government cannot increase consumption or commodity tax rate. A true reason is the accumulation of deficits and debts, regardless of bonds or Bank of Japan printing papers. Which is taken, default or compulsive inflation-policy? Financial fund managers watch the timing for the US to execute a tight-money policy in order to avoid bubbles-burst open. The current situation always balances between no-individual policy (inflated spending in unnecessary investments) and individual-oriented policy (towards no inflation/deflation). No inflation or minus inflation is wholly tied up with full-employment. Or, the rate of employment is a result of whole policies. One results in hopeless decrease in the real wage rate and, the other deflation as a special returns or compensation for individuals. Government cannot stop deflation unless it decreases deficits and debts as a whole. The market principles and the rate of interests are real, while government's trial-and-error policies have no meaning or remain to ease individuals¥¯ mind. China, regardless of democracy or dictatorship, easily solves policy specifying problem by setting the difference between actual and endogenous data, although there is no answer in the literature yet, as proved by G20 meeting, Turkey on 4 Sep 2015. Business and stock prices remain resultant and policy-makers should be away from business and stock prices.
B50|The case for increasing returns I: ‘The Hicksian Getaway’ and ‘The Hirshleifer Rescue’|The case for increasing returns is accepted by most heterodox economists. Yet allegiance to decreasing returns in orthodox circles still endures directly and in the form of substitution assumptions. In forty short years from 1928 to 1968, beliefs shifted from Pigou calling rising cost ‘inadmissible’ to Alchian deeming decreasing returns ‘a universally valid law’ until Kaldor revived the case for increasing returns in the 1970s. How did these shifts of view occur? After dapham opened the door and Pigou defined the orthodox stand, the 1930s debates swept through imperfect competition and many other issues into Keynesian disequilibrium theory. In 1939, ‘The Hicksian Getaway’ opened an Age of Denial leading to equilibrium theories based on substitution; then during the 1960s a second challenge to rising cost based on learning and technical change was defeated by ‘The Hirshleifer Rescue’ of decreasing returns and thus substitution in neoclassical theory. Why economists' substitution assumptions still hold sway is the focus of this study. First, the paper reviews ‘The Hicksian Getaway’ in its context and with respect to equilibrium models. Second, the paper analyzes and disproves ‘The Hirshleifer Rescue’ as an invalid argument based on a non-sequitur and thus simply asserted. Third, the case for increasing returns is developed into a theory of planning horizons supporting a generalized complementarity in economics. Some methodological implications are explored at the end.
B50|Economics in times of crisis. In search of a new paradigm in economic sciences|The relationship between the development of economics and economic performance is not reducible to any set of simple rules. Among the historians of economic thought there is even a handful of those who perceive the progress in economics mostly as an outcome of the attempts to solve the problems, inconsistencies and paradoxes within economic theory itself. Seen from this perspective, economic reality has minor (or no) importance. On the other hand, the endeavours to modify a mainstream approach are significantly greater in times of economic downturns. Seeing that economics is in such a state of ‘intellectual ferment’ nowadays, it is worth reconsidering the connection between economics and the economy. Thus the main aim of the paper is to analyse the current state of economic science in relation to the last economic slump. Although it is of course not possible to predict the future trajectories of economic theorising, taking into consideration the nature of the crisis the most feasible and potentially most fruitful areas are indicated.
B50|A criterion for realism, with an application to behavioral economic models|Many economists working within the framework of behavioral economics (BE) label the conventional way of modeling as unrealistic, and consider their own approach as more realistic than the standard practice. However, a criterion for realism is lacking in behavioral economics literature. This paper offers a simple criterion for predicating realism to economic models, and provides an illustration of such criterion at work on a particular BE model.
B50|Producción circular, clases socioeconómicas, demanda final y empleo en la economía monetaria de producción|El ensayo investiga la relación entre producción circular, clases socioeconómicas, demanda final y empleo. Con base en la teoría del análisis insumo-producto se muestra que existe una asimetría funcional entre los hogares propietarios y los hogares trabajadores en cuanto a su capacidad de determinación del nivel y la estructura de la demanda final, la producción y el empleo. Esto confirma una vez más la tesis de Kalecki según la cual los capitalistas se labran su propio destino al tiempo que fijan la condición social de la vida de los trabajadores asalariados. La discusión se plantea en el contexto más amplio de una teoría de la economía monetaria de producción.
B50|Fundamentos de la gestión humanista: una perspectiva filosófica|Este trabajo utiliza el rombo filosófico de Bédard para hacer un análisis de la dimensión ontológica, epistemológica, axiológica y praxiológica de la gestión humanista, permitiendo observar la complejidad que representa su estudio e implementación. Resultado del análisis es la identificación de los retos a los que se enfrenta la gestión humanista, entre los que destaca el cambio del paradigma administrativo que imperó durante el siglo XX, la inclusión de diversas disciplinas de las ciencias sociales en su estudio y el abandono del homo economicus como racionalidad de la actividad humana. El trabajo aporta una comprensión de la gestión humanista desde las dimensiones que integra la filosofía de la administración y no desde las corrientes filosóficas que la nutren, teniendo como resultado la identificación de las disciplinas de las ciencias sociales, los valores y las prácticas que integran el estudio de la gestión humanista.
B50|Die Macht der Wissenschaftsstatistik und die Entwicklung der Ökonomie|Citation metrics has become an important tool in the assessment of scientific research. Journal rankings and productivity indices are thereby understood as signifying reputation and impact within a scientific community, which is interpreted as a proxy for the quality of research. In this respect, the introduction of citation metrics for research assessment is part of a larger social trend to simplify complex issues by means of numerical expressions. Against this backdrop, this paper takes a look at the effects of the introduction of evaluative scientometrics within the field of economics. It is shown that the “power of citation metrics” has manifold consequences: the instruments of citation metrics not only reinforce conventional patterns of academic reproduction and attention in scientific discourse, but also influence the behavior of single agents as well as the paradigmatic developments of academic disciplines. / Zitationsmessungen und darauf basierende Indices und Ranglisten spielen eine immer wesentlichere Rolle im Wissenschaftsbetrieb, insbesondere im Rahmen der Bewertung und Evaluierung von Forschungsleistungen. Die Etablierung quantitativer Evaluationsroutinen im Wissenschaftsbetrieb steht dabei symptomatisch für einen umfassenderen sozialen Trend, komplexe Sachverhalte durch ihre numerische Fassung scheinbar oder tatsächlich zu vereinfachen. In diesem Kontext versucht dieser Beitrag, die Auswirkungen wissenschaftsstatistischer Evaluationsverfahren auf die weitere Wissenschaftsentwicklung zu analysieren und dabei insbesondere das Beispiel der ökonomischen Disziplin in den Blick zu nehmen. Dabei zeigt sich, dass die Macht der (evaluativen) Wissenschaftsstatistik vielfältige Auswirkungen hervorbringt: So werden akademische Reproduktionslogiken, das Verhalten einzelner AkteurInnen im Wissenschaftsbetrieb sowie die paradigmatische Entwicklung von Disziplinen durch wissenschaftsstatistische Verfahren beeinflusst.
B50|Central Fallacies of Modern Economics|Although it is widely recognised that the modern discipline of economics is short on explanatory successes, there is little sign that ongoing critical assessments of the situation are leading to any improvements. The reason for this lack of progress, it will be argued, is a prevalence of a set of fallacies maintained very often by mainstream practitioners and heterodox critics alike. These tend to take the form of presuppositions that underpin more explicit beliefs and accepted practices. Mostly they remain implicit and largely unnoticed. When noticed, they are regarded as so obviously correct they are rarely critically examined. Here I do examine them both explicitly and critically. / Obwohl es weithin anerkannt ist, dass die moderne Wirtschaftswissenschaft nur geringen Erklärungserfolg vorweisen kann, gibt es nur wenig Anzeichen dafür, dass kritische Einschätzungen dieser Situation zu irgendwelchen Verbesserungen führen. Der Grund für diesen Mangel an Fortschritt liegt, wie hier argumentiert wird, in der Vorherrschaft einer Reihe von Irrtümern, die häufig gleichermaßen von Mainstream-Praktikern wie heterodoxen Kritikern aufrecht erhalten werden. Dieses findet gemeinhin in der Form von Vorfestlegungen statt, die explizitere Überzeugungen und akzeptierte Praktiken untermauern. In den meisten Fällen blieben diese Vorfestlegungen implizit und werden deshalb nicht erkannt. Und wenn sie erkannt werden, werden sie so offensichtlich korrekt angesehen, dass sie selten kritisch reflektiert werden. Hier werden sie einer expliziten und kritischen Untersuchung unterzogen.
B50|An analytical review of volatility metrics for bubbles and crashes|Bubbles and crashes have long been an important area of research that has not yet led to a comprehensive theoretical or empirical understanding of how to define, measure, and compare such extreme market events. Highlights of the vast literature on bubbles, crashes, and volatility are surveyed and a promising direction for future research, based on a theory of short-side rationing, is described. The theory suggests that, especially in extreme market conditions, marginal quantities held or not held become transactionally more important than the prices paid or received. Our approach is empirically implemented by fitting monthly elasticity of return variances to an exponential expression. From this follows a comparison of changes in implied versus realized volatility, generation of an extreme events line (EEL), and a crash intensity comparison metric. These methods open a new perspective from which it is possible to analyze bubble and crash events as applied to different time scales and asset classes that include bonds, real estate, foreign exchange, and commodities.

B50|Free market madness and human nature|Purpose - – This paper aims to discuss the crises of free market capitalism in terms of its understanding of human nature. It reveals how recent market madness can be attributed to certain elements of human nature. Design/methodology/approach - – The paper uses a conceptual and philosophical approach to analyze crises of free market capitalism. It links both success and failure of capitalism to its understanding of human nature. It compares and contrasts economic assumptions of human nature in conventional and Islamic economics. It attempts to explain the 2008 financial crisis through a comprehensive theory of human nature. Findings - – It sheds some light on the irrational aspect of human nature as the driving factor behind the 2008 financial crisis. It elaborates on the importance of knowing self for knowing human decisions in free market economy. It concludes with the need for a comprehensive theory of human nature to predict and prevent irrational and irresponsible behaviors of populist politicians, greedy capitalists and conspicuous consumers. The paper also reflects on the 2013 Nobel Prize in economics as a victory for the study of human nature. Originality/value - – The paper offers a new perspective to understand crises of free market capitalism.
B50|Wealth Concentration, Income Distribution, and Alternatives for the USA|US household wealth concentration is not likely to decline in response to fiscal interventions alone. Creation of an independent public wealth fund could lead to greater equality. Similarly, once-off tax/transfer packages or wage increases will not reduce income inequality significantly; on-going wage increases in excess of productivity growth would be needed. These results come from the accounting in a simulation model based on national income and financial data. The theory behind the model borrows from ideas that originated in Cambridge UK (especially from Luigi Pasinetti and Richard Goodwin).
B50|¿Debería la economía heterodoxa ser enseñada en departamentos de economía, o existe algún espacio para la economía backwater?|Ha habido varios llamados estudiantiles para un mayor nivel de pluralismo en las salas de clases. Este artículo esboza las razones por las cuales es improbable que tales llamados sean escuchados. Los economistas ortodoxos creen que ya existe suficiente pluralismo y debate al interior de la ortodoxia y no llegan a darse cuenta que los economistas heterodoxos pueden hacer contribuciones positivas al campo de la economía, creyendo por el contrario que sus contribuciones consisten mayormente en diversas críticas al paradigma dominante. Además, la situación presente no es conducente a un mayor pluralismo dado que existe un excesivo flujo de oferta de doctores en economía dispuestos a perseguir una carrera académica. Un mayor pluralismo en el aula a de clases puede requerir entonces la creación de un campo nuevo, distinto del de la economía.
B50|Structural Change and Transformation of Growth Regime in the Japanese Economy|The purpose of this study is to empirically examine the relationship between structural change and economic growth in Japan during the past 40 years. While using the growth in real value added and labour productivity as measurement of economic growth, we consider the structural change in value added as the structural change in output and that in capital and labour as the structural change in inputs. Specifically, we use the Japan Industrial Productivity database 2014 compiled by the Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry, and show (1) the pace of structural change in inputs and output, (2) the evolution of sectoral dispersion of economic growth, (3) the changing distribution of sectoral contribution to aggregate economic growth, and (4) empirical evidence of the relationship between structural change and economic growth. Our main conclusion is that the Japanese growth regime has transformed from a heterogeneity decreased regime with overall growth process to a heterogeneity increased one with uneven growth process since the 1990s; the impact that structural change in output had on economic growth was positive, although its magnitude has weakened since then.
B50|Markt und Macht|The relationship between the market and private power is a tense one. Picturing a market “free of dominance” on which all power is neutralised is naïve, simply because ownership represents a great basis of power upon which a liberal society should not shake. Companies are always thinking of ways to increase producer surplus to the detriment of consumer surplus, which distorts distribution of funds on the capital markets and consequently leads to welfare losses. Nevertheless, as a rule, state intervention in the interests of disempowerment is not an option. Often the disadvantages of state empowerment are greater than the advantages. Frequently it is individual companies that benefit rather than the whole of society. However, the market itself still represents the best strategy for disempowerment, combatting inert or old-fashioned firms or sectors by means of competition. This will only work if the newcomers are able to convince people of the greater benefit of what they are offering. Ultimately, it all depends on entrepreneurial ingenuity and creativity.
B50|Minsky on Banking: Early Work on Endogenous Money and the Prudent Banker|"In this paper, I examine whether Hyman P. Minsky adopted an endogenous money approach in his early work--at the time that he was first developing his financial instability approach. In an earlier piece (Wray 1992), I closely examined Minsky's published writings to support the argument that, from his earliest articles in 1957 to his 1986 book (as well as a handout he wrote in 1987 on ""securitization""), he consistently held an endogenous money view. I'll refer briefly to that published work. However, I will devote most of the discussion here to unpublished early manuscripts in the Minsky archive (Minsky 1959, 1960, 1970). These manuscripts demonstrate that in his early career Minsky had already developed a deep understanding of the nature of banking. In some respects, these unpublished pieces are better than his published work from that period (or even later periods) because he had stripped away some institutional details to focus more directly on the fundamentals. It will be clear from what follows that Minsky's approach deviated substantially from the postwar ""Keynesian"" and ""monetarist"" viewpoints that started from a ""deposit multiplier."" The 1970 paper, in particular, delineates how Minsky's approach differs from the ""Keynesian"" view as presented in mainstream textbooks. Further, Minsky's understanding of banking in those years appears to be much deeper than that displayed three or four decades later by much of the post-Keynesian endogenous-money literature."
B50|The Repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act and the Federal Reserve's Extraordinary Intervention during the Global Financial Crisis|Before the global financial crisis, the assistance of a lender of last resort was traditionally thought to be limited to commercial banks. During the crisis, however, the Federal Reserve created a number of facilities to support brokers and dealers, money market mutual funds, the commercial paper market, the mortgage-backed securities market, the triparty repo market, et cetera. In this paper, we argue that the elimination of specialized banking through the eventual repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act (GSA) has played an important role in the leakage of the public subsidy intended for commercial banks to nonbank financial institutions. In a specialized financial system, which the GSA had helped create, the use of the lender-of-last-resort safety net could be more comfortably limited to commercial banks. However, the elimination of GSA restrictions on bank-permissible activities has contributed to the rise of a financial system where the lines between regulated and protected banks and the so-called shadow banking system have become blurred. The existence of the shadow banking universe, which is directly or indirectly guaranteed by banks, has made it practically impossible to confine the safety to the regulated banking system. In this context, reforming the lender-of-last-resort institution requires fundamental changes within the financial system itself.
B50|Heterodox economics, social ontology, and the use of mathematics|In a recent article (Lawson, 2013), Tony Lawson argues for a Veblenian interpretation of the term “neoclassical”, according to which a neoclassical economist is one whose methodology is at odds with their ontological presuppositions. This leads him to categorize many heterodox economists as neoclassical on the basis that their use of mathematical modeling is at odds with their (implicit) acceptance of an open-systems ontology. The reason is that, according to Lawson, mathematical modeling is deductivist: it presupposes that social systems are closed. The argument advanced in this paper is that this last claim is true only some of the time, and problematic only some of the time that it is true. It therefore amounts to a defense of mathematical modeling by heterodox economists that is, at the same time, sympathetic to Lawson’s claims that the social realm is structured but open and that this ontology is (implicitly) accepted by many heterodox economists.
B50|On Joan Robinson’s Abandonment of Exploitation|After discussing and analyzing exploitation as an analytical category in The Economics of Imperfection Competition and An Essay on Marxian Economics, Joan Robinson hardly mentioned it in The Accumulation of Capital. Despite analyzing her contributions at length, the literature has completely failed to recognize this curious turn, let alone explain it. This paper explains the abandonment of exploitation by arguing that it was one way to resolve the tension between the inherently normative aspects of the concept and her increasing discomfort with conflation of ideology and analysis across the first two books mentioned above.
B50|Methodological, internal and ontological inconsistencies in the conventional micro-foundation of post-Keynesian theory|By the aid of a simple but widely accepted model, the conventional micro-foundation of behavioral hypothesis postulated in post-Keynesian theory in the Kaleckian tradition is critically reviewed. Inconsistencies are identi ed along three dimensions: A methodological inconsistency arises from presenting macroeconomic arguments formally and microeconomic arguments verbally. An internal inconsistency prevails when the micro-considerations for di erent behavioral rules are mutually inconsistent. An ontological inconsistency arises since the postulated behavioral rules are invariant to endogenous changes in the micro-environment whereas the micro-considerations imply them to adjust endogenously. We arrive at two conclusions: First, re-visiting the issue of micro-foundation within the post-Keynesian framework may be a rewarding line of research. Second, the post-Keynesian research paradigm should be open to various forms of consistent micro-foundations as long as the economic mechanism characterized by the model are post-Keynesian.
B50|New Economic Sociology: Theoretical Achievements and Contemporary Challenges|This study presents some basic theoretical achievements and key concepts of the “new economic sociology”, which pretends to explore not peripheral economic phenomena, but fundamental economic processes. The theoretical programme of the new economic sociology is conceptualised in contrast with the assumptions of the neoclassical economics. The contributions of Bulgarian scholars to the analysis of important issues in the field of economic sociology are also highlighted. The study suggests hypotheses to explain the symptoms of recent slowdown in the development of economic sociology and possible perspectives for new theoretical breakthroughs. They are discussed in the context of contemporary societal challenges and conflicts, which seek their economic-sociological interpretation.
B50|Frederic S. Lee’s Contributions to Heterodox Economics|In this introduction we highlight Frederic Lee’s contributions to heterodox economics in terms of theory and community, which should be acknowledged and, more importantly, carried on by those who are concerned with the advancement of heterodox economics as an alternative critical theory to the status quo.
B50|European growth models and working class restructuring before the crisis|This paper builds on post-Keynesian macroeconomics, the Regulation Approach and a Neo-Gramscian International Political Economy approach to class analysis and offers an empirical analysis of European growth models and working class restructuring in Europe between 2000 and 2008. We will distinguish between the ‘East’, the ‘North’, and the ‘South’ and structure our analysis around industrial upgrading, financialisation and working class coherence. We find an export-driven growth model in the North, which came with wage suppression and outsourcing to the East. In the East the growth model can be characterised as dependent upgrading, which allowed for high real wage growth despite declining working class coherence. The South experienced a debt-driven growth model with a real estate bubble and high inflation rates resulting in large current account deficits. Our analysis shows that class restructuring forms an integral part in the economic process that resulted in European imbalances and the Euro crisis.
B50|Wage-led versus profit-led demand: What have we learned? A Kalecki-Minsky view|The Bhaduri-Marglin model has become a widely used workhorse model in heterodox macroeconomics and it has given rise to a dozen or so empirical studies, which at times have given conflicting results. Neo-Kaleckians and neo-Goodwinians have applied different estimation strategies, with the former typically estimating behavioural equations, while the latter have often used reduced-form demand equations. Further differences include the lag structure, the output measure, the control variables and the sample. The paper, firstly, tries to clarify the terms of the debate. While neo-Kaleckians interpret the model as medium-term, partial-equilibrium goods market model, neo-Goodwinians are interested in the interaction of demand and distribution and regard the model as a long-run model with short-run cycles. Second, we elaborate a Kalecki-Minsky view of the economy as characterised by a wage-led demand regime and cycles driven by financial fragility. Many of the reported results may suffer from omitted variable bias as they do not include financial control variables. At least in the recent past, financial effects on demand have been much larger in size than distribution effects. A wage-led Minsky model with reserve army distribution function gives rise to pseudo-Goodwin cycles.
B50|Returns to tail hedging|Tail hedging is a portfolio management strategy meant to reduce the risk of large losses. For an investor who holds a stock market index fund, the strategy entails buying out of the money put options on the index. Research suggests the strategy works well in practice and I explore the returns to tail hedging in a simple theoretical model. I calculate descriptive statistics for the returns to tail hedging when the stock price has either a normal or fat tailed distribution. I find that tail hedging is rewarding when stock prices have fat tails.
B50|Bitcoin Mission Statement. Or What does it mean Sharing Economy and Distributed Trust?|Technological advancements in the means of production are the driving force behind the changes in the prevailing system of socio-economic relations. Feudalism was transformed into capitalism as a result of such advancements. While man obtained physical freedom, the financial freedom remained under the control of the centralized authority. A deep level of collaboration is required to attain the next level of productivity provided by new technological advancements. However, the present system with a centralized control of governance and finance appears to constrain and restrain the value producing economy. This constriction becomes especially evident when the business environment requires collaboration to create, as it underlines the inherent conflict of centralized control. The most recent tech sector innovations, such as smart contracts and cryptocurrencies, are poised to disrupt the system of centralized control. The removal of a centralized authority from the position of control will change the fabric of the society to reflect the mesh network of shared resources. The society will transform to the new form of socio-economic relations – the era of Crypto-Socialism.
B50|Schumpeter’s “Business Cycles” Revisited|In this lecture from the end of the 1990s, until now unpublished, Chris Freeman analyses the possible reasons for the relative lack of receptivity awarded to Schumpeter’s Business Cycles. He suggests that the insufficient success may be due, not to the heavy style or the doubts about statistical validity, but rather to the weaknesses in the theory. According to Freeman, Schumpeter was right in pointing to the qualitative changes in the structure of the economy as the causes of the spring and ebb tides in growth rates. Where he was weak was in his theories of innovation, entrepreneurship and technology. The article analyses each of these theories, discussing their strengths and shortcomings, and then looks at how the neoSchumpeterians have been contributing to further the strengths and overcome the weaknesses. The article concludes inviting researchers to continue following Schumpeter’s pioneering insights into the theories of innovation and long cycles. RÉSUMÉ. Dans cette conférence de la fin des années 1990, non publiée jusqu’à maintenant, Chris Freeman recherche les raisons possibles du relatif manque d’attention accordé au Business Cycles de Schumpeter. Il suggère que ce faible succès pourrait être dû non pas à la lourdeur du style ni aux doutes quant à la validité statistique, mais plutôt à des faiblesses de la théorie. Selon Freeman, Schumpeter avait raison de montrer que les changements qualitatifs dans la structure de l’économie étaient la cause des flux et reflux de croissance. Mais il y a des faiblesses dans ses théories sur l’innovation, l’entrepreneuriat et la technologie. L’article analyse chacune de ces théories, discutant leurs points forts et leurs lacunes, et regarde ensuite comment les néo-schumpetériens ont contribué à faire avancer les points forts et dépasser les faiblesses. L’article conclut en invitant les chercheurs à poursuivre les idées pionnières de Schumpeter dans les théories de l’innovation et des cycles longs.
B50|From Long Waves to Great Surges|This article maps the continuation of the late Chris Freeman’s work on long waves as well as my own contributions along those lines. It begins with a brief summary of the contents of his 2001 book with Francisco Louca, As Time Goes By: from the Industrial Revolutions to the Information Revolution, where they, first, theoretically make the case for long waves in the capitalist economy on the basis of ‘reasoned history’ and they, then, qualitatively describe each of the successive technological revolutions and the transformations they bring. Next, the article presents the reasons for my own abandonment of the term “long waves” for that of “great surges” followed by the research consequences of shifting the focus from the rate of economic growth to the patterns of diffusion of each set of revolutionary technologies. Finally it draws the implications for policy making of the recurring sequence thus identified, which is the purpose Chris Freeman always pursued himself and encouraged us all to pursue.
B50|The Greek saga: competing explanations of the Greek crisis|This paper reviews the alternative explanations offered to explain the Greek crisis and checks there analytical and empirical validity. The first part focuses on the mainstream explanations. It distinguishes three main versions (‘Greek disease’, EMU is an unrectifiable non-OCA, EMU has problems but can be rectified). Mainstream explanations are criticized for failing to comprehend properly the deep structural dimensions of the Greek crisis and attributing it to policy errors. The second part reviews the radical explanations and particularly those around the ‘financialization thesis’. It also distinguishes three versions (EMU is the problem, Minskian case, equilibrium of class struggle). These explanations are criticized for offering a weak structural explanation of the Greek crisis by focusing upon policy or conjectural elements. The last part surveys the more classical Marxist explanations of the Greek crisis. These have a different understanding of the relationship between real and financial accumulation from all the previous explanations. Three versions are presented (TRPF, TRPF and underconsumption, TRPF and imperialist exploitation). It is argued that Marxist explanations grasp better than the rest the deep structural dimensions of the Greek crisis.

B50|Un régime monétaire traditionnel contesté par la monnaie d’État : l’histoire du kip au Nord-Laos de 1975 à 2000|Le gouvernement de la République démocratique populaire lao impose un nouveau modèle économique en 1986. Les réformes engagées cherchent à promouvoir une « économie de marché » et à diffuser la monnaie nationale, le kip. Monétiser l’économie constitue un objectif de premier ordre et, en même temps, un moyen pour mettre en œuvre les processus de marchandisation. Cependant, imposer une nouvelle monnaie ne va pas de soi dans la mesure où elle conteste directement l’ordre monétaire antérieur et les pratiques sociales correspondantes. À Phongsaly, province isolée au nord de la République, l’État s’appuie sur la fiscalité et sur les transferts pour diffuser sa monnaie dans un environnement où elle occupait, au départ, une place ténue. Le kip s’impose, il transforme les représentations monétaires et les monnaies traditionnelles ; les biens dotés d’attributs monétaires sont relégués au niveau de la marchandise. L’action de l’État impulse un nouveau paysage monétaire au sommet duquel se trouve une monnaie idoine au développement des échanges marchands. Ainsi, les mutations sociales recherchées s’enclenchent et le programme politique voté en 1986 se réalise.
B50|Is Neoclassical Economics Scientific Knowledge Detached from Ethics? A Kantian Answer, an Institutionalist Alternative|This paper aims to criticize the common idea which sustains that current neoclassical economics is detached from ethics, and therefore is scientific knowledge. Using Kantian critical philosophy, we argue, on the contrary, that neoclassical economics is based on certain ethical postulates, and thus it cannot obtain the status of science. Although ethics is but one of the many institutions that affect economics, it plays a major role in setting the basis on which to build its entire theoretical structure. Approaching the analysis from institutionalism places ethical issues at the forefront of economic debate, thus opening the door to future dialogue between disciplines and analytical approaches.
B50|Capital, Economic Crises, Institutions and History|This article examines different ways of â€œdoingâ€ heterodox political economy by way of â€œbook plansâ€ for â€œprinciples and practicesâ€ volumes (and articles). First, the Uno Japanese School method is scrutinized, as utilized by Robert Albritton and John Bell; starting with [a] the pure theory of â€œcapitalâ€ ; followed by [b] stages of evolution including institutions; and concluding with [c] political economy history. Second, this is compared with the methods of Michael Lebowitz and David Harvey, who both seek to interpenetrate within discourse the [i] the principles of â€œcapital,â€ with more concrete issues such as [ii] wage labor, [iii] landed property, [iv] state, and [v] the uneven world economy and crises. Third, the Japanese School, Lebowitz, and Harvey methods are compared vis-Ã -vis both Karl Marxâ€™s â€œBook Plansâ€ and explanations of the 2008-14 crises of capitalism (deep recessions, debt crises). Fourth, I introduce other plans, such as those developed by Samuel Bowles, Howard Sherman, and Danny Mackinnon (and coauthors), respectively. One of these such plans starts with [1] history and institutions; followed by [2] capitalism and the surplus; linking this with [3] social structures of accumulation, community, and state; and last adding [4] policy/governance plus alternative systems and institutions. The significance of these various book plans for the future of heterodox political economy is then outlined.
B50|Is Over-investment the Cause of the Post-2007 U.S. Economic Crisis?1|A significant number of left political economists hold that the U.S. Great Recession and subsequent lethargic performance are a crisis of over-capacity that resulted from over-investment. Kotz (2011, 2013) has recently attempted to provide empirical support for this position. Despite sharing an understanding of the crisis very similar to his, the authors find in this paper that a careful examination of his evidence does not support considering this to be a crisis of over-investment.
B50|İktisadi Sosyolojiden Yeni İktisat Sosyolojisine: İktisat ve Sosyoloji İlişkisinin Değişen Yüzü|This study aims to put forth the diversities between the economic sociology that was founded at the beginning of the last century and the New Economic Sociology that was established at the middle of 80s and is popular nowadays especially in the USA. The new economic sociology has changed the traditional relation between the economics and sociology. While the economic sociology approach that emerged at the beginning of last century has worked on a ground that may be resumed as an evaluation of the economic events from a sociological standpoint; the new economic sociology approach that emerged at 80s has the opposite content that evaluates the sociological events with an economic view point. It may be said that due to that quality, the new economic sociology approach is a typical example for the methological imperialism of the economics. This study consists of three parts. In the first part, the transformation of the relation between economics and sociology will be examined; secondly the main principles of the economic sociology based on the ideas of Weber and Durkheim will be assessed and lastly, along with a critical examination of the new economic sociology, the study will end with an evaluation of what may be done in order to reattach the bonds between the economics and the society that were already cut off.
B50|Latin American Economic History: looking backwards for the future|The paper will explore different trends in Latin American economic history written in different periods, relating them to contemporary academics, economic and political debates in Latin America and in the developed world. It will highlight the extent to which economic history in Latin America and Latin American historiography has shown similar development patterns to the Western canon, where particular and distinctive features can be found.
B50|Economic Theory As Praxeology|The paper aims to deliver a logical and epistemological demonstration for the economics statute inside the social sciences. In my opinion, economics is not a science because it doesn’t verify the criteria of scientificity, as this concept is generally accepted. The demonstration is based on sufficiency predicates of cognition and scientificity, respectively. More general, I think no social discipline is a science. Some of them are hermeneutics, some are praxeologies, and some are ethics. Economics seems to be a praxeology.
B50|What happened to heterodox economics in Germany after the 1970s|In the context of ongoing criticisms of the lack of pluralism in economics, the present article aims to discuss the development of 'heterodox' economics since the 1970s. Following Lakatos's concept of scientific research programs (srp), and concentrating on the situation in Germany, the article will discuss classifications of economics, and will specify the understanding of diversity in the light of 'axiomatic variations' of the economic mainstream. This will form the basis for the subsequent description of the development of heterodoxy in Germany, with special reference to the founding of new universities and the reform movements in the 1970s. It can be shown that the heterodox scene flourished in this period, but that this pluralization remained fragmented and short-lived; by the 1980s at the latest heterodoxy was again on its way to marginalization. The history of heterodoxy in Germany thus presents itself as an unequal 'battle of the paradigms', and can only be told as the story of a failure.
B50|Orthodoxy versus heterodoxy: Inflation, unemployment, growth, profit|"Institutions like the IMF, the ECB and many finance ministries and private banks in the world's richest countries are sending out unequivocal calls for strict control of prices to be addressed urgently, given their intrinsic relationship with how the budget deficit and government debt evolve. These messages allow very little room for nuances or interpretations, stating categorically that price stability is the essential factor that guarantees economic growth and therefore plays a key role in enabling countries to achieve good living standards. Nevertheless, inflation, which nobody doubts needs to be kept under control, requires a much deeper analysis to avoid over-mechanical, over- simplistic applications for the present situation. We mustn't fall into what Paul Samuelson called basing economic policy on ""shibboleths"" - that is, hard and fast slogans that take over serious, thoughtful discussion and exchange of opinions. Especially since in economics slogans become hallmarks that are constantly repeated, and this repetition gets in the way of the obvious truth. This trend has led to the sale of intellectual products with no scientific backing. A case in point is David H. Fischer's book on prices. Addressing business leaders, he asserts categorically that econo mic cycles and crises have ended, but the actual economic events have disproved this. As Robert Solow warns, there is not one set of laws of economics applicable to all times and all places, and the part of e conomics that is not dependent upon economic history and the social context is very small and of little interest."
B50|The Financial and Political Opportunity Costs of Orangutan Conservation in the Face of Oil-Palm Expansion| This paper examines the opportunity costs of conserving the forest habitats of the endangered orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus spp.) of Indonesia and Malaysia in the face of a highly profitable alternative land use, the conversion of these habitats for the production of palm oil. It shows that one component of the financial opportunity cost of conserving orangutan habitat, the business opportunity cost (profits foregone), was high in both Malaysia and Indonesia in the case of oil-palm development. It is argued that this would be difficult to offset under the payments-for-ecosystem-services (PES) approach. However, the government opportunity cost of conservation in Indonesia, such as the land-tax revenue foregone by local governments by conserving rather than leasing out orangutan habitats for agricultural use, are sometimes lower than the business opportunity cost of conservation. It is suggested that targeting government opportunity costs to conserve unleased forests could potentially offer lower-cost opportunities for conserving orangutan habitats. If, however, political and institutional realities are taken into account, there might exist another type of opportunity cost of conservation— a political one— that could impede the success of the PES approach. Some oil-palm companies in Borneo offer financial inducements in the form of kickbacks and other types of political donations to government officials to obtain land for growing oil palm. This ‘government decisionmaker’s opportunity cost’ has not been addressed in the PES literature, which typically compares potential ecosystem payments with the commercial profits that would have to be sacrificed as a result of conserving forests. The impact of this political opportunity cost on oil-palm expansion is discussed. It is suggested that solutions to this conservation problem cannot be restricted to the monetary valuation method but must also involve alternative political economic interventions.
B50|Economics in Times of Crisis. In Search of a New Paradigm|The relationship between the development of economics and economic performance is not reducible to any set of simple rules. Among the historians of economic thought there is even a handful of those who perceive the progress in economics mostly as an outcome of the attempts to solve the problems, inconsistencies and paradoxes within economic theory itself. Seen from this perspective, economic reality has minor (or no) importance. On the other hand, the endeavours to modify a mainstream approach are significantly greater in times of economic downturns. Seeing that economics is in such a state of ‘intellectual ferment’ nowadays, it is worth reconsidering the connection between economics and the economy. Thus the main aim of the paper is to analyse the current state of economic science in relation to the last economic slump. Although it is of course not possible to predict the future trajectories of economic theorising, taking into consideration the nature of the crisis the most feasible and potentially most fruitful areas are indicated.
B50|Behavioral Indifference Curves|According to the endowment effect there is some discomfort associated with giving up a good, that is to say, we are willing to give up something only if the price is greater than the price we are willing to pay for it. This implies that the indifference curves should designate a reference point at the current level of consumption. Such indifference maps are kinked at the current level of consumption. The kinks in the curves imply that the utility function is not differentiable everywhere and the budget constraint does not always have a unique tangent with an indifference curve. Thus, price changes may not bring about changes in consumption which may be the reason for the frequent stickiness of prices, wages and interest rates. We also discuss a multiple period example in which the indifference map shifts as the reference point shifts implying that the curves cross over time even though tastes do not change.
B50|The Rational Expectations Hypothesis: An assessment on its real world application|The Rational Expectations Hypothesis was first developed as a theoretical technique aimed at explaining agents’ behavior in a given environment. In particular, it describes how the outcome of a given economic phenomenon depends to a certain degree on what agents expect to happen. Subsequently, it was introduced into macroeconomic models as a way to explain the ineffectiveness of monetary policy. Since then, most of these models have been based on the rational expectations assumption. This paper assesses the real life application of this feature based on two arguments: the determination of an objective reality through beliefs and subjective expectations; and the exclusion of the evolution of human knowledge and innovation in macroeconomic models. La Hipótesis de Expectativas Racionales fue desarrollada en principio, como una herramienta teórica cuyo objetivo era explicar el comportamiento de los agentes en un escenario dado. En particular, procuraba describir cómo el resultado de un fenómeno económico depende en cierto grado de lo que los agentes esperan que ocurra. Posteriormente, el concepto fue introducido en los modelos macroeconómicos como un medio para explicar la ineficiencia de la política monetaria. Desde ese momento, la mayoría de estos modelos han encontrado su fundamento en el supuesto de expectativas racionales. Este artículo evalúa la aplicación que tiene el concepto de expectativas racionales en el mundo real con base en dos argumentos: la determinación de una realidad objetiva a través de creencias y expectativas subjetivas; y la exclusión de la evolución del conocimiento humano y la innovación en los modelos macroeconómicos.
B50|Entrepreneurs and wage-earners: a monetary approach|The purpose of the paper is to o¤er a logical genesis of the di¤erenci- ation of agents in two classes: capitalist entrepreneurs and wage-earners. The model presented here does not follow the Classical (or Marxian) tra- dition (where the two opposed classes are the straight consequence of the concentration of the means of production in the hands of a limited fraction of people). It does not follow mainstream economists either (no di¤erence according to general competitive equilibrium or a di¤erence taken as given in labour economics in general). Models belonging to those traditions fail to reproduce a major stylised fact: wage-earners cannot be distinguished from entrepreneurs when they are in the market for ccommodities but they radically di¤er in the 'market for labour'or in production (wage-earners do not produce for their own account but for that of entrepreneurs who get pro ts, not wages). Modern tentatives to deal with the di¤erenciation of agents (Mat- suyama for instance) explain it by a progressive di¤erenciation of the level of wealth up to a threshold which makes some agents able to accumulate and others not. We propose a di¤erent view based on the process of issuance of money. If a fraction of agents have not a direct access to that process they cannot act in the market for their own account. The alternatives they have are limited to autarky or to work for the account of those who have addi- tional alternatives due to their direct access to money (to be independent producers or entrepreneurs hiring wage-earners). The model makes explicit the necessary and su¢ cient conditions for the existence of an E-equilibrium in which co-exist heterogeneous agents (entrepreneurs and wage-earners) starting from a population homogeneous except for bank rationing. These reasonable conditions are: an e¢ cient monetary system, a su¢ cient gap between productivity of production in mass compared to other types and a possibility to induce wage-earners to work signi cantly more than they would as free producers. A non-Marxian notion of exploitation is suggested to conclude.
B50|Uma interpretação do novo desenvolvimentismo a partir da conjuntura econômica da América Latina|Este artigo visa abordar de maneira crítica não apenas o conjunto de políticas que se denominou de (neo) liberal na América Latina, como também fazer uma análise crítica das teses do (novo)desenvolvimentismo que se colocam como alternativas às políticas anteriores. O (novo) desenvolvimentismo aparece muito mais em função da própria incapacidade de resposta aos problemas que as teses (neo) liberais se dispuseram a equacionar. Efetivamente não é uma ideia força de um pensamento contemporâneo autônomo que se propõe a construir uma tese espontânea, tampouco uma teoria econômica. Em outras palavras, é uma soma de valores, ideias, instituições e políticas econômicas.
B50|Entry and exit in disequilibrium|Most entrepreneurship theory depicts disequilibrium as the most common state for entrepreneurial activity and yet remarkably very little empirical research investigates the role of entry and exit in this type of external environment. Drawing on economics and organizational ecology we outline reasons why the interrelation between entry, exit and incumbent firms is likely to vary when the actual number of firms is higher or lower than the number that a market can sustain. We also introduce a new empirical methodology to explain entry and exit levels in two different types of disequilibria comprising situations when markets under and over shoot carrying capacity. Using a data set on the retail industry, we find that in undershoots a lack of competition between incumbent firms restores equilibrium by creating room for new-firm entry. In contrast, in overshoots competition induced by new firms (in particular strong displacement) restores equilibrium. We also find that equilibrium-restoring mechanisms are faster in over than undershoots. The results highlight that the behaviour and impact of entry and exit varies depending on the type of disequilibrium.
B50|The neoclassical sink and the heterodox spiral: political divides and lines of communication in economics|A crisis that started as a textbook case of how financial and asset markets can spin out of control without adequate public oversight has transmuted in 5 years into a crisis of irresponsible sovereigns, such that restoring prosperity requires that governments re-establish control over their own excessive spending. How did this happen? This paper explains the recovery of position by pro-market, restricted-government proponents in economics on the basis of political divides and segmented lines of communication within the academic economics profession. These political divides involve a double invisibilization of power within economics: an invisibilization both of the political purposes served by a profession whose leading models deny the relevance of social and political power, and of the ideational barriers to entry into â€˜mainstreamâ€™ departments. The argument is motivated and illustrated by the cases of the subprime and the eurozone crises.
B50|Workplace relations, unemployment and finance-dominated capitalism|This paper considers the interconnections between the nature and organization of work and the level of unemployment. We consider how actions taken at the workplace level can impede as well as facilitate the reduction in unemployment. We also consider how the workplace may be reformed to overcome some of the obstacles, economic as well as political, to full employment. Finally, we examine the impacts of the current finance-dominated capitalism on work organization and workers. Our view is that financialization represents a major barrier to full employment, not only because of its tendency to limit real investment but also because of its negative effects on the bargaining power of workers.
B50|Application of Minsky's Theory to State-Dominated Economies|"The global financial crisis of 2007-2008, consequences of which continue to adversely affect the world economy, is often called a ""Minsky crisis"". A prominent American economist Hyman Philip Minsky studied capitalist economic system paying special attention to its major properties, in particular, instability and high importance of money. He developed a consistent way to explain the nature of economic crises, which, according to him, are generated through financial mechanisms. Minsky's financial instability hypothesis states that the fragility of financial system increases in periods of booms and thus crises arise from the very structure of business cycles. In this paper we give a short review of Minsky's ideas and show that the last financial crisis could be persuasively explained in the framework of financial instability hypothesis. Moreover, we provide the extension of Minsky's hypothesis and apply his insights to the ""state-dominated economies"". Interesting and vivid examples of such economies are modern Russian economy (characterized by weak institutions, resource curse and dominance of state-related companies in the financial as well as non-financial sectors) and planned economy of the Soviet Union. We analyze the financial crisis 2008-2009 in Russia and the breakdown of the USSR and argue that these events could be interpreted along Minsky's line of argument."
B50|Posture e imposture del lavoro cognitivo. Ripensare la pratica sindacale nel capitalismo delle reti e dei saperi|"La centralità della componente cognitiva all’interno dei processi di produzione del valore contemporanei si accompagna a una progressiva frantumazione e umiliazione del lavoro. Appare inoltre piuttosto evidente come i caratteri oggettivi e soggettivi del lavoro cognitivo diano vita a fenomenologie culturali e sociali inedite, che le tradizionali coordinate teoriche interpretative della modernità industriale stentano a comprendere. Ad esempio, il rapporto tra lavoro e processi di soggettivazione tende oggi sempre di più a seguire percorsi ""imprevisti"" e non scontati, che da un lato re-inscrivono il lavorare all’interno d’inedite e singolari istanze di autonomia e cooperazione sociale, dall’altro lo ""intrappolano"" in nuove, diffuse e logoranti condizioni di sfruttamento. Il futuro del sindacato dipenderà, allora, anche dalla sua capacità di interpretare e dare risposta alle nuove domande di tutela e progettualità sociale del lavoratore cognitivo."
B50|Case Study: Finance and Housing Provision in Britain|The paper uses the systems of provision (sop) approach to analyse the transformed presence of finance in the UK housing sop since the 1980s. ‘Sop’ analyses look at the integrated chain of agents involved in providing a good and the structures and processes through which they relate to each other. Such a study of UK housing is carried out from the vantage point of finance, asking how the transformation of mortgage finance since the 1980s has reshaped housing provision. It is argued that the reregulation of mortgage markets, along with increased international capital flows and a sustained period of low interest rates, led to influx of mortgage credit. On the production side, this expansion of mortgage lending has tended to feed prices rather than supply, in part reflecting both the availability of development finance and the use to which it was put. The activities of speculative housebuilders have been increasingly organised around the appropriation of land uplift, over which housebuilders compete with landowners and planners. Labour has suffered from casualisation as a result of housebuilders’ focusing their in-house activities on land acquisition and subcontracting construction. Such processes have also had implications for the availability of skills and other inputs, technological progress, and industry structure. On the consumption side, the transformation of mortgage markets coincided with, and helped to create, increased demand for owner-occupation. The latter was itself the consequence of the legacy of forms of provision throughout the 20th century interacting with a concerted effort on the part of the state to instigate both welfare reform and a cultural shift in preferences over housing. More generally, the state’s influence over the housing sop is pervasive, with the state involved more or less directly throughout the chain of provision
B50|Hyperinflation argentine de 1989 : une interprétation post-keynésienne|L’article poursuit un double objectif. Le premier vise à proposer une interprétation de l’hyperinflation compatible avec la théorie post-keynésienne. L’analyse des phénomènes hyperinflationnistes par les auteurs post-keynésiens mais aussi par les auteurs structuralistes permet de nourrir notre réflexion. Nous mettons l’accent sur l’importance de la présence d’une devise dans les comportements domestiques au cours des hautes inflations. D’ailleurs, selon nous, l’hyperinflation est indissociable du rejet complet de la monnaie domestique au profit d’une devise. Ce rejet, soudain dans son expression finale, se construit progressivement. Il est suscité par un violent conflit de répartition qui génère une forte inflation, par des phénomènes d’indexation, par un endettement externe libellé en devises et par des comportements auto-réalisateurs sur le change.Le second objectif réside dans la confrontation de cette proposition théorique aux faits économiques observés en Argentine sur une période qui débute lors des années 1970 et mène à l’hyperinflation de 1989. L’analyse d’économie politique historique permet de repérer la séquence suivante : le conflit de répartition est particulièrement virulent et régulièrement reconfiguré dès les années 1970. Cela provoque l’émergence d’arrangements institutionnels développés par les agents (l’indexation), pendant que le dollar prend de plus en plus d’importance dans l’économie. Ce dernier point est encouragé par l’adoption d’une politique de change originale dans un contexte de complète libéralisation financière à la fin des années 1970. L’impossibilité dans les années 1980 de stabiliser le taux de change dans un contexte de fort endettement externe rend possible en 1989 la survenue de l’hyperinflation, provoquée in fine par une intense spéculation sur le change et un run sur les réserves.
B50|Entrepreneurs and wage-earners: a monetary approach|The purpose of the paper is to offer a logical genesis of the differenciation of agents in two classes: capitalist entrepreneurs and wage-earners. The model presented here does not follow the Classical (or Marxian) tradition (where the two opposed classes are the straight consequence of the concentration of the means of production in the hands of a limited fraction of people).

B50|Evolutionary Political Economy in Crisis Mode|This paper sets out to discuss recent economic developments from a twofold perspective. Both spotlights focus on the special role played by the current deep global crisis. The first line of argument centers on the history of economic ideas and shows how evolutionary economics has emerged as a promising alternative to mainstream neoclassical thought as well as to traditional Keynesian macroeconomics. The failure of standard macroeconomics to inform economic policy in the current situation shows that arguments of evolutionary political economists - from Malthus via Schumpeter to contemporary scholars - can and should substitute these inadequate models. The second part of the paper takes the argument for evolutionary political economy to a methodological level: The deep crisis of economic theory is necessarily also a crisis of the methodological apparatus used. Though evolutionary economics does not provide a welldefined alternative set of methods yet, it nevertheless seems to be the best foundation to build such a new combination, a methodological innovation, out of some of the most recent advances in formalization. These latter elements are briefly sketched.
B50|Income Distribution and Economic Growth in a Multi-Sectoral Kaleckian Model|This study builds an income distribution and growth model within a simple multi-sectoral Kaleckian framework. The model has heterogeneous features in each sector in that the responses of saving and investment to changes in macroeconomic performance differ sectorally, and there are also different sectoral shares of saving and investment. We consider the determinants that establish the economic growth regime (i.e. wage-led and profit-led) and the stable output growth rate adjustment within this framework. By doing so, we reveal the sectoral composition of saving and investment and that elasticity of saving and investment matter for the formation of a growth regime and the stability of the output growth rate at the aggregate level.
B50|The Rational Expectations Hypothesis: An Assessment from Popper's Philosophy|"The rational expectations hypothesis (REH) is the standard approach to expectations formation in macroeconomics. We discuss its compatibility with two strands of Karl Popper's philosophy: his theory of knowledge and learning, and his ""rationality principle"" (RP). First, we show that the REH is utterly incompatible with the former. Second, we argue that the REH can nevertheless be interpreted as a heuristic device that facilitates economic modeling and, consequently, it may be justified along the same lines as Popper's RP. We then argue that, our position as to the resolution of this paradox notwithstanding, Popper's philosophy provides a metatheoretical framework with which we can evaluate the REH. Within this framework, the REH can be viewed as a heuristic device or strategy that fulfils the same function as, for instance, the optimizing assumption. However, we believe that the REH imparts a serious methodological bias, since, by implying that macroeconomic instability is caused exclusively by ""exogenous"" shocks that randomly hit the economy, it precludes the analysis of any sources of inherent instability caused by the making of (nonrandom) errors by individuals, and hence it favors the creation of an institutional configuration that may be ill suited to address this type of instability."
B50|Technology, structural change and BOP-constrained growth: a structuralist toolbox|Latin American structuralism (LAS) is a significant part of the heterodox tradition in the theory of long-term growth, with a focus on the problems of developing economies that started their industrialisation process when other regions had already accumulated substantial technological capabilities. The emergence of a centre–periphery system posed specific problems to growth and distribution in laggard economies, which LAS discusses in a systematic way. In this paper we present a model that, first, captures key insights of the LAS school, such as the persistency of technological asymmetries and structural heterogeneity; second, it can be used to analyse the impacts of shocks and policies based on how they affect the supply-side and demand-side parameters of the model; third, it links more closely (post-)Keynesian macroeconomics based on the BOP constraint with the evolutionary microeconomics concerned with the dynamics of learning; last, it can be used as a toolbox and a teachable model in the analysis of interactions between structural change, technological catching up and long-term growth.
B50|From resilient regions to bioregions: An exploration of green post-Keynesianism|This paper develops an answer to the question of what constitutes a resilient region (Bristow, 2010) by arguing that the resilient region can be seen as a prototype bioregion. The transition from a proto-bioregion to a bioregion, and thus from proto-bioregionalism to bioregionalism proper, is examined. The paper begins with a review of the existing literature on regional resilience. The authors then explore the possible heterodox theoretical underpinnings of this approach, drawing on post-Keynesian, Marxian and green economy concepts. The paper’s final section extends the theory to a bioregional conclusion, and discusses the policy approaches that might be applied to extend a resilient region into a bioregion.
B50|Consistency in pluralism and microfoundations|John King has made challenging contributions to our thinking in many areas. This paper focuses on two of these: the case for pluralism and the case against requiring macroeconomic theory to be expressed in terms of its microfoundations. The purpose of this paper is to explore further the relationship between the two, requiring discussion of the relationship between the different levels of philosophy, methodology, theory and reality. A particular focus is put on the role of the concept of consistency in these two papers. This concept is explored further here at different levels and according to different methodological approaches. The contrast is drawn between its meaning in classical logic and in human logic.
B50|A Post-Keynesian Response to Piketty's ‘Fundamental Contradiction of Capitalism’| In Capital in the Twenty-First Century, Thomas Piketty presents a rich set of data that deals with income and wealth distribution, output-wealth dynamics and rates of return. He also proposes some ‘laws of capitalism’. At the core of his argument lies the ‘fundamental inequality of capitalism’, an empirical regularity stating that the rate of return on wealth is greater than the growth rate of the economy. This simple construct allows him to conclude that increasing wealth (and income) inequality is an inevitable outcome of capitalism. While we share some of his conclusions, we will highlight some shortcomings of his approach based on a Cambridge post-Keynesian growth-and-distribution model. The paper makes four points. First, r > g is not necessarily associated with increasing inequality in functional distribution. Second, Piketty succumbs to a fallacy of composition when he claims that a necessary condition for r > g is that capitalists save a large share of their capital income. Third, post-Keynesians can learn from Piketty's insights about personal income distribution and incorporate them into their models. Fourth, we reiterate the post-Keynesian argument that a well-behaved aggregate production function does not exist and cannot explain income distribution.
B50|Economy as the value streams. Preliminary study|Economy can be generally described as a bunch of value streams. At least a part of capital accumulation is assumed to be the consequence of value stream blockage, and a means too keep such blockage. Negative relation between capital accumulation and foreign trade balance coming out from this assumption is supported by the data from national accounts, and hence justify the idea of economy as the value streams. A lot of research ideas are following this assertion, most of them promising results useful for socio-economic policies, and for optimizing institutions and business practices in order to make them more conductive to capital flows.
B50|Schumpeter and Goodwin|This paper discusses the works of Joseph Schumpeter and Richard Goodwin using the common perspective that both were theoretical mavericks of mainstream economic theory development in the 20th century. In particular the fact that their activities overlapped during their cooperation at Harvard University is explored. Their contributions are interpreted as entrepreneurial activity in the domain of theory building - with some spillovers to economic policy intervention. It is argued that maverick theoretical activity is indispensable for progress in evolutionary political economy.
B50|Social Identity and Class Consciousness|The current economic crisis proves how deep the contradictions inherent in contemporary capitalism really are. At the same time it is evident that the financial crisis goes hand in hand with a social crisis, since an increasing number of people lost trust in governments, trade unions and other representative institutions. A main reason why the European Left nevertheless faces severe challenges in attracting supporters seems to be an experienced loss of what has been called ‘working class identity’ in earlier times. This development has been fuelled by the continuing debate on “identity constructions” as proposed e.g. by post-modernist scholars referring to “fluid” and ambiguous concepts of identity and strictly denying any social categorization. So there is a gap between the loss of working class identity on one hand and the focus on merely social identities on the other hand. To bridge this gap the two trajectories have to be linked. Thus, it is proposed to reflect the whole discussion on “working class identity” in the light of exploitation referring to classical political economy, but additionally to integrate social identity constructions by reviving the concept of alienation.

B50|Κρίση, Σύγχρονος Καπιταλισμός Και Ταξικές Ανακατατάξεις<BR>[Economic Crisis, Modern Capitalism and Class Realliances]|The economic crisis that inflicted Greece is international in character and its cause is in the decreasing profitability of capital which from a certain point onwards leads to the stagnation of profits, discourages new investment, reduces production and increases unemployment. If these are combined with the large public debt and the austerity economic policies that were pursued before and after the advent of the Troika, we may explain the vehemence with which the crisis affected the Greek economy. The crisis may also lead to new class realliances and furthermore show the direction and the requirements for the contemplation of an alternative economic policy.
B50|Will the Financial Crisis Become a Milestone in the Development of Methodology of Economics?|It has been widely accepted that philosophers of science wrote a “swansong” for positivism during the second half of the 20th century. Milton Friedman and Paul Samuelson, major contributors in the fi eld of economic methodology at the time, the argument goes, never refl ected the demise. Therefore, positivist roots are still to be found in infl uential theoretical concepts developed by mainstream economists. Specifi cally, I present the hypothesis of rational expectations and the theory of effi cient markets as two signifi cant outcomes of a “high tide” of positivist thinking in economics. However, quite a large number of scholars currently share the view that the two concepts contributed in a non-negligible manner to the development leading to the fi nancial crisis culminating in 2008 and 2009 and should be replaced by behavioural or other approaches. The article thus asks, in quite a novel way, if the crisis - seen by many as an empirical rejection of both the concepts - can also be seen as a milestone in the development of methodology of economics.
B50|A search for distinctive features of demand-led growth models|This paper aims at a critical and constructive assessment of some extensions of Keynes's analysis of effective demand to the long period and growth. A criticism is addressed to a single-cause interpretation of the demand-led growth models and to the notion of normal capacity utilization adopted in such models. A positive argument tries to find a distinctive characterization of those extensions in the productive and financial conditions that make effective the autonomous changes in aggregate demand. It suggests a notion of normal capacity utilization as a range of distributions of normal utilization, related to the cost minimizing choice of techniques and to the persistence of the long term expectations of normal prices underlying the investment decisions. In such a context a long-period analysis with normal prices should avoid a dual steady growth where constant relative prices of capital goods correspond to constant proportions among the stocks of fixed capital.
B50|Financialization and Desire. A Veblenian Perspective|This article examines the recent process of financialization from the perspective of Veblen’s work on emulation, conspicuous consumption and desire. The rise of a particular sector, the financial, to a position of hegemony is a consequence of the capture and perversion of subject’s desire. This domination of symbolic value and libidinal investment over material or life value is a cause of instability and is a key contributor to the dynamics of crisis. The article will first develop a theoretical framework influenced by the work of Veblen before using it to analyse the financialization of the economy. The article will conclude with a brief discussion of potential solutions to the capture desire which focus around extricating desire from the social totality and directly it towards one’s peers in the commons.
B50|Capacity Utilization, Obsolete Machines and Effective Demand|This paper is concerned with certain conditions under which an autonomous intended change in demand becomes effective. A simple model describes an economy, which initially is assumed in a steady state characterized by a given conventional wage rate, a uniform rate of profit and the existence of obsolete machines which are still used and receive quasi-rents, although not produced anymore. Small changes in effective demand, allowed by variable capacity utilization of fixed capital at given prices, are distinguished from large changes which affect the relative prices of commodities and the distribution of income. In both cases the steady state and the adjustment process towards a new steady state are compatible with unemployment; but large effective changes in demand require a higher flexibility of capacity utilization, compared with small changes. This occurs through a deviation of prices and income distribution from their normal values and a change in quasi rents, which make profitable a change in the types and the amounts of the obsolete machines in use. The distinction stressed in the paper is preliminary to the further distinction between impulse-wise and persistent changes in the rates of growth of demand, that is left as a research agenda.
B50|Economists as political philosophers : a critique of normative trade theory|Economists are political philosophers. This claim is defended based on an investigation of normative arguments made in economics textbooks. The paper aims to explain, reconstruct and contest the neoclassical vision implicit in mainstream economic trade theory. Analyzing arguments made by international economists from the perspective of political philosophy, I show how the contemporary defence of free markets and trade liberalization is linked to a specific normative ideal of the political and social good.
B50|A “Minsky crisis” in a Stock-Flow Consistent model|This study uses the Stock-Flow Consistent modelling approach to assess the relevance of Minsky’s demonstration of his financial instability hypothesis. We show that this demonstration, based on the assumption of a pro-cyclical leverage ratio, is incompatible with the Kaleckian analysis of profits endorsed by Minsky. Therefore we suggest replacing the assumption of a pro-cyclical leverage ratio with one of a pro-cyclical short-term borrowing, which also appears in Minsky’s work.
B50|Mainstream Macroeconomics in the Light of Popper<BR>[La macroeconomía ortodoxa a la luz de Popper]|Macroeconomics has been dominated over the last four decades by the Rational Expectations Hypothesis (REH) which implies that economies are inherently stable. REH is a key element of the New Neoclassical Synthesis (NNS) macroeconomic model which has also played a dominant role in theory and policy analysis over the last two decades. We analyse REH in light of Popper´s evolutionary theory of knowledge and learning. We claim that the latter provides macroeconomics with an epistemological and ontological foundation that, unlike REH, takes full account of human fallibility and upon which economists can build a more useful macroeconomic theory.
B50|Demand, credit and macroeconomic dynamics. A micro simulation model|Abstract We develop a micro simulation model for the macroeconomic business cycle. Our model is based on three main ideas. First, we want to specify how macroeconomic coordination is achieved without a dominating influence of price mechanisms. Second, we want to incorporate the stock-flow-consistent (SFC) approach that has become popular in post-Keynesian macroeconomics. Existing macroeconomic models often pay no attention to how short-run outcomes (in the form of surpluses or deficits on the account balances of individual agents, or groups of agents) accumulate into long-run debt. The SFC approach models such deficits and surpluses, and their accumulation, explicitly, and imposes a logic in which these long-run balances co-determine the macroeconomic coordination outcome. Third, we want to allow for bankruptcies as a major mechanism in the business cycle. In reality, bankruptcies are a way in which long-run balances get adjusted, but most often the SFC models do not allow bankruptcies as a way in which long-run balances adjust. In our model, bankruptcies arise because agents do not adapt their behavior quickly enough as debt, or assets, accumulate. This is parametrized, so that bankruptcies can disappear in the simulation runs, which enables us to compare the nature of business cycles with and without bankruptcies. Our results show a clear business cycle that is driven by accumulation of financial assets and the effects this has on the real economy. By changing some of the key parameters, we show how the nature of the business cycle changes as a result of changes in the assumed behavior of agents.
B50|The deposit financing gap: another Dutch disease|In the last 2 decades, the Netherlands has experienced an increase in real-estate prices, accompanied by an increase in mortgages and a marked decline in household savings. As a consequence, banks are faced with a large retail funding gap: outstanding mortgage debt is insufficiently matched by retail deposits, whereas other funding possibilities of banks have increasingly been constrained â€“ also due to their large foreign exposures. Traditional macroeconomic models cannot analyse this phenomenon appropriately as they lack a proper model of the financial sector and underestimate the potential for interactions between the monetary and the real sphere. We present a stock-flow consistent approach developed by Godley and Lavoie as a valuable alternative to traditional and New Keynesian macroeconomic models, enabling us to analyse the deposit financing gap for the Netherlands.
B50|Political Economy of Love: Nurturance Gap, Disembedded Economy and Freedom Constraints within Neoliberal Capitalism|This article critically evaluates the forms of love capital being accumulated by people in capitalist economies, through the lens of some of the core general principles of heterodox political economy (HPE). We start by situating love historically in the neoliberal culture and then examine the six main love styles as well as the five critical factors through the process of circular and cumulative causation. We then scrutinise the contradictions of neoliberal capitalism involving the nurturance gap, disembedded economy and freedom constraint which inhibit the generation of holistic love capital. The path dependent nature of love is then linked to relational phases and instabilities, especially involving serial monogamy in the United States. Some of the core principles of HPE provide a vantage point for scrutinising the problems involved in stimulating holistic love capital in the contemporary environment.
B50|Identity, Identity Politics, and Neoliberalism|With the intensification of neoliberalism, it is useful to examine how some individuals might cope with the irrationality of the system. Neoliberalism cloaks the execution of the corporate agenda behind rhetorical manipulation that advocates for limited government. The corollary absence of government involvement on behalf of the citizenry writ large disarms the means of social redress for the individual. Democracy funded and fueled by corporate power thereby disenfranchises the individual, provoking some to search for empo- werment through identity politics. The argument set forth suggests that individ- uals construct, reinforce, or escalate allegiance to identities as a coping me- chanism, some of which manifest in violent identity politics.
B50|Some Thoughts on Power: International Context|This is a polemical essay that enters into broad dialogue with the contemporary literature concerning the dynamic of power. It refers to the ap- propriate material and results from the research of different theories. It propos- es the constitutive position of the power in the international situation. In con- trast to some current theories, we emphasize the importance of the politico- economical approach, denoting that only the methodology based on the logics of political economy can explain the dynamics of power in the international context. The main thread of this essay is that the international constellation is not a neutral environment, but a framework that is deeply determined by the power-relations. The central idea is that these relations should be explicated by the complex relationships between freedom and order. We analyze the interac- tion between the politics and economy as the constitutive feature of the struc- ture of international context. This essay is divided into three sections. First, we are treating the meaning of order in an international context, in respect to the political-economic aspects of late capitalism. The notion of this order has a great importance in the economic reflections. The dynamic of the interconnec- tedness of global capitalism is examined considering the systematic aspects of power. After that we are analyzing different, and selected, aspects of the inter- national sphere including: the spatiality of the world order, that is, the spatial aspects of the international dynamics in the context of globalization, the con- vergence or divergence between the capitalist and territorial logic, the â€œlegal- economic nexusâ€ in international â€œchainâ€ , the processes of the modification of the forms of competition within recent globalization, and the political-economic conflicts in relation to the regime of economic measurement. Starting with these considerations we explain the current debates on â€œdemondializationâ€ , or the combination between neomercantilist and neoliberal policies.
B50|Ökonomische Bildung: Geistige Monokultur oder Befähigung zum eigenständigen Denken?|Der vorliegende Beitrag versucht den Einfluss und die Größenordnung der akademischen Bildung in den Wirtschaftswissenschaften, vor allem der Standardlehrbücher, abzuschätzen und fragt kritisch, auf welchem Bildungsverständnis die moderne Wirtschaftswissenschaft implizit beruht. Unter anderem wird konstatiert, dass in den Lehrbüchern kein aufgeklärtes und (selbst)reflektierendes Bildungsverständnis sichtbar ist, welches die Voraussetzungen des eignen Denkens bewusst vermitteln könnte. Im Anschluss daran werden die Grundzüge einer derartigen Alternative diskutiert und die Frage aufgeworfen, was Multiperspektivität und eine kritische Reflexion der eigenen geschichtlichen Wurzeln in der Lehre bedeuten kann.
B50|Orthodoxer Mainstream und Heterodoxe Alternativen: Eine Analyse der ökonomischen Wissenschaftslandschaft|Die moderne Volkswirtschaftslehre als wissenschaftliche Disziplin ist einerseits durch große Uneinheitlichkeit geprägt, die andererseits selbst in Zeiten der Krise der Theorie anscheinend nicht nachhaltig in ein öffentliches Bewusstsein vordringen konnte. Nach wie vor wird die Ökonomik unterstellt und auf diese Weise werden Unterschiede ökonomischer Denkweisen entweder nivelliert oder für irrelevant erachtet, wenn es um die Erklärung der großen Zusammenhänge geht. Doch neben dem orthodox-neoklassischen Mainstream, der seit langem den institutionalisierten akademischen Forschungs- und Lehrbetrieb dominiert, existieren vielfältige alternative Ansätze. Diese Tatsache an sich könnte der Ökonomik insgesamt den Schein eines monolithischen Theoriengebäudes eigentlich nehmen und stattdessen ihre Pluralität belegen. Als Phänomen ist Ökonomik zwar durchaus im Plural denkbar, aber die Existenzweise von Pluralität ist kümmerlich und bestenfalls durch hegemonialen Diskurs geprägt. Warum es nach wie vor schwierig ist, die Emanzipation vom Streamlining der Wirtschaftswissenschaften konsequent und erfolgreich zu betreiben, wird aus verschiedenen Perspektiven beleuchtet. Jenseits vertrauter Standarderklärungen unterstützen ideengeschichtliche, wissenschaftstheoretische und wissenschaftspolitische Argumente das Plädoyer für eine kritisch-pluralistische Ökonomik als Bestandteil eines funktionierenden modernen Wissenschaftsgebäudes.
B50|Freie Gewerkschaften|Gewerkschaften werden oft von Liberalen und Libertären kritisiert. Dabei sind sie Ausdruck grundlegender Freiheitsrechte, insbesondere der Vereinigungsfreiheit. Auch das Streikrecht ist innerhalb gewisser Grenzen ein legitimes Freiheitsrecht. Eine freie Gesellschaft ist mehr als Marktwirtschaft und diese geht über Kapitalismus im Sinne der Herrschaft des Kapitals bzw. kapitalgeleiteter Unternehmen hinaus.
B50|The Great Schism in the Theory of Public Finance. A Treatise in the Theory of Economic Thought|In 1870 Menger, Jevons and Walras succeeded in explaining prices in a market economy. While most economists welcomed their achievement, economists of the theory of public finance split in a Great Schism. The dissent is on the two Gossen Laws on which the neoclassical revolution relies. Continental Europeans insist in the relevance of choice and therefore adopt both Gossen laws, meaning that of declining marginal utility and that of utility equalization at the margin. The Anglo-Saxons adopt only declining marginal utility because they found that individual choice does not work for public goods. The former became choice individualists, the latter utilitarians. The Schism was revitalized with the Mirrlees Review of 2010/2011, a monumental work by 63 renowned economists over 1880 pages on what a good tax system ought to be. The author argues that without choice, nothing can be said on a good tax system. Therefore the Mirrlees Review is rejected in favour of a choice alternative which is developed in this paper.
B50|A Emergência Social dos Preços|O texto trata de uma questão de fundamento: nele se argumenta que o individualismo metodológico – pressuposto dominante da teoria econômica – mantém uma proposta para a construção de teorias que é logicamente impossível de ser realizada rigorosamente. E que, para não cair em contradição – e para não subsumir completamente a pessoa ao sistema econômico, tombando, assim, no coletivismo metodológico – é preciso pensar dialeticamente. Como esse propósito, mostra que os preços, para serem tratados com rigor lógico, devem ser considerados com base na categoria de emergência. Comprova, nesse sentido, que esse procedimento logico foi adotado implicitamente por Marx em O Capital.
B50|The (Normal) Rate of Capacity Utilization at the Firm Level|This paper examines the endogeneity (or lack thereof) of the rate of capacity utilization in the long run at the firm level. We provide economic justification for the adjustment of the desired rate of utilization toward the actual rate on behalf of a cost-minimizing firm after examining the factors that determine the utilization of resources. The cost-minimizing firm has an incentive to increase the utilization of its capital if the rate of the returns to scale decreases as its production increases. The theory of economies of scale provides justification for this kind of behavior. In this manner, the desired rate of utilization becomes endogenous.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
B50|The ‘desire for money:’ Aristotelian blind spot in the field of economics? A French heterodox point of view|If the field of economics has today become the archetype for determinism in the social sciences, it comes at the price of a form of objectivity founded on the complex process of the reduction and naturalization of a certain type of social relation, a process best described via the real approach or the ‘approach by value.’ A radical critique of this process requires the deconstruction of this dominant approach, characterized by the articulation of neoclassical theory and economic liberalism. It is only once the repression of the desire for money, a repression constitutive of false economic objectivity, has been denounced that the standard model can then be subject to such a critique. This will in turn open the possibility of an economic theory which is radically anti-naturalist.
B50|Subjective preferences and alternative costs|The present paper is an exploration of the economics of subjectivism and opportunity or alternative costs. Most contemporary economists pay lip service to these concepts, but when push comes to shove, all too often they jettison them. We shall illustrate this lapse from basic economics with a challenge that has been perplexing several modern economists: why do people always walk on staircases, but only sometimes on escalators. Landsburg (2002) misunderstood the reason people only sometimes walk on escalators, whereas they always walk on stairs. Garrison (2009) tackled the same problem, with somewhat different results. Both of them, however, are guilty of a failure to use what is perhaps the most fundamental concept in the economist’s toolkit – opportunity cost, known to an immense number of non-economists by the aphorism ‘There’s no such thing as a free lunch.’ This oversight resulted in his (their) failure to explain why people only sometimes walk on escalators, in contradistinction to the fact that they always walk on staircases.
B50|The missing link: From Kautilya’s The Arthashastra to modern economics|The aim of this paper is twofold: first, to provide evidence supporting the thesis that Kautilya was the first political economist; second, to verify that a systematic study of political economy has begun long before the ideas and works of Adam Smith. It was in the works of Kautilya (around 375 B.C.). In order to validate the aims of our study, we look for evidence in his Arthashatra of rational behaviour, self-interest motivation, and market elements of a traditional commercial society. Providing a sound interpretation of Kautilya’s main arguments, we demonstrate that his is no less a systematic study in political economy than Smith’s The Wealth of Nations. Economics is a science that tries to offer policies and practices for creating and enriching a nation’s wealth, and in that sense, the Arthashastra (literal translation being The Science of Wealth) represents the first systematic manual of political economy. The development of economics as a science must take cognition of the economic principles and ideas presented in The Arthashastra so as to reveal the true origins of economic thought and its evolution. It is only by understanding methodological problems in a historical perspective we can understand the modern methodological and conceptual issues.
B50|The relationship between development, investments, insecurity and social conditions in Colombia: a dynamic approach|In this paper, we investigate the relationship between economic development, investments, savings, insecurity and social conditions in Colombian departments. Using a dynamic heterogeneous panel analysis, we study the effects of insecurity and social conditions on economic development through an estimation of panel data cointegration techniques. The models applied in this study suggest a long-term relationship among economic development, investments, savings, social conditions and insecurity. Investments, savings and human development index have a positive and significant coefficient, which indicates that these variables produce incentives for economic development, whereas GINI and homicides have a negative relationship, demonstrating that these variables undermine economic development. All findings are important in the design of strategies and policies that strengthen income distribution equality, a key factor that determines growth and development through adequate government expenditures that encourage savings and investment decisions with the aim to improve welfare and the standard of living.

B50|Instituciones y tecnología como factores clave en los proyectos nacionales del desarrollo: un análisis comparativo de Brasil y México|La ausencia de proyectos nacionales que permitan institucionalizar las capacidades innovadoras endógenas en América Latina ha constituido un impedimento estructural crítico al desarrollo. Se presenta en este artículo un análisis de los temas relacionados con la tecnología y el desarrollo desde una perspectiva heterodoxa. Gran parte de las naciones abandonaron sus esfuerzos incipientes por desarrollar un grado de autonomía tecnológica en contraste con los emprendimientos arrancados durante el periodo de la industrialización dirigida por el Estado. Este artículo hace hincapié en las políticas tecnológicas montadas durante este periodo y las prospectivas actuales. Para anclar el trabajo, presentamos un análisis comparativo entre los casos dimétricos de México y Brasil, enmarcado en las estructuras institucionales generadas por el poder económico y la ideología dominante, siendo los factores determinantes en la formulación de las políticas nacionales de ciencia y tecnología.
B50|A monetary Minsky model of the Great Moderation and the Great Recession|Steve Keen's model of Minsky's Financial Instability Hypothesis (Keen, 1995) displayed qualitative characteristics that matched the real macroeconomic and income-distributional outcomes of the preceding and subsequent fifteen years: a period of economic volatility followed by a period of moderation, leading to a rise of instability once more and a serious economic crisis. This paper extends that model to build a strictly monetary macroeconomic model which can generate the monetary as well as the real phenomena manifested by both The Great Recession and The Great Moderation.
B50|The economicâ€“environment relation: can post-Keynesians, RÃ©gulationists and Polanyians offer insights?|As the environmental debate has intensified, post-Keynesians, RÃ©gulationists and Polanyians remain relatively silent. All treat time as historical, consider economic issues subordinate to politics and have plenty to say about growth, institutions, uncertainty and path-dependent events. These concepts seem pertinent to understanding the economicâ€“environment problematic. This article explores the â€˜environmental potentialâ€™ of these three heterodox economic traditions. We examine the conception of nature underpinning each methodological approach and the ability of their key conceptual tools to explain the economicâ€“environment relation. Methodological pluralism and a project driven by the neoclassical agenda, we posit, seriously weakens the possibility of a post-Keynesian-grounded coherent environmental perspective. On the other hand, the RÃ©gulationists and Polanyians provide cogent analytical frameworks to advance explanations of the economicâ€“environment relation and the contemporary environmental challenge.
B50|Wage-led growth: theory, evidence, policy|The paper provides an overview of the concept of wage-led growth, both as an analytical concept and as an economic policy strategy. At the core of our analysis is the distinction between wage-led and profit-led demand regimes. The Kaleckian tradition in macroeconomics asserts that a higher wage share will have expansionary effects. Bhaduri and Marglin (1990) generalize the model by allowing for classical mechanisms. The paper presents a two-country short run model to clarify the key concepts surrounding a wage-led vs a profit-led demand regime. It distinguishes carefully between partial and total effects and it analyses demand regimes with respect to national as well as international changes in the wage share. We also review the empirical literature. Our reading is that the available evidence indicates that demand in most economies is domestically wage-led. Changes in functional income distribution also have supply-side effects. Available evidence suggests that higher wage growth induces higher productivity growth. Neoliberalism resulted in an increase in inequality and a decline in the wage share, but growth has nowhere been based on the profit-led growth process. Rather neoliberalism has given rise to either debt-led or export-led growth regimes. The paper concludes by outlining a wage-led growth strategy and by discussing its limitations.
B50|Degree of monopoly and class struggle: political aspects of Kalecki's pricing and distribution theory|The aim of this paper is to analyse the concept of class struggle in Michal Kalecki's writings. First, his inclusion of trade unions' strength as one of the determining elements of the degree of monopoly is examined, taking into consideration Abba Lerner's formulation of the latter and its development by Kalecki. Then, the limits of this understanding of class struggle are pointed out from the standpoint of Karl Marx's conceptual distinction between labor and labor-power. Finally, a reinterpretation of Kalecki's â€˜Political aspects of full employmentâ€™ is provided, indicating the broader conception of class struggle implicit in this work and its usefulness to a better understanding of capitalâ€“labor conflicts in contemporary capitalism.
B50|Lose Less Instead of Win More: The Failure of Decoupling and Perspectives for Competition in a Degrowth Economy|This paper aims to provide a comprehensive explanation for the likely failure in the decoupling of economic growth from environmental degradation, and also intends to offer perspectives on the new role of competition in a steady state or a degrowth economy. The analysis is based on five different scenarios, and uses the European Union as an example. It is concluded that we must prepare ourselves for a potential incompatibility between sustainability and economic growth. In this respect one can say that the current EU situation is in some ways already quite close to an economic system without growth, although far from sustainable as yet. Two of the four perspectives developed, regarding the new role of competition in an economy without growth, indicate an increase of direct and indirect competition over resources. The other two perspectives point out that regulatory public intervention as well as financial intervention will increase in order to ensure that - despite the revised role of competition - the poorest are still given a chance to develop (e.g. through basic minimum incomes), even in a degrowth economy.
B50|La sfida del welfare: produzione a rete e comunità di senso|Il welfare che abbiamo ereditato dal novecento, sulla spinta della crescita di produttività garantita dal fordismo, è in crisi non solo per mancanza di risorse, ma anche per una progressiva perdita di qualità, dal punto di vista della customer satisfaction. Per trovare r imedi efficaci, bisogna adottare principi nuovi, adatti al paradigma tecnico e produttivo dei nostri tempi: rivalutare l’intelligenza della domanda, produrre a rete il servizio, ut ilizzare le idee e le capacità delle comunità si senso. Per evitare che le comunità tendano a chiudersi, creando processi di esclusione e di conservatorismo, è assolutamente necessario mantenere un servizio universale di base garantito dallo Stato per tutti. Dobbiamo abituarci a vivere e a lavorare con una doppia cittadinanza, facendo parte sia di una serie di comunità di senso, sia di un sistema pubblico che garantisce diritti essenziali di cittadinanza, anche nel welfare.
B50|Methodological issues in theorising the financial, economic and social system: realistic and systematic abstraction|The global financial and economic crisis, and in particular the perceived failure of economics to predict the crisis, has led to questioning of the methodology of economics. Some have championed the methodological approach of ‘critical realism’ as fostering a more realistic economic theory than that currently predominant. This paper will argue that, whilst critical realism correctly poses the need for realistic abstraction, critical realism fails to deliver because it does not offer any aid towards systematic abstraction (despite proponents’ claims to the contrary). The application of critical realism can readily identify myriad relevant aspects of the crisis (financial, economic, political, social, psychological, local, national, international, short-run, medium-run, long-run and so on). Yet, critical realism precludes any adequate comprehension of how these myriad aspects cohere to constitute the capitalist system as a whole. The paper goes on to argue that critical realism corrupts an approach (appropriately termed ‘system abstraction’) which can genuinely aid the development of economic theory that is both realistic and systematic. This superior approach aids system-wide theory by offering a step-by-step method that begins with an abstract conception of ‘value’ and moves towards a concrete comprehension of the world market.
B50|Industrial Seigniorage, the Other Face of Competition|This paper tries to develop an original view on industrial practices in competitive capitalist economies. In particular, we question the link between prices, competition and the quality of goods and services. We try to show that it is rational for firms to try to reduce the quality and/or the identity of goods and services while still presenting theses goods and services as the same as before, in order to reduce their prices and so to improve their relative position in the competitive struggle and in order to increase their profits. By reducing quality, we mean the practice that consists of mixing inputs at the margin with cheaper ones or with alternative products that give weight. This practice reminds us of the old Seigneurs who used to mix gold with other metals to produce more coins. That’s why we propose to label this practice 'industrial seigniorage'. The article first tries to delineate the widespread existence of this practice among French firms, and then explains the fundamental elements of (Post Keynesian) consumers' behaviour which allow for this practice to exist. We especially insist on the inability of the consumer to evaluate the quality of goods and services, and his inability to distinguish a good which have been modified at the margin. In a third part, we analyze the phenomenon of industrial seigniorage in a kaleckian model. We show the impact on sectoral profit rates and on prices, as well as the global and macroeconomic consequences on growth, distribution and employment.
B50|Desarrollo regional en la economía del conocimiento|Diversos autores, incluido Joseph Stiglitz, hablan de la necesidad de las regiones rezagadas de incorporarse a la economía del conocimiento como salida a sus dificultades. Sin embargo, el término: “economía del conocimiento” es vago en su conceptualización, así que intentaremos ver a qué se refiere y su impacto a nivel de las regiones integrantes de un país. La presente nota es una discusión sobr e enfoques teóricos al respecto/ Various authors, including Joseph Stiglitz, say that underdeveloped regions need to join the knowledge economy in order to overcome their backwardness. Yet, the concept of “knowledge economy” is vague in its conceptualisation, thus we will try to see to what do these authors refer to and its impact on analysis and policy at the subnational regional level. The present document is exclusively a theoretical discussion paper
B50|The Financial and Economic Crisis and the Aberrance of Economics|Positivism-empiricism-falsificationism has become the ‘state-of-the-art’ methodology of economics. In this article it will be argued that this approach (1) suffers from (logical) deficiencies when applied to the science of human action and (2) has helped legitimizing, and putting into practice, policies that have actually contributed greatly to bringing about the latest financial and economic crisis. The ‘Austrian’, or to be more precise: the ‘Misesian’, method (praxeology) will be outlined as the proper methodology in the field of social science.
B50|Wage and Profit-led Growth: The Limits to Neo-Kaleckian Models and a Kaldorian Proposal|We argue that a fundamental difference between Post-Keynesian approaches to economic growth lies in their treatment of investment. Kaleckian-Robinsonian models postulate an investment function dependent on the accelerator and profitability. Some of these models rely on the importance of profitability, captured by the profit share, to make the case for profit-led growth. For their part, Kaldorian models place the emphasis on the accelerator. More important, investment is a derived demand; that is, it is ruled by the adjustment of capacity to exogenous demand, which, in turn, determines the normal level of capacity utilization. In our view, the Kaldorian approach is better equipped to deal with some of the issues relating income distribution to accumulation with effective demand in the long run. We develop a Kaldorian open-economy model to examine the conditions under which an increase in real wages can produce profit or wage-led growth, showing that the limit to a wage-led expansion is a binding external constraint. The role and limitations of wages as a determinant of growth are further examined through spectral techniques and cycle analysis for a subset of developed economies. The evidence indicates that real wages are positively related to growth, investment, and capacity utilization. It also highlights the role of finance in sustaining expansions, suggesting that debt-led growth should not be identified with profit-led growth.
B50|The Role of Behavioral Models in the Ontological Structure of Modern Macroeconomics|Behavioral models are considered in the paper as the link between the description of the institutional structure of the economic system and the formation of macro-aggregates, reflecting the results of its operations. The degree of homogeneity of the private sector’s economic environment and complementary goals of private entities and government regulation are noted as basic characteristics of behavioral models. The author examines the differences in the estimates of these characteristics as one of the most important factors underpinning the architecture of modern macroeconomic models and their practical implications.
B50|Methodological Individualism and Methodological Institutionalism|In the paper the capabilities and limitations of methodological individualism­ as a core principle of mainstream economics are explored. The recent debate dealing­ with methodological individualism in economics is considered. Institutional individualism­ principle is tested. As a challenging view, premises for methodological­ institutionalism are offered and considered as an alternative and complementary precondition of the different vision for economic theory.

O aplicaţie pe cazul ştiinţei economice]|The present study aims, within the mainframe of the Patristic teaching on the link between the acquiring of knowledge by means of scientific reasoning and that by religious belief, to emphasize the epistemological need for and use of the “scientific knowledge assisted by grace” and then to shed light on the even greater epistemological need for and use of “prophetic knowledge”.
B50|Ethics and Capitalism. An Interdisciplinary Interpretation [Etică şi capitalism. O interpretare interdisciplinară]|The paper starts from the argument that, at present, there are two opposite perspective on the relationship between ethics and capitalism, namely: on the one hand, it is the interpretation offered by the neoclassical school of economic thought (mainstream economics) and, on the other hand, it is the interpretation offered by the Austrian School of economic praxeology (libertarian economics).
B50|The UK Research Assessment Exercise and the narrowing of UK economics| The aim of this article is to delineate an empirically grounded, structure-causal going concern recursive model of UK economics that, in the context of the Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) and local department decision making, explains the progressive elimination of heterodox economics, the progressive homogenisation of mainstream economics from 1992 to the present and the continued rise to dominance of a select group of departments, and indicates whether these events will continue under the Research Excellence Framework selectivity exercise in 2014.

B50|Foundations of the economic and social history of the United States: Empirical|I argue that a form of consciousness may be found in American economic history, one which is both mathematically demonstrable and important. In this book I present a model of economic and political growth based upon systematic addition. We begin with a philosophic model of trade (pp. 34-46); aggregate this model over the course of year to state the real Gross National Product of the United States and its relationship to the rate of employment (pp. 47-62); aggregate this model over the course of many years to find the growth of the United States stated as a natural “14-year octave” within real GNP data (pp. 63-91); multiply this octave times two to find the 28-year natural rate of price fluctuation (pp. 92-112); and multiply this octave times four to find the 56-year natural rate of political change (p. 92-112). The final model (pp. 113-136) is the larger “fractal” of the model of trade which begins these essays, in essence demonstrating that the United States “trades” values over a period of time in much the same way the individual citizen trades goods and services for money on a personal basis.
B50|Foundations of the economic and social history of the United States: Metaphysical|"""Oppositional Analysis"" - the name I give to the metaphysics presented in this volume - proposes a number of dichotomies through which one may analyze and understand systematically the structure of every level of reality. Macroeconomic theory, as well as social research, are two excellent stages upon which we may search for clues and insights to the interaction of oppositions. This is so particularly in connection with an analysis of the precepts of the ""Austrian School"" of macroeconomics as presented by Ludwig von Mises in his well-known and highly influential book Human Action. Based upon the circuit given for a musical note (see the Apologia and the Introduction to Volume 2, as well as the more extensive treatment herein) and the ""Circuit of Being"" which will be introduced in this final volume, I propose a model of economics which may correlate with a view of the physical universe of five dimensions as suggested by Theodor Kaluza. I suggest that these dichotomies may underlie the unity created by Kaluza’s work between General Relativity and Maxwell’s equations for electro-magnetism. If this is so, Oppositional Analysis and the economic and social history of the United States may provide a starting point from which we may learn important insights as to the inner workings of these economic and social oppositions as well oppositions of a more physical nature."
B50|Does “Okun’s Law” state a Pi:1 ratio? Toward a harmonic interpretation of why Okun’s Law works|In Albers & Albers (Spring, 2013) we demonstrated that the historic development of U.S. real GNP, 1869-present, may be structured in recurring 14-year periods. A steady-state rate of growth of 3.4969% is thereby calculated, generating an increase in real GNP proportional to the famous “Golden Mean” (1:phi or 1:1.6180) every fourteen years on average. Building on this foundation we show herein that “Okun’s Law,” a 3:1 proportion between percent growth in real GNP and percent decrease in the rate of unemployment, is actually a pi:1 proportion, created through a form of mathematic / harmonic inverse. The resulting model of economics in the United States is thereby aligned with geometric, harmonic and trigonometric analysis, rather than purely statistical methods.
B50|Money, Credit, Capital and the State: On the evolution of money and institutions|This paper combines several important arguments, which have puzzled economic theory for decades, to arrive at a more adequate description of the current global crisis. The main theoretical innovation is to view the long-run economic evolution as a stepwise evolution of money forms. Moreover, as already indicated in the title, this development of money forms is closely linked to the development of social institutions, in particular of state institutions. Capital, the most recent form of money, today has to be understood as an omnipresent algorithm, as a growth imperative implicit in social institutions and internalized models. The task of evolutionary political economy thus will be to provide an adequate theoretical counterpart to mirror these processes. This paper explores how far a careful reconsideration of received economic theory can contribute to this task.
B50|Distribución Funcional De La Renta: Teorías Y Evidencia Empírica<BR>[Functional Distribution of Income: Theories and Empirical Evidence]|En los últimos 40 años se ha podido ver una tendencia casi constante y uniforme en todos los países sobre la caída en el peso de las rentas salariales sobre el total. En este trabajo intento dar un repaso básico a las teorías económicas que intentan explicar la distribución funcional de la renta (aquella que la divide entre sus factores productivos, en general, capital y trabajo), y su repercusión sobre el ciclo económico. In the past 40 years, we have seen an almost constant and uniform fall in the weight of the total wage income in nearly every country. This paper attempts to provide a basic overview of economic theories that try to explain the functional distribution of income (that which is divided among its productive factors, in general, capital and labor), and their impact on the business cycle.
B50|Profits and employment|The volume of profits in an economy is a magnitude, which is out of sight of orthodox macroeconomic textbooks and effectively ignored by neoclassical macroeconomics. In contrast, Kalecki’s approach brings to the forefront the sources of profits and makes possible their further analysis. In a previous paper, the sources of profits and their impacts, as well as the inter-relations among them are examined one by one. The sustainability of the profits’ sources tends to have inevitable limits, which are discussed and elucidated. Given these limits, two phases in the operation of the sources may be distinguished, with a beneficial phase being transformed into a pathological one, as the limits are breached. Consequently, profits may be distinguished according to the source from which they flow, as well as the phase in which they arise. Taking into account both source and phase, a terminology is proposed to highlight the distinctive character of the different kinds of profits. The present paper briefly reviews this analysis and terminology and, based on this, goes on to consider the relationship between profits and employment. The concept of ‘wasted profits’ is first presented and developed. This is followed by an assessment of the alleged opposition between profits and employment. Finally, the employment effects that the different kinds of profits tend to bring forth, are examined and compared to each other on the basis of appropriate elasticities.
B50|Consumption as a Social Process within Social Provisioning and Capitalism: Implications for Heterodox Economics|The article discusses consumption as a social process that is a part of social provisioning and is in an evolutionary interplay with other social processes. The discussion is grounded in, but is not limited to the contributions of Thorstein Veblen. The first section delineates social provisioning as a framework for consumption inquiry. This section emphasizes that social provisioning is a part of collective life process embedded in culture and nature, and that it is comprised by two general sets of activities – those motivated by money and those that are not motivated by making money. The second section delineates features of capitalism as a system, so that it provides a social context for consumption inquiry. The third section formulates a categorization of social processes, one of which is the consumption process. Further, the section delineates the meaning and components of the concepts: social activities, institutions, and habits of life and thought. The fourth section applies these concepts to consumption social process in the specific context of capitalism. The section discusses consumption activities; institutions and systems of provision; and habits of life and thought – illustrating with examples obtained from various disciplines. The section introduces “gated consumption” as an example of a habit of life and thought. It is argued that the formulated analysis transcends the cultural-material dualism. Finally, the article draws implications of the offered analysis, concluding that the category of “consumers” is of little use to heterodox economics.
B50|Learning from the makers of history: Bolshevism, Bolivarianism, and the Legacy of Hugo Chavez|This is a pre-publication version of an article published by the journal ‘America Latina XXI’. It was originally produced as a tribute to Hugo Chavez and a critical reflection on his reception outside Venezuela, on the occasion of his death.
B50|Predictors of Well-Being in High Income, Industrialized Countries and Their Related Effects|Motivated by both: academic research illuminating the diminishing returns nature of the relationship between income and subjective well-being, and the recent development of composite indices as alternatives to GDP, this paper seeks to analyze empirically the relationship between a variety of macro-level indicators and subjective well-being. As there has been a paucity of research on this subject on just high-income countries, the paper looks at only those countries and finds that the effects of GDP do indeed diminish in comparison to low-income countries. Furthermore, the empirical analysis overall supports the thesis that as GDP rises, the values of countries shift from personal survival and economic opportunity towards larger government, less working hours, and more emphasis on trust in institutions and people.
B50|Methodological Misconceptions in the Social Sciences. Rethinking social thought and social processes|Contemporary social teaching suffers from a grave deficiency: it is lacking rules of methodology and procedure suited to social reality that are, in particular, able to reconcile increasing creativity (implying irreversibility) with rationality, which are indispensable for the scientific judgement of theoretical ideas. Unfortunately, this lack is largely ignored, and eminent social scholars have even explicitly and emphatically theorized a rejection of method. This allows rhetorical and literary skills to prevail over the reasons of science, thereby promoting a deceptive instead of constructive pluralism, confusion in the study of contemporary societies and growing ineptitude in their government, what represents a main source of afflictions in the present world. Method is a two-edged sword: it offers powerful assistance in and enhances our capability of understanding and solving the problems of everyday life; but if the chosen method is inappropriate,it can seriously obstruct the advancement of knowledge. Significantly, the best contributions to social knowledge have been ad hoc studies that disregard method and simply apply common sense. But ad hoc studies suffer a lack of coordination, and the neglect of method makes it difficult to evaluate and select findings and results. As a consequence, ad hoc analyses have little chance of stimulating the cumulative growth of knowledge. However, the present study is intended as a contribution that prevents method from becoming a prison for the mind as opposed to a stimulant of creativity and knowledge.
B50|Тадеуш Ковалик – Велики Политекономист<BR>[Tadeusz Kowalik – A great political economist]|Serbian Abstract. У раду се разматра живот и дело Тадеуша Ковалика, једног од најзначајнијих пољских економиста друге половине 20. и почетка 21. века. Рођен у сиромашној породици, рано је прихватио идеје социјалне правде, које је током целог живота комбиновао с научном активношћу. Израстао на традицијама О. Лангеа и М. Калецког, и дубоко проучивши дело Розе Луксембург, Ковалик је међутим био не само велики економист, већ је као доследни левичар учествовао у борбама за реформу хиперцентрализованог и бирократизованог привредног и друштвеног система Пољске. Одмах након извршених политичких промена и почетка тржишних реформи он се дистанцирао од прихваћеног програма реформи (Балцеровићев програм) и постао његов најоштрији критичар, задржавајући изворне левичарске идеје из почетног периода активности Солидарности. Био је непомирљиви противник неолибералне економске теорије, супротстављајући јој захтеве за плурализмом и јавним дебатама о економској политици. С таквим уверењима и несмањеном активношћу деловао је до самог краја живота. English Abstract. The paper shows the life and work of Tadeusz Kowalik, one of the greatest Polish economists of the second half of XX and the beginning of XXI century. Born in the poor family, he early accepted the ideas of socio-democracy, which he combined with scientific activity during his whole life. He grew on traditions of O. Lange and M. Kalecki, and studied profoundly the work of Rosa Luksemburg. He was not only a great economist, but being a principled leftist, he also took part in the struggle to reform the hyper-centralized and bureaucratized economic and social system of Poland. Immediately after the political changes and the beginning of market reforms he distanced from the accepted reforms program (Balcerowicz Program), becoming its sharpest critic. Kowalik adhered to the original leftist ideas from the initial period of the Solidarity activity. He was the irreconcilable opponent of the neoliberal economic theory, arguing in favor of pluralism and public debates on economic policy instead. He kept working by the same principles and with the same intensity until the end of his life.
B50|Transition in Serbia: Foundations, results and perspectives|Paper considers the foundations, results and perspectives of transition process in Serbia. The foundations were the postulates of neoclassical economics, the mainstream in recent economic thought. They determined the goal, the methodology, and the ideological basis of this process, and resulted especially in Washington Consensus. The results of the reforms, based on Consensus, showed, with some exceptions, that Serbia, as the other former socialist countries, realized deep and long-term economic fall, followed by similar processes in other spheras. Contrary to ordinary opinions that transition crisis show as result of inconsistency in reforms taking, the paper argues that this is normally its result. As an analogue is the Morgenthau’s plan for West Germany observed, that has promoted Germany to industrial disarmament, and that would lead to its poverty and its transformation into raw material basis for the developed economies, and to impossibility of survival of the existing number of population. Fortunately for the Germany, Morgenthau’s plan was abandoned and Marshall’s plan was introduced. It leads to industrial renewal of Germany. For the transition countries it is also necessary, considering the practice and basic principles of the Other Canon, which have they, origins as far as from the economic policy of Henry VII, to access re-industrialization in the same way, which is the necessity for renewal of economies, and for overcoming the long-term crisis.
B50|The Euro crisis and contradictions of Neoliberalism in Europe|Neoliberalism has not given rise to a sustained profit-led growth process, but to a finance-dominated accumulation regime in which growth relies either on financial bubbles and rising household debt (‘debt-driven growth’) or on net exports (‘export-driven growth’). The financial crisis that began in the market for derivatives on the US subprime mortgage market has translated into the worst recession since the 1930s. In Europe the crisis has been amplified by an economic policy architecture (the Stability and Growth Pact) that aimed at restricting the role of fiscal policy and insulating monetary policy and central banks from national governments. The crisis has thus led to a sharp economic divergence between core and peripheral countries. Contrary to the situation in the (export-driven) Germanic core of Europe, the crisis is escalating in the (debt-driven) southern countries of Europe. The paper interprets the policy regime as the outcome of national elites’ attempt to use European integration as a means to constrain nation states. The result is a policy regime that has fatally weakened nation states as regards their fiscal and monetary capacities without creating a European state.
B50|Remaking the Connections|The current Robert Boyer-led French Regulation School (FRS) characterizes the contemporary era as a diversity of national capitalisms. Boyerâ€™s new approach displaces the original FRS focus on â€œmodels of development.â€ This article rallies against the current direction and re-engages the FRSâ€™s earlier mid-range Marxist-influenced account of capitalist development. In particular, key concepts of â€œregulationâ€ and â€œmodel of developmentâ€ are reworked in the context of a revised account of the Fordist model of development. These concepts are then adapted to work up an outline of the â€œneoliberal model of development.â€ JEL classification: B50, F59, O57
B50|The Political Economy of Human Capital|In this paper I develop a critique of both standard neoclassical and standard Marxian conceptualizations of human capital that illustrates an important hypothesis of feminist political economy: collective conflicts based on class, gender, and age, as well as other dimensions of collective identity, affect the distribution of the costs of developing human capital.JEL codes: B50; E11; E24
