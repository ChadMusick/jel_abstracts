J58|Why American Older Workers Have Lost Bargaining Power| The bargaining power of workers cannot be measured directly, but it can be inferred from working conditions and institutional factors. This study documents the stagnation in older workers’ wages and the seven reasons older workers have lost bargaining power. Five factors relate to monopsony exposure from eroding retirement income security, union loss, more insecure employment relationships, persistent age discrimination, and geographical immobility. Two additional factors -- older workers' ineligibility for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC); and older workers’ relative propensity to work for smaller firms – also weaken bargaining power. Significant loss of bargaining power of workers over age 55 who are projected to fill 6.4 million of the 11.4 million net new jobs created between 2016 and 2026 could suppress wages and working conditions for all workers.
J58|Labour share developments over the past two decades: The role of public policies|Labour share developments over the past two decades have differed widely across OECD countries, with about half of them experiencing significant declines. This paper analyses the role of public policies in shaping labour share developments across countries. The results suggest that pro-competition product market reforms raise the labour share by reducing producer rents. Labour market reforms that strengthen the bargaining position of workers, such as tightening employment protection or raising minimum wages, may raise wages in the short term but risk triggering the substitution of capital for labour in the medium term. On average, across countries, such reforms are estimated to reduce the labour share. By contrast, promoting the re-employment of workers who lose their jobs through active labour market policies unambiguously raises the labour share.
J58|Going national: Implementing the OECD jobs strategy|This paper provides guidance for developing country-specific policy recommendations from the broad policy principles of the new OECD Jobs Strategy. To this end, it identifies countries’ main policy challenges and develops broad policy packages to address them. It highlights the importance of considering countries' initial conditions – in terms of the state of the business cycle, fiscal and administrative capacity, past reforms, preferences and demography – for tailoring policy recommendations to country specific challenges, capabilities and needs. It also contains a checklist with key questions for each of the broad dimensions of labour market performance that should be considered when developing country-specific recommendations.
J58|Employment Rights Implementation and Industrial Relations Systems: The Case of the Outsourcing Policy in Banking Industry|Outsourcing is sensitive subject in Indonesia, not only from manpower or employment point of views but also from the public policy angle. There were some violations happened at banking industry on outsourcing implementation. One example can be given when bank assigned outsourcing workers for core type of job, instead of supporting job as required by regulations. This is an example where outsourcing workers have limited avenue to seek for assistance to defend their rights for any dispute settlement and resolution. At least at the bipartite level when there is violation against their rights as a worker, including violation of employment rights, they have no representative to defend their employment rights. Generally, outsourcing workers have limited access or no union labor neither at outsourcing service provider as their employer or at their service user where they are currently assigned. However, though there are some “unfortunate” situations faced by outsourcing workers, but there are also situation where there are banks provide compensation and/or benefit and/or opportunities better than the law and decree requirements through outsourcing agencies. Furthermore, outsourcing workers who are placed in some banks have opportunities to enrolled in trainings as part of job requirements. Workers are also well prioritized for banks’ permanent role candidate selection. The outsourcing practice in Indonesia banking industry, specifically on how outsourcing workers received their employment rights including other added value benefits, have become the interest of researchers to have further study and analysis on the rationales. The research focusing on 3 different bank categories who are implementing outsourcing arrangements for their routine operations; 2 state-owned banks, 2 private-owned banks, and 2 foreign banks. The research and analysis should be able to complement previous studies on the outsourcing implementation. The purpose of the research is to have deep understanding on the outsourcing implementation in the banking industry, specifically whether banks have fulfilled obligations as required by the regulations, including outsourcing workers’ rights. Research have resulted with: 1) banking industry outsourcing workers’ rights characteristic have already implemented as required by the relevant labor regulations. 2) As outsourcing user, 3 bank categories have fulfilled the completion of compensation and benefit as required by the Manpower Law number 13 Year 2003, including workers’ employment rights; wages, overtime pay, other forms of other welfare aspects, and type of work performed by outsourcing workers. And 3) Regulator or Government that governing the outsourcing implementation require banks to comply and implement regulations and policies as required.
J58|Estimating Demand for Long-term Care Insurance in Thailand: Evidence from a Discrete Choice Experiment|At present, the Thai public health insurance schemes cover medical care. However, the financial risk associated with long-term care needs is unprotected. The increasing likelihood of Thai elderly living longer and living alone has raised great concern about their quality of life. In the wake of the declining informal support capacity, a public long-term care insurance (LTCI) system has been considered as a potential alternative. Because the public will have to contribute to the LTCI fund, this paper explores whether the Thai people are willing to pay for such a provision. The LTCI demand is estimated based on the stated preference survey data. Our results show that most respondents are willing to pay to insure against their risk associated with long-term care expenditure, but their preferences are very heterogeneous. Gains and losses for different policy scenarios, measured by consumer surplus, are discussed.
J58|Labor Conflict at the Workplace: Do Dismissal Regulations Matter?|Using data on more than 13000 European establishments over the 2009-2013 period, I analyze the relationship between discharge regulation and industrial actions. I introduce a simple theoretical framework allowing for both positive and negative effects of dismissal constraints on the occurrence of labor disputes, and empirically answer the question as whether stricter dismissal laws make EU establishments experience more frequent and intense industrial actions (work-to-rule, strikes and occupation). I find that a change from employment at-will to a regime with very strict dismissal constraints is associated with an increase in the likelihood of observing an industrial action at the establishment-level ranging between 10.5 and 14.8 percentage points, and that this effect reduces to around 6.7 percentage points when only company-specific industrial actions are considered. Discharge constraints effects on industrial actions are then confirmed through a difference-in-differences analysis, by exploiting quasi-experimental variations in national dismissal regulations. My findings show that less strict discharge regulations moderate labor conflicts in EU establishments, by disciplining workers and restraining unions' activism.
J58|Distributional effects of minimum wages: Can unions expect a double dividend? A theoretical exercise from a supply-side view|In this short communication, it is recalled that unions traditionally follow a policy of pushing higher average wages and at the same time propose a compression of the structure of wages and salaries, which follows the theory of some sort of equity. Considering a steep downfall of union density in many, if not all, OECD countries, the actual good condition for minimum wage policy comes as no surprise. Despite the fact that unions do not like the intervention of labor market policy at the cost of tariff autonomy, it can be shown that minimum wages are capable of serving both the above-discussed objectives of unions, but only the average wage rate cannot be increased. In addition, the distribution of wages will decrease, ceteris paribus. However, it is not clear whether minimum wages will be able to increase the overall wage quota in the economy. Here, this fact is theoretically explored in depth.
J58|Minimum Wage Effects on Poverty and Inequality|Minimum wage effect on employment is one of the mostly studied fields in labour economics. Minimum wage is also considered as a redistributive tool but its efficiency is strongly doubted due to potential disemployment effect that may cause. In the present paper, redistributive ability of minimum wage is studied through microsimulation techniques and under several scenarios of employment elasticity. The results indicate that minimum wage can reduce poverty even under the presence of a disemployment effect. Though, this anti-poverty effect is limited as employment elasticity is more negative. Similarly, inequality decreases when minimum wage increases are adopted, but the redistributive effect is weaker when they cause job losses. The above indicate that minimum wage policies should be used with caution and always take into account any possible impact on employment.
J58|Will Robots Automate Your Job Away? Full Employment, Basic Income, and Economic Democracy|Will the internet, robotics and artificial intelligence mean a 'jobless future'? A recent narrative says tomorrow's technology will fundamentally differ from cotton mills, steam engines, or washing machines. Automation will be less like post-WW2 demobilisation for soldiers, and more like the car for horses. Driverless vehicles will oust truckers and taxi drivers. Hyper-intelligent clouds will oust financial advisers, doctors, and journalists. We face more 'natural' or 'technological' unemployment than ever. Government, it is said, must enact a basic income, because so many jobs will vanish. Also, maybe robots should become 'electronic persons', the subjects of rights and duties, so they can be taxed. This narrative is endorsed by prominent tech-billionaires, but it is flawed. Everything depends on social policy. Instead of mass unemployment and a basic income, the law can achieve full employment and fair incomes. This article explains three views of the causes of unemployment: as 'natural', as stemming from irrationality or technology, or as caused by laws that let people restrict the supply of capital to the job market. Only the third view has any credible evidence to support it. After WW2, 42% of UK jobs were redundant (actually, not hypothetically) but social policy maintained full employment, and it can be done again. Unemployment is driven by inequality of wealth and of votes in the economy. Democratic governments should reprogramme the law: for full employment and universal fair incomes. The owners of the robots will not automate your job away, if we defend economic democracy.
J58|The Regional Effects of a National Minimum Wage|We estimate the spatially differential effects of a nationally uniform minimum wage that was introduced in Germany in 2015. To this end, we use a micro data set covering the universe of employed and unemployed individuals in Germany from 2011 to 2016 and a difference‐in‐differences based identification strategy that controls for heterogeneity in pre‐treatment outcome trends. We find that the policy led to spatial wage convergence, in particular in the left tail of the distribution, without reducing relative employment in low‐wage regions within the first two years.
J58|Optimal Income Taxation in Unionized Labor Markets|This paper extends the Diamond (1980) model with labor unions to study optimal income taxation and to analyze whether unions can be desirable for income redistribution. Unions bargain with firms over wages in each sector and firms unilaterally determine employment. Unions raise the efficiency costs of income redistribution, because unemployment benefits and income taxes raise wage demands and thereby generate involuntary unemployment. Optimal unemployment benefits and optimal income taxes are lower in unionized labor markets. We show that unions are socially desirable only if they represent (low-income) workers whose participation is subsidized on a net basis. By creating implicit taxes on work, unions alleviate the labor-market distortions caused by income taxation. Numerical simulations demonstrate that optimal taxes and transfers are much less redistributive in unionized labor markets than in competitive labor markets.
J58|The Shortfall in Formal Employee Participation at the European Workplace|Cross-country data are used to establish perceived shortfalls in employee involvement based on the responses of employee representatives in EU establishments with formal workplace employee representation. The desire for greater involvement is smaller where workplace representation is via works councils than union bodies, a finding that also obtains across country clusters. However, the favorable influence of the works council institution, if not information provision, does not carry over to situations in which management is adjudged uncooperative and untrustworthy. Whether the views of these respondents are representative of the workforce and hypothetically of a workforce currently without representation is also considered.

J58|The European Social Pillar: A Threat to Welfare and Prosperity?|In November 2017, the European Union proclaimed its fourth pillar, The European Pillar of Social Rights., to promote a “truly pan-European” labour market. A large number of specific social rights are endorsed. This paper investigates the potential short- and long-term consequences of the social pillar on the welfare and prosperity of Europe. Moreover, we discuss its potential effects on the legitimacy of the European Union. Our conclusions indicate that rather than to “support and complement” the social and labour market policies of the Member States, the European Union is likely to replace these policies with the “better” goals of the Union in an effort to fully implement the principles established in the social pillar. The principle of subsidiarity in this case promotes centralisations. There are strong reasons to believe that increased centralisation to EU-level in these areas will reduce preference satisfaction, weaken accountability and decrease efficiency and innovation. In the long run the social pillar therefore is likely to be a threat to welfare and prosperity in Europe, and as a consequence, cause damage to the legitimacy of the European Union.
J58|What Do Workers Want? The Shortfall in Employee Participation at the European Workplace|A shortfall in employee voice attendant upon union decline has long been forewarned. Data from the third European Company Survey is used to establish perceived shortfalls in employee involvement based on the responses of employee representatives in establishments where formal workplace employee representation is practiced. Among the main findings is that the desire for greater involvement in decision making is smaller where representation is via a works council-type apparatus rather than through the agency of a union body. Similar, albeit more pronounced marginal effects are associated with information provision, most notably where employee representatives are (a) 'satisfactorily' informed on a variety of establishment issues or (b) are asked to give their opinions/involved in joint decisions in the event of some major human resource decision. The latter results are robust to subsets of the data based on variations in trust between the parties and the perceived quality of the industrial relations climate, where there is an overwhelming desire for more participation in those circumstances in which management is adjudged uncooperative and untrustworthy. On net, it remains the case that a shortfall in employee participation is observed across all types of establishments in the sample and, by extension, it would appear to those without any workplace representation at all.
J58|The ''Good Workplace'': The Role of Joint Consultative Committees, Unions and HR policies in Employee Ratings of Workplaces in Britain|Using new, rich data on a representative sample of British workers, we examine the relationship between joint consultation systems at the workplace and employee satisfaction, accounting for possible interactions with union and management-led high-commitment strategies. We focus on non-union employee representation at the workplace, in the form of joint consultative committees (JCCs), and the potential moderating effects of union representation and high-involvement human resource (HIHR) practices. Our findings suggest a re-evaluation of the role that JCCs play in the subjective well-being of workers even after controlling for unions and HIHR policies. There is no evidence in our estimates of negative interaction effects (i.e., that unions or HIHR negatively influence the functioning of JCCs with respect to employee satisfaction) or full mediation (i.e., that unions or HIHR are substitutes for JCCs when it comes to improving self-reported worker well-being). If anything, there is a significant and positive three-way moderating effect when JCCs are interacted with union representation and high-involvement management. This is the first time -- to the authors' knowledge -- that comprehensive measures of subjective employee well-being have been estimated with respect to the presence of a JCC at the workplace, whilst controlling for workplace institutions that are themselves designed to involve and communicate with workers.
J58|Minimum Wages and the Distribution of Family Incomes|Using the March Current Population Survey data from 1984 to 2013, I provide a comprehensive evaluation of how minimum wage policies influence the distribution of family incomes. I find robust evidence that higher minimum wages shift down the cumulative distribution of family incomes at the bottom, reducing the share of non-elderly individuals with incomes below 50, 75, 100, and 125 percent of the federal poverty threshold. The long run (3 or more years) minimum wage elasticity of the non-elderly poverty rate with respect to the minimum wage ranges between -0.22 and -0.55 across alternative specifications that subsume most of the approaches used in the literature to construct valid counterfactuals. Inverting the policy's effect on the cumulative distribution, I estimate minimum wage elasticities for unconditional quantiles of family incomes. The long run minimum wage elasticities for the 10th and 15th unconditional quantiles of equivalized family incomes range between 0.15 and 0.49 depending on specification. A reduction in public assistance partly offsets these income gains, which are on average 72% as large when using an expanded income definition including tax credits and non-cash transfers.
J58|Structural policies to boost productivity and inclusion in Costa Rica|Owing to past structural reforms, Costa Rica has enjoyed robust GDP growth and productivity levels are gradually converging towards the OECD average. However, large GDP per capita and productivity gaps persist. In addition, not everyone has benefited from this growth. Inequality has increased and labour market conditions are a concern. Costa Rica has a lower share of employed workers in the population than almost all OECD countries, unemployment remains well above its pre-global-financial-crisis level, labour market participation has decreased and the share of informal jobs is high. Recognising these challenges, Costa Rica has accelerated its structural reform momentum recently, with policy reforms underway or planned in several areas that present win-win opportunities to boost both productivity and inclusion. These include efforts to tackle labour market informality, simplify the minimum wage structure, increase competition and reduce regulatory burdens. In addition to further reforms in these priority areas, structural policy improvements are also needed to increase outcomes and reduce inequalities in education and address significant transport infrastructure gaps.
J58|Effect of Motivational Structures on the Formation of Visions of the Y Generation´s Professionals| The aim of the introduction essay is to conceptualise and to make a comparison of the profiles of the motivational stuctures of the members generation Y towards the visions future professional careers, according to the form of the study. The review of relevant litarature combines the theoretical bases from the research of Manpower Group with profiles of the motivational structures, with regard to the concept the Career compass of the generation Y as the dynamic professional career. The models deal with methodology and the specification of the data obtained from the case study in the structured focus groups of the selected members generation Y. The analysis and findings interpret the results of the profiles of the motivational stuctures of the selected members of generation Y at impacts on formation visions during the course of professional careers. The conclusion discusses and confirms the influence and benefit of the profiles motivational structures on the selected members of generation Y, according to the form of study and the differences in their visions of future professional careers.

J58|Mental health and labor relationships: a study with the legal analysts of the Office of the Prosecutor General - Brasil|"Realizing the importance of social welfare and worker health, this article aims to investigate the work relations of the Office of the Prosecutor General (PGR), verifying the possibilities of risk and commitment of the mental health of the professionals and contributing to raise a illness in this field. An exploratory qualitative research was carried out with five judicial analysts, servants of the Office of the Prosecutor General. Data collection was performed through semi-structured interviews and the method of analysis was the Analysis of the Core of Senses (ANS). The method adopted allowed the identification of six categories of analysis, namely: ""what is the centrality of the cabinet""; ""Meeting goals is normal""; ""Suffers from the violations that are very veiled here""; ""I do landscape face"" and ""if it was someone else she'd even say I hate it. But I like"". These categories were listed in explanatory tables, which synthesize their definitions, constituent themes and participants' verbalizations. It was observed a distance between the servers in the context of the general institutional environment, associated with a high degree of cognitive effort of reading and interpretations, that hinders the communication among the workers. The ""subjection"" of the worker was also verified to the productivist and managerial social logic. Concealed in a discourse of pleasure and satisfaction with work, the verbalizations of frustration are mostly directed toward the little acknowledgment given to the efforts made, the workload of the cabinets, and impotence in the face of a work that does not end. As a conclusion, it is verified that the work schedule, associated with the tasks routines and the few spaces for discussion of the conflicts, compromise the health of the professionals and render the environment hostile, requiring a rethinking of activities and social relations that permeate the space of work."

J58|Towards a European Full Employment Policy|Full employment in the European Union member states is a challenge but feasible, also in downswings of the business cycle and during stages of increased robotization. It requires a labor legislation that ensures flexibility and retraining, responsive labor sharing during the business cycle and to individual life cycle needs, government interventions to supply supplemental employment and revamping dual education. The future of work is better ensured with coordinated European full employment labor policies establishing fair work conditions based on long-run business strategies as well as a fair distribution of national income between labor and capital.
J58|Votes at Work in Britain: Shareholder Monopolisation and the 'Single Channel'|Why do shareholders monopolise voting rights in UK companies, and are trade unions the only way to get meaningful workplace representation? In 1967 a Labour Party policy document first coined the phrase that collective bargaining was – and should be – the 'single channel' of representation. Since then, it has been said the labour movement embraced an 'adversarial' rather than a 'constitutional' conception of corporations, neglecting legal rights to worker voice in enterprise governance. This article shows that matters were not so simple. It explains the substantial history of legal rights to vote in British workplaces, and the competition from the rival constitutional conception: employee share schemes. The UK has the oldest corporations – namely universities – which have consistently embedded worker participation rights in law. Britain has among the world's most sophisticated 'second channel' participation rights in pension board governance. Developing with collective bargaining, it had the world's first private corporations with legal participation rights. Although major plans in the 1920s for codetermination in rail and coal fell through, it maintained a 'third channel' of worker representatives on boards during the 20th century in numerous sectors, including ports, gas, post, steel, and buses. At different points every major political party had general proposals for votes at work. The narrative of the 'single channel' of workplace representation, and an 'adversarial' conception of the company contains some truth, but there has never been one size of regulation for all forms of enterprise.
J58|Labor Market Institutions and the Future of Work: Good Jobs for All?|Work and employment around the globe change continuously, but there are potentially more rapid and fundamental transformations ahead as new technologies can have major impact on what jobs will exist in the future, how people will work and how the global division of labor will evolve. This contribution tries to assess the current outlook into the foreseeable future and highlights the importance of labor market institutions that can effectively influence the future of work. The paper in particular addresses the need to reform and update labor market regulation, social protection and active labor market policies as well as the education systems.
J58|Regional Purchasing Groups and Hospital Medicine Prices: Evidence from Group Creations|This paper estimates the impact of group purchasing on medicine prices in French hospitals, taking advantage of the entry of hospitals into regional purchasing groups between 2009 and 2014. I use a new database providing the average annual prices paid for all innovative and costly medicines in public hospitals. Using a fixed effects model that controls for hospitalsâ€™ medicine-specific bargaining abilities and medicine-specific price trends, I find that group purchasing reduces prices of medicines in oligopoly markets, but has no impact on the prices of medicines with no competitors.
J58|Wage Rigidities in Colombia: Measurement, Causes, and Policy Implications|This paper evaluates the extent of wage rigidities in Colombia over a period, 2002-2014, in which the fall in unemployment was relatively slow with respect to sustained economic growth. Following Holden and Wulfsberg (2009), we compute a measure of downward real wage rigidity (DRWR) of 12.09%, four times bigger than their aggregate estimate for the OECD economies. Moreover, in contrast to the evidence for the advanced economies, the determinants of such rigidities show no connection to the wage bargaining system. Amid the absence of effective labor market institutions to make rigidities less prevalent, economic growth appears as the most powerful mechanism to ward them off. Under this light, we provide a stylized description of the wage setting rule in Colombia, compare it with the common one in the advanced economies, and call for a far-reaching reform of the Colombian wage bargaining setup.

J58|Uber vs. Taxi: A Driver’s Eye View|Ride-hailing drivers pay a proportion of their fares to the ride-hailing platform operator, a commission-based compensation model used by many internet-mediated service providers. To Uber drivers, this commission is known as the Uber fee. By contrast, traditional taxi drivers in most US cities make a fixed payment independent of their earnings, usually a weekly or daily medallion lease, but keep every fare dollar net of expenses. We assess these compensation models from a driver’s point of view using an experiment that offered random samples of Boston Uber drivers opportunities to lease a virtual taxi medallion that eliminates the Uber fee. Some drivers were offered a negative fee. Drivers’ labor supply response to our offers reveals a large intertemporal substitution elasticity, on the order of 1.2. At the same time, our virtual lease program was under-subscribed: many drivers who would have benefitted from buying an inexpensive lease chose to opt out. We use these results to compute the average compensation required to make drivers indifferent between ride-hailing and a traditional taxi compensation contract. The results suggest that ride-hailing drivers gain considerably from the opportunity to drive without leasing.
J58|Is Occupational Licensing a Barrier to Interstate Migration?|Occupational licensure, one of the most significant labor market regulations in the United States, may restrict the interstate movement of workers. We analyze the interstate migration of 22 licensed occupations. Using an empirical strategy that controls for unobservable characteristics that drive long-distance moves, we find that the between-state migration rate for individuals in occupations with state-specific licensing exam requirements is 36 percent lower relative to members of other occupations. Members of licensed occupations with national licensing exams show no evidence of limited interstate migration. The size of this effect varies across occupations and appears to be tied to the state specificity of licensing requirements. We also provide evidence that the adoption of reciprocity agreements, which lower re-licensure costs, increases the interstate migration rate of lawyers. Based on our results, we estimate that the rise in occupational licensing can explain part of the documented decline in interstate migration and job transitions in the United States.
J58|Coping with creative destruction: Reducing the costs of firm exit|A policy framework that does not unduly inhibit the creative destruction process is vital to sustaining productivity growth. Yet, a key question is what happens to workers who lose their jobs due to this process and what are the policies that minimise the costs of worker displacement? Accordingly, this paper exploits a retrospective panel of workers in 13 European countries over the period 1986-2008 to explore the factors which shape the re-employment prospects of workers displaced due to firm exit. The results suggest that higher spending on active labour market policies (ALMPs), financed through an offsetting reduction in spending on passive measures, can aid the re-employment prospects of displaced workers. There may also be a case to better tailor ALMPs to workers displaced by firm exit to the extent that the re-employment probabilities of this group of workers are more sensitive to ALMPs than workers that are displaced for other involuntary reasons. The effectiveness of ALMPs is also enhanced by lower entry barriers in product markets and higher public sector efficiency, while reductions in the labour tax wedge can aid the re-employment prospects of displaced workers. Finally, regional mobility emerges as a key channel through which workers who lose their job due to plant closure become re-employed, suggesting that housing market policies may also be relevant. Accompagner la destruction créatrice : Réduire les coûts liés aux fermetures d'entreprises. Un cadre politique qui n’entrave pas indûment le processus de destruction créatrice est indispensable pour soutenir la croissance de la productivité. Cependant, une question cruciale est de savoir ce qu’il advient aux employés qui perdent leur emploi à cause de ce processus, et quelles sont les politiques qui minimisent les coûts des déplacements de main-d'oeuvre. En conséquent ce papier explore, sur la base d’un panel rétrospectif de travailleurs de 13 pays européens sur la période 1986-2008, les facteurs qui déterminent la ré-employabilité des travailleurs ayant perdu leur emploi en raison d’une fermeture d’entreprise. Les résultats suggèrent que des dépenses plus importantes sur les politiques actives du marché du travail (PAMT), financées par une réduction concomitante des dépenses sur les politiques passives, peut améliorer les possibilités de ré-emploi des travailleurs déplacés. Il peut également être bénéfique de mieux cibler les PAMT sur les travailleurs déplacés en raison d’une fermeture d’entreprise, dans la mesure où les probabilités de ré-emploi sont plus sensibles aux PAMT pour ce groupe de travailleurs que pour les travailleurs ayant perdu leur emploi pour d’autres raisons involontaires. L’efficacité des PAMT est également renforcée par la baisse des barrières à l’entrée et par une plus grande efficacité du secteur public, alors que l’allégement du coin fiscal sur le travail peut aider les chances de ré-emploi des travailleurs déplacés. Enfin, la mobilité régionale émerge comme un moyen important par lequel les travailleurs qui perdent leur emploi en raison d’une fermeture d’entreprise peuvent retrouver un emploi, ce qui suggère que les politiques du logement peuvent également être pertinentes.
J58|Problems of young people on the labour market in Podlaskie province in the opinion of employers|"In this article, chosen results of the study regarding the opinions of employers in the Podlaskie province (Poland) on their perception of young people entering the labour market are presented. In particular, efforts have been made to answer the following questions: what are the reasons for not recruiting young people and what are the largest competency gaps that employers notice within this group of employees? The unemployment rate of young people in Poland in the age range 15-29, reached 14.2% in 2015. For comparison, at that time the average for the EU was higher by almost two percentage points, and the decline compared to the year 2013 was lower than in Poland. In all provinces in Poland, the unemployment rate in 2015 was in the double-digits, and the Podlaskie province had the worst indicator of all regions with an unemployment rate of 13.8% among youth. It turns out that higher education in Poland has lost its importance in the process of hiring staff. Employers are increasingly less likely to look at the educational background of candidates, as they focus more on their experience and specific skills. The purpose of this article is to present the chosen results of research regarding the diagnosis of the situation of young people on the labour market in the Podlaskie province from the perspective of employers. In particular competency gaps were identified and other reasons for not recruiting young people. this article includes analyses of desk research and results of quantitative research, which was carried out on a sample of 346 respondents among 16 companies registered in the Podlaskie province. Among the reasons for not employing young people which were most often mentioned by the entrepreneurs from the Podlaskie province in quantitative research were financial reasons. During the interviews, employers indicated the reasons for not employing young people such as ""lack of appropriate qualifications,"" ""specific skills"" or simply ""practical preparation for work."" Employers when asked about the competence gaps of young people pointed out that they have a lack of experience, initiative and entrepreneurship, as well as learning skills."

Diese Verbaende sind prominente Beispiele fuer die neue Unuebersichtlichkeit der Arbeitsbeziehungen. Der Band behandelt in sozialwissenschaftlicher Perspektive die in Wissenschaft und oeffentlichkeit kontrovers diskutierten Fragen der wesentlichen Folgen: Veraendert der Wandel von Berufsverbaenden zu Berufsgewerkschaften und ihre damit verbundene Zielverschiebung nachhaltig die etablierten Strukturen der Interessenvertretung? Fuehrt ihre Tarifpolitik zu einem hoeheren Streikniveau in der traditionell arbeitskampfarmen Bundesrepublik?

J58|Washington Slept Here: How Donald Trump Caught the Politicians Napping on Trade|This paper explores how Donald Trump managed first to secure the Republican Party nomination, and then an upset victory in the general election, by running on an unapologetically protectionist platform. It argues Trump filled a political vacuum by taking positions long rejected by political professionals in both major parties and appealing to a class of potential voters that had been neglected. The analysis starts with a review of the decades-long economic transition in which producers of labor-intensive goods either became more international, thus switching from a protectionist to a pro-trade orientation, or died, thus becoming politically irrelevant. The net result was a reduction in the demand for and use of protectionist measures, and a steep decline in the political salience of trade (as measured in bills dealing with trade issues introduced in Congress, in the prominence of trade on White House agendas, and campaign promises to restrict imports). Trump recognized the large and untapped reservoir of potential votes in the post-industrial underclass that globalization left behind, and succeeded by prosecuting an unorthodox pro-protectionism campaign in which the usual sources of pro-trade campaign finance were rendered irrelevant.
J58|Regional Purchasing Groups and Hospital Medicine Prices: Evidence from Group Creations|This paper estimates the impact of group purchasing on medicine prices in French hospitals, taking advantage of the entry of hospitals into regional purchasing groups between 2009 and 2014. This paper uses a new database providing the average annual prices paid for all innovative and costly medicines in public hospitals. Using a fixed effects model that controls for hospitals' medicine-specific bargaining abilities and medicine-specific price trends, I find that group purchasing reduces prices of medicines in oligopoly markets, but has no impact on the prices of medicines with no competitors.
J58|On the distributional effects of minimum wages: A note|In this note, we recall that unions traditionally pursue a policy of pushing higher average wages and, at the same time, for a compression of the structure of wages and salaries, which is some sort of equity. Given the precipitous fall of union density in many, if not all, OECD countries, the actual good climate for minimum wage policy comes at no surprise. Despite the fact that unions do dislike the intervention of labor market policy to the detriment of tariff autonomy, we can show that minimum wages are capable of serving both of the above-mentioned goals of unions and also help increase the overall wage quota in the economy. Hence, It can be concluded that the unions have a double dividend when inviting policy makers to pursue a policy of minimum wages: both the average wage rate can be increased and the dispersion of wages be lowered, ceteris paribus.
J58|Incentives and evaluation of public managers in Italy|We analyse the current structure and the most recent evolution of the legislation concerning incentives for public managers in Italy. In the light of the main findings of economic theory, we identify the most critical issues inherent to the design of an optimal system of incentives. These are the existence of multi-principle agency problems involving public managers; the difficulty of observing and measuring the output produced in the public sector; the excessive limits to managersï¿½ autonomy imposed by the need to respect the rule of law. Along these three lines, we analyse the reforms of public management that have been adopted in Italy from the nineties and evaluate their effectiveness through an empirical analysis of the premiums paid to public managers in 2012. The empirical analysis reveals a substantial flattening of the premiums paid and highlights that only the age of the manager significantly affects how much they receive. We conclude that the poor effectiveness of the current system of incentives for public managers is mainly due to the undifferentiated application of the same rules to all organizations, to an inadequate planning of the objectives and to the excessive limits to managersï¿½ autonomy.
J58|Beyond the austerity dispute: new priorities for fiscal policy|The workshop aimed at moving forward the fiscal policy debate, which in the crisis years was unavoidably focused on how to regain fiscal credibility and to implement sizable and fast consolidation plans. Four main themes have been proposed for the debate during the workshop. First, the two-way link between fiscal consolidation and inequality, with the idea that consolidation efforts cannot be successful in the long run if they entail a socially unsustainable increase in inequality. Second, the importance of preserving, even in contexts in which the fiscal policy stance is necessarily restrictive, growth-enhancing public investments. Third, the challenges posed to fiscal management by a low inflation context, taking into account that a subdued price dynamics not only makes the real burden of debt heavier, but it also has subtle effects, at least in the short term, on several budgetary items. Finally, the need for a simpler and more appropriate set of rules for the governance of the EMU. The latter topic was also the object of the high-level panel at the end of the workshop. While differences in emphasis emerged among the panellists, they agreed that the current framework could be streamlined, and – more importantly – that no set of rules can work if trust and a sense of sharing a common objective is not rebuilt among the Member States.
J58|Entry Threats and Inefficiency in ‘Efficient Bargaining’|We examine whether the outcome of bargaining over wage and employment between an incumbent firm and a union remains efficient under entry threat. The workers\' reservation wage is not known to the entrant, and entry is profitable only against the high reservation wage. The entrant observes the pre-entry price, but not necessarily the wage agreements. When wage is not observed, contracts feature over-employment. Under separating equilibrium the low type is over-employed, and under pooling equilibrium the high type is over-employed. But when wage is observed, pooling equilibrium may not always exist, and separating equilibrium does not involve any inefficiency.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J58|What’s happening to our universities?| In recent decades, many universities have been moving in the direction of a more hierarchical and centralised structure, with top-down planning and reduced local autonomy for departments. Yet, the management literature over this period has stressed the numerous benefits of flatter organisational structures, decentralisation and local autonomy for sections or departments. What might explain this paradox? And why have academics remained strangely quiet about this, meekly accepting their fate? This proposition paper critically examines the dangers of centralised top-down management, increasingly bureaucratic procedures, teaching to a prescribed formula, and research driven by assessment and performance targets, illustrating these with a number of specific examples. It discusses a number of possible forces driving these worrying developments, and concludes by asking whether academics may be in danger of suffering the fate of the boiled frog.
J58|Adaptation and Influence: The Schumpeterian Perspective on Business-Politics Relations|This paper introduces Schumpeter’s views on the relationship between business and politics and argues that we can discern a distinct Schumpeterian perspective of business-politics relations. Schumpeter’s views about the pivotal role of entrepreneurs in economic development attracted substantial interest in economic sociology and in political economy. His views about the role of entrepreneurs in politics have so far however hardly been studied. The paper identifies the following four aspects as central to Schumpeter’s perspective of business-politics relations: (a) entrepreneurs and corporations drive economic change, (b) entrepreneurs and corporations are ineffective in defending their political interests and vulnerable to hostile movements, (c) the resulting divergence of the economic and the political impact of entrepreneurs and corporations makes capitalism socio-politically instable, and (d) the relationship of entrepreneurs and corporations to political institutions and public policies is primarily adaptive, rather than causative. The paper proposes a two-dimensional typology of business-politics relations that combines the Schumpeterian focus on adaptation with the Marxian focus on influence. These two dimensions - adaptation and influence - result in four ideal types: business-dominated social compromise, imposed social compromise, business dominance, and political confrontation. Examples from German welfare state history illustrate these four types. The paper suggests that the Schumpeterian and the Marxian perspective, while in contrast to each other, may be complementary and each perspective valid under different socio-political conditions.
J58|The Long-Run Effects of Teacher Collective Bargaining|We analyze how exposure to teacher collective bargaining affects long-run outcomes for students, exploiting the timing of state duty-to-bargain law passage in a cross-cohort difference-in-difference framework. Among men, exposure to a duty-to-bargain law in the first 10 years after passage depresses annual earnings by $2,134 (3.93 percent), decreases weekly hours worked by 0.42, and reduces employment and labor force participation. The earnings estimate implies that current duty-to-bargain laws reduce earnings by $213.8 billion annually. Effects grow with time since law passage, are largest among nonwhites, and are not evident for women. Duty-to-bargain laws reduce male noncognitive skills, supporting the labor market findings.
J58|No Extension Without Representation? Evidence from a Natural Experiment in Collective Bargaining|In many countries, notably across Europe, collective bargaining coverage is enhanced by government-issued extensions that widen the reach of collective agreements beyond their signatory parties to all firms and workers in the same sector. This paper analyses the causal impact of such extensions on employment using a natural experiment in Portugal: the immediate suspension by the government that took office in 21 June 2011 of the (until then) nearly automatic extensions. The combination of this suspension and the time needed for processing the extension applications resulted in a sharp and unanticipated decline in the extension probability of agreements signed several months earlier, around 1 March 2011. Our results, based on a regression discontinuity design and matched employer-employee-agreement panel data, suggest that extensions had a negative impact on employment growth. Moreover, the effects tend to be concentrated amongst non-affiliated firms. The lack of representativeness of employer associations is a potentially important factor behind the adverse effect of extensions. Another is the role of retro-activity in combination with the administrative delay in processing extensions. This is particularly relevant in the context of a recession.
J58|La influencia de la iglesia y la prensa en el movimiento obrero de Popayán: 1900- 1950|En 1900 Popayán había perdido el empuje que la había caracterizado como centro económico del occidente del país el siglo anterior, esta desaceleración económica vino acompañada de otras particularidades como su afinidad con el partido conservador y la iglesia, lo cual ayudó a configurar un movimiento obrero especial, de poco alcance y visibilidad nacional, y muy ligado a corrientes políticas. El objetivo del presente texto es determinar la conexión de la iglesia y la prensa en la configuración del movimiento obrero en Popayán. El periodo de análisis es la primera mitad del siglo XX, no sólo por acotar el tema, sino también porque es un periodo pionero en cuestión sindical.
J58|Inside and outside: The modernized hierarchy that runs China|Describes the process through which China has rebuilt and strengthened its bureaucracy since 1978 without moving toward rule of law. Internally, the bureaucracy has become more rule-governed, and new procedures have been introduced, including regular rules for promotion, credentialing, and turnover, including term limits. However, external accountability is absent. The huge difference between “inside” and “outside” may be a unique feature of the Chinese system.
J58|Fallimento e rinascita della valutazione delle performance nella prospettiva del valore pubblico: l’orizzonte della riforma madia|La valutazione nella Pubblica Amministrazione è fin qui fallita. Le cause del fallimento, testimoniato da 25 anni di tentativi legislativi senza successo, sono rintracciabili nei contenuti della valutazione oppure nell’assenza o nell’inadeguatezza dei presupposti abilitanti o dei requisiti di funzionamento? L’articolo si sofferma sulle numerose evidenze empiriche che dimostrano che le cause attengono tutte e tre le tipologie indagate. Quali sono oggi, all’inizio dell’ennesima stagione di riforma, le condizioni abilitanti, gli elementi costitutivi e i caratteri qualificanti della valutazione che dovrebbero essere cont enuti nelle norme attuative della Riforma Madia? Partendo da tale quesito di ricerca, il lavoro ripercorre gli errori legislativi degli ultimi 25 anni sul tema della valutazione ed analizza la Riforma della PA, del Ministro Madia, per comprenderne limiti e potenzialità.
J58|Collective bargaining systems and macroeconomic and microeconomic flexibility: the quest for appropriate institutional forms in advanced economies|Abstract This paper addresses the design of the machinery of collective bargaining from the perspective of microeconomic and macroeconomic flexibility. In the former context, somewhat greater attention is given over to enterprise flexibility than external adjustment. In the latter context, close attention is also paid to changes in collective bargaining along the dimensions of bargaining coverage, structure, and coordination. Support is adduced for the German, contemporary Scandinavian, and British models. The role of trust in securing micro and macro flexibility also receives attention, suggesting that the polder or Dutch model might also be expected to populate the firmament of fit-for-purpose collective bargaining arrangements.

J58|Public-private wage duality during the Greek crisis|During the recent crisis, Greece experienced a severe contraction and rapid transformation in its labour relations and pay-setting system in both the private and public sectors. Although the quantity (employment) adjustments that followed have been well documented, the changes that were triggered in the wage structures of the two sectors remain largely unexplored. In this article we examine these changes using Greek Labour Force Survey micro-data. We find a differential adjustment across sectors in terms of magnitude, timing, and structure. Despite general perceptions, adjustment in public sector wages has been slow and limited, with pre-crisis premia persisting throughout the period. Instead, the private sector recorded substantial adjustment, changing noticeably its valuation of worker and job characteristics and emerging from the crisis with a structure of returns that rewards more intensively marketable skills. This may be an important feature in the prospective recovery of the Greek economy.
J58|Von Konflikt ohne Partnerschaft zu Partnerschaft ohne Konflikt: Industrielle Beziehungen in Deutschland (From conflict without partnership to partnership without conflict: Industrial relations in Germany)|Der Aufsatz betrachtet das Lebenswerk von Walther Mueller-Jentsch als wichtigsten deutschen Forscher der letzten Jahrzehnte ueber kollektive Arbeitsbeziehungen und das „deutsche Modell“ der Sozialpartnerschaft. Im Mittelpunkt steht das von Mueller-Jentsch entwickelte Konzept der „Konfliktpartnerschaft“ als Beschreibung des derzeitigen Stands der industriellen Beziehungen in Deutschland vor dem Hintergrund ihrer Geschichte seit Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts. (The essay considers the lifetime achievement of Walther Mueller-Jentsch as a scholar and leading figure of the discipline of industrial relations in Germany during the last decades. The essay focuses on Mueller-Jentsch’s concept of Konfliktpartnerschaft (conflictual partnership), conceived to characterise the current state of industrial relations under the “German model”, against the background of their history since the beginning of the twentieth century.)
J58|Die neue Konfliktformation. Klassen-Kaempfe in fragmentierten Arbeitsbeziehungen (The new conflict formation: Class conflicts in the age of fragmented labour relations)|Der Beitrag setzt sich mit Walther Mueller-Jentschs Soziologie industrieller Beziehungen auseinander. Er argumentiert, dass die Transformation des einstigen Sozialkapitalismus zwei Welten sozialer Regulation hervorgebracht hat, deren ‘Grenzregime’ zunehmend umkaempft ist. Es handelt sich, so die These, um Klassen- Auseinandersetzungen in fragmentierten Arbeitsbeziehungen. Bewegungen, die von der einen in die andere Regulationswelt fuehren, lassen sich, wie auch Wolfgang Streeck feststellt, mit dem Konzept der Konfliktpartnerschaft nicht mehr angemessen verstehen. Deshalb gehoert auf den Pruefstand, was in der Soziologie industrieller Beziehungen lange als gesichertes Wissen galt. (The paper discusses Walther Mueller-Jentsch’s sociology of industrial relations. He contends that the transformation of erstwhile social capitalism has produced two distinct worlds of regulation, the ‘border regime’ of which is increasingly contested. It argues that what we are witnessing are class conflicts in the context of fragmented labour relations. As Wolfgang Streeck also notes, the movements that stretch from one world of regulation to the other can no longer be adequately grasped by the concept of ‘conflict partnership’. We must therefore reconsider some of the ideas that have long been taken for granted in the sociology of industrial relations.)
J58|Berufs- und Spartengewerkschaften. Zur Kritik des Tarifeinheitsgesetzes (Professional unions. A critique of the Collective Agreement Unity Act)|Seit den fruehen 2000er Jahren wandeln sich einige Berufsverbaende zu Berufsgewerkschaften und etablieren sich als unabhaengige Tarifpartner im Verkehrs- und Gesundheitssektor. Der Beitrag behandelt zunaechst ihre wesentlichen gemeinsamen Merkmale. Im Mittelpunkt steht das 2015 in Kraft getretene Tarifeinheitsgesetz, welches das abgeschaffte Prinzip der Tarifeinheit wieder einfuehrt („ein Betrieb, eine Gewerkschaft“). Unsere umfassende Kritik argumentiert nicht, wie es ueblicherweise der Fall ist, aus juristischer Sicht, sondern aus der Perspektive der Arbeitsbeziehungen. Sie erfolgt auf drei Ebenen: Probleme der Praktikabilitaet der Verfahren, der breitere Kontext der Gewerkschaftsentwicklung, befuerchtete, aber unrealistische Konsequenzen fuer das System der Arbeitsbeziehungen. (Since the early 2000s some professional associations have changed into professional unions and have established themselves as independent bargaining partners in the transport and health sectors. The paper begins by presenting the most important common characteristics of such professional unions. It focuses on the Collective Agreement Unity Act which came into force in 2015 and re-establishes the abolished principle of bargaining unity (‘one company, one union’). Our comprehensive critique does not take the usual legal perspective but rather an industrial relations one. It is based on three levels: Practical problems of the applicability of procedural rules, the broader context of trade union development, feared but unrealistic consequences for the system of employment relations.)
J58|Konflikt ohne Partnerschaft? Arbeitsbeziehungen im Dienstleistungssektor (Conflicts without any kind of partnership? Industrial relations in the service sector)|Der Beitrag setzt sich mit der These von Wolfgang Streeck auseinander, nach der das Konzept der Konfliktpartnerschaft von Mueller-Jentsch an Erklaerungskraft verloren hat. Mit Blick auf den privaten Dienstleistungssektor wird hier argumentiert, dass der empirischen Diagnose von Streeck in weiten Teilen zuzustimmen ist. Mittelfristig ist mit der Herausbildung einer stabilen Konfliktpartnerschaft in diesem Bereich der Arbeitsbeziehungen nicht zu rechnen. Vielmehr gewinnen staatsnahe Akteure an Bedeutung. Das Konzept von Mueller-Jentsch bleibt aber relevant als analytischer Bezugsrahmen und begriffliche Heuristik, um Wandlungsprozesse zu untersuchen. (This contribution reflects on Wolfgang Streeck’s argument that the concept of ‘conflict partnership” developed by Walther Mueller-Jentsch has lost its descriptive and explanatory power today. With regards to the private service sector, I agree with Streeck that we won’t witness the evolution of a stable conflict partnership in the service sector for the next decades ahead. But this does not mean that the theoretical concept of ‘conflict partnership” is no longer relevant. It is still useful as a heuristic and analytical tool to analyse processes of transformation in the industrial relations system.)

Sie greift deren Hinweise auf die Fragmentierung der deutschen industriellen Beziehungen in zwei bzw. drei Regulierungswelten auf und argumentiert, dass unbeschadet dessen die Konfliktpartnerschaft immer noch als das praegende Modell fuer die deutschen industriellen Beziehungen anzusehen sei, wenn auch fuer einen – im Vergleich zu frueheren Dekaden – eingeschraenkteren Bereich. (The following reply starts with a detailed definition of the concept of conflict partnership and addresses the main criticisms of the contributors about the controversy of this concept in former issues. It takes up their suggestions concerning the fragmentation of German industrial relations into two or three worlds of regulation. Finally, it argues that conflict partnership remains the constitutive model for German industrial relations, albeit for a more limited field compared to earlier decades.)
J58|What Drives Employment in OECD Countries?|The main aim of the study is a statistical analysis of the impact of labour market institiutions on employment rates in OECD countries. The relationships between employment rates (by age, skill level) and main labour market institutions including minimum wages, employment protection legislation, tax wedges, replacement rates, type of contracts and the degree of unionization are examined. Additionally, other key macroeconomic variables were taken into account The equations describing above mentioned relationships are estimated using GLS method assuming heteroscedastic and autocorrelated error term. Sample includes most of OECD (over 20) countries in 1990-2014 due to data avaibility and comparability of analysed institutions.The main conclusion of the analysis is a statistically significant impact of labour market institutions on the overall employment rates in OECD countries. However, the impact is not obvious if detailed study concerning disaggregated employment rates is conducted. In many cases we cannot accept hypotheses that labour market regulations affect the employment rates.
J58|Drivers and effects of labour market reforms: Evidence from a novel policy compendium|Abstract The paper analyses the determinants and short-term effects of labour market reforms, using information from a novel policy compendium that covers 110 developed and developing economies between 2008 and 2014. We find that the approval of reforms is positively associated with the unemployment rate, the simultaneous implementation of fiscal consolidation measures and the presence of a fixed exchange rate regime. Differences in the results are explored by looking at the direction of reforms (i.e. increasing or decreasing legislation), temporal horizon (i.e. temporary or permanent measures) and coverage (i.e. complete or two-tier reforms); while also analysing separately reforms’ determinants across domains of labour legislation (e.g. permanent contracts, collective dismissals). Finally, we find that deregulatory labour market reforms tend to increase the unemployment rate in the short run when they are approved during contractionary periods—while they have a non-significant effect when approved during periods of economic stability or expansion.

J58|Strengthening Enforcement in Unemployment Insurance: A Natural Experiment|Enforcing the compliance with job search obligations is a core task of conditional benefit systems like unemployment insurance (UI) or welfare. For targeted policy design, it is key to understand how the enforcement regime affects job search outcomes. This paper provides first estimates that separately identify the effects of increasing enforcement strictness in UI. As a natural experiment, we exploit a reform which induced a sharp and unanticipated increase in the probability of being sanctioned after the failure to document job search effort. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that the probability of job finding within six months increases by 6 percentage points in response to the policy change. This effect comes at the cost of lower job stability. As a consequence, early job finders experience losses in total earnings driven by fewer months in employment within the considered post-unemployment period. We use these estimates to quantify the elasticities to changes in enforcement strictness, trading off the short-run gains (job finding) against the mid-run costs (job quality).
J58|Labor Market Flexibility and FDI Flows: Evidence from Oil-Rich GCC and Middle Income Countries|In this paper we empirically examine the impact of labor market flexibility on FDI flows to oil-rich GCC and compare it to middle income countries in 2006-2011. We account for potential endogeneity and nonstationarity and adopt system GMM and IV estimation methodologies. Our findings show that in middle income countries overall flexibility increases FDI flows under both system GMM and IV methodologies. In GCC countries overall LMF decreases FDI flows under system GMM methodology. Results also show a positive “GCC region” influence outweighing the negative flexibility influence. Growth potential and infrastructure development matter for both GCC and middle income countries.
J58|How Should India Reforms Its Labour Laws?|We examine the current policy debate around the reform of labour laws in India, which has been stimulated in part by the success of the Gujarat model of economic development. Gujarat's deregulatory reforms have included changes to the legal regime governing employment terminations, which could form a basis for a change in national-level labour laws. Evidence linking labour law deregulation to growth, however, is weak, whether the focus is on India or the experience of other countries. Building labour market institutions is a long-term process which requires investment in state capacity for the management of risks associated with the transition to a formal economy.
J58|Job Quality in Segmented Labor Markets: The Israeli Case|Till the early-1990s the collectively-bargained labor contract (between the trade-union that presented the employees, and the employer or the employers'-association) was the norm, granting salaried workers a stable and protected labor contract. Thereafter, and more significantly after 1995, the share of unionized workers dropped constantly, to almost half of its peak level (of more than 80 percent). In parallel, two other types of contracts became more common: personal temporary contracts (between an individual worker and his employer), and contracts between a labor-contractor and employees who are employed in a triangular mode of employment (employee-contractor-client). The latter involves precarious employment and is more common among the more vulnerable sub-populations of new-immigrants, disabled individuals, Israeli-Arabs, foreign-workers and women. The contractual changes resulted in work instability, growth of the secondary labor market and segmentation. Efforts to protect the disadvantaged secondary labor-market workers include legislation, reforms, new regulations, and enforcement of all the above.
J58|Spatial mismatch through local public employment agencies: Answers from a French quasi-experiment|Using the unanticipated creation of a new agency in the French region of Lyon as a quasinatural experiment, we question whether distance to local public employment agencies (LPEAs) is a new channel for spatial mismatch. Contrary to past evidence based on aggregated data and consistent with the spatial mismatch literature, we find no evidence of a worker/agency spatial mismatch, which supports a resizing of the French LPEA network. However, echoing the literature on the institutional determinants of the local public employment agencies’ efficiency, we do find detrimental institutional transitory effects.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J58|The impact of teachers’ unions on educational outcomes: What we know and what we need to learn|In this paper we consider more than three decades of research on teachers' unions in the United States. We focus on unions' role as potential rent-seekers in the K-12 educational landscape, and specifically how teachers' unions impact district and student outcomes. We review important methodological improvements in the identification of union impacts and the measurement of contract restrictiveness that characterize a number of recent studies. We generally find that the preponderance of empirical evidence suggests that teacher unionization and union strength are associated with increases in district expenditures and teacher salaries, particularly salaries for experienced teachers. The evidence for union-related differences in student outcomes is mixed, but suggestive of insignificant or modestly negative union effects. Taken together, these patterns are consistent with a rent-seeking hypothesis. We conclude by discussing other important union activities, most notably in the political arena, and by noting that recent changes in state laws pertaining to teachers and teacher unions may provide context for new directions in scholarship.
J58|School Of Autocracy: Pensions And Labour Reforms Of The First Putin Administration|The early 2000s marked a surge in uncertainty in Russian politics caused by the succession crisis and the profound political turnover it triggered. This uncertainty could resolve in a number of ways, each leading to a different political development. We trace the actual way out of this uncertainty and suggest that the major factor to condition the further regime trajectory was the way reforms were conducted. The article questions the teleological approach that sees government as knowingly and purposefully building autocracy, and contributes to the tradition emphasizing the plurality of possible regime developments (Golosov 2011) and the role of contingency therein (Hale 2004) by providing a more systematic treatment of such contingency. We use insights from basic coordination game theory and cognitive institutionalism to show how local reform practices become accepted as a trusted way of interaction by political actors and stick with the regime in a path dependent manner. This intuition is substantiated with a case-study of pensions and labour reforms. Course of these reforms determined the major features of the Putin regime, such as building up a single party of power, crowding out the political market, opposition decay, and informal institutionalisation
J58|Do We Have to Be Afraid of the Future World of Work?|There is considerable concern regarding the prospective development of employment levels and job types in the future. The paper tries to highlight major trends shaping the world of work in developed economies with the aim of giving a realistic account of probable developments and the contributions of different driving forces, importantly focusing on the role of actors such as policy makers, firms and individuals. While it is true that the future of work poses considerable challenges to actors at different levels, there is no need to be particularly worried.

J58|General statutory minimum wage debate in Germany: Degrees of political intervention in collective bargaining autonomy|This article traces the pattern of conflict, collaboration, and compromise among trade unions, employers, political parties, executive branches, and economic research institutes in Germany, all of which have different stances regarding the introduction of a general statutory minimum wage there. This article examines the degree of political intervention in collective bargaining autonomy. First, it identifies the factors that bring about differences in stance. Second, it addresses the issue of actor independence—in particular, that of service trade unions—despite the placing of institutional factors, to establish a reference standard for the debate behind forming social movement alliances. Third, it examines the manner in which the policy’s economic legitimacy is earned. We conclude that the emergence of a statutory minimum wage in Germany reflects the dynamic mix of postwar political practices in its own context with the effects of modern neoliberal economic policies.
J58|Consolidated (Central) Public Procurement As Effective Tool For The County Management For Rationalization Of Costs Of Regional Units|Public procurement (PP) is a very important segment of the economy of each country, including the Republic of Croatia, especially if you take into account the fact that its value on an annual basis is between 10 and 15% of GDP, respectively 30 and 45 billion Croatian kuna. Legal requirements for implementation of the procedure of unified or central procurement is given in Article 8 of the Public Procurement Act, which stipulates that entities may purchase goods, works and / or services from or through a central body for public procurement. Th is includes the establishment of an effective system of central procurement accountable to taxpayers and to all economic operators involved and publicly-cost environment in order to achieve savings in public spending, taking into account the optimal relation between quality and price of the purchased goods, works and services, taking into consideration ecological and socially acceptable solutions, sustainable (“green”) public procurement and encouraging small and medium enterprises. Using the positive effects, with the awareness of the shortcomings and possible abuses (corruption), the county management, using the financial management and unified organization (central) Public Procurement (CPP) has a significant potential for reductions of cost, significant expense savings and increased efficiency of regional governments.

J58|Revisiting the Effects of Enhanced Flexibility on the Italian Labour Market|In this paper, we assess the effects of the Italian labour market reforms which began in 2001 and which led to widespread deployment of temporary work contracts. Using a hitherto unexploited administrative dataset of work histories for the period 2003-2010, we estimate transition probabilities in the states of non-employment and employment and find a small positive effect on job creation, imputed to the reforms. Estimates also indicate a large increase in transitions to temporary contracts, which offset the reduction in permanent employment flows, although transition probabilities for men and women explain little heterogeneity. While we do find a substitution effect of the reforms on the transition between temporary and permanent contracts, the increased probability of being employed in temporary jobs mostly involved young people and workers in the depressed areas of the south of Italy.
J58|Effective Labor Relations Laws and Social Welfare|Effective labor relations laws determine the allocation of bargaining power between the parties involved in labor disputes, and hence, influence social welfare. The right to strike, the types of legal strikes, and the right to hire replacement workers are fundamental components of labor relations laws in the public sector. Strikes by public school teachers, which are common in real-world settings, involve particularly high social costs. We theoretically study the social welfare effects of labor relations laws that permit the effective use of replacement teachers in case of strikes. These laws refer to the explicit right to hire replacement teachers and to the prohibition of intermittent strikes. We present a sequential bargaining game of incomplete information. Our model explicitly includes a law component, which captures the impact of effective labor relations laws. We conduct social welfare analysis and demonstrate that these laws reduce bargaining impasse and increase social welfare.

Both theoretical and experimental law and economics, which represent the cornerstones of the application of the scientific method, enhance our understanding of the effects of litigation institutions and tort reform on settlement and deterrence. This chapter evaluates the interaction between theoretical and experimental law and economics in the study of tort litigation institutions. Special attention is devoted to liability, litigation and tort reform institutions, and behavioral factors that might affect an impasse. The analysis suggests a productive interaction between theoretical and experimental law and economics. In particular, findings from experimental economics work on litigation institutions indicate the presence and robustness of cognitive biases, and provide evidence of the effects of litigants’ biased beliefs on the likelihood of impasse.
J58|"MINIMUM WAGE AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN ROMANIA: AN INSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE (International Conference ""Recent Advances in Economic and Social Research"", 13-14 mai 2015, București)"|The institutional economics perspective is less present in the field of minimum wage law’s implications, despite the fact that labor market is one of the most regulated markets in every economy. At its beginnings, the minimum wage legislation has been subject of intense controversies between the institutionalist and neoclassical economists, but the mainstream point of view has gained ground. Still, in the last decade the institutional economics perspective has made some progress in this area, its contributions being limited to justifying the necessity of the minimum wage legislation based on some arguments borrowed from the old institutionalists, especially from John Commons. This paper is focused on the minimum wage law’s implications on the business environment in Romania. The institutional hypothesis that guides the entire reasoning in this paper is: any entrepreneurial endeavor means, basically, that the entrepreneurs act in an existing institutional frame. The formal regulations, such as minimum wage legislation, affect entrepreneurial behavior by creating and altering transaction costs. The aim of this paper is to offer an explanation to the evasive entrepreneurship in Romania using the concept of transaction costs related to the institutional rigidities created by the minimum wage legislation.
J58|Social policy and social programming: key implications concerning development of active labor market policies and employment|Development of a functioning labor market is an issue of special consideration in recent years of extensive attempts to make proper assessments of the effectiveness of implemented and implementing social programs and taking decisions for future specifically targeted actions putting ambitious goals in the field of social and sustainable development. The global changes in views on labor force and labor market especially considering establishment of proper social policies are connected to the development of the concept of social programming as a social phenomenon and as a part of the broader understandings of the terms of program and programming reflecting on the alterations in the points of view on employment, unemployment and human resources. Examining theoretical background in that relation, current study provides new insights into the processes of development of a functioning labor market through active policies established and implemented on the basis of the notions of social programming and social technology as progressive tools distinguished by systematic approaches in organization and management, as well as by transparency and effectiveness.
J58|Under-provision of private training by MENA firms: what to Do about It?|This paper shows that firms in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) provide training to their workers less frequently than firms in other regions and yet seem to be more in need of it. Utilizing firm level data from the Enterprise Surveys for over 100 countries, it attempts to explain that paradox and also identify alternative policy actions that MENA countries might use to substantially increase firm-supplied training by MENA firms. In particular, it points to the potential usefulness of reforms of labor regulations in MENA countries to be less rigid, but also coupling this with stronger enforcement so as to encourage existing firms to be more formal and new firms to enter, grow in size and adopt characteristics more favorable to training over time.

J58|A decade of labour market reforms in the EU: insights from the LABREF database|This paper analyses the main features and determinants of labour market reforms in the EU over the period of 2000–2011 using the European Commission LABREF database. The data suggests that the timing, focus, and geographical distribution of reforms reflect the interplay between economic shocks and existing institutions. The 2008 crisis was followed by increased policy activity in most policy domains in a large number of EU countries, initially to cushion the impact of the crisis on employment and incomes, subsequently to improve the adjustment capacity of labour markets. Regression analysis indicates that reform activism is stronger in countries with lower GDP per capita and long-standing EU membership, under critical economic and labour market conditions, and where political costs are low. The direction of reforms is affected by economic and labour market conditions, available fiscal space, and by initial policy settings.

J58|Spatial Mismatch through Local Public Employment Agencies? Answers from a French Quasi-Experiment|Using the unanticipated creation of a new agency in the French region of Lyon as a quasinatural experiment, we question whether distance to local public employment agencies (LPEAs) is a new channel for spatial mismatch. Contrary to past evidence based on aggregated data and consistent with the spatial mismatch literature, we find no evidence of a worker/agency spatial mismatch, which supports a resizing of the French LPEA network. However, echoing the literature on the institutional determinants of the local public employment agencies’ efficiency, we do find detrimental institutional transitory effects.
J58|Guild-Ridden Labor Markets: The Curious Case of Occupational Licensing|In his third Upjohn Press book on occupational licensing, Morris M. Kleiner examines why the institution of occupational licensing has had such a curious evolution and influence in the United States, the European Union, and China. He also discusses the many similarities it has to guilds.
J58|Did PLAs on LA Affordable Housing Projects Raise Construction Costs?|The cost of building nine affordable housing projects in Los Angeles under the terms of a project labor agreement between the years 2008 and 2012 are compared to 121 affordable housing projects developed and built in the same time period and same area without project labor agreement requirements. We use three approaches to compare costs: 1) simple comparison of average square foot cost and average per unit cost, 2) a visual inspection of the cost data by increasing size of projects measured by square foot size and housing unit size, and 3) “nearest neighbor” analysis comparing the nine PLAs each to the four nearest comparisons along the dimensions of size, units, stories and targeted population. We break our sample down into a subsample for the City of Los Angeles excluding within-county but outside-the-city projects and into a subsample for prevailing wage projects only. Our conclusions are the same using all three statistical approaches to comparing costs and using all three samples: the nine PLA affordable housing projects were not more expensive to build than comparable projects not governed by project labor agreements.
J58|When Labor Disputes Bring Cities to a Standstill: The Impact of Public Transit Strikes on Traffic, Accidents, Air Pollution, and Health|Many governments have banned strikes in public transportation. Whether this can be justified depends on whether strikes endanger public safety or health. We use time-series and cross-sectional variation in powerful registry data to quantify the effects of public transit strikes on urban populations in Germany. Due to higher traffic volumes and longer travel times, total car hours operated increase by 11 to 13 percent during strikes. This effect is accompanied by a 14 percent increase in vehicle crashes, a 20 percent increase in accident-related injuries, a 14 percent increase in particle pollution, and an 11 percent increase in hospital admissions for respiratory diseases among young children.
J58|Job Quality in Segmented Labor Markets: The Israeli Case|Till the early-1990s the collectively-bargained labor contract (between the trade-union that presented the employees, and the employer or the employers'-association) was the norm, granting salaried workers a stable and protected labor contract. Thereafter, and more significantly after 1995, the share of unionized workers dropped constantly, to almost half of its peak level (of more than 80 percent). In parallel, two other types of contracts became more common: personal temporary contracts (between an individual worker and his employer), and contracts between a labor-contractor and employees who are employed in a triangular mode of employment (employee-contractor-client). The latter involves precarious employment and is more common among the more vulnerable sub-populations of new-immigrants, disabled individuals, Israeli-Arabs, foreign-workers and women. The contractual changes resulted in work instability, growth of the secondary labor market and segmentation. Efforts to protect the disadvantaged secondary labor-market workers include legislation, reforms, new regulations, and enforcement of all the above.
J58|The emergence of new entrepreneurs in Europe|This work tries to shed some light on the decision of becoming self-employed with and without employees, distinguishing between paid-employment and unemployment as starting status and exploring if the exposure to foreign competition also influences this decision. In doing so, we apply binary and multinomial logit models to data drawn from the European Community Household Panel for the EU-15 (ECHP, 1994–2001). Thus, we provide some evidence supporting the existence of different factors affecting each considered transition in terms of intensity of the causal relationship. Finally our study also suggests the existence of a negative relationship between the degree of openness and the probability of become entrepreneur, across the EU-15 countries, as some theoretical models suggest.
J58|State Union Membership, 2013|On January 24, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released its estimates for union membership in the United States in 2013. This issue brief focuses on the union membership numbers by gender, education, race, and private vs public sector.
J58|Union Advantage for Black Workers|In this report, we review the most recent data available to examine the impact of unionization on the wages and benefits paid to black workers. These data show that even after controlling for factors such as age and education level, unionization has a significant positive impact on black workers' wages and benefits. The union advantage is particularly strong for black workers with lower levels of formal education.
J58|Regulation of Public Sector Collective Bargaining in the States|While the unionization of most private-sector workers is governed by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), the legal scope of collective bargaining for state and local public-sector workers is the domain of states and, where states allow it, local authorities. This hodge-podge of state-and-local legal frameworks is complicated enough, but recent efforts in Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, and other states have left the legal rights of public-sector workers even less transparent. In this report, we review the legal rights and limitations on public-sector bargaining in the 50 states and the District of Columbia, as of January 2014. Given the legal complexities, we focus on three sets of workers who make up almost half of all unionized public-sector workers: teachers, police, and firefighters, with some observations, where possible, on other state-and-local workers. For each group of workers, we examine whether public-sector workers have the right to bargain collectively; whether that right includes the ability to bargain over wages; and whether public-sector workers have the right to strike.
J58|Women, Working Families, and Unions|One of every nine women in the United States (11.8 percent in 2013) is represented by a union at her place of work. The annual number of hours of paid work performed by women has increased dramatically over the last four decades. In 1979, the typical woman was on the job 925 hours per year; by 2012, the typical woman did 1,664 hours of paid work per year. Meanwhile, women's share of unpaid care work and housework has remained high. Various time-use studies conclude that women continue to do about two-thirds of unpaid child-care (and elder-care) work and at least 60 percent of routine housework. The research reviewed here suggests that unions can provide substantial support to women trying to balance their paid work and their unpaid care responsibilities.
J58|Barriers to Freedom of Contract in the Public Sector|Currently twenty-four states have “right–to-work” laws, which primarily restrict the rights of workers and employers in the private sector from entering into certain kinds of labor contracts. Federal labor law mandates that unions represent all workers at a workplace, whether they are dues-paying members of the union or not. Meanwhile, state “right-to-work” laws prohibit workers and employers from signing contracts that require all covered workers to contribute to the costs of representation regardless of whether or not the workers choose to join the union.
J58|La crisi, il diritto del lavoro e le relazioni sindacali: una panoramica con tante ombre e poche luci|"L’A. ricostruisce il quadro degli interventi normativi che si sono succeduti negli ultimi anni sia nella legislazione del lavoro sia nel sistema delle relazioni sindacali. Per quanto riguarda la legislazione del lavoro, il quadro che emerge mette in evidenza la crescente interferenza delle istituzioni europee sulle regole nazionali, che produce un effetto di appiattimento ""a senso unico"" e una uniformità degli assi portanti degli interventi in tutti i Paesi sottoposti a vigilanza. Inoltre, l’Italia appare alle prese con una vera e propria frenesia riformatrice, che non è riuscita, almeno finora, ad aggredire i punti nodali della crisi di sistema e ha finito per congestionare alcuni istituti. Il giudizio negativa trova temperamento guardando a cosa accade nel campo delle relazioni industriali, in cui le parti sociali hanno deciso di intervenire nella difficile questione della rappresentanza e dell’efficacia soggettiva della contrattazione collettiva di livello nazionale e aziendale. La ripresa di intervento delle parti sociali riuscirà, però, ad attenuare solo in parte le difficoltà incontrate nella realtà."
J58|The Swedish industrial relations transformation during the 1970s – abolishing neutrality and affecting the deep structure|Industrial Relations systems are essentially a nexus of contracts between different actors: Government, employer’s organizations and unions first and foremost. The Swedish labour market model was based on the concept of Government neutrality ie: non-partisanship and non-intervention from the early 20th century. Did the interventionist state during the 1970s change the fundamentals of the Swedish model? I argue that it did. The argument is based on an empirical investigation that comes from the concept “Frontier of Control”. If we take five dimensions: Occupational safety, Determination in work-place issues, Employment and dismissals, Strikes and industrial conflicts and lastly Determination in company issues, the power relations changed fundamentally in the 1970s with the labour law legislation and was ultimately part of a paradigmatic change in Swedish IR.

J58|The consequences of trade union power erosion|The micro- and macroeconomic effects of the declining power of trade unions have been hotly debated by economists and policymakers. Nevertheless, the empirical evidence shows that the impact of the decline on economic aggregates and firm performance is not an overwhelming cause for concern. However, the association of declining union power with rising earnings inequality and a loss of direct communication between workers and firms is potentially more worrisome. This in turn raises the questions of how supportive contemporary unionism is of wage solidarity, and whether the depiction of the nonunion workplace as an authoritarian “bleak house” is more caricature than reality.
J58|Gross Earning Inequalities in OECD Countries and Major Non-member Economies: Determinants and Future Scenarios|Income and earning inequality has been on the rise in most of the OECD and in many emerging economies since the 1980s. This paper estimates a model of earnings inequality across OECD countries that incorporates determinants of relative demand and supply of more and less-skilled labour. Drawing on OECD data we find that skill-biased technological change – measured as a common cross-country time trend and the level of multi factor productivity – has been the key driver in increasing earning differentials. The analysis also shows that educational attainment has mitigated the impact of skill-biased technological change on earning differentials, but has in most countries been unable to fully compensate. In line with previous OECD analysis, changes in structural policies and labour market institutions, such as deregulation of product and labour markets have exerted upward pressure on inequality. The estimated model is used to decompose historical changes in earning differentials and to construct forward looking scenarios up to 2060. If the common cross-country trend of skill-biased technological change observed during the last 25 years prevails, earning differentials will on average increase by almost 30% in the OECD by 2060. Finally, the model is used to simulate the consequences of alternative policy scenarios over the coming 50 years. Inégalités de revenus dans les pays de l'OCDE et les grandes économies non membres : Facteurs déterminants et scénarios futurs Les inégalités de revenus se creusent dans la plupart des pays de l’OCDE et nombre d’économies émergentes depuis les années 1980. Dans ce document, on évalue un modèle des inégalités de revenu intégrant les déterminants de l’offre et de la demande relatives de main d’oeuvre plus qualifiée et moins qualifiée. En analysant la base des données de l’OCDE, on observe que le changement technologique– mesuré comme un effet temporel commun à tous les pays – et le niveau de productivité multifactorielle ont été les principaux moteurs du creusement des écarts de rémunération. L’analyse montre également que le niveau de formation a atténué l’effet du changement technologique sur les écarts de revenus, mais que dans de nombreux pays, il n’a pas suffi à le compenser. Comme l’indiquent de précédentes analyses de l’OCDE, les évolutions des politiques structurelles et des institutions du marché du travail (déréglementation des marchés des produits et du travail notamment) ont exercé une pression à la hausse sur l’inégalité. Le modèle évalué est employé pour décomposer les évolutions historiques des écarts de revenus et pour élaborer des scénarios prospectifs à l’horizon 2060. Si le changement technologique valorisant les compétences observé au cours des 25 dernières années persiste, les écarts de revenus se creuseront de près de 30 % en moyenne d’ici à 2060 dans l’OCDE. Le modèle est par ailleurs utilisé pour simuler les conséquences de scénarios différents dans les 50 prochaines années.
J58|Use of performance information in Italian municipalities: some empirical evidences|Recent history in public administration has been characterized by the introduction of performance measurement and evaluation systems, so that some authors talk of Performance State. Instruments of Performance Management and their related applicability to the public administration context have been object of many studies, in particular quantitative ones. By means of a qualitative survey, this study is aimed to analyse some Italian municipalities and verify if and with what goals the internal actors do really utilize performance information in decision-making processes. The final aim is to detect key factors which have influenced the use (or the non-use) of performance information and to draw lessons learned from the analysed experiences.
J58|Los contratos de cesión de tierra en Extremadura en el primer tercio del siglo XX|Using the exceptional archives of the jurados mixtos de la propiedad from the judicial district of Caceres, this article shows the importance of the changes to tenancy contracts in Spain during the 1930s. First, the decree led to a huge volume of documentation on demands between landowners and tenants for rent reduction. Second, the source shows the legal complexity of some contracts, and the occasional difficulties that this created for determining which tenant should benefit from the decree. Third, one of the most interesting dimensions of the source is the widespread use of subletting, often by groups of local workers signing collective contracts. Finally, we use the information provided by the jurados mixtos to shed more light on the censo de campesinos [peasant census], and in particular on the figure of the yuntero [landless peasants].
J58|Wage subsidies and youth employment in South Africa: Evidence from a randomised control trial|• Youth unemployment in South Africa is high, differs substantially by race group and is increasing. In 2012, close to two-thirds of young Africans were broadly unemployed. Over the four years prior to this the unemployment rate had increased by almost ten percentage points. • A wage subsidy is one type of intervention which aims to reduce youth unemployment by providing a subsidy to firms which covers part of the cost of employing young people. The outline of a youth employment incentive was provided by the National Treasury in 2011. • Evidence from other countries suggests that the success of a wage subsidy can be context specific and depends on the nature of the intervention and the structure of the labour market amongst other things. Thus, in order to understand how a wage subsidy may affect youth unemployment it is useful to know how South African young people and firms may react to a wage subsidy. A randomised control trial (RCT) is one way to investigate this. • In an RCT the participants in the study are randomly divided into two groups – one which received the intervention, in this case a voucher for a wage subsidy which a firm who employs the individual could claim for six months (called the treatment group), and the second group which does not receive anything (called the control group). Since allocation to the groups is random and both groups share similar characteristics, any observed changes on average should be the result of the wage subsidy voucher. We can thus attach a causal interpretation to our results. • The key finding of the paper is that those who were allocated a wage subsidy voucher were more likely to be in wage employment both one year and two years after allocation. The impact of the voucher thus persisted even after it was no longer valid. The magnitude of these effects was relatively large – those in the voucher group were 7.4 percentage points (approximately 25 percent) more likely to be in wage employment one year after allocation and of similar magnitude two years later. This impact was not driven by changes in the sample composition. • This suggests that those young people who entered jobs earlier than they would have because of the voucher were more likely to stay in jobs. This confirms the important dynamic impacts of youth employment. It also suggests that government interventions which successfully create youth employment are important and can virtuous longer-term effects. • Relatively few firms actually claimed the voucher. Interviews with firms and young people suggest that this was for a number of reasons: the young people did not even get a chance to show the voucher to someone who makes hiring decision; the administrative burden associated with claiming the money, although not onerous, could not be overcome (for example, larger firms did not have a process for accepting subsidy money, human resource functions were centralised and HR had little incentive to engage in the process of claiming the voucher); or managers or firm owners questioned the legitimacy of the voucher. This suggests that a national wage subsidy policy would need to be widely advertised and information and support provided to firms who would like to claim the subsidy. • However, the impact of the voucher among those individuals who were employed in firms who claimed or enquired about the subsidy was much larger than the broader estimated effect. In this paper we are unable to ascertain whether these jobs were new or not. • Even after controlling for firm take up and enquiry there is still a difference in the probability of wage employment between the group with a voucher and the group without. This indicates that part of the impact of the voucher is through supply side responses of those allocated the voucher. • The results indicate that the observed impact of the voucher is not driven by changes in search, increases in search intensity or movement either to look for jobs or to take up employment. • Rather it seems that part of the impact may be driven by people turning down job offers. Those in the control group, especially those in households with other employed members, were more likely to turn down job offers than those in the treatment group. This suggests that there is some queuing in the South African youth labour market as young people who can wait for better paid jobs do. • We can only speculate about why those in the treatment group did not engage in this behaviour. One explanation is that the voucher changed their perceptions of potential success in the job market and thus they were more willing, or able, to go to these jobs, since they thought the voucher advantaged them or they were able to borrow money from their households to travel and incur the initial costs associated with accepting a job. It may also be that households which contained voucher holders were more likely to encourage the holder to take up the job since it was perceived as part of a special programme, or it may be that more information about jobs was passed onto the households of voucher holders with employees since they were linked into firms and people in their network may have known about the voucher. • These results confirm that the structure of the household is important for success in the labour market. Research on South African labour markets shows that networks are the main channel through which information about jobs is transmitted. Households with working members are thus advantaged since members receive more information about jobs. These types of households can also provide intra-household cash transfers to help pay for transport costs or other costs associated with taking up a job. • However, there can also be relatively negative implications for young people in households with other earners – they can afford to turn down jobs as they wait for potentially better paying or better matched jobs. The consequences of this may not necessarily be negative if these types of jobs eventually arrive but if they do not then these young people have sacrificed both earnings and work experience as they wait.
J58|De la Econom�a Popular a la Econom�a Social y Solidaria: el Caso de los Recicladores de Base en Santiago de Chile|Las organizaciones de recicladores de base han sido analizadas en varios contextos como una salida a la informalidad y un ant�doto a la pobreza de los que trabajan en este sector. El an�lisis presentado en este art�culo est� enfocado en dos estudios de caso en el �rea metropolitana de Santiago de Chile, donde se han analizado dos comunas en las que trabajan algunas organizaciones de recicladores. El objetivo del estudio era entender las din�micas organizacionales y el potencial de estas organizaciones para pasar de una situaci�n de informalidad, asociada con la idea de la econom�a popular, a la capacidad de incorporarse como organizaciones m�s estructuradas en el contexto de la econom�a social y solidaria. Los resultados evidencian una serie de ventajas aportadas por las organizaciones de recicladores a nivel social, econ�mico, medioambiental y comunitario, y una serie de desaf�os que todav�a obstaculizan en este contexto el ulterior desarrollo de las organizaciones y el empoderamiento de sus socios.
J58|The Effect of Labour Relations Laws on Union Density Rates: Evidence from Canadian Provinces|We provide evidence on the potential for reforms in labour law to reverse deunionization trends by relating an index of the favorability to unions of Canadian provincial labour relations statutes to changes in provincial union density rates between 1981 and 2012. The results suggest that shifting every province’s 2012 legal regime to the most union-friendly possible could raise the national union density by up to 7 percentage points in the long run. This effect appears driven by regulations related to the certification of new bargaining units, the negotiation of first contracts and the recruitment of replacement workers. The effects of reform are largest for women, particularly university-educated women employed as professionals in public services. Overall, the results suggest a limited potential for labour relations reforms to address growing concerns about labour market inequality.
J58|Labour Market Matters - November 2014|While proponents argue that minimum wage laws are essential in improving social welfare and economic well-being, implementation of minimum wage laws can also be associated with increased unemployment and the movement of workers into the informal sector where worker protection and workplace standards are less likely to be observed compared to the formal sector. A paper entitled â€œEstimating the Effects of Minimum Wage in a Developing Country: a Density Discontinuity Design Approachâ€ (CLSRN Working Paper no.142) by CLSRN affiliate Hugo Jales (University of British Columbia), proposes a novel framework to empirically assess the effect of the minimum wage on unemployment, average wages, sector mobility, wage inequality, the size of the informal sector, and on labour tax revenues. The study finds that while minimum wage policy can increase average wages and reduce wage inequality, the policy has the unintended effect of causing labor tax revenues to fall as a result of workers shifting from the formal to informal sectors. Proponents of unionization assert that unions have beneficial social welfare impacts, such as providing workers with improved wage rates, fringe benefits and working conditions, but other evidence points to the negative effects of unions on corporate profits, investment, and employment growth. More recently, research has examined the potential for spillover effects of unions on the wage outcomes of non-unionized workers. Indeed, examination of spillover effects of union wage outcomes in the United States has been found to account for up to one-third of the growth in American wage inequality in recent decades. In a paper entitled â€œThe Effect of Labour Relations Laws on Union Density Rates: Evidence from Canadian Provincesâ€ (CLSRN Working Paper no. 141), CLSRN affiliates Scott Legree (University of Waterloo), Tammy Schirle (Wilfrid Laurier University) and Mikal Skuterud (University of Waterloo) examine the impact of changes in labour relation laws on union density rates in Canada. They find that while changes to labour relations laws have the potential to greatly increase union density rates, increased unionization through labour relations reform tends to benefit workers who would enjoy relatively high wages even in the absence of unions. Consequently, the authors argue that reforms in labour relations laws are unlikely to result in significant reductions in wage inequality
J58|MarchÃƒÂ© du travail en revue - Novembre 2014|Alors que les adeptes des lois sur le salaire minimum les considÃ¨rent comme essentielles pour amÃ©liorer le bien-Ãªtre social et Ã©conomique, la mise en application des lois sur le salaire minimum peut aussi entraÃ®ner une hausse du chÃ´mage et un dÃ©placement des travailleurs dans le secteur non structurÃ© oÃ¹ les normes de protection des travailleurs et du milieu de travail ont moins de chances dâ€™Ãªtre respectÃ©es par rapport au secteur structurÃ©. Une Ã©tude intitulÃ©e Â« Estimation des effets du salaire minimum dans un pays en dÃ©veloppement : Une approche conceptuelle de la discontinuitÃ© de la densitÃ© Â» (Rapport de recherche du RCCMTC no 142) par le membre affiliÃ© du RCCMTC Hugo Jales (UniversitÃ© de la Colombie-Britannique) propose un cadre innovateur pour Ã©valuer de faÃ§on empirique les effets du salaire minimum sur le chÃ´mage, le salaire moyen, la mobilitÃ© des secteurs, lâ€™inÃ©galitÃ© des salaires, lâ€™importance du secteur non structurÃ© et les recettes fiscales du travail. Selon lâ€™Ã©tude, alors que la politique du salaire minimum peut augmenter le salaire moyen et rÃ©duire lâ€™inÃ©galitÃ© des revenus, ladite politique a aussi lâ€™effet involontaire de causer la baisse des recettes fiscales du travail, du fait des dÃ©placements des travailleurs du secteur structurÃ© vers le secteur non structurÃ©. Les adeptes de la syndicalisation font valoir que les syndicats ont des impacts bÃ©nÃ©fiques sur le bien-Ãªtre social, comme celui dâ€™accroÃ®tre pour les travailleurs leurs salaires, avantages sociaux et conditions de travail, mais dâ€™autres preuves semblent montrer les effets nÃ©gatifs des syndicats sur les bÃ©nÃ©fices et lâ€™investissement des entreprises, et sur la croissance de lâ€™emploi. Des recherches plus rÃ©centes ont examinÃ© la possibilitÃ© de la rÃ©action en chaÃ®ne des syndicats sur les revenus des travailleurs non syndiquÃ©s. De fait, on a trouvÃ© quâ€™aux Ã‰tats-Unis cette rÃ©action en chaÃ®ne comptait pour jusquâ€™Ã un tiers de la hausse de lâ€™inÃ©galitÃ© des revenus au cours des derniÃ¨res dÃ©cennies.

Ils dÃ©couvrent que, bien que cette lÃ©gislation ait le potentiel de fortement accroÃ®tre ces taux, la hausse de la syndicalisation du fait des rÃ©formes de la lÃ©gislation du travail a tendance Ã profiter aux travailleurs ayant des salaires assez Ã©levÃ©s, mÃªme Ã ceux nâ€™Ã©tant pas syndiquÃ©s.

J58|Long-term consequences of an innovative redundancy-retraining project: The Austrian Steel Foundation|In the late 1980s privatization and down-sizing of nationalized steel mills and related firms in the metal industry have lead to large-scale redundancy plans. A special Steel Foundation was created as part of a social plan. This foundation acted like an independent training center, where displaced workers would spend relatively long training periods (sometimes several years), obtaining personality and orientation training, as well as formal education. The last step of the integrative program was placement assistance as well as assistance for creating one’s own business. The foundation was financed by (higher) contributions from unemployment insurance funds, by the previous firms themselves, as well as by a collectively-bargained special tax on the remaining workers in the steel firms. Moreover the trainees themselves would have to support the foundation by giving up the interest accruing to their redundancy payments. I use combined data from Austrian social security records and from the Employment Service to look at participation decisions and on post-foundation economic performance, i.e. days worked and wage growth. As a control group I take all displaced workers from the firms who formed the foundation, using Instrumental Variables to solve the selection problem. The results show considerable wage gains - even for a period of five years after leaving the Foundation - as well as improved employment prospects. Finally, a cost-benefit analysis is performed to assess the long-term success of the Foundation.
J58|The Legal Framework Governing Business Firms & its Implications for Manufacturing Scale & Performance: The UK Experience in International Perspective|This paper reviews empirical studies examining the economic effects of laws governing the formation, financing and organisation of business firms with the aim of putting the UK experience in a comparative perspective. The literature identifies two models of legal support for manufacturing which imply different directions for policy: on the one hand, the Silicon Valley model of venture capital funded growth which depends on liquid capital markets and flexible labour markets, and the northern European and Japanese model which is based on long-term innovation, stable ownership, and institutionalised worker-management cooperation. The UK has some of the legal features of the Silicon Valley model, but important parts are missing: for example, the Californian rule under which post-employment restraints ('restrictive covenants') are void on the grounds of their anti-competitive effects has no equivalent in the UK. Conversely, although the UK has certain elements of the northern European or east Asian model of institutionalised corporate governance, it is unlikely to be able to replicate the 'productive coalition' approach of these countries as long as the legal framework prioritises shareholder rights and the market for corporate control, and provides limited encouragement for job security. The Silicon Valley and 'productive coalition' models are ideal types which can distract from the fact that most countries, the UK included, are hybrid systems with some of the characteristics of each model. Rather than designing laws and policies exclusively with one model or the other in mind, it may be preferable to consider specific laws and policies on their own merits, while bearing in mind that a given legal rule or policy does not operate in isolation from others and that there may be some 'network effects' in operation due to the way that particular rules interact.
J58|Globalization and labor market institutions: International empirical evidence|A widespread concern is that labor market institutions erode in the course of globalization, which, in turn, decreases employment and wages. By using panel data and cross-sectional data, I investigate the influence of globalization on labor market regulation. I use the indicators of labor market institutions by Gwartney et al. (2012) and the KOF indices of globalization. To deal with potential reverse causality, I employ a system GMM panel estimator and use a constructed trade share as proposed by Frankel and Romer (1999) as an instrumental variable for globalization in cross-sectional models. The results do not show that globalization induced labor market deregulation.
J58|Labour Supply Effects of Conditional Transfers: Analyzing the Dominican Republic's Solidarity|This paper studies the impact of the conditional cash transfer program Solidaridad on changes in the labor market of the Dominican Republic based on statistical data from the Evaluation of the Social Security Survey 2010. The estimation methodology is based on matching techniques, which can discern the impact on both benene.t-receiving and non-benefit-receiving households. The results show a negative but very small impact of the different components of the program on labor market indicators, especially for the components related to children. However, the estimates show some heterogeneity in the effects on the most vulnerable sectors of the population.
J58|Conflict and negotiations in the public sphere|System transitions taking place in Poland after 1989 entailed evolution in functioning of the public sphere, especially in relations of citizens and agencies representing them with administrative bodies. The formation of the civic society, an increase in the number of entities functioning in the public sphere, entering into various kinds of relations with administrative bodies and with similar organizations by such entities, diversification of the range of their activity, and at the same time their mutual dependence, have caused the negotiations to play more and more important role in such contacts. The article presents selected aspects of conflict and negotiations in the public sphere with the emphasis on factors bringing about typical difficulties.
J58|Has atypical work become typical in Germany? : country case studies on labour market segmentation|"This paper gives an overview of the transformation of the German labor market since the mid-1990s with a special focuson the changing patterns of labor market segmentation or ""dualization"" of employment in Germany. While labor market duality in Germany can partially be attributed to labor market reforms promoting in particular non-standard forms of employment and allowing for an expansion of low pay, structural changes in the economy as well as strategic choices by employers and social partners also play a prominent role.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>"
J58|Who Earns Minimum Wages in Europe? New Evidence Based on Household Surveys|"This paper aims to provide a comprehensive, evidence-based, and up-to-date assessment of minimum wages in a range of European countries. A first step towards a better understanding of where Europe stands today on this issue requires to grasp the diversity of European minimum wage systems, a key objective of the paper at hand. The second objective is to document international differences in the so-called ""bite"" of the minimum wage. This leads to questions such as ""how do national minimum wages compare to the overall wage distribution?"" and ""how many people earn minimum wages in each country?"" that are assessed for a set of nine countries from Western, Central and Eastern Europe: Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Poland, Romania, Spain, and the United Kingdom. This sample was designed to include countries for which recent evidence has been missing prior to this paper. What is more, the study also overcomes the narrow focus of extant overviews that have typically focussed only on full-time employment. Crucially, the study improves on existing work by looking beyond aggregate numbers; it provides a detailed panorama of the population of minimum wage earners in each country under investigation, notably by describing their composition in terms of a range of socio-demographic characteristics."
