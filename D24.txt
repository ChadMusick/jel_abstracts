D24|Improved productivity measurement in New Zealand's Longitudinal Business Database|Accounts information that businesses supply to Inland Revenue for tax purposes provide over 96% of the observations in the productivity dataset in the Longitudinal Business Database. In 2013, material changes in the data collected halted the annual updating of the productivity dataset. This paper describes a method for accounting for these raw data discontinuities, and revisits the prior productivity dataset methodology, implementing wholesale changes that improve the overall quality of the data and the versatility of the productivity dataset.
D24|Demand and Supply-side Drivers of Labour Productivity Growth: an empirical assessment for G7 countries|The recent slowdown in labour productivity growth experienced in advanced economies is generally considered one of the main causes of the current phase of economic stagnation. This has led scholars to carry out a number of theoretical and empirical studies to identify the long-run determinants of productivity growth. The present work aims to fall within this debate, with a peculiar focus on the relevance of the Kaldor-Verdoorn law. To this purpose, we empirically investigate on the determinants of labour productivity growth both for the total economy and for the manufacturing sector, comparing the role played by demand- and supply-side factors. A Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) model is estimated for G7 countries from 1970 to 2017. Although the analyses confirm the positive role of supply-side factors in fostering productivity growth, our findings generally validate also the relevance of demand-side factors. Additionally, the positive effect generated by demand factors on labour productivity growth suggests that supply-side measures would be not sufficient to enhance productivity. Our findings suggest that demand-side policies are likely to foster productivity by also stimulating supply-side factors, particularly in the manufacturing sector of the economy.
D24|Factor-Analysis-Based Directional Distance Function: The case of New Zealand hospitals|This paper develops a new factor-analysis-based (FAB) approach for choosing the optimal direction in a directional distance function (DDF) analysis. It has the combined merits of factor analysis and slacks-based measure (SBM) and incorporates the relative ease with which various input-output could be adjusted. This development relieves the dependency of price information that is normally unavailable in the provision of public goods. This new FAB-DDF model has been applied on a dataset containing all public hospitals in New Zealand (NZ) observed during 2011-2017. The empirical results indicate that the average reduction across different labor is in the range of 3-10 percent, and the corresponding figure for capital input is 25.7 percent. The case-adjusted inpatient-discharge and price-adjusted outpatient-visit are used as measures of desirable output, the average efficiencies are 92.7 percent and 99 percent respectively. Hospital readmission within 28 days of discharge is used as a measure for undesirable output, and the average efficiency score is 90 percent. These evidence support the suspicion that perverse incentives might exist under the National Health Targets abolished in 2018, which was a set of six indicators used in the last decade to evaluate the performance of local District Health Boards.
D24|Technical Efficiency and Corporate Structure of Italian Private Hospitals: Evidence from One-step Stochastic Frontier Analysis|This paper aims to identify the relationship between the output-oriented technical efficiency of Italian private hospitals and their ownership structure. Using the one-step Stochastic Frontier Analysis technique, we explain technical efficiency throughout a set of variables capturing the firm’s shareholder activity, ownership concentration, and managerial ownership. Results suggest that (1) technical efficiency is positively affected by managerial ownership, and (2) private hospitals are more efficient when ownership concentration is low.
D24|Firm-level Investment Under Imperfect Capital Markets in Ukraine|This paper develops and estimates a model of firm-level fixed capital investment when firms face borrowing constraints. Dynamically optimal investment functions are derived for the firms with and without financial constraints. These policy functions are then used to construct the likelihood of observing each of the investment regimes in the data. Structural parameters are estimated using data from the Ukrainian manufacturing sector in 1993–1998. I provide empirical evidence of the role of market and ownership structure for firm-level investment behavior. I also discuss the effects of international trade exposure and involvement in non-monetary transactions on the probability of facing financial constraints and the resulting fixed capital accumulation path. Estimation results are used to illustrate the welfare implications of financial constraints in the Ukrainian manufacturing sector.
D24|The Productivity Slowdown in Canada: an ICT Phenomenon?|We ask whether a weaker contribution of information and communication technologies (ICT) to productivity growth could account for the productivity slowdown observed in Canada since the early 2000s. To answer this question, we consider several models which capture channels by which ICT could affect productivity growth. Our results indicate that ICT continues to contribute to productivity growth, but that this contribution has declined and consequently accounts for part of the productivity growth slowdown. However, the productivity slowdown and the change in the contribution of ICT do not seem to have the same timing. While productivity growth slowed in the early 2000s, the ICT contribution does not appear to have fallen until around the Great Recession. This prompts the conclusion that while ICT had little to no role in the initial productivity slowdown, it has been a major determinant of the subdued productivity growth since 2007-2009.
D24|Shocks and labour cost adjustment: evidence from a survey of European firms|We use firm-level survey data from 25 EU countries to analyse how firms adjust their labour costs (employment, wages and hours) in response to shocks. We develop a theoretical model to understand how firms choose between different ways to adjust their labour costs. The basic intuition is that firms choose the cheapest way to adjust labour costs. Our empirical findings are in line with the theoretical model and show that the pattern of adjustment is not much affected by the type of the shock (demand shock, access-to-finance shock, ‘availability of supplies’ shock), but differs according to the direction of the shock (positive or negative), its size and persistence. In 2010-13, firms responding to negative shocks were most likely to reduce employment, then hourly wages and then hours worked, regardless of the source of the shock. Results for the 2008-09 period indicate that the ranking might change during deep recession as the likelihood of wage cuts increases. In response to positive shocks in 2010-13, firms were more likely to increase wages, followed by increases in employment and then hours worked suggesting an asymmetric reaction to positive and negative shocks. Finally, we show that strict employment protection legislation and high centralisation or coordination of wage bargaining make it less likely that firms reduce wages when facing negative shocks.

D24|Drivers of Productivity in the Spanish Banking Sector: Recent Evidence|Abstract We analyse the drivers of total factor productivity of Spanish banks from early 2000, including the last financial crisis and the post-crisis period. This allows us to study changes in productivity following a major restructuring process in the banking sector such as the one experienced in Spain. Overall, we find that following a period of continued growth, productivity declined after the height of the crisis, though large banks were less affected. We also find that risk, capital levels, competition and input prices were important drivers of the differences in productivity change between banks. Finally, our results suggest that, by the end of our sample period, there was still some room for potential improvements in productivity via exploiting scale economies and enhancing cost efficiency. These opportunities appear to be generally greater for the smaller banks in our sample.
D24|Zombie firms in Italy: a critical assessment|This note shows the consequences of different methodological choices for the estimates of the incidence of zombie firms in Italy. We use as a benchmark the influential measure proposed by the OECD (Adalet McGowan et al. 2017a and 2017b) which identifies zombie firms based on a combination of firm age and values of the interest coverage ratio (operating profits to interest expenses). We show that a key decision is whether operating profits are taken before or after amortization and depreciation and we argue that using profits after amortization and depreciation has several undesirable characteristics: i) it overestimates the share of capital “trapped” into zombie firms, and, to a smaller extent, the share of zombie firms; ii) it is worse in predicting the future performance of firms; iii) it is more likely to classify as zombies in a given year firms which invested heavily in previous years and amortized that investment quickly (for example to enjoy tax breaks); iv) it is especially inappropriate for cross-country comparisons.
D24|Protección y productividad en la industria colombiana, 1993-2011|Este documento analiza la evolución de la productividad total factorial en la industria colombiana entre 1993 y 2011 haciendo uso de datos a nivel de firma. La determinación de la productividad total factorial es bastante importante debido a sus implicaciones en el crecimiento económico, la innovación y el nivel de ingresos del país. Una vez definida la evolución de la productividad total factorial se estudian sus determinantes. Fundamentalmente se consideran especificaciones que evalúan la importancia de la apertura económica y el nivel de concentración de la producción sobre los niveles de productividad. Los resultados muestran un estancamiento en la productividad factorial en la industria manufacturera del país y, además, se identifica una relación directa entre los niveles de incorporación de las firmas a los mercados internacionales y su nivel de productividad.
D24|TOTEX Malmquist Index for RPI-X Regulation: Does it Correctly Estimate the True Frontier Shift?|The X in RPI-X regulation aims to adjust price or revenue allowances of regulated firms to changes in total factor productivity and input prices. If calculated correctly, both terms together correspond to the change in efficient costs which can be determined by applying a cost Malmquist index. However, regulators typically lack the required data on input quantities and prices. As an alternative, regulation authorities may apply a TOTEX Malmquist index to measure the total cost change. We study under which conditions this total cost change correctly estimates the true efficient cost change. We find that the TOTEX Malmquist index provides an undistorted estimate at least under two conditions, namely if (1) the frontier firms identified in the benchmarking procedure are either fully efficient, or if their degree of inefficiency remains constant over time, and (2) if input prices either stay constant or change by the same proportion for all firms.
D24|Labor Shares in Some Advanced Economies|We study the joint impact of three measurement issues in the empirical literature on the labor share: (i) start and end periods for the empirical analysis; (ii) accounting for self-employment; and (iii) accounting for residential real estate income. When we correct for these three potential biases, we do not find a general decline in the labor share in our sample of advanced economies. In that respect the behavior of the US labor share after 2000 presents a puzzle.

D24|Does Electrification Cause Industrial Development? Grid Expansion and Firm Turnover in Indonesia|I ask whether electrification causes industrial development. I combine newly digitized data from the Indonesian state electricity company with rich manufacturing census data. To understand when and how electrification can cause industrial development, I shed light on an important economic mechanism - firm turnover. In particular, I study the effect of the extensive margin of electrification (grid expansion) on the extensive margin of industrial development (firm entry and exit). To deal with endogenous grid placement, I build a hypothetical electric transmission grid based on colonial incumbent infrastructure and geographic cost factors. I find that electrification causes industrial development, represented by an increase in the number of manufacturing firms, manufacturing workers, and manufacturing output. Electrification increases firm entry rates, but also exit rates. Empirical tests show that electrification creates new industrial activity, as opposed to only reorganizing industrial activity across space. Higher turnover rates lead to higher average productivity and induce reallocation towards more productive firms in electrified areas. This is consistent with electrification lowering entry costs, increasing competition and forcing unproductive firms to exit more often. Without the possibility of entry or competitive effects of entry, the effects of electrification are likely to be smaller.
D24|Does competition increase pass-through?|How does market power affect the rate of pass-through from marginal cost to the market price? A standard intuition is that more competition makes prices more “cost-reflective” and thus raises cost pass-through. This paper shows that this intuition is sensitive to the common assumption in the literature that firms’ marginal costs are constant. If firms have even modestly increasing marginal costs, more intense competition actually reduces pass through. These results apply to the “normal” case where pass-through is less than 100%. They have implications for competition policy and environmental regulation.
D24|Carbon-sensitive Meta-Productivity Growth and Technological Gap: An Empirical Analysis of Indian Thermal Power Sector|This paper measures carbon-sensitive efficiency and productivity growth in technologically heterogeneous coal-fired thermal power plants in India for the period of 2000 to 2013. It uses a unique data set of 56 plants, obtained petitioning the Right to Information Act 2005. We apply ‘within-MLE’ fixed effects stochastic frontier model to get consistent estimates of meta-directional output distance function. The thermal power plants are grouped in two categories: central sector and state sector. We find that the state sector plants have higher potential to simultaneously increase electricity generation and reduce carbon emission than the central sector plants. If all the state and central sectors plants were made to operate on the meta-frontier, reduction of 98 million tonnes of CO2 could have been achieved. Carbon-sensitive productivity growth in the central sector plants is higher than the plants in state sector, though in both the sectors productivity growth is governed by carbon-sensitive innovation effect. Commercialisation or autonomy in electricity generation also induces carbon-sensitive productivity growth and reduces carbon-sensitive productivity growth gap.
D24|Distressed banks, distorted decisions?|"Exploiting differences in pre-crisis business banking relationships, we present evidence to suggest that restricted credit availability following the 2008 financial crisis increased the rate of business failure in the United Kingdom. But rather than ""cleansing the economy by accelerating the exit of the least productive businesses, we find that tighter credit conditions resulted in some businesses failing despite being more productive than their surviving competitors. We also find evidence that distressed banks protected highly leveraged, low productivity businesses from failure."
D24|Using Social Connections and Financial Incentives to Solve Coordination Failure: A Quasi-Field Experiment in India's Manufacturing Sector|Production processes are often organised in teams, yet there is limited evidence on whether and how social connections and financial incentives affect productivity in tasks that require coordination among workers. We simulate assembly line production in a lab-in-the-field experiment in which workers exert real effort in a minimum-effort game in teams whose members are either socially connected or unconnected and are paid according to the group output. We find that group output increases by 15% and wasted individual output is lower by 30% when workers are socially connected with their co-workers. Unlike the findings of existing research, increasing the power of group-based financial incentives does not reduce the positive effect of social connections. Our results are driven by men whose average productivity is significantly lower than that of women. These findings can be explained by pro-social behavior of workers in socially connected teams.
D24|Educación en Colombia: Un análisis regional|Uno de los retos que tiene el país en materia de políticas públicas es mejorar la cobertura, calidad, la equidad y la pertinencia en su sistema educativo, como uno de los pilares claves para mejorar la equidad social y la prosperidad económica. En esa vía, el país ha mostrado avances importantes en sus indicadores educativos, pero que aún no son suficientes para alcanzar la meta de ser el país más educado de la región, sobre todo se evidencian importantes brechas y diferencias entre los departamentos y regiones del país, que son necesario cerrar para lograr ese propósito. En este documento se muestra las diferencias en algunos indicadores educativos entre departamentos, como las tasas de asistencia neta, los promedios educativos e indicadores de calidad, entre otros, que contribuyen a entender las mencionadas brechas. Adicionalmente, se estima un modelo mixto tipo jerárquico que permitió estimar el efecto que sobre la calidad (Saber11) tienen los diferentes eslabones del proceso educativo: individual, el establecimiento y las características de los entes territoriales. Se encontró que en promedio para el país el más importante es el individuo (67%), seguido del establecimiento (27%) y un 6% el territorial.
D24|Análisis de experiencias de modelos asociativos como mecanismo para el desarrollo empresarial en la ruralidad|En este trabajo estudiamos algunos de estos modelos, con un enfoque diferente. A saber, analizamos modelos asociativos de características diferentes, identificamos buenas y malas prácticas y hacemos recomendaciones de política. Para ello, recolectamos información cuantitativa y cualitativa –entrevistas, registros e información secundaria– de empresas y productores de nueve modelos asociativos en cuatro sectores: palma, cacao, leche y panela. El trabajo está organizado de la siguiente manera. Después de esta introducción, en el segundo capítulo presentamos el marco conceptual para caracterizar los diferentes modelos asociativos de agricultura por contrato y hacemos explícitos sus principales riesgos. En el tercer capítulo se explica la metodología para la selección de casos, se presentan los modelos a estudiar y se describen los aspectos más importantes de cada uno. En el cuarto capítulo elaboramos un resumen comparativo de los estudios de caso y en el quinto presentamos las conclusiones y recomendaciones en diversos frentes, entre otros respecto a precios remunerativos, productividad y calidad, acceso al crédito y formalización laboral.
D24|Stagnation vs singularity: The global implications of alternative productivity growth scenarios|Productivity growth has flat-lined in most economies despite rapid advances in technology. Economists suggest competing explanations for this paradox. Some argue the current stagnation will persist given deep structural challenges, arguing that recent technological advances are no match for those of the past. Others argue that the historical time-lag between technological advances and increased productivity means a productivity surge is just around the corner. The paper explores the implications of alternative productivity growth scenarios for the global economy, particularly for growth, labor markets and the flows of trade and capital. The paper explores the appropriate policy response under these alternative scenarios. It highlights the importance of productivity-enhancing reforms and the first-mover benefits that can flow to economies which move closer to the productivity frontier. It explores the factors that constrain an economy’s ability to reap the full benefits of any future productivity boom. It highlights the consequences of asymmetric increases in productivity across countries for both booming and non-booming economies and the role of monetary and fiscal policies, with particular warnings for the stability of the euro zone. Finally, it highlights the implications of asymmetric productivity changes across sectors and the importance of flexibility in labor, capital and product markets.
D24|The banks that said no: the Impact of credit supply on productivity and wages|This paper estimates the effects of changes in bank credit supply on the real economy. We use UK firm-level data around the global financial crisis and information on pre-existing bank lending relationships to isolate exogenous credit supply shocks. We find some evidence that contractions in credit supply substantially reduce labour productivity, wages, and capital per worker within firms, and increase the chance firms will fail. Our results have implications for the welfare costs of financial crises, and for the costs of policy measures affecting credit supply at other times.

D24|What Drives Differences in Management Practices?|"Partnering with the US Census Bureau, we implement a new survey of ""structured"" management practices in two waves of 35,000 manufacturing plants in 2010 and 2015. We find an enormous dispersion of management practices across plants, with 40 percent of this variation across plants within the same firm. Management practices account for more than 20 percent of the variation in productivity, a similar, or greater, percentage as that accounted for by R&D, ICT, or human capital. We find evidence of two key drivers to improve management. The business environment, as measured by right-to-work laws, boosts incentive management practices. Learning spillovers, as measured by the arrival of large ""Million Dollar Plants"" in the country, increase the management scores of incumbents."
D24|The Decompositions of Cost Variation|In this paper a number of meaningful and empirically implementable decom- positions of the cost variation (in difference and ratio form) are developed. The components distinguished are price level change, technical efficiency change, allocative efficiency change, technological change, scale of activity change, and price structure change. Given data from a (balanced) panel of produc- tion units, all the necessary ingredients for the computation of the various decompositions can be obtained by using linear programming techniques. An application is provided.
D24|Exporting and firm performance: Evidence from India|The positive correlation between firm productivity and export status is well established. This correlation can arise from multiple alternative casual models. We investigate these relationships, harnessing the transition of several firms from serving the domestic market to exporting, in a dataset of Indian firms from 1989 to 2015. Each firm which made the transition is matched against a control which did not. The transitions take place across many years, thus permitting a matched event study in firm outcomes. We find there is self-selection of more productive firms into exporting. Firms that make the transition become bigger, but there is little evidence of learning by exporting, of improvements in productivity right after exporting commences. However, there is evidence of mprovement in productivity of export starters a couple of years before they begin to export.
D24|Access to Credit and Growth of Firms|The aim of the paper is to analyze the employment and sales growth of companies in transition countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia that have obtained bank credit in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. It is shown, using a treatment effects model, that loans are negatively and positively related to employment growth and sales growth, respectively. Loans that completely remove any restrictions to accessing finance do not have a positive effect on sales growth.
D24|Theories of value and ultimate standards in Sraffa's notes of summer 1927|The group of manuscripts titled 'Notes/London, Summer 1927/Physical real costs, etc.' (D3/12/3) is recognized as extremely important for the reconstruction of the evolution of Sraffa's thought after the articles published in 1925 and 1926. The present paper is aimed at analysing some relevant passages and ideas expressed by Sraffa in those manuscripts. We shall focus, in particular, on Sraffa's arguments about the existence of two different theories of value, with different aims: one aimed at determining the value of large aggregates of commodities, such as the national product, the necessary consumption and the social surplus, and the other aimed at determining the price of a single commodity, separately from the others. In Sraffa's view, if the values of many commodities are to be determined simultaneously, then the theory cannot dispense with an ultimate standard of value. That idea led Sraffa toward the conception (or the rediscovery) of the physical real cost.
D24|Technology heterogeneity in European industries' energy efficiency performance. The role of climate, greenhouse gases, path dependence and energy mix|Assessment of industrial-level energy efficiency development is a critical research topic that has infiltrated in the global battle against climate change. A balanced panel of fourteen European industries from twenty-four countries for the period 1995-2011 is introduced into a metafrontier framework. Reflecting the divergent views on the importance of desirable and undesirable outcomes in the pursuit of energy efficiency, the proposed approach estimate industrial performance by prioritizing either economic or environmental criterion incorporating technological heterogeneity. It is found that small-scale economies exhibit persistent high energy efficiency scores. Regarding energy efficiency determinants, path dependence phenomena have a strong presence, climate characteristics occurs, while energy mix displays linear but also non-linear relationships. Finally, regardless of the method employed, there is a strong evidence of conditional and unconditional convergence.
D24|Optimal Control of the Parameters of the Production Line|The problem of optimal control of the parameters of the production flow line - stocks (work in process) and the rate of processing of objects of labour for a technological operation is considered. The article presents a mathematical formulation of the problem of controlling the parameters of a production line with restrictions on work in progress and the speed of machining parts for each technological operation. The control program is determined by the specified quality criteria. An example of the calculation of the optimal control for the production line parameters is presented.

Методика. Производственная ли-ния предприятия с поточным методом организации производства – это сложная динамическая распреде-ленная система. Технологический маршрут изготовления изделия для многих современных предприятий содержит несколько сотен технологических операций, в межоперационном заделе каждой из которых со-держатся тысячи изделий, ожидающих обработку. Технологические маршруты разных деталей одного вида изделий пересекаются. Это приводит к тому, что распределение предметов труда вдоль технологического маршрута оказывает значительное влияние на пропускную способность производственной линии. Для опи-сания таких систем введен новый класс моделей производственных линий (PDE-model). Модели этого клас-са используют уравнения в частных производных для описания поведения потоковых параметров произ-водственной линии. В данной статье построена PDE-модель производственной линии, потоковые парамет-ры которой зависят от величины коэффициента загрузки технологического оборудования для каждой опе-рации.
D24|Sommes-nous payés selon la productivité marginale ?<BR>[Does Marginal Productivity Mean Anything in Real Economic Life ?]|The equality between factor pay and marginal product is a major component of the neoclassical paradigm. The article begins with a brief historical review of this principle. Follows a questioning about the relevance of this law as an argument in the social debates: does marginal product represent the very contribution of the agent and if so, is it a legitimate reference for the setting of remuneration? Our answer to the first part of the question is irresolute; to the second, it is negative. But most of the article is devoted to analysing the economic realism of the said law, both empirically and theoretically. We review some statistical studies present in the literature, with particular attention for the debate regarding the regressions of Cobb and Douglas. Evidence does not strengthen the neoclassical law of retribution. The article analyses the factors that hinder either the determination of marginal product or the equalisation between it and factor's remuneration. Are analysed: - the restrictions inherent in the law of marginal productivity: constant returns to scale and perfect competition - an alternative explanation of interest: the Austrian theory - incentive wage theories: efficiency wage and tournament theory. The article then considers the particular case of the CEO's remuneration.
D24|Examining eco-efficiency convergence of European Industries.The existence of technological spillovers within a metafrontier framework|European policies regarding global warming have been outspread the last few decades with many initiatives for industrial production process. In this paper we model eco-efficiency performance under a meta-frontier framework for 14 industries from the manufacturing sector from 27 European countries over the 1995-2011 period. The utilization of NOx, SOx, CO2, CH4, N2O, CO, NMVOC and NH3 as undesirable outputs and GVA as the desirable represent the impact of of economic activities on the environment. In the first stage, we estimate eco-efficiency using the conventional Directional Distance Function (DDF) as well as the non-radial DDF approach. In the second stage of analysis, we investigate the existence of conditional and unconditional convergence according to several methodologies. Our eco-efficiency estimates provide a distinct behavior for energy intensive European industries. Moreover, a decline occurs for the majority of them. In addition, our results using distributional dynamics approach and the recent approach of Philips and Sul (2007) supports the non-convergence hypothesis and the creation of distinct clubs. Finally, the establishment of a catch up index indicate an increase in a speed of convergence.
D24|Productive Performance and Technology Gaps using a Bayesian Metafrontier Production Function: A cross-country comparison|Growth theory argues on the role of heterogeneity that can lead to multiple regimes examining countries’ performance. A meta-production stochastic function under a Bayesian perspective has been developed to estimate technical efficiencies across countries over a time period. The metafrontier model is used to highlight heterogeneity among cluster of countries revealing catch up phenomena. The estimation procedure relies on the solution of an optimization problem and on the concept of the upper orthant order of two multinormal random variables. The proposed models are applied in a real dataset consisting of 109 countries for a 20-year period from 1995-2014. The productive performance differential and the associated technology gaps were investigated using two distinct frontiers (OECD vs non-OECD countries). Empirical results reveal that heterogeneity indeed plays a significant and distinctive role in determining technological gaps.
D24|Дискретно-Событийная Модель Расчета Продолжительного Производственного Цикла Изготовления Партии Деталей<BR>[Discrete-Eventing Model Of Calculation Of The Duration Of The Production Cycle Of Manufacturing A Part Of Products]|The method of calculating the duration of the production cycle for manufacturing a batch of parts is considered. The production cycle of manufacturing the batch of parts is one of the main characteristics of the production system. It is used to calculate the important indicators of planning the production activity of the factory. At present, the task of calculating the duration of the production cycle for unsynchronized production lines remains relevant. The task takes on special relevance in the case when the processing time of a work item in a technological operation is a random quantity. The present work is devoted to the analysis of this case. To derive the equation of motion of labour objects for technological operations, a discrete-event model of the production process is used. The structure of the processing time of an object of labour on a technological operation is considered. The source of change in the value of inter-operational stocks at each technological operation is shown. The interrelation of the trajectories of the previous and after subjects of labour is analyzed. The equation of motion of a subject of labour on technological operations is recorded, taking into account the inter-operational stocks. Methods for its solution are proposed. Conditions for the applicability of the obtained results are considered. The analysis of the machine time spent on calculating the duration of the production cycle of manufacturing the batch of products for the factory of the semiconductor industry was carried out. Prospects for research have been determined.
D24|The determinant factors of automotive industry investment decision in Indonesia|Automotive industry contributes directly and indirectly to economic growth in Indonesia. Investment in this industry has increased after declining in the previous years. This paper examines some internal and external factors influencing the investment decision in this industry by using E-views for listed automotive company in Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2013 to 2017. This study finds that both net cash flow from operation and investment opportunity set (IOS) as internal factors have a significant and positive relationship to the investment decision. The capital market pressure as an external factor has a significant and negative relationship to the investment decision. The composition of the independence commissioner as an external factor does not have a significant relationship to the investment decision. By comparing the coefficient of the significant variables, the net cash flow from operation is a dominant factor in the investment decision. This fact relates to the report published by Bank Indonesia, as a central bank, that the increasing free cash flow of corporation enhances the investment in Indonesia. This study contributes as a reference to the free cash flow literatures and the capital market authority especially in the developing country.
D24|The optimal control problem for output material flow on a conveyor belt with input accumulating bunker|The article is devoted to the synthesis of optimal control of the conveyor belt with the accumulating input bunker. Much attention is given to the model of the conveyor belt with a constant speed of the belt. Simulation of the conveyor belt is carried out in the one-moment approximation using partial differential equations. The conveyor belt is represented as a distributed system. The used PDE-model of the conveyor belt allows determining the state of the flow parameters for a given technological position as a function of time. We consider the optimal control problem for flow parameters of the conveyor belt. The problem consists in ensuring the minimum deviation of the output material flow from a given target amount. The control is carried out by the material flow amount, which comes from the accumulating bunker into the conveyor belt input. In the synthesis of optimal control, we take into account the limitations on the size of the accumulating bunker, as well as on both max and min amounts of control. We construct optimal control of the material flow amount coming from the accumulating bunker. Also, we determine the conditions to switch control modes and estimate time period between the moments of the switching.
D24|Death to the Cobb-Douglas Production Function? A Quantitative Survey of the Capital-Labor Substitution Elasticity|We show that the large elasticity of substitution between capital and labor estimated in the literature on average, 0.9, can be explained by three factors: publication bias, use of aggregated data, and omission of the first-order condition for capital. The mean elasticity conditional on the absence of publication bias, disaggregated data, and inclusion of information from the first-order condition for capital is 0.3. To obtain this result, we collect 3,186 estimates of the elasticity reported in 121 studies, codify 71 variables that reflect the context in which researchers produce their estimates, and address model uncertainty by Bayesian and frequentist model averaging. We employ nonlinear techniques to correct for publication bias, which is responsible for at least half of the overall reduction in the mean elasticity from 0.9 to 0.3. Our findings also suggest that a failure to normalize the production function leads to a substantial upward bias in the estimated elasticity. The weight of evidence accumulated in the empirical literature emphatically rejects the Cobb-Douglas specification.

D24|Aggregation of Efficiency and Productivity: From Firm to Sector and Higher Levels|Here we consider various cases where researchers are interested in measuring aggregate efficiency or productivity levels or their changes for a group of decision making units. These could be entire industry composed of individual firms, banks, hospitals, or a region composed of sub-regions or countries, or particular sub-groups of these units within a group, e.g., sub-groups of public vs. private or regulated vs. non-regulated firms, banks or hospitals within the same industry, etc. Such analysis requires solutions to the aggregation problem some theoretically justified approaches that can connect individual measures to aggregate measures. Various solutions are offered in the literature and our goal is to try to coherently summarize at least some of them in this chapter. This material should be interesting not only for theorists but also (and perhaps more so) for applied researchers, as it provides exact formulas and intuitive explanations for various measures of group efficiency, group scale elasticity and group productivity indexes and refers to original papers for more details.
D24|Statistical Inference for Aggregation of Malmquist Productivity Indices|The Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI) has gained popularity amongst studies on dynamic change of productivity of decision making units (DMUs). In practice, this index is frequently reported at aggregate levels (e.g., public and private rms) in the form of simple equally-weighted arithmetic or geometric means of individual MPIs. A number of studies have emphasized that it is necessary to account for the relative importance of individual DMUs in the aggregations of indices in general and of MPI in particular. While more suitable aggregations of MPIs have been introduced in the literature, their statistical properties have not been revealed yet, preventing applied researchers from making essential statistical inferences such as con dence intervals and hypothesis testing. In this paper, we will ll this gap by developing a full asymptotic theory for an appealing aggregation of MPIs. On the basis of this, some meaningful statistical inferences are proposed and their nite-sample performances are veri ed via extensive Monte Carlo experiments.
D24|Hicks Neutrality and Homotheticity in Technologies with Multiple Inputs and Multiple Outputs|We analyse two popular notions in production theory: the notion of Hicks neutral technical change and the notion of homothetic technology. Both of these notions are characterized by the radial expansions or contractions of the relevant isoquants, yet in different ways. In the case of multiple-input and multiple-output, an isoquant is characterized by either the input or output combinations. Thus, for each of these notions, there are two types of conditions: one is based on the input isoquants and the other is based on the output isoquants. We show that for each notion, these two conditions are equivalent under the ð ›¼-returns to scale technology. From this result, we also derive several implications for the properties of well-known productivity indexes, such as the Malmquist productivity index and the Hicks-Moorsteen productivity index.
D24|Dual Productivity Analysis: A KonÃ¼s/Shephard Approach|A primal (or direct) productivity index is conventionally defined as the ratio of an output quantity index to an input quantity index. There have been attempts in the literature to define and implement dual and indirect productivity indexes based on price changes rather than quantity changes. Although dual and indirect productivity indexes share a common motivation, the measurement of productivity change when prices are measured more accurately than quantities, they differ analytically, from one another and from primal productivity indexes. We introduce a new dual productivity index, based on contributions of KonÃ¼s and Shephard, and we compare our dual productivity index with a primal productivity index based on the work of Malmquist. We also compare these two theoretical productivity indexes with analogous empirical Fisher productivity indexes. We provide an empirical application to US agricultural productivity growth.
D24|Firm Organization with Multiple Establishments|How do geographic frictions affect firm organization? We show theoretically and empirically that geographic frictions increase the use of middle managers in multi-establishment firms. In our model, we assume that a CEO’s time is a resource in limited supply, shared across headquarters and establishments. Geographic frictions increase the costs of accessing the CEO. Hiring middle managers at one establishment substitutes for CEO time, which is reallocated across all establishments. Consequently, geographic frictions between the headquarters and one establishment affect the organization of all establishments of a firm. Our model is consistent with novel facts about multi-establishment firm organization that we document using administrative data from Germany. We exploit the opening of high-speed train routes to show that not only the establishments directly affected by faster travel times but also the other establishments of the firm adjust their organization. Our findings imply that local conditions propagate across space through firm organization.
D24|Aggregate productivity and the allocation of resources over the business cycle|This paper proposes a novel decomposition of aggregate productivity to evaluate the role of allocative efficiency for the cyclical dynamics of aggregate productivity. The decomposition, which is derived from the aggregation of heterogeneous firm-level production functions, accounts for changes in allocative efficiency, as well as for changes in entry and exit. This approach thereby extends Solow's (1957) growth accounting exercise to a framework with firm heterogeneity and frictions in the allocation of resources across firms. I apply the decomposition to a comprehensive dataset of French manufacturing and service firms, and I find that entry and exit contribute little to the year-on-year variability of sectoral productivity, between-sector allocative efficiency plays a limited role for the volatility of aggregate productivity, whereas within-sector allocative efficiency is countercyclical and tends to reduce the volatility of sectoral productivity.

D24|Labor Productivity and Firm-Level TFP with Technology-Specific Production Function|We investigate the technological dimension of productivity, presenting an empirical methodology based on mixture models to disentangle the labor productivity differences associated with the firm's choice of technology (BTFP) and those related to the firm's ability to exploit the adopted technology (WTFP). The estimation endogenously determines the number of technologies (in the sector) and degree of technology sharing across firms (i.e., for each firm, the probability of using a given technology). By using comparable data for about 35,000 firms worldwide distributed across 22 (two-digit) sectors, we show BTFP to be at least as important as WTFP in explaining the labor productivity gaps across firms. Intra-sectoral and inter-sectoral heterogeneity is substantial and, even in sectors in which BTFP dominates on average, we find a considerable number of firms for which labor productivity is mostly determined by the ability to use the adopted technology. Hence, dissecting the labor productivity gaps is crucial to achieving more targeted innovation policies. The estimated number of technologies ranges from one (in only three industries) to five, being three in most cases. The suggested estimation strategy takes simultaneity into account. The BTFP measure is unaffected by omitted price bias. The presence of BTFP dispersion can be associated with the action of frictions preventing firms from switching to superior and more productive technologies. Eliminating BTFP does not eliminate misallocation. (Copyright: Elsevier)
D24|Productivity and Organization in Portuguese Firms|The productivity of firms is, at least partly, determined by a firm’s actions and decisions. One of these decisions involves the organization of production in terms of the number of layers of management the firm decides to employ. Using detailed employer-employee matched data and firm production quantity and input data for Portuguese firms, we study the endogenous response of revenue-based and quantity-based productivity to a change in layers: a firm reorganization. We show that as a result of an exogenous demand or productivity shock that makes the firm reorganize and add a management layer, quantity- based productivity increases by about 8%, while revenue-based productivity drops by around 7%. Such a reorganization makes the firm more productive, but also increases the quantity produced to an extent that lowers the price charged by the firm and, as a result, its revenue-based productivity.
D24|Protección y productividad en la industria colombiana, 1993-2011|Este documento analiza la evolución de la productividad total factorial en la industria colombiana entre 1993 y 2011 haciendo uso de datos a nivel de firma. La determinación de la productividad total factorial es bastante importante debido a sus implicaciones en el crecimiento económico, la innovación y el nivel de ingresos del país. Una vez definida la evolución de la productividad to tal factorial se estudian sus determinantes. Fundamentalmente se consideran especificaciones que evalúan la importancia de la apertura económica y el nivel de concentración de la producción sobre los niveles de productividad. Los resultados muestran un estancamiento en la productividad factorial en la industria manufacturera del país y, además, se identifica una relación directa entre los niveles de incorporación de las firmas a los mercados internacionales y su nivel de productividad. **** ABSTRACT: This document analyzes the evolution of total factor productivity in Colombian industry between 1993 and 2011 using data at the firm level. The determination of total factor productivity is quite important because of its implications for economic growth, innovation and the income levels in the country. Once the evolution of total factor productivity is defined, its determinants are studied. Fundamentally, we considered specifications that evaluate the importance of the economic opening and the level of production concentration on productivity levels. The results show a stagnation in the productivity levels in the manufacturing industry of the country and, in addition, a direct relationship is identified between the firm’s integration levels to international markets and their productivity.
D24|Skill Biased Technical Change and Misallocation. A Unified Framework and a country-sector exercize|Due to strict reliance on perfectly competitive labor markets, standard approaches estimating skill biased technical change (SBTC) conflate ‘true’ SBTC and labor market distortions preventing firms from choosing the efficient skilled to unskilled labor ratio. To overcome this limit, we present a unified framework to estimate SBTC, net of factor accumulation (FA) effects, and quantify the discrepancy between skilled to unskilled marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS) and wage ratio (i.e., relative misallocation). The methodology takes advantage of recent developments in nonparametric estimation methods (i.e., generalized kernel regression) that allow us to estimate the marginal productivity of inputs at the country-sector level directly from country-sector data. Using 1995-2005 data, we find a 3% yearly growth rate for the MRTS between skilled and unskilled labor and show such change to be mostly driven by SBTC, rather than FA. We then show that MRTS changes does not match the evolution of the wage ratios (quite stable over time), thus yielding substantial heterogeneity in terms of relative misallocation patterns, for which we report a 6% increase, overall (1.5% in manufacturing, against a rough 12% in Non-Manufacturing sectors). Finally, we show evidence that relative misallocation increased less in country-sectors in which it was larger at the beginning of the period and grew more in country-sectors characterized by: higher skill-intensity; lower bargaining power of skilled over unskilled workers; lower FA effects.
D24|Trade, Labor Share, and Productivity in India's Industries|This paper explores whether trade can explain a part of the sharp decline in the labor share of Indian formal industries from around 30% in 1980 to less than 10% in 2014. Decline in strikes and lockouts, reduced labor time lost from disputes per factory and increased use of contract workers in all major states in India are signs of reduced bargaining power. In order to estimate the influence of trade, the mark-up and bargaining power affecting the labor share and resultant productivity is derived. A semi-parametric approach is applied on a 3-digit level of industrial data over major states during 1998–2014 to regress the Solow residual (the proxy for productivity) on trade share along with its interaction terms capturing market imperfections. The results confirm that trade, by dampening the bargaining power of labor, reduces labor share and hence raises productivity. It is argued that the joint effects of market size and competition arising out of trade cannot dominate the adverse effect of specialization in the presence of unions. The degree of specialization or comparative advantage that appears due to the increased market share of the most productive firms, who require fewer workers, thereby reducing the demand for workers with the trade. The drop in demand weakens bargaining power and shifts away distributive share from workers. But the competitive policy encouraging entry can negate such adverse effects of trade, to a large extent.
D24|Flexible Estimation of Heteroskedastic Stochastic Frontier Models via Two-step Iterative Nonlinear Least Squares|This article illustrates a straightforward and useful method for incorporating exogenous inefficiency effects in the estimation of semiparametric stochastic frontier models. An iterative estimation algorithm based on two-step nonlinear least squares is developed allowing for any flexible and monotonic specification of the production technology. We investigate the behavior of the proposed procedure through a set of Monte Carlo experiments comparing its finite sample properties with those of available alternatives. The new algorithm provides very good performance, outperforming the competitors in small samples and in presence of small signal-to-noise ratios. Two applications to agricultural data illustrate the usefulness of the proposed algorithm, even when it is used as a tool for sensitivity analysis.
D24|Disentangling tax evasion from inefficiency in firms tax declaration: an integrated approach|"In this article we present a new methodology to support fiscal monitoring by the Italian Revenue Agency (IRA) with the aim of improving current taxpayers fiscal compliance and fighting tax evasion within small and medium enterprises. In fact, given the methodology behind the Sector Studies (Studi di Settore - SdS) system, there is room for firms to implement tax evasion strategies by simply adjusting revenues (and costs) toward an estimated average threshold (known ex-ante), the so called ""presumptive"" revenues, and achieving the fiscal ""congruity"" status. By estimating a production function through stochastic frontier analysis we avoid estimating the average threshold know ex-ante and can combine information on firm economic efficiency with those on fiscal congruity, thus being able to disentangle underreporting of revenues due to potential firm tax evasion behaviours from underreporting due to firm inefficiencies. We apply this framework to two samples of Italian firms belonging to two Sector Studies. Our results confirm the potentiality of the approach, although more work is needed before moving to a large scale implementation for policy purposes."
D24|Border Regimes And Indirect Productivity Effects From Foreign Direct Investment|Supplying inputs to foreign affiliates is consistently found to be an important source of productivity gains for domestic firms. We analyse the impact of border regimes on the existence and size of cross-border indirect productivity effects, exploiting variation in the pace and extent of European integration of seven Central and Eastern European countries and their neighbours during the period 2000-2010. EU-membership is a necessary condition for positive cross-border indirect productivity effects through backward linkages. Schengen area participation further magnifies cross-border effects. Our results bear testimony to the successful EU integration of CEECs and warn about potential productivity costs to local firms should border restrictions be reinstated.
D24|Sources of Labor Productivity Growth in the German Brewing Industry|We decompose aggregate industry labor productivity growth into seven distinct components: input deepening, technical change, technical efficiency, scale effect, between-firm reallocation, effects from exits and entry. The first four components measure the productivity growth within a firm. The latter three components capture industry dynamics. Applied to a sample of 118 small and medium sized breweries in Germany over 13 years, we found that within-firm effects, in particular technical change and the scale effect, clearly dominated the effects from industry restructuring.

D24|Are small farms really more productive than large farms?|We revisit the long-standing empirical evidence of an inverse relationship between farm size and productivity using rich microdata from Uganda. We show that farm size is negatively related to yields (output per hectare), as commonly found in the literature, but positively related to farm productivity (a farm-specific component of total factor productivity). These conflicting results do not arise because of omitted variables such as land quality, measurement error in output or inputs, or specification issues. Instead, we reconcile the findings emphasizing the role of farm-specific distortions and returns to scale in traditional farm production. We exploit unique regional variation in land tenure regimes in Uganda in evaluating the role of farm-specific distortions. Our findings point to the limited value of yields (or land productivity) in establishing the farm size-productivity relationship. More generally, we demonstrate the limitation of using farm size in guiding policy applications.
D24|R&D Spillovers in Canadian Industry: Results from a New Micro Database|Business investment in research and development (R&D) makes a key contribution to rising living standards. Firms undertaking the R&D can reduce production costs and introduce new products that provide benefits to consumers that are not fully captured in selling prices. Further, it is very difficult for R&D-performing firms to prevent some of the knowledge created from leaking out or spilling over to other firms. Since firms do not take these positive spillover benefits into consideration when making investment decisions, most governments subsidize business investment in R&D with the expectation that economic performance will improve as a result. Our study confirms the existence of substantial spillover benefits from R&D performed in Canada, so government support for R&D is justified. However, we do not find any empirical evidence to support the current policy of subsidizing R&D at a higher rate when it is performed by small firms than when it is performed by large firms. We also find much lower private rate of return on R&D performed by small firms than by large firms. Subsidies appear to be playing a key role in this result
D24|Too Many Cooks Spoil the Broth: The Conflicting Impacts of Subsidies and Deposits on the Cost-Efficiency of Microfinance Institutions|The costs and benefits of subsidized microfinance are still a controversial topic. We evaluate how subsidies affect the cost-efficiency of microfinance institutions (MFIs). At the same time, we account for endogenous self-selection into the business models of credit-only versus credit-plus-deposit MFIs. Our findings draw a contrasting picture. First, they suggest that unsubsidized credit-plus-deposit MFIs have achieved optimal capacity and therefore constitute the most cost-efficient group of institutions in our sample. Second, the unsubsidized credit-only MFIs are the farthest away from their minimum cost. Between the two polar cases, there are subsidized institutions, among which the credit-only ones are closer to optimal capacity. Our results reveal the redundancy between subsidization and deposit-taking in microfinance. In conclusion, combining funds from donors and depositors tends to harm cost-efficiency.

D24|Benchmarking with uncertain data: a simulation study comparing alternative methods|We consider efficiency measurement methods in the presence of uncertain input and output data, and without the (empirically problematic) assumption of convexity of the production technology. In particular, we perform a simulation study in order to contrast two well-established methods, IDEA and Fuzzy DEA, with a recently suggested extension of Fuzzy DEA in the literature (dubbed the HB method). We demonstrate that the HB method has important advantages over the conventional methods, resulting in more accurate efficiency estimates and narrower bounds for the efficiency scores of individual Decision Making Units (DMUs): thereby providing more informative results that may lead to more effective decisions. The price is computational complexity. Although we show how to significantly speed up computational time compared to the original suggestion, the HB method remains the most computationally heavy method among those considered. This may limit the use of the method in cases where efficiency estimates have to be computed on the fly, as in interactive decision support systems based on large data sets.
D24|Estimating Stochastic Ray Production Frontiers|In this paper, we consider the stochastic ray production function that has been revived recently by Henningsen et al. (2017). We use a profit-maximizing framework to resolve endogeneity problems that are likely to arise, as in all distance functions, and we derive the system of equations after incorporating technical inefficiency. As technical inefficiency enters non-trivially into the system of equations and the Jacobian is highly complicated, we propose Monte Carlo methods of inference. We illustrate the new approach using US banking data and we also address the problems of missing prices and selection of ordering for outputs.
D24|Agglomeration economies and firm-level labor misallocation|A large portion of the productivity differentials among locations is related to density. Firms located in denser areas are more productive (Combes et al., 2012a, Econometrica, 80: 2543–2594). We show in this article that resource misallocation is lower in denser areas and argue that misallocation plays an important role in explaining the observed productivity premium of large cities. Using a methodology proposed by Petrin and Sivadasan (2013, Review of Economics and Statistics, 95: 286–301), we firstly assess the degree of resource misallocation among firms within sectors for each of the 348 French Employment Areas (commuting zones). Based on firm-level productivity estimates, we identify in the gap between the values of the marginal product and marginal input price the degree of input allocation at the firm level. Over the whole period 1994–2007, the average gap at firm level is 9.5 thousand euros. Secondly, we show that firm misallocation is lower in denser employment zones, suggesting that matching mechanisms on the labor market contribute to the productivity premium of agglomerated locations.
D24|Measuring ‘indirect’ investments in ICT in OECD countries| ICT components, such as microprocessors, may be embodied in other capital goods not recorded as ICT in National Accounts. We name ‘indirect ICT investment’ the value of embodied ICT components in non-ICT investment. The paper provides estimates of ‘indirect ICT investment’ based on detailed and unpublished Supply-Use tables (SUT) in 12 OECD countries: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.Our main finding is that ICT investment appears significantly higher when considering its indirect component, the average increase being about 35%. The inclusion of indirect ICT investment, excluding software (for which firms’ expenditures are difficult to measure), changes significantly the relative position of countries with respect to the ICT intensity of their investments. The inclusion of software further increases indirect ICT investment but the increase is smaller (in percentage) than without this inclusion. A final result, but concerning only three countries, it that the diagnosis of a stabilisation, or even a decrease, of ICT investment in percentage of GDP or of total investment, observed from the beginning of the century, is not modified if we take into account the indirect ICT investment.
D24|Investment climate, outward orientation and manufacturing firm productivity: new empirical evidence| Drawing on the World Bank Enterprise Surveys, we revisit the link between firm-level investment climate and productive performance for a panel of enterprises surveyed twice in time in 70 developing countries and 11 manufacturing industries. We take advantage of the time dimension available for an increasing number of countries to tackle the endogeneity issue stressed in previous studies. We also use pertinent econometric techniques to address other biases inherent in the data (e.g.measurement errors, missing observations and multicollinearity). Our results reinforce previous findings by validating, with a larger than usual sample of countries and industries, the importance of a larger set of environment variables. We show that infrastructure quality, information & communication technologies, skills and experience of the labour force, cost of and access to financing, security and political stability, competition and government relation contribute to firms’ and countries’ performances gap. The empirical analysis also illustrates that firms which choose an outward orientation have higher productivity level. Nevertheless, outward oriented enterprises are more sensitive to investment climate limitations. These findings have important policy implications by showing which dimensions of the business environment, in which industry, could help manufacturing firms to be more competitive in the present context of increasing globalization.
D24|Prevention or cure? Abatement efficiency in a network technology|We develop a network technology model for pollution abatement that distinguishes between the two primary forms that abatement can take: Prevention of emissions from occurring in the first place, and treatment of any emissions that are generated by the production process. Our network model separates the production process into two stages, an initial production and prevention stage and a final treatment (or cure) stage. We allow for reallocation of abatement resources across the production stages, in order to improve overall abatement and production efficiency and better understand the tradeoffs between the two forms of abatement. This framework is relevant in practice for a number of industrial production processes, including manufacturing and energy, which employ multiple abatement measures at different stages of production. To illustrate, we apply the prevention-treatment network model to estimate the production and abatement technology for firms in Sweden’s pulp and paper manufacturing sector. We find that with reallocation of prevention and treatment resources, the industry could achieve further gains to both production and emissions reductions, relative to those estimated using the more common single-stage approach to technology estimation for pollution-generating processes. In practice, these results could be used by producers for improving managerial efficiency, and by policy makers to better target abatement incentives to the most effective aspects of production.
D24|Efficient and sustainable bioenergy production in Swedish forests – a network DEA approach|Forest fuel defined as branches and tops (GROT) of harvested trees represents a large share of forest biomass and is increasingly viewed as a potential energy source. This study assesses the economic potentials of forest bioenergy production in Swedish forests, using a network data envelopment analysis (DEA) model to estimate the technology for biofuel and other forest products. We consider that forests are managed to use multiple inputs to produce multiple outputs. Outputs include sawtimber, pulpwood, fuelwood, and bioenergy in terms of GROT. Our model also considers environmental concerns over biodiversity and CO2 emissions from burning biomass. We apply the network DEA model to measure the revenue efficiency of forest production of Swedish forests using a panel consisting of 20 counties and covering the years from 2008 to 2014. Our results show that there exist persistent economic inefficiencies of forest production in some counties, reducing the overall efficiency of Sweden’s forest and wood products industry. In addition, we also estimate the potential increase in bioenergy, deadwood and CO2 emissions reduction from combustion of bioenergy and by-products from sawtimber and pulpwood.

D24|Innovation, Productivity, and Spillovers Effects: Evidence from Chile|This paper estimates the direct and spillover effects of two matching grants schemes designed to promote firm-level research and development (R&D) investment in Chile on firm productivity. Because the two programs target different kinds of projects—the National Productivity and Technological Development Fund (FONTEC) subsidizes intramural R&D, while the Science and Technology Development Fund (FONDEF) finances extramural R&D carried out in collaboration with research institutes—analyzing their effects can shed light on the process of knowledge creation and diffusion. The paper applies fixed-effects techniques to a novel dataset that merges several waves of Chile’s National Manufacturing Surveys collected by the National Institute of Statistics with register data on the beneficiaries of both programs. The results suggest that while both programs have had a positive impact on participants’ productivity, only FONDEF-funded projects have generated positive spillovers on firms’ productivity. The analysis reveals that the spillover effects on productivity display an inverted-U relationship with the intensity of public support. Spillover effects were found to occur only if firms were both geographically and technologically close.
D24|The impact of public R&D support on firms' patenting|We examine the impact of both R&D tax credits and direct R&D subsidies on Norwegian firms' patenting. Whereas direct subsidies are aimed at projects with low private and high social return, tax credits do not discriminate between projects or technologies. We find that both direct subsidies and tax credits have significant positive effects on patenting. However, the magnitude of the effects depend critically on the firms' pre-treatment characteristics. In particular, the statistically significant estimates are all related to firms with no patent applications prior to obtaining support. Moreover, we estimate that direct subsidies have triggered at least three times as many granted patents per NOK million of support compared to tax credits. Our results suggest that R&D support should be directed to promote innovations at the extensive margin, i.e. to firms with a high potential of becoming innovative rather than to firms with a record of being innovative. Moreover, as targeted subsidies generate more innovations, society would benefit from distributing more of the subsidies to priority areas.
D24|Supermodular correspondences and comparison of multi-prior beliefs|Economic decisions often involve maximising an objective whose value is itself the outcome of another optimisation problem. This decision structure arises in multi-output production and choice under uncertainty with multi-prior beliefs. To analyse comparative statics in these models, we introduce a theory of Supermodular correspondences. In particular, we employ this theory to generalise the notion of first order stochastic dominance to multi-prior beliefs, allowing us to characterise conditions under which greater optimism leads to higher action.
D24|Exports, Imported Inputs, and Domestic Supply Networks|Exporters have large domestic supply networks. We examine the impact of import reliance within their domestic supply networks on exchange rate pass-through to export prices and volume. For identification, we use administrative firm-to-firm sales and firm-product-destination level customs databases from a large emerging market, Turkey. We find that (i) while exporters' degree of reliance on imported goods is 24\%, this number reaches nearly 45\% once their suppliers are taken into account; (ii) following a domestic currency depreciation, exporters that use imported inputs more or those working with import-intensive suppliers raise their producer-currency export prices significantly more and increase their export volumes significantly less; (iii) exporters with higher reliance on a single supplier have higher exchange rate pass-through to export prices; and (iv) exporters with higher overall import intensity experience greater disruption in their supply networks, e.g., they establish fewer new supplier linkages and terminate more of their existing linkages, following a domestic currency depreciation.
D24|Two and a Half Million Syrian Refugees, Tasks and Capital Intensity|We investigate how the rapid increase in the low-skilled labor supply induced by the inflow of 2.5 million Syrian refugees changed the tasks performed by native workers and the capital intensity of firms in Turkey. We use both survey and administrative data to estimate the effects. The results based on the Labor Force Survey suggest that the inflow of refugees increased natives’ task complexity, reducing the intensity of manual tasks, and raising the intensity of abstract tasks. This effect is driven by highly educated and young natives. Exploiting the administrative firm data that contains the entirety of firms in the country, we find that manufacturing firms reduced their capital intensity and investments. Reduction in capital intensity and investment is largely driven by smaller sized firms. We conclude that tasks provided by Syrian refugees are substitutes for manual tasks and capital inputs in production, and complements to more complex tasks.
D24|Ownership and Productivity in Vertically-Integrated Firms: Evidence from the Chinese Steel Industry|We study productivity differences in vertically-integrated Chinese steel facilities using a unique data set that provides equipment-level information on material inputs and output in physical units and equipment size for each of the three main stages in the steel value chain, i.e., sintering, pig-iron making, and steel making. We find that private vertically-integrated facilities are more productive than provincial state-owned (SOEs) facilities, followed by central SOEs. This ranking lines up with our productivity estimates in the two downstream production stages, but central SOEs outperform in sintering, most likely because of their superior access to higher quality raw materials. The productivity differential favoring private facilities declines with their size, turning negative for facilities larger than the median. These patterns are linked with equipment-level TFP in private firms as size expands, and the internal configuration of vertically-integrated facilities, which reflect the greater constraints facing private firms. Increasing returns to scale at the stage and facility-level partially offset these costs and rationalize firms' choice on larger vertically-integrated facilities.
D24|Are Small Farms Really more Productive than Large Farms?|We revisit the long-standing empirical evidence of an inverse relationship between farm size and productivity using rich micro data from Uganda. We show that farm size is nega- tively related with yields (output per hectare), as commonly found in the literature, but positively related with farm productivity (a farm-specific component of total factor pro- ductivity). These conflicting results do not arise because of omitted variables such as land quality, measurement error in output or inputs, or specification issues. Instead, we reconcile the findings emphasizing decreasing returns to scale in farm production and farm-specific distortions. We exploit regional variation in land tenure regimes in Uganda in evaluating the role of farm-specific distortions. Our findings point to the limited value of yields (or land productivity) in establishing the size-productivity relationship. More generally, we highlight farm size as an ineffective instrument for policy implementation since size is deeply con- founded by distortions in developing countries.
D24|Productivity Indexes and National Statistics: Theory, Methods and Challenges|This paper reviews the theory underlying the index number approaches used by National Statistical Offices in the construction of productivity indexes. It reviews approaches for measuring output, labour and capital, and highlights persistent and emerging measurement problems.
D24|Money and the Measurement of Total Factor Productivity|Firms have greatly increased their cash holdings since the mid-1990s. These holdings have an opportunity cost; i.e., allocating firm financial capital into monetary deposits means that investment in real assets is reduced. Traditional measures of Total Factor Productivity (TFP) do not take into account these holdings of monetary assets. Given the recent large increases in these holdings in the U.S. and other advanced economies, it is expected that adding these monetary assets to the list of traditional sources of capital services will reduce the TFP of the business sector. We measure this effect for the U.S. corporate and non-corporate business sectors.
D24|Is Public Sector Performance just a matter of money? The case of the Spanish regional governments|Efficient use of public resources is clearly a relevant issue to be studied from several points of view. Among others, it accounts for a significant share of the total economy activity and it deals with non market oriented activities. In Spain, the regional level is particularly relevant due to the progressive decentralization during the 200s of key public policies constituting the welfare state (as education, health, etc.). Consequently,it increased notably their financing needs but affecting asymmetrically because of the important differences in their fiscal capacity. Moreover, they mostly share (15 of 17) a common financing system in which an efficient use of resources is assumed but not evaluated. Our results show that normally a few of the regions tend to be the top performers, but there no regions performing poorly in every aspect. It is also worth noting that no dramatic changes can be seen in terms both of expenditure and performance during the recent Great Recession.
D24|Nonparametric Measurement of Potential Gains from Mergers: An Additive Decomposition and Application to Indian Bank Mergers|One of the main incentives for voluntary merger between firms in the same industry is the potential gain in the form of lower cost of producing the combined output of the merging firms. Baumol, Panzar, and Willig (1982) showed that subadditivity of the cost function at the combined output level is a precondition for positive cost gains from a merger. In this paper we build on their theoretical model to derive conditions for potential gains from merger in a short run cost framework where not only the outputs but also the fixed inputs of the merging firms are aggregated through merger. We show that subadditivity of the short run ray total cost curve of the merged firm at the combined output bundle is neither necessary nor sufficient for positive gains from merger. We also provide a decomposition of the potential gain from merger into three components related to convexity of the technology, subadditivity of the short run ray total cost, and decrease in the variable cost due to an aggregation of the fixed inputs. Appropriate linear programming models are formulated for measuring the gain from merger and its components using the nonparametric method of Data Envelopment Analysis. We use data for a number of recent mergers of Indian banks in an empirical application of our proposed models.
D24|Revisando el rol de los productos intermedios importados en la productividad: un análisis a nivel de empresa para Uruguay|International trade is considered a vehicle for technology diffusion, which in turn can induce productivity growth. Particularly, imports may give domestic firms access to a larger variety and/or better quality of intermediate or capital inputs in which new technologies are embodied. However, the lack of sufficiently skilled labor, an issue especially relevant for small developing countries, may prevent firms from taking advantage of these technologies. Using a panel of Uruguayan manufacturing firms for the period 1997-2008, we explore the impact of imported inputs on firms’ productivity and evaluate whether the effect is mediated by the firm’s absorptive capacity, proxied by the proportion of skilled labor. We use two alternative approaches. Firstly, we apply a two-stage approach by first estimating firms’ productivity and then using impact evaluation techniques to analyze causality between imported inputs and productivity. Secondly, we use a direct approach, estimating TFP with imported inputs as a state variable. Our results show that imported intermediates have an enhancing effect on Uruguayan firms’ productivity, and that absorptive capacity plays an important role on this effect.
D24|R&D, innovation and productivity|This paper reviews various technological indicators from innovation inputs to innovation outputs, pointing out their strengths and weaknesses and the consequent caution that is in order when using these data for economic analysis. It briefly explains the theoretical link between innovation and productivity growth and then compares the estimated magnitudes of that relationship using the different innovation indicators.
D24|Dynamic Productivity Decomposition with Allocative Efficiency|We propose a novel approach to decomposing aggregate productivity growth into changes in technical efficiency, allocative efficiency, and variety of goods as well as relative efficiency of entrants and exiters. We measure technical efficiency by the aggregate production possibility frontier and allocative efficiency by the distance from the frontier. Applying our approach to establishment- and firm-level datasets from Japan, we find that the allocative efficiency among survivors declined during the banking crisis period, while the technical efficiency declined during the Global Financial Crisis period. Furthermore, we find that both entrants and exiters were likely to be more efficient than survivors.
D24|Identifying Sri Lanka’s Sources of Growth: The Application of Primal and Dual Total Factor Productivity Growth Accounting Approaches|This study aims to identify how much of economic growth is driven by improvement in Total Factor Productivity (TFP) in Sri Lanka, a small open economy, in comparison to other Asian economies. To examine this, aggregate TFP growth was calculated for Sri Lanka by using both primal and dual growth accounting frameworks. The study covers the period 1980-2016 and eight sub-periods, classified according to distinctive socio-economic-politico changes. For the whole period, TFP growth accounts for 45 percent of the total output growth. The annual average TFP growth rates under the primal and dual approaches are 2.3 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively. Though the growth accounting framework has limitations, the results were robust enough to draw comparative conclusions with those of other Asian countries. Sri Lanka’s TFP growth under both methods has been positive and higher than some Asian countries, except for China. Further, though Indonesia and Sri Lanka have similar per capita GDP levels, Sri Lanka’s TFP growth has been higher than that of Indonesia. Additionally, we show that the two growth drivers in Sri Lanka have been capital accumulation and productivity growth.

Among the different sectors, we find that the information and communication sector is the most adversely affected by space weather.
D24|Death to the Cobb-Douglas Production Function? A Quantitative Survey of the Capital-Labor Substitution Elasticity|We show that the large elasticity of substitution between capital and labor estimated in the literature on average, 0.9, can be explained by three factors: publication bias, use of aggregated data, and omission of the first-order condition for capital. The mean elasticity conditional on the absence of publication bias, disaggregated data, and inclusion of information from the first-order condition for capital is 0.3. To obtain this result, we collect 3,186 estimates of the elasticity reported in 121 studies, codify 71 variables that reflect the context in which researchers produce their estimates, and address model uncertainty by Bayesian and frequentist model averaging. We employ nonlinear techniques to correct for publication bias, which is responsible for at least half of the overall reduction in the mean elasticity from 0.9 to 0.3. Our findings also suggest that a failure to normalize the production function leads to a substantial upward bias in the estimated elasticity. The weight of evidence accumulated in the empirical literature emphatically rejects the Cobb-Douglas specification.
D24|Labour market power and the distorting effects of international trade|This article examines how trade shocks shape labour market imperfections that create market power in labour markets and prevent an efficient allocation of labour. I develop a framework for measuring such labor market distortions in monetary terms and document large degrees of those distortions in Germany's manufacturing sector. Import competition can only exert labor market disciplining effects when firms rather than workers have labour market power. Otherwise, export demand and import competition shocks tend to fortify existing distortions by amplifying labour market power structures. This diminishes the gains from trade compared to a model with perfectly competitive labour markets.
D24|Micro-mechanisms behind declining labour shares: Market power, production processes, and global competition|This article investigates how changing production processes and increasing market power at the firm level relate to a fall in Germany's manufacturing sector labour share. Coinciding with the fall of the labour share, I document a rise in firms' product and labour market power. Notably, labour market power is a more relevant source of firms' market power than product market power. Increasing product and labour market power, however, only account for 30% of the fall in the labour share. The remaining 70% are explained by a transition of firms towards less labour-intensive production activities. I study the role of final product trade in causing those secular movements. I find that rising foreign export demand contributes to a decline in the labour share by increasing labour market power within firms and by inducing a reallocation of economic activity from nonexporting-high-labour-share to exporting-low-labour-share firms.
D24|What Determines the Elasticity of Substitution between Capital and Labor? A Literature Review|This paper provides the first comprehensive review of the empirical and theoretical literature on the determinants of the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor. Our focus is on the two-input constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production function. By example of the U.S., we highlight the distinctive heterogeneity in empirical estimates of σ at both the aggregate and industrial level and discuss potential methodological explanations for this variation. The main part of this survey then focuses on the determinants of σ. We first review several approaches to the microfoundation of production functions, especially the CES production function. Second, we outline the construction of an aggregate elasticity of substitution (AES) in a multi-sectoral framework and investigate its dependence on underlying sectoral elasticities. Third, we discuss the influence of the institutional framework on the determination of σ. The concluding section of this review identifies a number of potential empirical and theoretical avenues for future research. Overall, we demonstrate that the effective elasticity of substitution (EES), which is typically estimated in empirical studies, is generally not an immutable deep parameter but depends on a multitude of technological, non-technological and institutional determinants.

D24|Do high‐quality local institutions shape labour productivity in Western European manufacturing firms?|We investigate the extent to which regional institutional quality shapes firm labour productivity in Western Europe, using a sample of manufacturing firms from Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Spain, observed over the period 2009–2014. The results indicate that regional institutional quality positively affects firms' labour productivity and that government effectiveness is the most important institutional determinant of productivity levels. However, how institutions shape labour productivity depends on the type of firm considered. Smaller, less capital endowed and high‐tech sectors are three of the types of firms whose productivity is most favourably affected by good and effective institutions at the regional level. Se investiga en qué medida la calidad institucional regional determina la productividad laboral de las empresas en Europa Occidental, para lo cual se utiliza una muestra de empresas manufactureras de Alemania, Austria, Bélgica, España, Francia, Italia y Portugal, observadas durante el período 2009–2014. Los resultados indican que la calidad institucional regional afecta positivamente la productividad laboral de las empresas y que la efectividad del gobierno es el determinante institucional más importante de los niveles de productividad. Sin embargo, la forma en que las instituciones determinan la productividad laboral depende del tipo de empresa considerada. Los sectores más pequeños, los menos dotados de capital y los de alta tecnología son tres de los tipos de empresas cuya productividad se ve afectada de manera más favorable por instituciones buenas y eficaces a nivel regional. 本稿では、オーストリア、ベルギー、フランス、ドイツ、イタリア、ポルトガル、スペインの製造業企業のサンプルデータを用いて、2009~2014年の間の西欧の企業の労働生産性は、どの程度、地方制度の質により決定されたのかを検討する。結果は、地方制度の質は企業の労働生産性に正の影響を与えること、生産性のレベルを決める制度的決定要因の中では政府の効率性 (government effectiveness)が最も重要であることを示している。しかし、制度がどのように労働生産性を決めるのかは企業のタイプに依存する。小規模、小資本、ハイテク、以上の3つのタイプのセクターの生産性が、地域レベルで優良かつ効率的な制度から最も好ましい影響を受けている。
D24|Investing in agriculture when it is worth it. Evidence from rural Uganda|One of the reasons for the persistent low agricultural productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa is the lack of adoption of pro table agricultural technologies. Yet, what is pro table in a controlled experimental setting may not be pro table in a real-world setting. Estimating the returns to a single input is, in fact, challenging as farmers may respond to adoption by re-optimizing the use of other inputs. This paper explores farmers behavioral response to a positive random shock on future productivity by disentangling inputs returns from farmers' response. Using a unique household panel dataset collected in rural Uganda, I proxy a future productivity shock with the birth of a female calf against that of a male calf. Calves have no technical returns, but female calves will become cows producing milk, providing a stable source of income, while bulls and oxen are of little use in this context. The main OLS and di erence-in-di erences results show the existence of a crowd-in e ect. Farmers react to the birth of a female calf by increasing inputs' expenditures. They invest more on their cattle's health, increase hired labor and are more willing to pay for cattle-related investments but not for other activities. This increase in investments leads to an increase in milk production and revenues that lasts over time. Further results show that economies of scale associated with the number of female animals seem to explain this behavioral response.
D24|What determines the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor? A literature review|This paper reviews the status quo of the empirical and theoretical literature on the determinants of the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor. Our focus is on the two-input constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production function.

D24|Agglomeration Economies and the Firm TFP: Different Effects across Industries|This paper analyzes the effect of agglomeration economies on firms’ total factor productivity. We propose the use of a control function approach to overcome the econometric issue inherent to the two-stage approach commonly used in the literature. Estimations are conducted separately for four industry groups, defined by technological intensity, to allow for non-uniform effects of agglomeration economies on firms given their technological level. In addition, R&D is included to account for the firms’ own efforts to foster productivity through creating and absorbing knowledge. Finally, radii as well as administrative boundaries are used for defining regions. The results confirm differences in the strength and even in the direction of agglomeration economies: While urban economies have the largest effect on TFP for firms in high-tech industries, they have no effect on TFP in low-tech industries. For firms in the latter industries, however, the variety of the local economic structure has an impact, while this is irrelevant for the TFP of firms in high-tech industries. Only localization economies have a positive and significant effect on TFP throughout, but the effect increases with technological intensity of industries. Throughout, R&D is also found to have a positive effect that increases with technological intensity.
D24|Measuring trends and persistence in capital and labor misallocation|We analyze trends and persistence in the misallocation of labor and capital using firm-level panel data for the Netherlands in the period 2001-2017. We use the dispersion in marginal revenue products of labor and capital to measure the extent of misallocation. Compared to a counterfactual efficient allocation we find that misallocation has had a sizable negative impact on aggregate productivity. Especially capital misallocation has increased over time. The relatively high and rising capital misallocation is caused by a combination of small, highly productive firms facing relatively high capital wedges and large and unproductive firms facing relatively low capital wedges. Exploiting a panel data error components model we find that capital misallocation has a much more permanent character than labor misallocation. Moreover, it is the permanent component of capital misallocation that has increased over time. Finally, we show that in our sample the measurement of misallocation is largely insensitive to capital adjustment costs and alternative specifications of the production function. The contribution of heterogeneous markups to observed misallocation, however, is non-negligible.
D24|When losses turn into loans: the cost of undercapitalized banks|We provide evidence that a weak banking sector has contributed to low productivity growth following the European sovereign debt crisis. An unexpected increase in capital requirements for a subset of Portuguese banks in 2011 provides a natural experiment to study the effects of reduced bank capital adequacy on productivity. Affected banks respond not only by cutting back on lending but also by reallocating credit to firms in financial distress with prior underreported loan loss provisioning. We develop a method to detect when banks delay loss reporting using detailed loan-level data. We then show that the credit reallocation leads to a reallocation of production factors across rms. A partial equilibrium exercise suggests that the resulting increase in factor misallocation accounts for 20% of the decline in productivity in Portugal in 2012.

D24|Breaking the Shackles: Zombie Firms, Weak Banks and Depressed Restructuring in Europe|This paper explores the connection between “zombie” firms (firms that would typically exit in a competitive market) and bank health and the consequences for aggregate productivity in 11 European countries. Controlling for cyclical effects, the results show that zombie firms are more likely to be connected to weak banks, suggesting that the zombie firm problem in Europe may at least partly stem from bank forbearance. The increasing survival of zombie firms congests markets and constrains the growth of more productive firms, to the detriment of aggregate productivity growth. Our results suggest that around one-third of the impact of zombie congestion on capital misallocation could be directly attributed to bank health and additional analysis suggests that this may partly be due to reduced availability of credit to healthy firms. Finally, improvements in bank health are more likely to be associated with a reduction in the prevalence of zombie firms in countries where insolvency regimes do not unduly inhibit corporate restructuring. Thus, leveraging the important complementarities between bank strengthening efforts and insolvency regime reform would contribute to breaking the shackles on potential growth in Europe.
D24|The cost-efficiency and productivity growth of euro area banks|We use an industrial organisation approach to quantify the size of Total Factor Productivity Growth (TFPG) for euro area banks after the crisis and decompose it into its main driving factors. In addition, we disentangle permanent and time-varying inefficiency in the banking sector. This is important because lack of distinction may lead to biased estimates of inefficiency and because the set of policies needed in both cases is different. We focus on 17 euro area countries over the period 2006 to 2017. We find that cost efficiency in the euro area banking sector amounted to around 84% on average over the 2006 to 2017 period. In addition, we observe that Total Factor Productivity growth for the median euro area bank decreased from around 2% in 2007 to around 1% in 2017, with technological progress being the largest contributor, followed by technical efficiency. Given the need to boost productivity and enhance profitability in the euro area banking sector, these findings suggests that bank’s efforts in areas such as rationalisation of branches, digitalisation of business processes and possibly mergers and acquisitions should be intensified.

D24|Trading activities, productivity and markups: evidence for spanish manufacturing|This work analyses the firms’ internationalization strategies of importing intermediates and exporting output, and the potential rewards of these activities in terms of total factor productivity (TFP), as a proxy for marginal costs, and markups. It further deepens into the study of the relationship between internationalization strategies and markups by disentangling whether it operates through affecting firms’ marginal costs and/or firms’ prices. The panel database employed in this paper is the Spanish Survey on Business Strategies (ESEE) for the period 2006- 2014. Results in the paper distinguish between SMEs and large firms and indicate that there is high persistence in the performance of these activities and in firms’ TFP and markups. In addition, the internationalization strategies are especially relevant for SMEs, as for this group we obtain rewards of the two activities in terms of both TFP and markups. Furthermore, we also find that these strategies allow SMEs to charge higher output prices.
D24|Agriculture productivity gains and their distribution for the main EU members|This article seeks to highlight the performance of the farm sector in the main EU countries. Based on the productivity surplus account method (PSAM), our performance analysis includes all elements of the profit and loss account, which is one of the limits of the traditional index number approach. Moreover, this method also shows the way in which productivity gains observed in each country have been distributed among the main stakeholders. A specific focus is on the state’s as well as the farmers’ roles in this distribution game.
D24|Efficiency of the European banks in the aftermath of the financial crisis: A panel stochastic frontier approach|Using panel estimates and Stochastic Frontier Analysis this paper aims to contribute to the analysis of bank efficiency of the European banks in the aftermath of the international financial crisis and the sovereign crisis that seriously affected many EU countries. It also considershypothetical scenarios of exit from the EU of some of the particularly relevant member-states, including the Brexit scenario. The results obtained very clearly demonstrate the existence of statistically significant technical inefficiencies in all considered scenarios. Nevertheless, the results reveal that the exclusion of the Italian banks and of the UK banks from our estimates would be more beneficial to the decrease of the banks’ cost inefficiencies than the exclusion of the French and the German banks. Moreover, the worst scenario in terms of the decrease of the EU banks’ cost inefficiencies would be the exclusion of the banks from the five EU countries that were deeply affected by the international financial and sovereign crises and were obliged to restructure their bank systems, that is, Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain.
D24|Effects of Electrification on the Production and Distribution in the Coal Industry: Evidence from 1900s Japan|This paper studies how electrification affected the economic performance and industrial relations of the Japanese coal mining industry in the 1900s. We find that electrification considerably improved productivity and increased the number of workers, but had statistically zero effects on minersâ€™ wages and significantly declined the labor income share, using difference-in-differences estimation. We explain this phenomenon by using the â€œsuperstar firmâ€ hypothesis, which provides a consistent explanation of the recent declines in labor income share in the US economy.
D24|Spillovers and substitutability in production|Can the existence of positive productivity spillovers between co-workers be explained by the presence of complementarities in a firmâ€™s production function? A simple model demonstrates that this is possible when workers perform their tasks sequentially and part of individuals' pay is determined by the firm's output, but also that negative spillovers may arise when workers can raise overall output unilaterally. Data from major league baseball support these predictions. They show that the pairs of players who are most complementary in the production process exert the largest positive spillovers on each other, but that negative spillovers predominate between all player pairs.
D24|Skill Complementarity in Production Technology: New Empirical Evidence and Implications|"Matched worker-firm data from Danish manufacturing reveal that 1) industries differ in within-firm worker skill dispersion, and 2) the correlation between within-firm skill dispersion and productivity is positive in industries with higher average skill dispersion. We argue that these patterns are a manifestation of technological differences across industries: firms in the ""skill complementarity"" industries profit from hiring workers of similar skill level, whereas firms in the ""skill substitutability"" industries benefit from hiring workers of different skill levels. An empirical method we devise produces a robust classification of industries into the distinct complementarity and substitutability groups. Our study unveils hitherto unnoticed technological heterogeneity between industries within the same economy, and demonstrates its importance. Specifically, we show through simulations on a simple general equilibrium model that failing to take technological heterogeneity into account results in large prediction errors."
D24|Creative Destruction, Social Security Uptake and Union Networks|Does the creative destruction induced by unions entail increased social security uptake? Creative destruction implies the closures of less productive workplaces, and if the regional benefits from this process is not large enough, the displacements caused by workplace closures cause increased social security uptake. In this paper we apply a shift-share approach and historical unionisation data from 1918 to study the impact of regional unionisation changes in Norway on regional social security uptake during the period 2003-2012. As regional unionisation increases, inflows to regional unemployment and disability decrease, but the outflow to retirement increases.
D24|Linguistic Diversity and Workplace Productivity|We study the importance of linguistic diversity in the workplace for workplace productivity. While cultural diversity might improve productivity through new ideas and innovation, linguistic diversity might increase communication costs and thereby reduce productivity. We apply a new measure of languages' linguistic proximity to Norwegian linked employer-employee Manufacturing data from 2003-12, and find that higher workforce linguistic diversity decreases productivity. We find a negative effect also when we take into account the impact of cultural diversity. As expected proficiency in Norwegian of foreign workers improves since their time of arrival in Norway, the detrimental impact disappears.
D24|How innovation affects performance|This paper studies how innovation strategies of Russian manufacturing firms affect various features of firm performance. A multi stage model is used, which relates the firm's decision to undertake R&D to its innovation output, technical efficiency, labor productivity, and growth. We also include imports into the knowledge production function, because catching up economies may adopt technologies embodied in imported hardware. Additionally, we link productivity and innovation output to survival. We find that both types of knowledge input - R&D and imports - strongly determine innovation. Innovations yield the strongest performance return in the case of catching up to technological frontier. Product innovation is more beneficial than process innovation in all performance features except for labor productivity. However, higher efficiency does not improve the growth rates or survival time of manufacturing firms. Taken together, these results show that innovation is not uniformly rewarded across all features of firm performance.
D24|Intersectoral Network-Based Channel of Aggregate TFP Shocks|This study investigates the role of intersectoral networks in the transmission of aggregate technology shocks to sectors’ growth. First, we develop a theoretical model to obtain insights into the propagation of shocks through input-output linkages, which suggests that the network effect arises via sectoral downstream linkages. We then quantitatively assess this theoretical implication with US manufacturing industries, where the aggregate technology shocks are derived from a dynamic factor model. We find that aggregate technology shocks lead to an increase in the output growth of the sector, both directly and indirectly via its intersectoral linkages. More interestingly, we document a crucial role of the intersectoral network channel, which contributes about 50 percent of the total effect. In addition, the network-based effect comes mostly from downstream linkages of sectors, which is broadly consistent with theory.
D24|Direct and Network Effects of Idiosyncratic TFP Shocks|This study investigates the direct and intersectoral network effects of idiosyncratic TFP shocks on sectors’ growth in the context of US manufacturing industries. To deal with the potential endogeneity of TFP, we propose a novel set of instruments for contemporaneous regressors. These instruments are technology shocks identiﬁed via sign restriction from sectoral SVAR models. Using US input-output tables and industry-level data, we quantify direct and network-based effects of the shocks. Our results show that idiosyncratic technology shocks propagate mostly downstream the network. In addition, we capture strong contemporaneous direct effects of the shocks.
D24|The Impact of Intellectual Property Rights on Labor Productivity: Do Constitutions Matter?|Focusing on 22 OECD countries we estimate the impact of constitutional provisions and of lower-rank norms aimed at protecting intellectual property rights (IPR) on labor productivity at industry level. Our analysis allows us to answer the following questions: Are IPR more likely to be enforced if they are envisaged in the constitution rather than provided for in ordinary legislation? And if constitutional protection implies an accrued defense or enforcement of those principles, is this difference relevant enough to translate into a higher impact on firms’ outcome? By using IV techniques and controlling for a full set of year-, industry- and country fixed effects (and their interactions), we show that constitutional provisions protecting IPR positively affect the differential in labor productivity between high and low R&D intensive sectors. This effect is driven by the impact of IPR protection on R&D investment of the highly innovative sectors. Our results hold after controlling for lower-rank norms. Furthermore, the interaction between constitutional norms and lower legislation is negative, suggesting that the two are substitutes: the impact of constitutions is stronger in those countries where IPR protection by lower norms is weaker. On turn, in those countries where IPR are protected by constitutional norms, lower norms do not have a significant effect on the productivity of high R&D intensive sectors.
D24|Competition and productivity: Do commonly used metrics suggest a relationship?|We demonstrate the power of recently redeveloped productivity microdata to produce a range of meaningful competition indicators highlighting different aspects of industry competitiveness. Combining these competition metrics into composite indicators, we summarise the diverse range of competitive environments in New Zealand by clustering industries into four distinct groups. Estimating the relationship between competition and productivity within these groups provides some suggestive results that the tail of unproductive firms may be truncated when competition is greater, in part due to greater selection-to-exit based on productivity. Overall, the limited evidence we find for a direct relationship between competition and productivity does not necessarily imply that the two are unrelated, but more likely reflects that changes in competition in New Zealand over the sample period have not been particularly pronounced, making it difficult to identify a systematic relationship.
D24|Capacity Constraints and the Provision of Public Services: The Case of Workers in Public Health Clinics|Unlike in the production of most goods, changes in capacity for labor-intensive services only affect outcomes of interest insofar as service providers change the way they allocate their time in response to those capacity changes. In this paper, we examine how public sector service providers respond to unexpected capacity constraints in the specific context of public health clinics. We exploit an exogenous reduction in public health clinic capacity to quantify nurses' trade-off between patients treated and time spent with each patient, which we treat as a proxy for a quality v. quantity decision. We provide evidence that these small and generally insignificant effects on nurse time favor public sector employees prioritizing quality of each interaction over clearing the patient queue.
D24|Managerial Quality and Productivity Dynamics|Which managerial skills, traits, and practices matter most for productivity? How does the observability of these features affect how appropriately they are priced into wages? Combining two years of daily, line-level production data from a large Indian garment firm with rich survey data on line managers, we find that several key dimensions of managerial quality, like attention, autonomy, and control, are important for learning-by-doing as well as for overall productivity, but are not commensurately rewarded in pay. Counterfactual simulations of our structural model show large gains from screening potential hires via psychometric measurement and training to improve managerial practices.
D24|From Good to Bad Concentration? U.S. Industries over the Past 30 Years|We study the evolution of profits, investment and market shares in US industries over the past 40 years. During the 1990’s, and at low levels of initial concentration, we find evidence of efficient concentration driven by tougher price competition, intangible investment, and increasing productivity of leaders. After 2000, however, the evidence suggests inefficient concentration, decreasing competition and increasing barriers to entry, as leaders become more entrenched and concentration is associated with lower investment, higher prices and lower productivity growth.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D24|Digitalisation and productivity: In search of the holy grail – Firm-level empirical evidence from EU countries|This paper assesses how the adoption of a range of digital technologies affects firm productivity. It combines cross-country firm-level data on productivity and industry-level data on digital technology adoption in an empirical framework that accounts for firm heterogeneity. The results provide robust evidence that digital adoption in an industry is associated to productivity gains at the firm level. Effects are relatively stronger in manufacturing and routine-intensive activities. They also tend to be stronger for more productive firms and weaker in presence of skill shortages, which may relate to the complementarities between digital technologies and other forms of capital (e.g. skills, organisation, or intangibles). As a result, digital technologies may have contributed to the growing dispersion in productivity performance across firms. Hence, policies to support digital adoption should go hand in hand with creating the conditions to enable the catch-up of lagging firms, notably by easing access to skills.
D24|Like it or not? The impact of online platforms on the productivity of incumbent service providers|This paper uses a novel empirical approach to assess if the development of online platforms affects the productivity of service firms. We build a proxy measure of platform use across four industries (hotels, restaurants, taxis and retail trade) and ten OECD countries using internet search data from Google Trends, which we link to firm-level data on productivity in these industries. We find that platform development supports the productivity of the average incumbent service firm and also stimulates labour reallocation towards more productive firms in these industries. This may notably reflect that platforms’ user review and rating systems reduce information asymmetries between consumers and service providers, enhancing competition between providers. The effects depend on platform type. “Aggregator” platforms that connect incumbent service providers to consumers tend to push up the productivity of incumbents, while more disruptive platforms that enable new types of providers to compete with them (e.g. home sharing, ride hailing) have on average no significant effect on it. Consistent with this, we find that different platform types affect differently the profits, mark-ups, employment and wages of incumbent service firms. Finally, the productivity gains from platforms are lower when a platform is persistently dominant on its market, suggesting that the contestability of platform markets should be promoted.
D24|Reducing regional disparities for inclusive growth in Spain|Spain is a highly decentralised country, making the effective implementation of national reforms dependent on regional policies. Some regional disparities are high and need to be reduced. High regional dispersion in education and job outcomes, compounded by low inter-regional mobility, emerge as key drivers of regional inequalities in income and wellbeing. Lifelong learning programmes that take into account regional specific needs would help foster regional skills and attract firms to lagging regions. Ensuring full portability of social and housing benefits across regions, by providing temporary assistance either by the region of origin or the central government, would improve inter-regional mobility. At the same time, barriers to achieving a truly single market limit productivity growth of regions, including the most advanced. Reducing regulatory barriers and better innovation policies would boost productivity. Effective intergovernmental coordination bodies and a well designed interregional fiscal equalisation system will be key to ensuring that regions have the incentives to implement policies for inclusive growth.
D24|Digital Dividend: Policies to Harness the Productivity Potential of Digital Technologies|This paper presents a range of policies to enhance adoption of digital technologies and firm productivity. It quantifies illustratively the effect of policy changes by combining the results of two recent OECD analyses on the drivers of adoption and their productivity benefits. Increasing access to high-speed internet, upgrading technical and managerial skills and implementing product and labour market reforms to facilitate the reallocation of resources in the economy are found to be the main factors supporting the efficient adoption of a selection of digital technologies. The most productive firms have benefitted relatively more from digitalisation in the past, contributing to a widening productivity gap with less productive firms. Policies should create the conditions for efficient adoption by less productive firms, which would help them to catch up, achieving a double dividend in terms of growth and inclusiveness. Enhancing skills has a key role to play in this area since less productive firms suffer relatively more from skill shortages.
D24|Unconventional monetary policy and productivity: Evidence on the risk-seeking channel from US corporate bond markets|We examine the relationship between lax monetary policy, access to high-yield bond markets and productivity in the US between 2008 and 2016. Using monetary policy surprises, obtained from changes in interest rates futures in narrow windows around FOMC announcements, we isolate the increased access to high-yield bond markets relative to investment-grade bond markets that is due to unconventional monetary policy (UMP). We find that through the risk-taking channel, UMP has increased investors’ appetite for high-yield US corporate bonds, thereby increasing access to high-yield bond markets for firms with a higher risk profile. Since the relationship between credit ratings and firm-level productivity is U-shaped, the aggregate effect on productivity is a priori unclear. Turning to the real economy, we thus analyse whether this additional access to finance had an effect on aggregate productivity by altering the reallocation of resources across firms. Our results show that unconventional monetary policy induced less investment in tangible capital by high-productive firms. However, before drawing conclusions on the net effects of UMP on aggregate productivity, we discuss a number of issues that this paper could not deal with due to data limitations, including prominently whether this apparent misallocation may have been offset by a shift in the composition of investments towards more intangible investment.
D24|Productivity and innovation at the industry level: What role for integration in global value chains?|Productivity growth has declined in most advanced economies in the past two decades and there are signs that the pace of global value chain (GVC) integration has slowed in the post-crisis period. This paper explores the role of GVCs - international trade in intermediate inputs - for multi-factor productivity growth using a range of cross-country industry-level data sources. We find that greater participation in GVCs is associated with faster domestic productivity growth at the industry level. We estimate that if GVCs had continued to grow at their pre-crisis trend, productivity growth would have been around 1 percentage point faster over the subsequent five years in both manufacturing and services. We also find that the productivity-enhancing direction of trade differs between sectors. For manufacturing sectors, greater use of intermediate inputs from foreign sources (backward participation) is linked with faster productivity growth, reflecting the beneficial effects of having access to better quality or cheaper inputs. For services sectors, it is more the sales of intermediates (forward participation) that is associated with productivity gains, in line with the traditional role of services in foreign trade as providing inputs to other activities. Looking by partner country, GVC participation with higher productivity countries is particularly productivity enhancing. We also find that GVC integration spurs greater domestic innovation activity.
D24|Firm Heterogeneity and the Dynamics of Credit Rationing in Japan|The role of firms' financial heterogeneity in determining the credit channel of monetary policy attracted more attention recently. We investigate the degree of financial constraints among listed Japanese firms from 1994 to 2014. Based on an estimated financial constraints index, we analyze the distribution of this value and investigate its time-series changes. First, the distribution of financial constraints is approximately a gamma distribution with a long right tail, meaning that many firms have weak credit constraints and a small number of firms have severe credit constraints. Second, the spread between the 75th and the 25th percentiles of the financial constraints index increased, especially after 2000, which implies that financial inequality increased recently. Third, this increased inequality may be due to the growing inequality between firms within the same industry. We conduct a simple regression of the financial constraints index on productivity and find that the increased financial heterogeneity appears to be linked to the increase in productivity dispersion.
D24|Persistent and transient inefficiency: Explaining the low efficiency of Chinese big banks|Considering the evidence that China’s five largest state-owned banks (the Big Five) suffer from low cost efficiency, this paper decomposes overall efficiency of Chinese banks into: persistent efficiency and transient efficiency components. Low persistent efficiency reflects structural problems, while low transient efficiency is associated with short-term problems. Using the model of Kumbhakar, Lien and Hardaker (2014) based on the stochastic frontier approach, we measure persistent efficiency and transient efficiency for a large sample of 166 Chinese banks over the period 2008–2015. In line with existing evidence, we find a lower average cost efficiency of Big Five banks compared to other Chinese banks. It is almost entirely due to low persistent cost efficiency. Big Five transient efficiency is similar to other Chinese banks. Our findings support the view that major structural reforms are needed to enhance the efficiency of China’s Big Five banks.
D24|Firm heterogeneity and macroeconomic dynamics: a datadriven investigation|In this paper we offer a unique firm-level view of the empirical regularities underlying the evolution of the Lithuanian economy over the period of 2000 to 2014. Employing a novel data-set, we investigate key distributional moments of both the financial and real characteristics of Lithuanian firms. We focus in particular on the issues related to productivity, firm birth and death and the associated employment creation and destruction across industries, firm sizes and trade status (exporting vs. non-exporting). We refrain from any structural modeling attempt in order to map out the key economic processes across industries and selected firm characteristics. We uncover similar empirical regularities as already highlighted in the literature: trade participation has substantial benefits on firm productivity, the 2008 recession has had a cleansing effect on the non-tradable sector, firm birth and death are highly pro-cyclical. The richness of the dataset allows us to produce additional insights such as the change in the composition of assets and liabilities over the business cycles (tilting both liabilities and assets towards the short-term) or the increasing share of exporting firms but the constant share of importing ones since 2000.
D24|The productivity puzzle and misallocation: an Italian perspective|Productivity has recently slowed down in many economies around the world. A crucial challenge in understanding what lies behind this ‘productivity puzzle’ is the still short time span for which data can be analysed. An exception is Italy, where productivity growth started to stagnate 25 years ago. The Italian case can therefore offer useful insights to understand the global productivity slowdown. We find that resource misallocation has played a sizeable role in slowing down Italian productivity growth. If misallocation had remained at its 1995 level, in 2013 Italy’s aggregate productivity would have been 18% higher than its actual level. Misallocation has mainly risen within sectors rather than between them, increasing more in sectors where the world technological frontier has expanded faster. Relative specialization in those sectors explains the patterns of misallocation across geographical areas and firm size classes. The broader message is that an important part of the explanation of the productivity puzzle may lie in the rising difficulty of reallocating resources across firms within sectors where technology is changing faster rather than between sectors with different speeds of technological change.
D24|Productivity analysis by using firm-level data: the case of Macedonia|Productivity, the efficiency by which firms convert inputs into output is central concept in growth related discussions. This research is focused on analyzing productivity on a sample of Macedonian firms. The goal is twofold – first, to construct productivity indicators by using firm-level data, with special focus to construction of total factor productivity (TFP), and, second to identify productivity determinants specific for Macedonian firms. Results are in line with the global productivity trends –there is significant slowdown in productivity growth in 2016. This is true for labour productivity, as well as for the TFP measure. However, the period is relatively short to conclude that this shift is of permanent, structural nature, especially having in mind the trend of reducing unemployment in the economy. As productivity determinants are concerned, econometric research confirms the importance of financial health, human capital and firms’ size as significant factors that affect the productivity of Macedonian firms.
D24|Competition effect on innovation and productivity - The Portuguese case|The aim of the present paper is to assess the effect of competition on innovation (patent applications) and on productivity (Total Factor Productivity and Labour Productivity), using data from 654 Portuguese firms, according to 208 NACE 4-digits sectors, and over the period 2007 to 2015. For this purpose, two different methodological approaches were used, a Poisson regression model for the patent function and a log-log fixed effect model for the productivity function. The results reveal that, on average, competition has a negative, U-shaped form effect on innovation in the short term, and a positive effect in the medium-long term. Nevertheless, the model focusing only on manufacturing sectors shows some differences from the model considering all economic activities, namely a linear positive effect of competition on innovation. Concerning the effect of competition on productivity, a positive effect on Total Factor Productivity emerged from the analysis, while for labour productivity a negative one prevails.
D24|Competition and Firm Productivity: Evidence from Portugal|This paper presents empirical evidence on the impact of competition on firm productivity for the Portuguese economy. To that effect, firm-level panel data comprising information between 2010 and 2015 gathered from the Integrated Business Accounts System (Portuguese acronym: SCIE) is used. The database enables the construction of economic and financial indicators, which allow for isolating the impact of competition on firm-level productivity. We find a positive relationship between competition and both total factor productivity and labor productivity. This relationship is found to be robust to different specifications and in accordance with the results in the literature obtained for other countries.
D24|The Determinants of TFP Growth in the Portuguese Service Sector|As services today are of great complexity and usually a bundle of different individual inputs, it is sometimes hard to identify characteristics for the overall service sector. As such, empirical research on productivity is less common in this sector. Given the connection between Total Factor Productivity (TFP) and economic growth, and the importance of services for overall economic activity, it is crucial to study, at the firm level, which factors may drive TFP growth in this particular sector. Our empirical assessment is based on a firm-level panel dataset covering Portuguese service firms, between 2010 and 2016. We first estimate TFP through the Levinsohn-Petrin (LP) algorithm and compare results amongst different traditional estimating methods. Secondly, we conclude our econometric framework with a fixed-effects estimation, hence, trying to shed further light on the determinants of TFP growth in the Portuguese service sector. We found evidence for a positive correlation between financial health, innovation, wage premium, and TFP growth, whereas capital intensity, training, and age show a non-linear relationship with TFP growth.
D24|Combining uncertainty with uncertainty to get certainty? Efficiency analysis for regulation purposes|Data envelopment analysis (DEA) and stochastic frontier analysis (SFA), as well as combinations thereof, are widely applied in incentive regulation practice, where the assessment of efficiency plays a major role in regulation design and benchmarking. Using a Monte Carlo simulation experiment, this paper compares the performance of six alternative methods commonly applied by regulators. Our results demonstrate that combination approaches, such as taking the maximum or the mean over DEA and SFA efficiency scores, have certain practical merits and might offer a useful alternative to strict reliance on a singular method. In particular, the results highlight that taking the maximum not only minimizes the risk of underestimation, but can also improve the precision of efficiency estimation. Based on our results, we give recommendations for the estimation of individual efficiencies for regulation purposes and beyond.
D24|Private Information and the Commitment Value of Unobservable Investment|The commitment value of unobservable investment with cost-reducing effects is examined in an entry model where the incumbent is privately informed about his costs of production. We show that when the price signals incumbent’s costs, unobservable investment can not have any commitment value and the limit price does not limit entry. By contrast, if the price does not reveal costs, which is the more likely outcome, unobservable investment has a magnified value of commitment and a less aggressive limit price deters profitable entry.

D24|La demande de travail de la théorie générale de la firme : évidences empiriques|"Ce papier s’est fixé pour objectif d’effectuer les tests empiriques de la fonction de demande de travail issue de la théorie générale de la firme. En effet, en réfutant l’hypothèse de maximisation du profit et en adoptant l’idée que l’entreprise fonctionne, en général, sur la base de compromis entre les parties prenantes (actionnaires, managers et employés), la théorie générale de la firme aboutit, entre autres, au résultat théorique selon lequel « dans le court terme, la demande de travail ne dépend pas que du salaire réel ; elle dépend également du profit brut réel et est croissante avec ce dernier ». Les tests économétriques réalisés dans le cadre de ce travail à partir de données d’un échantillon de 370 entreprises formelles du Burkina Faso confirment ce résultat théorique. Ces tests économétriques montrent, d’une part, que la composante quantitative de la demande de travail est croissante avec le profit brut réel et décroissante avec le salaire réel et, d’autre part, que la demande composée de travail (quantitative et qualitative) est croissante avec le profit brut réel et décroissante avec la prime de qualification. De ce fait, ce papier soulève des questionnements par rapport à la représentation du marché du travail dans l’analyse macroéconomique. This paper aims to verify the labor demand function from General Theory of Firm. Indeed, rejecting the hypothesis of profit maximization and holding the idea that firm operates, in general, on the basis of compromise between stakeholders (shareholders, managers and employees), General Theory of Firm leads, among others, to the theoretical outcome according to which ""in short term, the labor demand does not depend only on real wage; it also depends on real gross profit and increases along with it"". The econometric tests carried out in the framework of this research confirm this theoretical outcome. They show, on one hand, that quantitative component of labor demand increases along with real gross profit and decreases along with the real wage and, on other hand, that compound demand of labor (quantitative and qualitative) increases along with real gross profit and decreases along with the qualification premium. Therefore, this paper points out questions regarding the representation of labor market in macroeconomic analysis.(Full text in french)"
D24|From Methodology to Practice (and Back): Georgescu-Roegen's Philosophy of Economics and the Flow-Fund Model|Despite his early contribution to the rise of mathematics in economics, Georgescu-Roegen's later methodological criticism of models has received little attention from historians and philosophers of economics. This paper attempts to fill this gap following two lines. First, I examine his explicitly methodological claims and connect them with related topics in economic methodology. Building on the distinction between dialectical and arithmomorphic concepts, I characterise his approach to theory-making as a three steps process of idealisation, isolation and arithmetisation. In this framework, models perform two functions, checking for logical consistency and facilitating understanding, which can be related to the idea of modelling as theorising. I then confront these general principles with Georgescu-Roegen's flow-fund model of production. I use the methodology as a reading grid of this theory, while examining its limits and complementary principles in practice. This shows a great deal of consistency, where idealisation provides conceptual foundations, isolation determines the relevant problems, and models are built according to structural consistency. The two functions of models are then illustrated by the logical derivation of older principles formulated by Babbage and Smith, and the understanding of the different organisational patterns of production. But some slightly different functions also appear when specific configurations of the model enable to check the conceptual consistency of other theories, or the understanding provided by the model contributes to the formation of new concepts. Hence, the consistency and the complementarity between Georgescu-Roegen's methodology and practice of theory-making provide interesting insights and a useful background for further investigations.
D24|Varying-coefficient panel data models with partially observed factor structure|In this paper, we study a varying-coefficient panel data model with nonstationarity, wherein a factor structure is adopted to capture different effects of time invariant variables over time. The methodology employed in this paper fills a gap of dealing with the mixed I(1)/I(0) regressors and factors in the literature. For comparison purposes, we consider the scenarios where the factors are either observable or unobservable, respectively. We propose an estimation method for both the unknown coefficient functions involved and the unknown factors before we establish the corresponding theory. We then evaluate the finite-sample performance of the proposed estimation theory through extensive Monte Carlo simulations. In an empirical study, we use our newly proposed model and method to study the returns to scale of large commercial banks in the U.S.. Some overlooked modelling issues in the literature of production econometrics are addressed.
D24|Complementarities In Performance Between Product Innovation, Marketing Innovation And Cooperation With Clients|This paper examines the complementary relationship between product innovation, marketing innovation and cooperation with clients, based on data from Estonian firms. The author evaluated complementary relationship in terms of its effect on the firm’s total factor productivity. This study uses the Community Innovation Survey (CIS) and Estonian Business Register data from the years 2002–2012 and the Heckman selection model to research the complementarity effect between studied innovation activities using the supermodularity approach. The results show that product innovation and marketing innovation are complementary in the service industry, but in manufacturing industry there is lack of evidence for the effect of complementarity. Cooperation with clients showed inconclusive complementarity test results involving both innovation types in both industries. Using panel data as a robustness test showed more insights into the complementary effects between cooperation with clients and the studied forms of innovation. However, the results show a weak complementarity effect between cooperation and innovation and suggest that there is still no clear complementarity effect.
D24|Security, Trade, and Political Violence|To address security concerns, governments often implement trade barriers and re- strictions on the movement of goods and people. These restrictions have negative economic consequences, possibly increasing the supply of political violence. To test this hypothesis, we exploit the restrictions imposed by Israel on imports to the West Bank as a quasi-experiment. In 2008 Israel started enforcing severe restric- tions on the import of selected dual-use goods and materials, de facto banning a number of production inputs from entering the West Bank. We show that after 2008 (i) output and wages decrease in those manufacturing sectors that use those materials more intensively as production inputs, (ii) wages decrease in those local- ities where employment is more concentrated in these sectors, and (iii) episodes of political violence are more likely to occur in these localities. Our calculations suggest these effects account for 18% of the violent political events that occurred in the West Bank from 2008 to 2014.
D24|Worker Flows, Entry and Productivity in the New Zealand Construction Industry|The 21st century global decline in productivity growth is not well understood. One possible contributor is a decline in economic dynamism. We explore the contribution of firm formation and employee movement to productivity using administrative data on the population of New Zealand construction firms from 2001-2012, along with linked data on their employees and working proprietors, to study the relationships among entry, worker flows and firm productivity. Entrants are more productive than pre-existing firms. Firms that enter and stay exhibit a persistent productivity advantage that averages about seven percent, but which grows as experience accumulates. We find that job churn is prevalent in construction, with around 60 percent of firm-worker pairs not existing previously or not existing subsequently. Firms with new employees are more productive than those with no change in workforce, in part because of knowledge flows from other construction firms. In our preferred specification, with firm fixed effects, a standard deviation increase in the productivity of new employees' previous firms is associated with a 0.6 percent increase in productivity. The entry and worker-knowledge-flow phenomena are distinct, in that the entry effect is not explained by employee composition, and non-entrant firms also benefit from worker knowledge flows.
D24|Nonparametric identification of unobserved technological heterogeneity in production|"We propose a novel nonparametric method for the structural identification of unobserved technological heterogeneity in production. We assume cost minimization as the firms' behavioral objective, and we model unobserved heterogeneity as an unobserved productivity factor on which firms condition the input demand of the observed inputs. Our model of unobserved technological differences can equivalently be represented in terms of unobserved\latent capital"" that guarantees data consistency with our behavioral assumption, and we argue that this avoids a simultaneity bias in a natural way. Our empirical application to Belgian manufacturing data shows that our method allows for drawing strong and robust conclusions, despite its nonparametric orientation. For example, our results pinpoint a clear link between international exposure and technological heterogeneity and show that primary inputs are in the considered sectors substituted for materials rather than for technology."
D24|Compositional changes in aggregate productivity in an era of globalisation and financial crisis|We demonstrate that common modeling assumptions underlying micro-unit productivity indices induce biases in the evolution and decomposition of standard aggregate productivity measures. After controlling for such biases, we decompose aggregate productivity based on groups of economically significant firm types. We show that large incumbent firms that both export and import determine the evolution of aggregate productivity for the Belgian manufacturing sector. Over time, the increase in average productivity outweighs the decline in the covariance between market shares and productivity of this group. The former result stems from stronger learning-by-doing effects for granular firms. The latter suggests an increase in resource misallocation due to market distortions. This pattern intensifies after the 2008 financial crisis. All other firm types, if anything, contribute negatively to aggregate productivity and productivity growth.
D24|IT and productivity: A firm level analysis|Using a novel comprehensive data set of IT investment at the firm level, we find that a firm investing an additional euro in IT increases value added by 1 euro and 38 cents on average. This marginal product of IT investment increases with firm size and varies across sectors. IT explains about 10% of productivity dispersion across firms. While we find substantial returns of IT at the firm level, such returns are much lower at the aggregate level. This is due to underinvestment in IT (IT capital deepening is low) and misallocation of IT investments.
D24|What happens when firms invest? Investment events and firm performance|The aim of the study is to investigate the firm-level relationship between investment spikes and subsequent productivity developments. We used census data of Polish firms with employment above 9 persons, we measured investment spike and constructed a control sample for comparison. We showed various performance indicators before and after investment spike. We tested for the effects of a spike using generalized difference-in-difference models. The results suggest different effects for SMEs and larger companies. In smaller firms investment spike is associated with subsequent sales and employment expansion and lagged labor productivity rise, consistently with learning-by-doing model. TFP of smaller firms falls directly after a spike and only gradually rises thereafter. In larger firms investment spike also result in expansion of sales, but labor productivity is not improving relative to control group, despite a drop of employment. Moreover, capital deepening of larger firms results in significantly lower TFP, both in absolute and relative terms.
D24|Changing Business Dynamism and Productivity : Shocks vs. Responsiveness|The pace of job reallocation has declined in all U.S. sectors since 2000. In standard models, aggregate job reallocation depends on (a) the dispersion of idiosyncratic productivity shocks faced by businesses and (b) the marginal responsiveness of businesses to those shocks. Using several novel empirical facts from business microdata, we infer that the pervasive post-2000 decline in reallocation reflects weaker responsiveness in a manner consistent with rising adjustment frictions and not lower dispersion of shocks. The within-industry dispersion of TFP and output per worker has risen, while the marginal responsiveness of employment growth to business-level productivity has weakened. The responsiveness in the post-2000 period for young firms in the high-tech sector is only about half (in manufacturing) to two thirds (economy wide) of the peak in the 1990s. Counterfactuals show that weakening productivity responsiveness since 2000 accounts for a significant drag on a ggregate productivity.
D24|Intangible Investment and Firm Performance|Abstract We combine survey and administrative data for about 13,000 New Zealand firms from 2005 to 2013 to study intangible investment and firm performance. We find that firm size and moderate competition is associated with higher intangible investment, while firm age is associated with lower intangible investment. Examining firm performance, we find that higher investment is associated with higher labour and capital input, higher revenue, and higher firm-reported employee and customer satisfaction, but not with higher productivity or profitability. The evidence suggests that intangible investment is associated with growth and ‘soft’ performance objectives, but not with productivity or profitability.
D24|Worker flows, entry, and productivity in New Zealand’s construction industry|We use administrative data on the population of New Zealand construction firms from 2001-2012, along with linked data on their employees and working proprietors, to study the relationships among worker flows, entry, and firm productivity. We find that job churn is prevalent in construction, with around 60 percent of firm-worker pairs not existing previously or not existing subsequently. The data also show that firms gaining or losing any labour are more productive than static firms, and that firms gaining labour from other construction firms are 4-6 percent more productive than the industry average in a given year. Our analysis suggests such firms are productive in part because of knowledge flows from other construction firms; in our preferred specification, with firm fixed effects, a standard deviation increase in the productivity of new employees’ previous firms is associated with a 0.6 percent increase in productivity. New entrants are more productive than pre-existing firms. Firms that enter briefly and disappear exhibit high productivity for that brief period, and firms that enter and persist exhibit a persistent productivity advantage that averages about 5%, but which grows as experience accumulates. The entry and worker-knowledge-flow phenomena are distinct, in that the entry effect is not explained by employee composition, and non-entrant firms also benefit from worker knowledge flows.
D24|Resource Misallocation in European Firms: The Role of Constraints, Firm Characteristics and Managerial Decisions|Using a new survey, we show that the dispersion of marginal products across firms in the European Union is about twice as large as that in the United States. Reducing it to the US level would increase EU GDP by more than 30 percent. Alternatively, removing barriers between industries and countries would raise EU GDP by at least 25 percent. Firm characteristics, such as demographics, quality of inputs, utilization of resources, and dynamic adjustment of inputs, are predictors of the marginal products of capital and labor. We emphasize that some firm characteristics may reflect compensating differentials rather than constraints and the effect of constraints on the dispersion of marginal products may hence be smaller than has been assumed in the literature. We also show that cross-country differences in the dispersion of marginal products are more due to differences in how the business, institutional and policy environment translates firm characteristics into outcomes than to the differences in firm characteristics per se.
D24|Foreign Direct Investment and Knowledge Diffusion in Poor Locations: Evidence from Ethiopia|We quantify foreign direct investment (FDI) spillovers by comparing changes in total factor productivity (TFP) among domestic plants in districts that attracted a large greenfield foreign plant and districts where greenfield FDI was licensed but not yet operational. Treated and untreated districts have similar trends in TFP prior to the opening of the large greenfield foreign plant. Over the four years starting with the year of the opening, TFP of domestic plants is 8% higher in treated districts. Using an alternative identification strategy that exploits the assignment of land for FDI by the Ethiopian Government, we obtain similar results. Foreign plants also attract new economic activity to treated districts. Exposure to foreign firms enhances domestic firms’: (i) production processes; (ii) managerial and organizational practices; (iii) logistics and; (iv) knowledge about exporting. Knowledge transfer is more likely among labor or vertically linked firms but also occurs outside these channels.
D24|Indivisibilities in Distribution|This paper develops and estimates a model of indivisibilities in shipping and economies of scale in consolidation. It uses highly detailed data on imports for which it is possible to observe the contents of individual containers. In the model, a firm is able to adapt to indivisibility constraints by using consolidation strategies, and by determining how dense to make its distribution network in both space and time. Indivisibilities are found to create significant scale economies in distribution.
D24|Why Has Economic Growth Slowed When Innovation Appears to be Accelerating?|Measured between quarters with identical unemployment rates, U. S. economic growth slowed by more than half from 3.2 percent per year during 1970-2006 to only 1.4 percent during 2006-16, and only half of this GDP growth slowdown is accounted for diminished productivity growth. The paper starts from the proposition that GDP growth matters, not just productivity growth, because slower GDP growth provides fewer resources to address the nation’s problems, including faltering education, aging infrastructure, and the looming shortfall in funding for Social Security and Medicare, and it also implies lower net investment and a reduced rate at which new capital can embody the latest technology. The paper documents the contribution to slower GDP growth of the separate components of demography -- fertility, mortality, life expectancy, and immigration. Particular emphasis is placed on the interaction between rising inequality and the slower secular rise of life expectancy in the U.S. compared to other developed countries, both in the form of a large gap in life expectancy between rich and poor, and the stagnation of life expectancy for the lowest income quintile. Further contributions to slowing growth are made by a decline in the population share of both legal and illegal immigration and a turnaround from rising to declining labor force participation. Rising inequality creates a gap between the growth of average real per-capita income relative to that of median real income, and alternative measures of the evolution of this gap are compared and assessed. Causes of declining productivity growth begin with the slowdown in the rate of increase of educational attainment resulting from the interplay of demand and supply factors, including the flattening of the college wage premium and the rising relative price of college education. Why did productivity growth decline after 2006 despite an increase in the rate at which new U.S. patents were issued in 2006-16 compared to earlier decades? Part of the slowdown is attributed to the maturity of the IT revolution, which also helps to explain the trajectory of the college wage premium. Aspects of the productivity growth slowdown include the declining productivity of research workers, diminishing returns to drug innovation, and the evolutionary rather than revolutionary impact of robots and artificial intelligence, which are replacing workers slowly and only in a minority of industrial sectors throughout the economy. Also considered are alternative explanations of slower productivity growth, including low investment and mismeasurement.
D24|New Evidence on the Markup of Prices over Marginal Costs and the Role of Mega-Firms in the US Economy|The markup of price over marginal cost reveals market power. The distinction between marginal and average cost is key. Average cost is easy to measure, but the price/average cost ratio understates the price/marginal cost ratio when fixed costs are present. In particular, in free-entry equilibrium, where revenue equals cost, the price/average cost ratio is always one, while the price/marginal cost ratio may be above one. The idea here is to calculate marginal cost as the ratio of the adjusted expenditure on inputs to the adjusted change in output. The first adjustment is to remove the change in expenditure that arises from the changes in input costs. The second adjustment is to remove the change in output attributed to productivity growth. Application to KLEMS productivity data finds a typical markup ratio of 1.3. Markup ratios grew between 1988 and 2015. For mega-firms, the paper uses employment at firms with 10,000+ workers. Substantial heterogeneity occurs across sectors and in growth rates. There is no evidence that mega-firm-intensive sectors have higher price/marginal cost markups, but some evidence that markups grew in sectors with rising mega-firm intensity.
D24|Energy Productivity and Energy Demand: Experimental Evidence from Indian Manufacturing Plants|This paper studies a field experiment among energy-intensive Indian manufacturing plants that offered energy consulting to raise energy productivity, the amount plants can produce with each unit of energy. Treatment plants, after two years and relative to the control, run longer hours, demand more skilled labor and use 9.5 percent more electricity (standard error 7.3 percent). I assume that the treatment acted only through energy productivity to estimate the plant production function. The model estimates imply that energy complements skill and capital and that energy demand therefore responds more strongly to a productivity shock when plants can adjust these inputs.
D24|High-Skill Immigration, Innovation, and Creative Destruction|Economists have identified product entry and exit as a primary channel through which innovation impacts economic growth. In this paper, we document how high-skill immigration affects product reallocation (entry and exit) at the firm level. Using data on H-1B Labor Condition Applications (LCAs) matched to retail scanner data on products and Compustat data on firm characteristics, we find that H-1B certification is associated with higher product reallocation and revenue growth. A ten percent increase in the share of H-1B workers is associated with a two percent increase in product reallocation rates – our measure of innovation. These results shed light on the economic consequences of innovation by high-skill immigrant to the United States.
D24|Using Empirical Marginal Cost to Measure Market Power in the US Economy|Market power arises in the case where a seller is aware that raising output will depress price. In the profit-maximizing equilibrium with market power, price exceeds marginal cost. The Lerner index---the ratio of price less marginal cost to the price---is a widely accepted measure of market power. Measuring marginal cost is a challenge. This paper develops and applies a direct empirical approach---marginal cost is measured as the ratio of the observed change in cost to the observed change in output. Because marginal cost is a partial derivative, both changes need to be adjusted for other sources of change. Thus marginal cost is the ratio of (1) the change in cost not associated with changes in input prices to (2) the change in output not associated with productivity change. I develop data for the 60 KLEMS industries for this measure. I find a typical Lerner index of 0.15. Lerner indexes grew moderately between 1988 and 2015.
D24|Techies, Trade, and Skill-Biased Productivity|We study the impact of firm level choices of ICT, R&D, exporting and importing on the evolution of productivity and its bias towards skilled occupations. We use a novel measure of the propensity of a firm to engage in technology investment and adoption: its employment of workers with STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) skills and experience who we call “techies”. We develop a methodology for estimating firm level productivity that allows us to measure both Hicks-neutral and skill-augmenting technology differences, and apply this to administrative data on French firms in the entire private sector from 2009 to 2013. We find that techies and importing of intermediate inputs raise skill-biased productivity, while imports also raise Hicks-neutral productivity. We also find that higher firm-level skill biased productivity raises low-skill employment even as it raises the ratio of skilled to unskilled workers. This is because of the cost-reducing effect of higher productivity. The techie and trade effects are large, and can account for much of the aggregate increase in skilled employment from 2009 to 2013.
D24|Inter-Industry Wage Inequality: Persistent differences and turbulent equalization|Persistent inter-industry wage differentials are an enduring puzzle for neoclassical economics. This paper applies the classical theory of ‘real competition’ to inter-industry wage differentials. Theoretically, we argue that competitive wage determination can be decomposed into equalizing, dispersing and turbulently equalizing factors. Empirically, we show graphically and econometrically for 31 U.S. industries in 1987-2016 that wage differentials, like regulating profit rates, are governed by turbulent equalization. Furthermore, we apply a fixed effects OLS as well as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model and find that the link between regulating profit rates and wage differentials is positive, significant and robust.
D24|Cloud Computing and National Accounting|As the digitalisation of the economy progresses, one of the changes in business models affecting statistics including GDP and trade data is the adoption of cloud computing services in place of fixed investment in computer and communications hardware and the development of own-account software. This rapidly growing phenomenon involves the detachment of the physical location of data and computing processes from their creation, ownership and use, potentially introducing transactions across national borders. In this paper, we construct price indices for cloud services in the UK, showing significant price declines both before and after adjusting for quality in the past few years. We discuss the conceptualisation of a volume measure for cloud services. We discuss the implications of cloud use by businesses for the interpretation of measured business investment, GDP and productivity growth, noting in particular the limitations of measuring total factor productivity through growth accounting, and the importance of double deflation when there are significant changes in the price of intermediate goods such as cloud services. We discuss also the implications for the interpretation of international trade statistics. Finally, we set out the requirements for official statistical surveys to be able to track cloud computing in the future.
D24|Firms at the productivity frontier enjoy lower effective taxation|Slow productivity growth in advanced economies holds back income gains and therefore improvements in well-being. Sluggish productivity gains in aggregate hide a growing gap between firms at the frontier, which display sustained productivity growth, and the rest of firms whose productivity stagnates. The empirical analysis – based on firm-level data for the period 1998–2014 – uncovers the existence of a tax burden gap alongside the productivity gap: firms at the frontier pay less for each dollar of profits than lagging firms. This heterogeneous impact of taxation may hinder productivity diffusion, as it reduces incentives (and opportunities) for lagging firms to catch up with the frontier. The negative impact of taxation is particularly important when associated with cash constraints, weak demand and other framework conditions (e.g. labour market legislation, trade openness). The analysis shows that complementing tax incentives with policies to ease cash constraints would help to narrow the productivity gap.
D24|Digital technology diffusion: A matter of capabilities, incentives or both?|Insufficient diffusion of new technologies has been quoted as one possible reason for weak productivity performance over the past two decades (Andrews et al., 2016). This paper uses a novel data set of digital technology usage covering 25 industries in 25 European countries over the 2010-16 period to explore the drivers of digital adoption across two broad sets of digital technologies by firms, cloud computing and back or front office integration. The focus is on structural and policy factors affecting firms’ capabilities and incentives to adopt -- including the availability of enabling infrastructures (such as high-speed broadband internet), managerial quality and workers skills, and product, labour and financial market settings. We identify the effects of structural and policy factors based on the difference-in-difference approach pioneered by Rajan and Zingales (1998) and show that a number of these factors are statistically and economically significant for technology adoption. Specifically, we find strong support for the hypothesis that low managerial quality, lack of ICT skills and poor matching of workers to jobs curb digital technology adoption and hence the rate of diffusion. Similarly our evidence suggests that policies affecting market incentives are important for adoption, especially those relevant for market access, competition and efficient reallocation of labour and capital. Finally, we show that there are important complementarities between the two sets of factors, with market incentives reinforcing the positive effects of enhancements in firm capabilities on adoption of digital technologies
D24|The quantification of structural reforms|This paper summarises earlier OECD work aimed at quantifying the impact of structural reforms on economic outcomes. It overviews: i.) insights obtained for the linear relationships linking policies and economic outcomes (including multi-factor productivity, capital deepening and employment) for an almost complete set of OECD countries, ii.) non-linear results on how policies interact with each other in OECD countries, and iii.) results extended for emerging-market economies looking at whether policy effects vary across countries depending on the level of economic development and whether institutions have an influence on economic outcomes. The paper lists of policies and institutions that could be used to quantify the effect of reforms. It also gives some guidance on how to quantify reforms in OECD and non-OECD countries. It provides mid-point estimates of the long-run effects on per capita income levels through the three supply-side channels. Finally, it raises the issue of estimation and model uncertainty.
D24|The quantification of structural reforms: Introducing country-specific policy effects|This paper presents country-specific effects of structural reforms. It discusses how sizeable and interesting country-specific effects can be identified in a panel setting by conditioning the impact of individual policies on their own level or on the stance of other policies and institutions. This approach allows for the incorporation of a potentially large set of additional policy areas including institutions and policy areas with limited time-series availability (e.g. sub-components of the Product Market Regulation indicator, housing market regulations and policies, Doing Business indicators and the quality of institutions such as the rule of law indicator or the efficiency of the legal system). Results suggest that for instance, when more stringent product market regulation hurts more in more open economies. Better institutions amplify the positive effect of R&D spending. Tax wedge reduction leads to less employment gains when EPL is not very stringent.
D24|The UK productivity puzzle through the magnifying glass: A sectoral perspective|Since the start of the Great Recession, labour productivity growth has been weak in the United Kingdom, weaker than in many other OECD countries. The productivity shortfall, defined as the gap between actual productivity and the level implied by its pre-crisis trend growth rate, was nearly 20% for output per hour at the end of 2016. This study assesses the UK productivity puzzle and discusses its possible determinants at the sectoral level. Most of the UK productivity underperformance is structural rather than cyclical. Half of the productivity shortfall is explained by non-financial services (with information and communication being the largest contributor), a fourth by financial services, and another fourth by manufacturing, other production and construction. All but non-financial services and the construction sectors contribute disproportionately to the productivity shortfall compared to their shares in overall output and hours worked of the UK economy. In non-financial services, large increases in self-employed with no employees, reduced matching of skills to jobs and a lower capital-output ratio may have been a drag on productivity. Stagnant productivity in the financial sector is mainly linked to reduced risk-taking and leverage, as reflected by declining total factor productivity following its steep increases in the run-up to the crisis. Greater substitution of labour for capital and weak corporate restructuring have both held back productivity improvements in the manufacturing sector. Some causes of the productivity puzzle pre-date the crisis, including low tangible investment, too rapid expansion of financial services, weak innovation in the manufacturing sector, and a secular decline of oil and gas industries.This Working Paper relates to the 2018 OECD Economic Survey of the United-Kingdom (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-united-kingdom.htm).
D24|Sectoral and regional distribution of export shocks: What do two hundred thousand UK firm observations say?|This study explores the impact of export shocks on firms and re-aggregates results to derive distributional effects on sectors and regions. In a first step, firm level data are used to assess the empirical relationship between exports and three outcome variables – labour productivity, employment and wages. In a second step, an illustrative set of changes in trading relationships generate sectoral export shocks, which are simulated with the OECD METRO model of trade and subsequently fed into micro-level estimates. The method developed in this study can be applied to other countries, conditional on the availability of data. As an initial case study, the analysis is for the United Kingdom which has weak regional productivity outside London, partly related to sectoral and trade specialisation. In particular, the most productive regions are specialised in knowledge-intensive services and are more intensive in tradable services. The results suggest limited impacts of export shocks on sectoral employment, except for car and truck manufacturing, consistent with a high integration of the sector with European value chains. Labour productivity and wages are negatively affected across most sectors, but the effects are smaller on the services sector relative to the goods sector. Given that services activities are concentrated in more productive regions, these regions are more resilient to shocks. The United Kingdom has a strong comparative advantage in services sectors and promoting the opening of global services markets would be an important way to offset potential negative impacts of export shocks on the other sectors of the economy.
D24|Design of insolvency regimes across countries|This paper explores cross-country differences in the design of insolvency regimes, based on quantitative indicators constructed from countries’ responses to a recent OECD policy questionnaire. The indicators – which are available for 36 countries for 2010 and 2016 – aim to better capture the key design features of insolvency which impact the timely initiation and resolution of personal and corporate insolvency proceedings. According to these metrics, the design of insolvency regimes varies significantly across countries, with important differences emerging with respect to the treatment of failed entrepreneurs, the availability of preventative and streamlining tools and ease of corporate restructuring. While a comparison of indicator values for 2010 and 2016 imply that recent reform efforts have improved policy design, there remains much scope to reform insolvency regimes in many OECD countries. This is particularly significant in light of complementary analysis which shows that the design of insolvency regimes is relevant for understanding three inter-related sources of contemporary labour productivity weakness: the survival of “zombie” firms, capital misallocation and stalling technological diffusion.
D24|Fear the walking dead: Zombie firms, spillovers and exit barriers|Productivity growth is slowing down among OECD countries, coupled with increased misallocation of resources. A recent strand of literature focuses on the role of non-viable firms (“zombie firms”) to explain these developments. Using a rich firm-level dataset for one of the OECD countries with the largest drop in barriers to firm exit and restructure, we assess the role of zombies on firm dynamics, both in the extensive and intensive margins. We confirm the results on the high prevalence of zombie firms, significantly less productive than their healthy counterparts and thus dragging aggregate productivity down. Moreover, while we find evidence of positive selection within zombies, with the most productive restructuring and the least productive exiting, we also show that the zombies' productivity threshold for exit is much lower than that of nonzombies, allowing them to stay in the market, distorting competition and sinking resources. Zombie prevalence curbs the growth of viable firms, in particular the most productive, harming the intra-sectoral resource reallocation. We show that a reduction in exit and restructuring barriers promotes a more effective exit channel and fosters the restructuring of the most productive. These results highlight the role of public policy in addressing zombies' prevalence, fostering a more efficient resource allocation and enabling productivity growth.
D24|Environmentally Adjusted Multifactor Productivity: Methodology and Empirical Results for OECD and G20 Countries|This paper extends the analytical framework for measuring multifactor productivity in order to account for environmental services. A growth accounting approach is used to decompose a pollution-adjusted measure of output growth into the contributions of labour, produced capital and natural capital. These indicators allow the sources of economic growth, and its long run sustainability, to be better assessed. Results presented here cover OECD and G20 countries for the 1990–2013 period, and account for the extraction of subsoil natural assets and emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases. The main findings suggest that growth in OECD countries has been generated almost exclusively through productivity gains, while BRIICS countries have drawn largely on increased utilisation of factor inputs to generate additional growth. Regarding natural capital, in countries such as Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Chile, reliance on subsoil assets extraction has contributed to a significant share of income growth. Results also point to a shift towards more environmentally friendly production processes in many countries. In fact, most OECD countries have decreased their emissions over the last two decades, and these pollution abatement efforts result in an upward adjustment of their GDP growth rates, allowing for a more accurate assessment of their economic performance.
D24|Productivity measurement, R&D assets and mark-ups in OECD countries|A key feature of the 2008 revision of the System of National Accounts was the treatment of R&D expenditure as investment. The question arises whether the standard approach towards accounting for growth contribution of assets is justified given the special nature of R&D that provides capital services by affecting the working of other inputs as a whole – akin to technical change and often requires up-front investment with sunk costs. We model R&D inputs with a restricted cost function and compare econometric estimates with those derived under a standard index number approach but find no significant differences. However, we cannot reject the hypothesis of increasing returns to scale. The standard MFP measure is then broken down into a scale effect and a residual productivity effect, each of which explains about half of overall MFP change. The scale effect points to the importance of the demand side and market size for productivity growth. We also compute mark-up rates of prices over marginal cost and find widespread evidence of rising mark-ups for the period 1985-2016.
D24|Public R&D Support and Firms' Performance - A Panel Data Study|We analyse all the major sources of direct and indirect R&D subsidies in Norway in the period 2002-2013 and compare their effects on individual firms’ performance. Firms that received support are matched with a control group of firms that did not receive support using a combination of stratification and propensity score matching. Changes in performance indicators before and after support in the treatment group are compared with contemporaneous changes in the control group. We find that the average effects of R&D support among those who obtained grants and/or subsidies are positive and significant in terms of performance indicators related to economic growth: value added, sales revenue and number of employees. The estimated effects are larger for start-up firms than incumbent firms when the effects are measured as relative effects (in percentage points), but smaller when these effects are translated into level effects. Finally, we do not find positive effects on return to total assets or productivity for firms who received support compared with the control group.
D24|Incentive Regulation: Evidence From German Electricity Networks|We propose a difference-in-differences (DiD) approach to estimate the impact of incentives on cost reduction. We show theoretically, and estimate empirically, that German electricity distribution system operators (DSOs) pile up more costs in the year used to determine future prices when subject to a lower-powered regulation mechanism. The difference is particularly significant (about 10% of total cost) for firms in the upper quartile of the efficiency distribution, a pattern which is consistent with the pooling of types under the threat of ratcheting. In light of heterogeneous network reinforcement across DSOs due to local wind and solar power expansion, cost inflation will particularly hit already hard-struck DSOs’ customers.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D24|The Impact of Climate Change on U.S. Agriculture: The Roles of Adaptation Techniques and Emissions Reductions|We investigate the impact of climate change on U.S. agricultural productivity using county-level yield and weather data from 1950 to 2015. We present two new methods of modelling how producers adapt agricultural techniques to harsh temperatures, including a new panel data estimator that allows for two-dimensional fixed-effects in slopes. We find evidence of adaptation to geographic and temporal variation in climate, but it has stalled since 1989. We show that adaptation implies fixed-effects slope heterogeneity in the relationship between crop yield and temperature, and ignoring this leads to biased estimates of temperature sensitivity. We use our estimates to project corn yields to 2100 using a variety of climate models and emission scenarios, and find that unmitigated climate change will have severe effects on yields. Our models indicate that adaptation techniques can mitigate 10 to 45% of the damage, but significant emissions reductions can mitigate far more (i.e., 42 to 91%).
D24|Political connection and bank in(efficiency)|Does political connection affect bank efficiency during both financial and political crises? This study addresses this question by adopting a two-stage approach that uses a quantile regression analysis of a unique dataset of listed banks in the Middle East and North Africa region. Our results show that political connection is a driving force behind bank inefficiency in the region. We find that the least efficient banks have the most significant association with political connections, thus supporting the bailout theory. We also find that political connections influenced the efficiency of banks during the 2008-9 global financial crisis but not during the 2011-13 regional political crisis. Our results provide new evidence on the applicability of established political connection theories in developing countries during political regime turmoil. We therefore recommend that global banking regulators and market participants scrutinize the political connections of banks more thoroughly.
D24|Cyclical and Stuctural Variation in Resource Reallocation: Evidence for Europe|This paper uses cross-country micro-aggregated data on rm dynamics and productivity from the ECB CompNet database to provide empirical evidence on factor reallocation in the EU. The analysis fi nds that reallocation is towards more productive firms although the magnitude varies across countries and over time. Variation in reallocation is related to structural di fferences in firm size distribution across countries as well as to variation in labor and product market institutions. Productivity enhancing reallocation generally rises in downturns but, similar to findings for the US, it did not pick up in the great recession. The sharp drop in exports and tightness in credit markets are seen to provide a partial explanation for this lack of a silver lining.
D24|Barriers to Entry and Regional Economic Growth in China|The non-state manufacturing sector has been the engine of China's economic transformation. Up through the mid-1990s, the sector exhibited large regional differences; subsequently we observe rapid convergence in terms of new firm start-up rates, productivity, and wages. To analyze the drivers of this behavior, we construct a Melitz (2003) model that incorporates location-specific capital wedges, output wedges, and a novel entry barrier. Using Chinese Industry Census data for 1995, 2004, and 2008, we estimate these wedges and examine their role in explaining differences in performance across prefectures and over time. Entry barriers turn out to be the salient friction for explaining performance differences. We investigate the empirical covariates of these entry barriers and find that barriers are causally related to the size of the state sector. Thus, the downsizing of the state sector after 1997 may be important in explaining the rapid manufacturing growth over the 1995-2008 period.
D24|From central planning toward a market economy: The role of ownership and competition in Vietnamese firmsâ€™ productivity|This paper examines the role of ownership and market competition in Vietnamese firmsâ€™ total factor productivity (TFP) from 2001 to 2011. Making use of a large panel dataset of Vietnamese manufacturing firms, we find that, on average, both foreign-owned enterprises (FOEs) and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have performed better than privately owned enterprises (POEs) in terms of their TFP levels. However, while FOEs ranked the highest in terms of TFP in the period 2001â€“2006, SOEs â€œclosed the gapâ€ with FOEs in the period 2007â€“2011. SOEsâ€™ good performance may be the result of the state-led development policies undertaken during the 2000s. We also find that market competition has been effective in enhancing average firm productivity and reducing the gaps in efficiency across firms of different ownership types. Based on these results, we compare Vietnamâ€™s transition path with those followed by other countries.
D24|Supply flexibility in electricity markets|The development of non-dispatchable renewable sources of energy requires more flexible reliable thermal equipment to match residual demand. We analyze the advantages of delaying production decisions to benefit from more precise information on states of the world, at the expense of higher production costs in a two-period framework where two technologies with different flexibility characteristics are available. We determine firstbest production levels ex ante and ex post, that is, when demand is still random and is known with certainty respectively. We then show that, under perfect competition, first best can be implemented indifferently either by means of ex post state-contingent markets or by means of a day-ahead market followed by adjustment markets. By contrast, when the industry is imperfectly competitive, the two market designs are not equivalent.
D24|The Impact of Sickness Absenteeism on Productivity: New Evidence from Belgian Matched Panel Data|We investigate the impact of sickness absenteeism on productivity by using rich longitudinal matched employer-employee data on Belgian private firms. We deal with endogeneity, which arises from unobserved firm heterogeneity and reverse causality, by applying a modified version of the Ackerberg et al's (2015) control function method, which explicitly removes firm fixed effects. Our main finding is that, in general, sickness absenteeism substantially dampens firm productivity. An increase of 1 percentage point in the rate of sickness absenteeism entails a productivity loss of 0.24%. Yet, we find that the impact is much diversified depending on the categories of workers who are absent and across different types of firms. Our results show that sickness absenteeism is detrimental mainly when absent workers are high-tenure or blue-collar workers. Moreover, they show that sickness absenteeism is harmful mostly to industrial firms, high capital-intensive companies, and small- and medium-sized enterprises. This overall picture is coherent with the idea that sickness absenteeism is problematic when absent workers embed high levels of firm/task-specific (tacit) knowledge, when the work of absent employees is highly interconnected with the work of other employees (e.g., along the assembly line), and when firms face more limitations in substituting temporarily absent workers.
D24|Duality in Production|The paper reviews the application of duality theory in production theory. Duality theory turns out to be a useful tool for two reasons: (i) it leads to relatively easy characterizations of the properties of systems of producer derived demand functions for inputs and producer supply functions for outputs and (ii) it facilitates the generation of flexible functional forms for producer demand and supply functions that can be estimated using econometrics. The paper focuses on describing the properties of five functional forms that have been used in the production literature: (i) the Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES), (ii) the Generalized Leontief, (iii) the translog, (iv) the Normalized Quadratic and (v) the KonÃ¼s Byushgens Fisher functional forms. The applications of GDP functions and joint cost functions to various areas of applied economics is explained.
D24|Economic Measures of Capacity Utilization: A Nonparametric Cost Function Analysis|Cost based measures of capacity utilization and capacity output are important metrics for evaluating firm performance. Understanding where firms are producing on their average cost curve provides information about whether capacity utilization is greater then, less than or equal to one. Most firms are multi-output, multi-input in nature which makes estimation of capacity utilization and capacity output challenging if a cost based measure is desired. For a multi-output firm, the relevant concept is ray average cost (RAC) which can be estimated through non-linear DEA models. This paper offers a simple transformation that linearizes the non-linear DEA program to estimate average, or ray average cost, and to determine capacity utilization and optimal output. The methods are empirically tested on data from a number of U.S. electricity producers for the single output case, and a sample of dental practices for the multi-output case. Results show that for both industries, most firms were operating at less than full capacity, and needed to expand output to minimize their costs. For the dental practices, examination of results from six randomly chosen firms showed the importance of operatories in determining optimal levels of output.
D24|Data Envelopment Analysis with Alternative Returns to Scale|This paper offers an overview of Data Envelopment Analysis as a nonparametric method of measuring efficiency in production. Special attention is devoted to alternative returns to scale assumptions about the technology and identifying the local nature of returns to scale at projections of an inefficient unit on to the frontier. Both radial and non-radial measures of technical efficiency are considered.
D24|Austria’s Economic Competitiveness in a Neighbourhood Context: Is Austria’s Economy Locked-in to the CESEE Region?|Since the Eastern enlargement of the EU in 2004, Austria has lost global export market shares. At the same time exports to Central, East and Southeast Europe (CESEE) have gained a significant portion of Austria’s total exports. Moreover, in recent years Austrian GDP growth has slowed down and unemployment increased. In this context our main research question is whether the opening to the East has had a structural lock-in effect for Austria’s economy. In a novel approach on the territorial lock-in effect we apply a multi-perspective view from a microeconomic (firm-level), mesoeconomic (industry-level) and macroeconomic (country-level) perspective. The major finding is that by and large Austria is not subject to a lock-in effect into CESEE markets. On the contrary, the results suggest a growing internationalisation of the Austrian export structure. Nevertheless, policy recommendations that aim at further improving Austria’s competitiveness include a productivity‑oriented wage policy, an industrial policy that aims at technological upgrading, support for European policy measures that speed up income convergence across the continent as well as additional measures to internationalise Austrian businesses with a focus on the booming emerging markets in India and Africa.
D24|Cohesion Policy Meets Heterogeneous Firms|In this paper, we empirically test the effects of the EU â€˜cohesion policyâ€™ on the performance of about 500,000 European manufacturing firms after combining regional policy data at NUTS- 2 level with firm-level data. In a framework of heterogeneous firms and different absorptive capacity of regions, we show that financing of â€˜cohesion policyâ€™ by European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) aimed at direct investments in R&D correlates with improvement of firmsâ€™ productivity in a region. Conversely, funding designed at overall Business Support correlates with negative productivity growth rates. In both cases, we registered an asymmetric impact along the firmsâ€™ productivity distribution, where a stronger impact can be detected in the first quartile, i.e. less efficient firms in a region. We finally argue that considering the heterogeneity of firms allows a better assessment of the impact of â€˜cohesion policyâ€™ measures.
D24|Immigration and Innovation|Do High-Skilled Third-Country (i.e. Non-EU) Migrants Contribute to Productivity Growth? In order to foster innovation and enhance economic development and growth, attracting skilled professionals from abroad has become an important policy goal in many economies, initiating a global race for talent. This paper looks at the private company sector in a group of 13 old EU Member States and examines the role of high-skilled third-country (HS-TC) migrants for innovation – as captured by real labour productivity and total factor productivity (TFP) growth – between 2004 and 2015. It utilises four different indicators of HS-TC migration and defines high skills in terms of either educational attainment (ISCED classification) or the skills required in an occupation (ISCO classification) which helps identify the presence of a jobs-skills mismatch for HS-TC migrants. Taking into account the endogenous nature of HS-TC migration, we find some selective evidence of a negative causal link between the share of HS‑TC migrants, on the one hand, and labour productivity and TFP growth, on the other. Furthermore, differences in the results for the ISCED- and ISCO-based skills measures point to a non-negligible jobs‑skills mismatch in terms of an over-representation of HS-TC migrants in lower productivity occupations. We also find that HS-TC migrants are relatively less productive than HS EU migrants. Results for selected individual industries are more mixed, with some industries even benefiting in productivity terms from a higher share of HS-TC migrant workers.
D24|Migrants and Firms: Evidence from China|This paper estimates the causal effect of rural-urban migration on urban production in China. We use longitudinal data on manufacturing firms between 2001 and 2006 and exploit exogenous variation in rural-urban migration due to agricultural price shocks. Following a migrant inflow, labor costs decline and employment expands. Labor productivity decreases sharply and remains low in the medium run. A quantitative framework suggests that destinations become too labor-abundant and migration mostly benefits low-productivity firms within locations. As migrants select into high-productivity destinations, migration however strongly contributes to the equalization of factor productivity across locations.
D24|The extensive and intensive margins of exports of firms in developing and emerging countries|Using a dataset of over 86,000 firms from 179 surveys in developing and emerging countries, this paper presents evidence of the relationship between the margins of trade and productivity. Consistent with heterogeneous firm theoretical models, firms with high productivity have both greater likelihood of exporting (extensive margin) and higher export volume (intensive margin). Access to credit increases likelihood of entry to international markets; however, credit does not increase export volume. Size is a robust indicator of exporting status and the volume of exports. Firms with foreign ownership participation tend to be exporters, while those with state participation tend not to be.
D24|Foreign investment regulation and firm productivity: Granular evidence from Indonesia|Countries that control foreign direct investment (FDI) often face the trade-off between following national policy interests and suffering efficiency losses arising from FDI restrictions. We demonstrate the presence of this trade-off in the case of a protectionist FDI policy in Indonesia that restricts FDI at the product level. Using a yearly census of Indonesian manufacturing firms for 2000 to 2015, we link productlevel changes in FDI regulation to changes in firm-level productivity. Controlling for an extensive set of fixed effects as well as potential political-economy drivers of regulation, we find that newly introduced limitations on FDI were successful at reducing foreign capital use within the regulated firms. Although the drop in foreign capital has been more than compensated by increases in domestic capital, regulated firms have experienced a substantial loss in productivity that was concentrated in the sectors most dependent on external finance and technological innovation.
D24|Resource Misallocation in European Firms: The Role of Constraints, Firm Characteristics and Managerial Decisions|Using a new survey, we document high dispersion of marginal revenue products across firms in the European Union (EU). To interpret this dispersion, we develop a portable framework to quantify gains from better allocation of resources. We demonstrate that apart from direct measures of distortions, firm characteristics, such as demographics, quality of inputs, utilization of resources, and dynamic adjustment of inputs, are predictors of the marginal revenue products of capital and labor. We emphasize that some firm characteristics may reflect compensating differentials rather than constraints and the effect of constraints on the dispersion of marginal products may hence be smaller than has been assumed in the literature. We show that cross-country differences in the dispersion of marginal products in the EU are largely due to differences in how the business, institutional and policy environment translates firm characteristics into outcomes rather than to the differences in firm characteristics per se. Removing distortions could raise EU aggregate productivity by 40 percent or more.
D24|Does persistence in internationalization and innovation influence firms’ performance?|In this paper, we analyze the joint effect of persistency in innovation and export on firms’ total factor productivity (measured in accordance with Levinsohn and Petrin, 2003). For this purpose, we use data on Italian manufacturing firms covering an eight-year time span (1998-2006) which allow us to measure the effect of different time activities, both in innovation and in export and the existence of different pathways linking them. We distinguish between persistent and temporary exporting firms as well as frequent and temporary innovators, to test (through OLS and a two-step system GMM) the existence of any combined learning-by-exporting and learning-by-doing effects. We find that persistent innovation efforts seem to be associated with a permanent presence in foreign markets since persistently innovative and exporting firms have better productivity results than persistently exporting (innovating) firms with no persistent innovation (export). Combining both strategies can be an opportunity to internalize knowledge flows coming from long-lasting exposure to foreign markets.
D24|R&D, IP, and firm profits in the North American automotive supplier industry|Economic theory implies that research and development (R&D) efforts increase firm productivity and ultimately profits. In particular, R&D expenses lead to the development of intellectual property (IP) and IP commands a return that increases overall profits of the firm. This hypothesis is investigated for the North American automotive supplier industry by analyzing a panel of 5000 firms for the years 1950 to 2011. Results indicate that R&D expenses in fact increase profitability at the firm level. In particular, increases in the R&D expense to sales ratio lead to increases in the profit contribution of intangible assets relative to sales. This indicates that more R&D intensive IP should command higher royalty rates per sales when licensed to third parties and within multinational enterprises alike.
D24|Constrained Potential: A Characterisation of Mexican Microenterprises|This paper investigates the existence and nature of constraints prevailing among Mexican microenterprises. It provides inter-temporal insights by relying on firm-level data spanning from 1994 to 2012. A performance index is defined based on firm levels of capital stock and monthly profits, and is used to estimate the empirical probability of a business's success. The predicted values are used to classify every microenterprise into one of three categories: upper, middle, or lower segment. Overall, the study provides evidence of constrained productivity and capital misallocation. Specifically, middle-segment firms exhibit entrepreneurial features and their average marginal returns are 15 percent. Because this segment faces mainly external constraints, cost-effective interventions are plausible. Regarding the lower-segment firms, it is estimated that their average monthly marginal returns are 30 per cent, compared to 1 per cent for the upper segment. It is also shown that, over time, the share that middle-segment firms represent relative to all microenterprises increased from 16 to 22 percent. Lastly, the sources of variation in monthly profits among segments are explored using the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition method.
D24|Two and a half million Syrian refugees, skill mix and capital intensity|We investigate how the rapid increase in the low-skilled labor supply induced by the inflow of 2.5 million Syrian refugees changed the tasks performed by native workers and the amount of capital used by firms in Turkey. Despite the unexpected nature of the refugee inflow, location choice of the refugees may be endogenous to the labor market opportunities of hosting regions. To handle this endogeneity issue, we use an instrument for the refugee intensity based on the distance of Turkish regions to the Syrian ones. The results based on Labor Force Survey suggest that the inflow of refugees increased natives’ task complexity, reducing the intensity of manual tasks, and raising the intensity of abstract, routine and ICT tasks. This effect is particularly strong for natives with medium level of education. Exploiting the administrative firm data that contains the entirety of firms in the country, we find that the firms reduced their fixed assets. The fixed asset reduction is largest in machinery and equipment, which can be interpreted as a decline in the capital intensity of production. We conclude that tasks provided by Syrian refugees are substitutes for natives’ manual tasks and firms’ capital, and complementary to natives’ more complex tasks.
D24|Identifying Factor Productivity from Micro-data: The case of EU agriculture|The classical problem of agricultural productivity measurement has regained interest owing to recent price hikes in world food markets. At the same time, there is a new methodological debate on the appropriate identification strategies for addressing endogeneity and collinearity problems in production function estimation. We examine the plausibility of four established and innovative identification strategies for the case of agriculture and test a set of related estimators using farmlevel panel datasets from seven EU countries. The newly suggested control function and dynamic panel approaches provide attractive conceptual improvements over the received ‘within’ and duality models. Even so, empirical implementation of the conceptual sophistications built into these estimators does not always live up to expectations. This is particularly true for the dynamic panel estimator, which mostly failed to identify reasonable elasticities for the (quasi-) fixed factors. Less demanding proxy approaches represent an interesting alternative for agricultural applications. In our EU sample, we find very low shadow prices for labour, land and fixed capital across countries. The production elasticity of materials is high, so improving the availability of working capital is the most promising way to increase agricultural productivity.
D24|The future of work: How G20 countries can leverage digital-industrial innovations into stronger high-quality jobs growth|"A new wave of innovation is beginning to disrupt industry on a global scale. It constitutes a tremendous opportunity for faster productivity growth, but also a potential disruption to a number of economic sectors and to job markets. Academic research and the public debate have focused mostly on the threat that innovation poses to jobs and wages. This paper instead suggests that (i) these same technological disruptions make human capital more important than ever for companies' strategies; (ii) greater attention needs to be devoted to new forms of complementarity between new technologies and human capital. While some jobs will be displaced, the greatest impact of innovation will come in the way that many jobs will be transformed; the evidence to date supports the authors' view that innovation will once again result in more and better jobs - but much work needs to be done to optimize the transition. In particular, more effort should be devoted to (i) understanding what new skills will be needed, and how existing jobs will change; (ii) upgrading education and professional training schemes; (iii) reforming labor market institutions to support a future where a larger share of workers will change jobs and employers more frequently, and more people will work independently in a crowdsourcing or ""gig economy"" framework; (iv) reforming social benefits systems and bolstering social safety nets to smooth the economic transition and cushion the impact on the worst-affected workers. As innovation disrupts a growing number of industries, human capital strategies will need the collaboration of companies, educational institutions, governments and multilateral policy agencies. This paper presents an analysis of the challenges, addresses the key areas of action, and puts forward some specific proposals, including policy actions, industry initiatives, and further research projects. The authors argue that the G20 could and should champion a comprehensive approach to leverage digital-industrial innovations for faster job creation and growth, with measures to re-align demand and supply of skills, labor market reforms, redesigned social safety nets, measures to promote digital innovation and facilitate the adoption of skills-augmenting technologies. Private sector companies should strengthen training programs. International cooperation, standards harmonization and interoperability will be essential to maximize the benefits and minimize the disruptions - the G20 can therefore play a key role."
D24|Leisure time and labor productivity: A new economic view rooted from sociological perspective|Most economists measure labor productivity based on activities conducted at places of work and do not consider leisure time in their calculations. In contrast, psychologists and sociologists argue that leisure has a positive role in the production process: leisure can improve individuals' labor productivity by affecting their self-development. Using empirical data from 21 OECD countries, this study finds that leisure time has a dual effect on labor productivity in terms of per capita per hour GDP. Moreover, leisure time is nonlinearly associated with labor productivity (inverted U-shaped). When leisure time reaches the optimal level (5813 hours), leisure has a compensatory effect on work and can positively influence labor productivity, but when leisure time exceeds the optimal value, leisure has a substitution effect on work and can negatively influence labor productivity.
D24|Labour market power and the distorting effects of international trade|This article examines how trade shocks shape labour market imperfections that create market power in labour markets and prevent an efficient allocation of labour. I develop a framework for measuring such labour market distortions in monetary terms and document large degrees of those distortions in Germany's manufacturing sector. Import competition can only exert labour market disciplining effects when firms rather than workers have labour market power. Otherwise, export demand and import competition shocks tend to fortify existing distortions by amplifying labour market power structures. This diminishes the gains from trade compared to a model with perfectly competitive labour markets.
D24|The Many Decompositions of Total Factor Productivity Change|Total factor productivity change, here defined as output quantity change di- vided by input quantity change, is the combined result of (technical) efficiency change, technological change, a scale effect, and input and output mix ef- fects. Sometimes allocative efficiency change is supposed to also play a role. Given a certain functional form for the productivity index, the problem is how to decompose such an index into factors corresponding to these five or six components. A basic insight offered in the present paper is that mean- ingful decompositions of productivity indices can only be obtained for indices which are transitive in the main variables. Using a unified approach, we ob- tain decompositions for Malmquist, Moorsteen-Bjurek, price-weighted, and share-weighted productivity indices. A unique feature of this paper is that all the decompositions are applied to the same dataset of a real-life panel of decision-making units so that the extent of the differences between the various decompositions can be judged.
D24|Shadow price of CO2 emissions in Indian thermal power sector|Abstract This paper estimates production efficiency and shadow prices of CO2 emissions for coal-fired thermal power plants in India. It employs a unique sample of 56 power plants for 2000–2013 acquired primarily by invoking the Right to Information Act 2005. It estimates parametric quadratic directional output distance function using linear programming approach. We find that CO2 intensity of electricity generation could be reduced by about 16 and 23% if the power plants were made to operate efficiently. The estimated average shadow prices of US$ 14.54 and 18.68 for a ton of CO2 emission, depending upon a plant’s strategies for enhancing electricity and reducing CO2 emissions, reflect that the prevailing Clean Energy Cess of US$ 6.15 on a ton of coal or US$ 3.81 on a ton of CO2 emissions is not enough to induce the required emission mitigation. Significant variation in the estimates of shadow prices across the thermal power plants calls for use of economic instruments to reduce the emissions.
D24|What drives productivity change in the manufacturing sector? Evidence from the metalworking industry in Ethiopia|We employ longitudinal data to explore sources of heterogeneity in productivity among firms in the metalworking industry in Ethiopia. We measure multifactor and labor productivity using non-parametric and regression residual parametric approaches. We find a sizable improvement in both labor productivity and TFP over time, which is also accompanied by large productivity dispersion across firms in the industry. The decomposition of industry-level productivity indicate that productivity increases is mostly explained by the reallocation of market shares across plants in the industry and that firm exit is preceded by declining productivity trends. Our reduced model also indicates that labor productivity and TFP is significantly higher in firms with a large share of workers with vocational training background. Productivity, however, does not differ with firm ownership. These results are robust to the choice of productivity measures.
D24|Labor market imperfections, markups and productivity in multinationals and exporters|This paper examines the links between a firm’s internationalization status and the type and degree of market imperfections in product and labor markets. We develop a framework for modelling heterogeneity across firms in terms of (i) product market power (price-cost markups), (ii) labor market imperfections (workers’ bargaining power during worker-firm negotiations or a firm’s degree of wage-setting power) and (iii) revenue productivity. We apply this framework to analyze whether the pricing behavior of firms in product and labor markets differs across firms that engage in different forms of internationalization using an unbalanced panel of 7,458 manufacturing firms over the period 1994-2012 in Japan. Engagement in international activities is found to matter for determining not only the type of imperfections in product and labor markets but also the degree of imperfections. Clear differences in behavior between firms that serve the foreign market either through exporting or through FDI are observed. Exporters are more likely to be characterized by imperfect competition in the product market whereas the opposite holds for multinationals. Exporters are more likely to share rents based on the bargaining power of workers whereas a firm’s wage-setting power seems to generate wage dispersion across firms with foreign subsidiaries.
D24|Productivity of Slovenian Firms|We analyse productivity differences across non-financial Slovenian firms over the period 1994-2015. In particular, we investigate the impact of different factors (including size, ownership, investment activity and industry characteristics) on firms' total factor productivity (TFP), competitiveness and internationalisation. Large corporates appear to have the highest level of TFP, more than 50% above the average, and show stronger TFP growth. Exporting firms also show higher TFP growth than other firms, particularly after the recent crisis. Using a complete database of R&D subsidies over 1998-2015, the paper identifies R&Dintensive firms and investigates the impact of R&D investment on productivity and profitability. It is found that subsidies did not significantly increase firm-level productivity, once size, industry and year effects are taken into account. This could be because, during the recession (2009-2015), subsidies were granted to firms in difficulties.
