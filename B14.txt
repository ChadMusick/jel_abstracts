B14|Optimal Weight of Commercial Sector and Reproduction Scheme|In the field of commercial capital theory, recently Yano (2006) and Murakami (2014) have tried to incorporate the commercial sector into the reproduction scheme. However, Yano's formulation put the commercial capital outside the reproduction formula, and his explanation is too complex. Moreover, Murakami's formation still has a problem owing to his methodology that uses only the numerical examples. Therefore, this paper incorporates the commercial sector into the reproduction scheme as a perfect equation system based on the equalized profit rate. It is because equalized profit rate is also applied to the commercial sector to determine its weight in the whole economy. As a result of these calculations, this paper also identified that average profit rate is determined by the technological conditions only in the industrial sectors.
B14|Was ist falsch an der Arbeitswerttheorie? Wie Wert wirklich gebildet wird<BR>[What is wrong with the labor value theory? How value is really made]|"In this article it is shown that the labor value theory according to Marx is flawed in a central aspect: Neither the surplus value nor the value is produced. Value is a social relationship that is formed on the social level between exchange partners. Potential goods are produced as reference points for possible value relationships. They are shaped by manpower, machine and nature. On this basis, the description of value formation deviates from the classical interpretation of labor theory, and the value is no longer perceived as a subjective singularity (as a generated ""work value"", that can only be an expectation value) but as a real relationship between humans."
B14|The Impact of Financialization on the Rate of Profit: A Discussion|The present work, by making use of the ‘integrated wage-goods sector’ methodology proposed by Gareg-nani, investigates some channels through which financialization may impact the normal rate of profit. We analyze the effect of a higher profit share in the financial sector, the technical innovations in the financial sector and rising household indebtedness. We find that none of them influences normal profitability, with the exception of one type of technical innovation. We subsequently critically discuss some Marxian strands of analysis that describe financialization as a temporary countertendency to supposed falling gen-eral profitability. We argue in favor of a separate analysis between growth caused by private borrowing and the study of a normal distribution. Finally, a recent attempt to read the ‘sixth’ countertendency to the falling rate of profit listed by Marx as an anticipation of the phenomenon of financialization is criticized, proposing an alternative interpretation.
B14|Class Agency Under Conditions of Self-Enforcement: Marx on Capitalists' Common's Problem|Marx discussed institutional innovations in the context of a complex dynamic between inter versus intra-group opportunism, which contains clues for understanding how capacity for class agency develops. His lengthy discussion of the English Factory Acts in his Vol. I of Capital is an important case in point, which the paper revisits for its broader lessons not only for how institutions solve collective action problems but also how they become self-enforcing when third party enforcement is ineffective. The paper gives an account of how the Acts could have become self-enforcing at a time when the state enforcement capacity was rudimentary at best. The argument focuses on the dynamic between inter versus intra-class opportunism, shedding analytical light on how organized labor could help capitalists bolster their capacity for class agency.
B14|Karl Marx: An early post-Keynesian? A comparison of Marx's economics with the contributions by Sraffa, Keynes, Kalecki and Minsky|"This paper compares Marx's economics with those by Sraffa, Keynes, Kalecki and Minsky. The paper takes an ""ex post"" view on the matter and rather looks at the output side of the respective authors, but not at the input side. This means no attempt is made at studying in a systematic way, if and to what extent Sraffa, Keynes, Kalecki and Minsky were individually influenced by Marx's work. First, the relationship between Marx's theory of value and Sraffa's reformulation of the classical theory of prices and distribution is reviewed. Then the relationship between Marx's and Keynes's monetary theory is examined relying on an interpretation of Marx's theory of value as a ""monetary theory of value"". Next, some light is shed on the Marx-Kalecki connection focusing on Marx's theory of simple and extended reproduction and the built-in, although not fully elaborated ""principle of effective demand"" and the related theories of distribution and accumulation. Finally, Marx's and Minsky's views on financial instability and crises are scrutinised. It is concluded that Marx should not be considered as an ""early post-Keynesian"" but rather as an important forerunner of modern post-Keynesianism, with certain similarities, but also some important differences, and several areas of compatibility."
B14|Kapitalismus versus Marktwirtschaft. Karl Marx und Fernand Braudel|Since the beginning of the finance crisis, the notion of capitalism and the adjective capitalistic are more and more employed in public discourse without making an attempt to define it. In contrast, the concept of market economy is less used. We try in this paper to differentiate both concepts by going back to the approaches by Karl Marx (1818-1883) and Fernand Braudel (1902-1985). Marx does not use the term capitalism but only capitalistic production, while Braudel argues on the basis of a wealth of empirical evidence that one has to differentiate between capitalism and market economy, because he sees a contrast between them. For this reason, he has different view of a capitalistic economy as Marx has. JEL classification: B14, B24, P10, P16, P5
B14|'Wage', 'Salary' & 'Remuneration': A Genealogical Exploration of Juridical Terms & Their Significance for the Employer's Power to Make Deductions from Wages|The Supreme Court in Hartley v King Edwards VI College (2017) has confirmed that an employee who refuses to work in accordance with his contract forfeits his right to be paid for the duration of the breach. The decision extends to professional employees paid a periodic salary the principle established in Miles v Wakefield MDC (1987). The present article sheds new light on these decisions by situating them within a broader debate concerning the function of the wage and the proper relationship between work and payment. Drawing on insights from economic theory, and engaging in a genealogical analysis of legal concepts, the article shows how this debate has, over time, conditioned the use of concepts such as the 'wage', 'the salary' and 'remuneration' in legislation and case law concerning deductions. It shows that the legal concept of the 'wage' is closely related to the economic idea of the wage as the price of a commodity, while the legal concepts of 'salary' and 'remuneration' are more closely analogous to the economic idea of the wage as the cost of subsistence. The courts' tendency to confuse these concepts, and to analyse the employer's power to deduct as a right to withhold wages for non-performance of the contract, tells us much about the implicit assumptions underpinning cases such as Miles and Hartley, and how they have shaped the path of the law.

B14|Towards a Marxist theory of financialized capitalism|In the rapid growth of the literature on financialization, the term risks becoming meaningless (‘take x, add finance’). This contribution first reviews this literature, highlighting characteristic empirical features at the macroeconomic level and their variegation across different institutional contexts, then turning to meso- and micro-level multidisciplinary studies of how processes of financialization have manifest in the transformed behavior of firms, states and households, as well as in the changing mode of provision of public services and the appropriation of the commons. Marxist attempts to theorize the essences of financialization are examined and found wanting. Two proposals are made in the spirit of advancing this project. First, financialization as cyclical process must be disentangled from financialized capitalism as secular stage. Second, it is argued that the emergence of financialized capitalism as a new stage within mature capitalism is linked with the central role played by finance in the internationalization of the circuit of production.
B14|Le mode de production asiatique et la Chine. Retour sur la pertinence d'un concept biaisé|Proposed in 1859 by Karl Marx in onder to characterize India, the concept of an Asiatic mode of production was widened to explain the whole Asia stagnation in the 19th century. Severely criticized for political reasons during the 20th century, its economic relevance was rarely put into question. Indeed, in China's case, economic growth is frequently impeded by local governments actions, what could, at least in part, rehabilitate Marx's analysis.
B14|CONDITIONS WHERE THE RULED CLASS UNITES FOR THE REVOLUTION -applicability of a game theory on social dilemmas-|"Revolutions, typical cases of crucial social transformations, cannot be realized successfully without a large number of activists. Therefore, creating conditions favorable for acquiring enough participants should be an important topic of Marxist social science. In particular, this problem includes the ""free-ride,"" because the benefits of revolutionaries' activities are gained not only by the activists but also by all other members. The paper analyzes problems such as this one, applying non-cooperative game theory to social dilemma problems. This leads to some interesting results. In this research, the problem of the workers' choice between unity or freeride is first defined using numerical examples of the gain structure. It is defined again in a more generalized form using other parameters. In so doing, we express both the cost of participating in the movement and the gains from the concession of the ruling class. Because this analysis focuses on the importance of the number of participants, the concession of the ruling class is framed as a function of the number of participants. The results of this analysis revealed that the economic foundation and superstructure accurately correspond in some game structures but not in others. In other words, the social dilemma presents either as a case of prisoners' dilemma or as a chicken game. Furthermore, this paper analyzes the influence of group size, and it was revealed that groups with a large number of members, such as a ruling class, find it particularly difficult to unite. This phenomenon is called the ""large group dilemma."" In these ways, this research shows that the aforementioned type of game theory can be used to analyze the difficulties and possibilities of social movements."
B14|The Classical Treatment of Skilled Labor|"The ability to accommodate heterogeneous types of labor has presented a serious issue for the labor theory of value. Ever since Bohm-Bawerk's criticism of Marx's theory as circular, Marxist's have contributed considerable efforts to prove the labor theory of value holds with the inclusion of heterogeneous labor. This paper analyzes some of the more notable approaches to the problem. This paper proceeds in the following manner: Section 1 briefly introduces the topic of skilled labor within the labor theory of value as well as Bohm-Bawerk's theoretical critique. Section 2 presents the basic framework and notation used in the paper. Section 3 explores Hilferding's solution to the problem as formalized by Rowthorn. The well-known contribution to the literature by Bowles and Gintis is also addressed here. Section 4 examines the extension to heterogeneous labor within the ""New Interpretation"" of Dumenil and Foley. Section 5 introduces a method formalized by Shaikh which this paper refers to as a ""cost of skilling"" approach. Finally, section 6 discusses key implications of the varying approaches and situates the cost of skilling amongst them."
B14|The Rise and Fall of Unproductive Activities in the US Economy 1964-2015: Facts, Theory and Empirical Evidence|The general idea about unproductive labour and the associated with it activities is that they tend to expand and by expanding reduce the investible product and the growth potential of the economy, however little is known about the determinants of their movement. In this study, we take a closer look at the US unproductive labour and activities in general during the long enough 1964-2015 period. As possible determinants of the movement of unproductive activities we consider the economy-wide average rate of profit, the real interest rate and the degree of capacity utilization. The Toda Yamamoto causality tests, as well as the ARDL econometric model, lend support to the view that the unproductive expenditures and activities are determined rather than determine the above variables. Furthermore, the error correction term indicates that a long-run equilibrium relationship exists and it is attainable after the passage of not too long time.
B14|Ricardo’s Theory of Value is Still Alive and Well in Contemporary Capitalism|The purpose of this article is, on the one hand, to shed light on some significant aspects of Ricardo's theory of value and on the other hand to show that Ricardo's insights about the explanatory power of the relative labour times on the movement of relative prices were in the right direction. For this purpose, Ricardo's theory of value is cast rigorously and in modern terms such that by using detailed intertemporal data from input-output tables of two major economies to show that Ricardo's insights are absolutely consistent with the facts.
B14|The roots of the Euro|Indisputably, the euro has played a pivotal role in the development of Europe. Yet, the euro has also been very controversial, raising many discussions related to the nature, role and form of the “common currency”. This paper aims at contributing to this ongoing debate from a Marxist perspective, presenting the theoretical framework of quasi-world money and examining the evolution of the euro as such, from the 1950s when the idea appeared for the first time. In particular, the paper focuses on the processes that led to the emergence of the euro as quasi-world money. These processes comprised a series of political solutions to the contradiction between the necessity of all major European countries to impose their money on the European market on the one hand, and their incompetence in doing so, on the other. The analysis focuses on the post-war European monetary system up until the launch of the European Monetary Union. Its object is a historical monetary compromise that passed through many phases and managed to survive until the present day. The paper analyses the particular mechanisms through which the euro became a reality and points to the class interests that were satisfied in each phase. This discussion offers useful insights for the current debate that unfolds amidst a deep capitalist crisis internationally and a particular monetary crisis in the European Union.
B14|Zur mathematischen Struktur der Wertformen von Karl Marx in 'Das Kapital'<BR>[About the mathematical structure of the form of value of Karl Marx in 'Das Kapital']|In the first section of Das Kapital by Karl Marx different forms of values are analysed. From a mathematical point of view one can find therein structures, which correspond to elements of the mathematical theory of categories. These are especially the limit of cones and the definition of subobjects as morphisms. Using the limit cone, the concept of money contains the categorial product of commodities. The concept of the value of a commodity contains the categorial definition of a subobject.
B14|The Dialectical View Of Real And Financial Crises In Marx'S Thought|Economic crises are a recurrent topic in Marx’s works, but nowhere does he deal with this subject in a systematic way. Nevertheless, we do find many considerations that are consistent with a systematic and complete view of crises as dialectical moments in the movement of capitalist economies. According to Marx, the ultimate cause of all actual crises is always the contradiction between subjective and objective goals in the capitalist mode of production. But in the real world there are several direct causes of economic crises, each of which can randomly prevail over the others to trigger the phenomenon. However, the different causes are random only in prevailing as prime mover, not in terms of their presence or absence. The paper deals with the reconstruction of Marx’s dialectical view of economic and financial crises, analysing many passages in Capital and Theories of Surplus-Value, but especially in Economic Manuscripts of 1857-58 (Grundrisse).
B14|Sraffa’s Silenced Revival of the Classical Economists and of Marx|The standpoint of the old classical economists as well as of Marx “has been submerged and forgotten since the advent of the ‘marginal’ method” – to borrow Sraffa’s own words. The neoclassical (or ‘marginal’) paradigm, in fact, triumphantly dominated over the twentieth century (and is still dominating even now). A serious step towards the rehabilitation of the paradigm of the old classical economists was made by Sraffa (1951) with his remarkable ‘Introduction’ to Ricardo’s Principles, his seminal 1960 book Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities (PCMC) followed a few years later, as a logical completion of his long-standing work. The paper here proposed argues that Sraffa’s 1960 contribution has so far been mainly interpreted and used as a highly powered tool for destroying the foundations of neoclassical theory from a logical point of view, with the confident belief that attacking the logical side of the theory would have been sufficient to bring about its definite dismissal, which, instead, did not happen. As a consequence of all this, the revival of the classical economists and of Marx – which is one of the most characterizing feature of Sraffa’s 1960 contribution – was automatically silenced and this very fact precluded Sraffa’s theoretical framework from being used in a constructive way as a real alternative ‘vision’ to that proposed by the neoclassical market-centered paradigm. The aim of the paper is to underscore the crucial importance of Sraffa’s revival referred to above, by emphasizing its usefulness in providing a genuine alternative perspective and a radically different representation of the economy, compared with that provided by neoclassical theory. An attempt will be made to show the main features of the Sraffian framework in providing such an alternative ‘vision’ which, it will be argued, is now much needed, not least for suggesting far more sensible alternative economic policies than those so far pursued in the ceaseless turmoil of present day world economies.
B14|The Composition of Capital and Technological Unemployment: Marx's (and Ricardo's) Intellectual Debt to John Barton and George Ramsay|This brief note contends that Marx's (and Ricardo's) views on fixed (constant) and circulating (variable) capital,the impact of machinery on the working class,and their conception of how the accumulation of capital gives rise to a relative diminution in the demand for labor were strongly influenced by the works of English economists John Barton and George Ramsay. With a few notable exceptions, Marx's (and Ricardo's)intellectual debt to these classical economists has been practically neglected in the extant literature. Second, the note delves into Marx's theory of technological unemployment (surplus labor) and its main components. Again, the textual evidence strongly suggests that Marx was influenced by the writings of Barton, Ricardo, and Ramsay. The latter seems to have also influenced Marx's conception of one of the three major components of the surplus population, viz. the latent component.
B14|"Der Begriff ""Arbeit"" beim frühen und beim späten Karl Marx"|"Der Begriff ""Arbeit"" hat im Marx'schen Werk einen deutlichen Wandel vollzogen. In seiner Frühphilosophie verband Marx eine Aufhebung der Arbeit mit dem Übergang zu einer kommunistischen Gesellschaft. Mit der Ausarbeitung seines Hauptwerkes ""Das Kapital"" sagte er dagegen, dass Arbeit eine ""ewige Naturbedingung"" menschlicher Existenz sei, die nur ihre Form verändern könne. In seiner späteren Theorie der Arbeit findet sich zudem ein immanenter Widerspruch: Marx entgeht, dass sich der Begriff der Arbeit nicht von der Form der Vergesellschaftung durch die menschliche Sprache trennen lässt. Unter Rückgriff auf zeitgenössische Autoren von Marx können diese Versäumnisse der Theorie aufgedeckt und ""Arbeit"" neu interpretiert werden."
B14|The Communist Manifesto: What can we learn today for a country like Vietnam?|Today we can learn from the Communist Manifesto that unregulated markets lead to disastrous economic, social, and political developments, which can endanger the reproduction of the capital system itself. The liberal argument, based on Adam Smith's invisible hand - that markets coordinate the selfish actions of millions of people and lead to the welfare of nations -, is a dangerous dream. The consequence is that politicians should not listen to economists, including foreign advisors who preach the liberal dreams of radical versions of capitalist systems. Especially for developing countries, it is vital that they strive for a regulated version of capitalist development. Marx and Engels had a deep understanding of the functioning of capitalism. They underestimated the possibilities to regulate the capitalist system and also allowed the working class to take part in prosperity. However, there is always the danger that capitalist systems evolve with low levels of regulation with the features of capitalism analysed in the Manifesto.
B14|Kann Karl Marx die Finanzkrise 2007/08 erklären? Eine Einordnung seiner Geld- und Kredittheorie|"Der ökonomische Mainstream steht seit Ausbruch der Finanzkrise 2007/08 vermehrt unter Kritik, hatten doch nur wenige Fachwissenschaftler die Krise vorhergesehen. In der entstandenen Debatte über Ausrichtung und Methoden in der Volkswirtschaftslehre wird auch eine Rückbesinnung auf nationalökonomische Klassiker gefordert, die der Mainstream aus den Lehrbüchern weitgehend getilgt hat. Hätte Karl Marx eine bessere Prognose zur Finanzkrise gestellt? Seine Geld- und Kredittheorie erschließt sich insbesondere aus der Lektüre des dritten Bandes des ""Kapital"", den Ökonomischen Manuskripten dazu (1863-1865) und den Londoner Heften (1850-1853). Der vorliegende Beitrag rekonstruiert diese aus dem Blickwinkel der herrschenden Ökonomik. In Aspekten wie Wesen und Erscheinungsformen des Geldes, Endogenität und Neutralität des Geldes, Rolle von Krediten, Zinsen und Krisen zeigt sich, dass Marx insbesondere durch seine Analysen zum Kreditgeld die Finanzkrise besser erklären kann als der ökonomische Mainstream. Es handelt sich dabei um eine Krise der Überakkumulation von Geldkapital, die weder einzigartig noch auf das Versagen einzelner Marktakteure zurückzuführen ist. Solche Krisen entstehen unweigerlich aus einem fundamentalen Widerspruch des kapitalistischen Wirtschaftssystems, wonach das endogene Kreditgeld zugleich Triebfeder der Produktion aber auch der Überproduktion und Überspekulation ist."
B14|New starting point(s) : Marx, technological revolutions and changes in the centre-periphery divide|This paper investigates Marx's understanding of the connections between technological revolutions and the centre-periphery divide. Marx's initial elaboration on those topics may be helpful for a contemporary agenda to investigate how global capitalism has been shaped and reshaped by movements in this structural divide between a dynamic centre and a changing periphery. Technological revolutions have been shaping the structure of that divide, its nature and structure. Therefore, Marx's elaboration may be fruitful for both the understanding of the origin and the dynamics of technological revolutions and their impact upon the divide centre-periphery.
B14|The Recurrence of Long Cycles: Theories, Stylized Facts and Figures|Basic innovations and their diffusion, the expansion or contraction of the level of economic activity and the volume of international trade, rising sovereign debts and their defaults, conflicts and the outbreak of wars, are some of the major phenomena appearing during the downswing or upswing phases of long cycles. In this article, we examine the extent to which these phenomena constitute stylized facts of the different phases of long cycles which recur quite regularly in the turbulent economic history of capitalism. The main argument of this paper is that the evolution of long cycles is a result of the long-run movement of profitability. During the downswing of a long cycle, falling profitability induces innovation investment and the associated with it 'creative destruction' of the capital stock that eventually set the stage for the upswing phase of a new long cycle.
B14|Elementi di pensiero economico nello Stato commerciale chiuso di J. G. Fichte|"Questo scritto analizza i contributi dello Stato Commerciale Chiuso (1800) di Johann Gottlieb Fichte all'economia politica nel loro complesso. Presenta l'interpretazione del diritto di proprietÃ del filosofo tedesco come un a priori fondamentale del suo metodo economico. Quanto deriva da questa interpretazione - principalmente l'impianto di un'economia pianificata centralmente - appare il risultato di una costituzione economica ""razionale"" che perviene a un equilibrio di stampo socialista ma senza un calcolo economico esplicito. Il paper fornisce anche una nuova e diversa interpretazione dell'""anarchia dei mercati"" di Fichte, riconducendola a un esito derivante dal ""fallimento dei mercati"" stessi. Questi argomenti vengono discussi, infine, in una prospettiva comportamentale che giustifica l'attenzione di Fichte verso gli stili economici (Wirtschaftsstil) quale caratteristica tipica della tradizione economica tedesca."
B14|Regularities in Prices of Production and the Concentration of Compositions of Capitals|Recent developments in price of production models have proposed a hypothesis on the structure of the input coefficient matrices to explain the empirical near-linearity and monotonicity found in prices as a function of income distribution - the tendency towards zero of subdominant eigenvalues. The objective of this paper is twofold: First, based on the behavior of observed eigenvalues, the paper shows that they cannot explain by their own the regularities found in prices of production. Second, it is shown theoretically and empirically the existence and relevance of an additional force acting on the input matrix and the labor coefficient vector: the concentration of industries' vertically integrated compositions of capital around their average. It is argued that the combined effect of these two factors produces the empirical regularities in relative prices. The tendency of the vertically integrated labor to means of production proportions to cluster around their average reveals the existence of an economic force acting on the structure of technology of observable economies and calls for an explanation. The paper relies on the US 1987- 2007 Input-Output accounts, at the highest disaggregation level (between 370-466 sectors), for the empirical evidence in this paper.
B14|Theory and Practice of Crisis in Political Economy: the Case of the Great Recession in Spain|This paper addresses the Marx´s theory of crisis in order to analyze the Great Recession in Spain, a peripheral economy within the Eurozone. It is shown the underlying problem in the capacity to generate surplus value behind the housing bubble, which in turn explain some particularities related to the capital composition and productivity, as well as wages and finance. The document also carries out a critic of both orthodox and heterodox approaches that focus i) on a profit squeeze caused by labor market rigidities, ii) underconsumption because of stagnant wages, as well as iii), finances: interest rates and indebtedness.

B14|Introduction to Michel Husson's 'Value and price: a critique of neo-Ricardian claims'|"This is a prepublication version of the published article of the same name and should be cited as ""Freeman, A. 2018. Introduction to Michel Husson's 'Value and Price: a critique of neo-Ricardian Claims' Capital and Class Vol 42, Issue 3, 2018, pp 509-516"" Michel Husson originally published this landmark article in French as Manuel Perez (1980). It thus offers a new generation of Marx scholars a resource which academic Marxism has rejected, except for a minority tradition in which this article played a foundational role: the opportunity to understand, and grapple with, Marx’s own economics. This introduction aims to explain, to such new readers, the key role which Husson’s article played in advancing our understanding of Marx’s theory of value. It appeared nine years after Paul Samuelson (1971) pronounced Marx’s value theory a failure, and three years after English Marxist Ian Steedman (1977) formally endorsed this verdict. Husson set out the first, and in many ways the most comprehensive concise rebuttal of these claims."
B14|Is Marx’S Absolute Rent Due To A Monopoly Price?|Absolute rent, in Marx’s view, has an upper limit represented by the difference between the value and the price of production of agricultural commodities. The actual relevance of this limit was questioned by Bortkiewicz and other scholars because of the difficulties concerning the argument which Marx based it on. The lack of this upper limit prompted a number of scholars to claim that there is no difference between absolute rent and a rent paid by a monopoly price. Referring to the classical/Marxian theory of monopoly price, we shall argue that is still possible— notwithstanding the missing upper limit—to distinguish absolute rent from a rent actually due to a monopoly price. In particular, the difference between the two rests on the removability (in the case of absolute rent) or the persistency (in the case of monopoly rent) of the obstacle to the expansion of agricultural production.
B14|Capital as a Social Process: A Marxian Perspective|This paper analyzes the very important notion of capital from a Marxian perspective as opposed to a neoclassical one. It is argued that when capital is viewed as a historically determined social process (relation), rather than as a thing or a collection of things, it tends to assume certain specific forms more often than others depending on the particular stage of economic history. Capital thus refers simultaneously to social relations and to things. Given this frame of reference, notions such as money and property capital are more easily accommodated and consequently are not written off as financial or fictitious capital—not real capital—because they “produce nothing.” The paper also focuses on Marx’s important analysis of the time of production and the turnover of capital in terms of the production of surplus-value (profit). It then examines Marx’s equally important and prescient analysis of how the turnover speed of capital is affected by the time of circulation of commodities (the realization of surplus-value) and the growing use of credit (in its various forms) in the capitalist system. Finally, the paper turns its attention to the economic role of time as it relates to interest-bearing (loan) capital and Adam Smith’s important distinction between productive and unproductive labor—one whose clear comprehension rests on viewing capital as a social construct.
B14|Marx and Ricardo on machinery: a critical note| This article critically discusses the important and relevant—not to mention controversial— views of Ricardo and Marx on the impact of machinery on labor productivity, the organization of production and the wages and employment prospects of the working class during the capitalism of their day. First, the article turns to Ricardo’s assessment of the introduction of machinery and its likely effects on the laborer and the rate of profit and accumulation—one which went through a substantial revision (and reversal) between the first and third editions of his Principles of Political Economy and Taxation. Then, we discuss Marx’s own critical analysis of the historical development of machinery and its impact on the labor process, the so-called “compensation principle,” and how the rising organic composition of capital ostensibly generates a “redundant or surplus-population” during the course of capitalist development. We highlight Marx’s intellectual debt to Ricardo, John Barton (and George Ramsay) insofar as his theory of technological unemployment is concerned. Lastly, the article summarizes the views of Ricardo and Marx and offers some concluding remarks.
B14|The Structure and Content of Das Kapital|Karl Marxâ€™s magnum opus, Das Kapital, presents an analysis of the long run dynamics of a mature capitalist economy. The analysis is conducted at two primary levels of abstraction â€“ â€˜capital in generalâ€™ (where competition between individual capitals is abstracted from) and â€˜many capitalsâ€™ (where the phenomenon of competition between individual capitals is introduced) â€“ and the presentation is organized into three volumes. In terms of structure, the analysis in the first two volumes is located at the level of â€˜capital in generalâ€™, and the analysis in the third volume is located at the level of â€˜many capitalsâ€™. In terms of content, the first volume analyses the production and accumulation of surplus value, the second volume investigates the problems of realization of surplus value, and the third volume analyses the mechanisms that lead to the distribution of surplus value into income streams of different fractions of the ruling class â€“ as profit of enterprise, commercial profit, interest and rent (and monopoly profit more generally). The three volumes together give a comprehensive picture of the workings of a mature capitalist economy and highlights its long run, contradictory tendencies.

B14|Appropriation and subversion: pre-communist literacy, communist party saturation, and post-communist democratic outcomes|Twenty-five years after the collapse of communism in Europe, few scholars disagree that the past continues to shape the democratic trajectories of postcommunist states. Precommunist education has featured prominently in this literature’s bundle of “good” legacies because it ostensibly helped foster resistance to communism. The authors propose a different causal mechanism—appropriation and subversion—that challenges the linearity of the above assumptions by analyzing the effects of precommunist literacy on patterns of Communist Party recruitment in Russia’s regions. Rather than regarding precommunist education as a source of latent resistance to communism, the authors highlight the Leninist regime’s successful appropriation of the more literate strata of the precommunist orders, in the process subverting the past democratic edge of the hitherto comparatively more developed areas. The linear regression analysis of author-assembled statistics from the first Russian imperial census of 1897 supports prior research: precommunist literacy has a strong positive association with postcommunist democratic outcomes. Nevertheless, in pursuing causal mediation analysis, the authors find, in addition, that the above effect is mediated by Communist Party saturation in Russia’s regions. Party functionaries were likely to be drawn from areas that had been comparatively more literate in tsarist times, and party saturation in turn had a dampening effect on the otherwise positive effects of precommunist education on postcommunist democracy.
B14|Don’t mess with my smokes: cigarettes and freedom|Considerations of objective-value freedom and status freedom do impose constraints on policies that restrict access to cigarettes. As to the objective-value freedom, something of value is lost when anti-alcohol policies lead to pub closures interfering with valued life styles, and a similar, though weaker, argument can be made for cigarettes. As to status freedom, non-arbitrariness requires consultation with vulnerable populations to learn what might aid them with smoking cessation.

B14|Underconsumption, capitalist investment and crisis: a reply to Sardoni|Sardoni (2015) presents an underconsumptionist reading of Marxâ€™s crisis theory and argues for developing a theory of capitalist investment by building on the insights of Keynes and Kalecki. This paper engages with both these arguments. It offers a critique of the underconsumptionist reading of Marxâ€™s crisis theory and flags some critical differences between the Marxian and Keynesianâ€“Kaleckian viewpoints of capitalist investment. It also presents some general remarks on Marxist crisis theory.
B14|What are production, work and consumption? Trans-historical re-conceptualisations|This paper argues for trans-historical reformulations of the basic economic concepts of production, work and consumption. The definition of the production boundary by System of National Accounts (SNA) is inconsistent from a scientific point of view. For example, while some non-market and illegal services are viewed as productive, others are not, and services and goods are treated differently. The definition proposed by feminist economics, the so-called third person criterion, is consistent, but in need for further development; furthermore, it is a definition of work and not of production. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether it is possible to formulate a non-eclectic set of logically consistent definitions that could be considered variations of a common underlying understanding across various theoretical traditions – mainly Classical, Neoclassical, Institutional, Marxist, Feminist and Keynesian Economics – of how humans consciously change external nature in order satisfy human needs. Important issues concern how to deal with violence, double counting of transaction costs, human capital formation, non-market activities and causation of final consumption. Production, work and consumption are defined as relations between events, the subject matter and the agent, and in the main definitions reduced to non-economic sentences. Even the utility concept is avoided. First-order logic is used, complemented with modal operators for some of the sentences. In this study, it is shown that production, work and consumption all share the common feature of intentional physical transformation of the intrinsic properties of the subject matter. The object transformed during the productive activity and work must at some point in time be external to the agent. For work, the purpose of transforming an external object must not lie in the transformation of the agent. A productive activity must potentially be able to cause the satisfaction of human needs, or final consumption, which is not a condition for work or required by the third-person criterion. Final consumption involves the transformation of the subject matter that is a final purpose for the consumer or serves as a purpose for transforming the consumer. Using a criterion applied by the institutional economist Cheung to identify transaction costs, this study defines social reproduction as an activity that would not occur in a Robinson Crusoe economy. Social reproduction occurs under an institutional setting. We can further differentiate between coercive and non-coercive social reproduction. In this study, eight different definitions of production are presented. The definition of agent external production is close to the third person criterion, but the possible causation of future final consumption is included as a condition for a productive activity. It is also related to the basic neoclassical model with its assumptions of no transaction costs. The definition of agent external non-coercive production entails that transformations of persons against their own will, whether legally or illegally performed, are unproductive activities. The definition of agent external non-social production entails that all socially reproductive activities are unproductive, and comes close to the distinction made by Classical and Marxist economists of productive and unproductive work. Humanity external production only includes the transformation of non-persons. The three definitions of time scale invariant production entails that human capital formation could be considered productive activities. Market production comes close to Keynesian theory and the present definition of SNA, with the difference that it excludes non-market goods production. The present study also opens for the possibility of unproductive work, for example failed production or professional murder, and productive final consumption that does not involve any work, for example hobby-hunting, play with children or research activity for own pleasure. Which definition of production is applied greatly affects the modelling and empirical application of growth theory and the analysis of the driving forces in economic history. For example, assume trade causes labour productivity outside of trade to increase four-fold due to specialisation, while the share of GDP in total working time increases from nil to half. With the same value added per productive hour and with total hours worked kept constant, the value added of agent external production then records a four-fold increase, while that of non-social production only a doubling. Similarly, during wars the SNA GDP often increases substantially, while the concept of agent external non-coercive production entails that all war expenses are treated as unproductive. Time frame invariant production grows faster than agent external production during expansions of the education system. Market production could serve important analytical purposes, for example to investigate the relation between money supply and inflation, but should be rid of inconsistencies such as the inclusion of non-market goods production.
B14|"Marx e as ""robinsonadas"" da Economia Política [Marx and Crusoe stories of Political Economy]"|This article reexamines Marx's critique of the Robinson Crusoe stories of Political Economy. Political Economy, according to Marx, starts from an isolated individual without social determinations. This is supposed to be the natural condition of mankind and this is personified by Robinson Crusoe on his island. Following Marx's ontological critique, Robinson Crusoe's stories of Political Economy are considered to be an illusory and theoretical representation covering the real conditions of capitalist society. In the first section of this article, the Robinson Crusue stories of Political Economy are reviewed, pointing to his conception of human nature and society. This section also shows that this is a lasting conception of man in economics. In the second section, we developed Marx's explanation for this conception of man through the method of ontological critique. Finally, in the last section it is suggested that Marx's critique of Robinson Crusoe stories of Political Economy doesn't imply the irrelevance of theoretical and ethical significance of individuals.
B14|Monetary Expressions of Labour Time and Market Prices: Theory and Evidence from China, Japan and Korea| This article presents estimates of labour values and prices of production following two approaches: the first is based on the classical and Marxian theory of value and distribution; the second on the so-called ‘new solution’ to the ‘transformation problem’ and its variant, the Temporary Single-System Interpretation (TSSI). The major advantage of the latter approach is its simplicity, along with the relatively low data requirements. Our empirical findings from the economies of China, Japan and South Korea suggest that both approaches give estimates of labour values and prices of production which are extremely close to each other as well as to actual market prices. On further examination, however, we conclude that our empirical findings are absolutely consistent with the theoretical requirements of the classical approach and contradict those of the TSSI.

B14|Marx, the Production Function and the Old Neoclassical Equilibrium: Workable under the Same Assumptions? With an Appendix on the Likelihood of Reswitching and of Wicksell Effects|A stochastic approach has been introduced to explain the empirically observed fact that wage curves calculated from input-output systems tend to be nearly linear and that the paradoxes of capital appear to be rare. The stochastic approach allows to justify the simplifying treatment of normal prices common to 19th and early 20th century authors as diverse as Marx (transformation problem), Wicksell (old neoclassical equilibrium), J.B. Clark (neoclassical production function). It is shown that the likelihood of reverse capital deepening is much lower than that of Wicksell effects. With this, the likely characteristics of the wage frontier obtained from a multiplicity of input-output tables are derived. The conclusion summarises what we know and do not know about the validity of the Cambridge critique of capital.
B14|Global inequality of class to the country of residence of the proletarians to migrants<BR>[Глобальное Неравенство: От Классовой Принадлежности К Стране Проживания, От Пролетариев К Мигрантам]|The inequality between the citizens of the world in the XIX century, at least half could be attributed to the difference in income between workers and owners of capital in a particular country. The real income of workers in most countries was about the same low level. That is what was the basis for the widespread acceptance of Marxism. After more than 150 years old, at the beginning of the XXI century, the situation changed dramatically: over 80% of global differences in income due to a significant gap between the average income in different countries, and the wages of unskilled workers in rich and poor countries often differ on the order. This is due to a new global political problem of migration, because the difference in income between the countries makes the migration extremely beneficial to the individual. The main problem of the near future will be to find an answer to this new challenge - assuming migration recognition of one of the most effective tools for reducing global poverty and inequality.
B14|Risking Capitalism|The growing centrality of risk management in pro-market governance raises important questions regarding how risks are produced, and why? Who and what is included in, and excluded from, risk management, and why? And, what is the relationship between the rise of risk management and neoliberalism? Charting the relationship between risk, contemporary capitalism and its neoliberal modes of governance, Risking Capitalism, addresses these questions by examining - both analytically and empirically - diverse meanings and practices of risk management across a range of scales and themes, ranging from austerity to climate change to housing and debt. The authors investigate the relationship between shifts in contemporary capitalism and the ways in which neoliberal forms of risk management have emerged, been reproduced and normalized, and, transformed historically.

B14|The Transformation of Values into Prices of Production in Marxâ€™s Scheme of Expanded Reproduction|This paper analyzes the formation of a general rate of profit and the subsequent prices of production in the context of Marxâ€™s two-sector scheme of expanded reproduction. We show that a consistent solution of the transformation problem can be derived by incorporating the original transformation procedure into the inter-temporal equilibrium framework provided by the scheme of accumulation. Previous solutions for the special case of simple reproduction are also examined, and it is shown that all these solutions rest on the restrictive assumption of constant wage rates.
B14|Janus Ante Portas|Distribution, one of the main concerns of classical political economists, is virtually a non-factor when it comes to modern neoclassical economics. The importance and influence of competition between different classes on the factor markets was understood to be a constant feature of capitalism in classical political economy. I have been able to translate this classical conflicting-claims approach in a consistent stock-flow model, with a working banking system, two classes, capitalists and workers, and a vertically integrated firm sector. National income is divided between workers and two sets of capitalist interests: industrial and financial. Results of the model reinforce the intuition of Kaleckiâ€™s 1943 essay on Political Aspects of Full Employment. The output of capitalist economies, as well as profits of capitalists, could be higher, with policies of low interest rates and a high worker income share. However, as the paper shows, these hypothetical results are not tenable under a capitalist regime, with long-run changes in the power structure endangering the current social order. Finally the disconnect between the community and capitalists becomes even clearer when we see that a high profit rate implies a lower national income.
B14|Absolute Advantage and International Trade|The purpose of this paper is to give empirical content to the approach of international trade based on the principle of absolute advantage and to show that differences in productivity may give rise to transfers of value towards the units of capital with an absolute advantage in production. Our approach is based on the classical/Marxian theories of value and competition and it is operationalized using input-output data for the years 1995, 2000, and 2005 of four euro-zone countries (Greece, Spain, Finland, and the Netherlands). The derived results are consistent with the view that productivity differences persist over the years, which is equivalent to saying that the absolute advantage in production does not change into comparative advantage.
B14|Long Waves of Capitalist Development : An Empirical Investigation|In this paper, I investigate the phenomenon of long waves of capitalist development from two perspectives. First, I look for evidence of long waves of economic growth taking the dates for turning points of long waves from the historical literature (Mandel, 1995). Using historical data for 20 capitalist countries from the Maddison-Project, I find that the growth rate of real per capita GDP (and real GDP) is significantly higher in the upswing than in the downswing phase of long waves. I interpret this as evidence of long waves of economic activity. Second, I revisit the method used by Gordon, Weisskopf and Bowles (1983) to identify long waves, using historical data on the U.S. economy from Dumenil and Levy (2013). I use this definition of long waves to test their hypothesis that business cycle downturns are â€˜reproductiveâ€™ during the upswing phase and â€˜non- reproductiveâ€™ during the downswing phase of long waves. I find evidence in support of the hypothesis.

B14|Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz—Statistician, Economist and a European Intellectual|" type=""main"" xml:id=""insr12083-abs-0001""> Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz (1868–1931) was a European statistician. His scientific work covered theoretical economics, stochastics, mathematical statistics and radiology; today, we would call him a cross-disciplinary scientist. With his clear views on mathematical principles with their applications in these fields, he stood in conflict with the mainstream economic schools in Germany at the dawn of the 20th century. He had many prominent students (Gumbel, Leontief and Freudenberg among them), and he carved out the path of modern statistical thinking. He was a true European intellectual with a career path from St. Petersburg via Göttingen to Straßburg and finally the Berliner Universität, now Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. He is known for the precise calibration of insurance claims applying the—at that time hardly known—Poisson distribution to Prussian horse kick and child suicide data. He proposed a simple solution to the Marxian transformation problem and wrote numerous articles and books on the mathematical treatment of statistical (including radiological physical) data. In this article, we sketch his life and work and point out the prominent role that he has in today's statistical thinking."

Analyses économiques en France au tournant du xx e siècle|At the end of the 19th century, in the context of a general concern about the alleged « decay of white races », the Treaty of Shimonoseki (1895) opens the perspective of an industrial revolution in China. The paper studies how economic concepts and theories are used to evaluate the possibility of a « Chinese Peril » for Europe, but also how the debate, while progressing both from conceptual and a methodological viewpoints, relies on racialist representations to estimate the relative value of key economic indicators (wage, productivity, initiative, speeds of capital accumulation and technological transfers, institutional efficiency).

B14|Marx, the notebooks on the crisis of 1866 and structural changes in capitalism: investigating financial innovation and stock exchanges|Marx's Notebooks prepared in 1868 and 1869 (excerpts from The Economist and The Money Market Review) are an investigation on the crisis of 1866. Beyond a broad study of that crisis, they are an investigation of an emerging transformation of capitalism. They focus on leading industrial sectors (railways), financial innovations (such as limited liability firms and new types of shares and titles), and follow political measures undertaken in response to that crisis - dynamic new features of a system in its drive for survival. Those Notebooks might be material for a deep revision of his unfinished manuscripts for Volume III.
B14|The issue of value in economic thought — Part 1: the evolution of views from the 5th century BC to the mid-19th century|This paper is devoted to the evolution of views on the category of value, which for more than two thousand years has been recognized as one of the most important economic concepts. It appeared in the literature thanks to Herodotus in the 5th century BC. Aristotle distinguished use value and exchange value, and demanded the exchange of goods of equal value. St. Thomas Aquinas argued that prices of traded commodities should be of equal value, and that this value is determined by the amount of labour, production costs, needs and income of buyers, as well as the amount of goods offered for sale. W. Petty found that the amount of labour determines the value of goods. The views of the aforementioned thinkers were developed by J. Locke, J. Steuart Denham and R. Cantillon, the last of whom pointed out that market prices oscillate around the proper value of affected goods. For A.R.J. de Turgot, the purchasing power and needs determine the value set by contractors. However, G.F. Le Trosne acknowledged that proper value is determined by use value, production costs and the abundance of things. These views on the objectively existing value of exchanged products were taken over and developed by A. Smith and D. Ricardo, who made value the foundation of the scientific system of economics. This role of the theory of value in economics was not undermined even by the critics of the classical school, including K. Marx, A.H. Müller, and H.Ch. Carey, although for K. Marx, as for D. Ricardo, the theory of value was an element that integrates the whole theoretical system. In turn, the precursors of the subjective-marginal movement, among others, F. Galiani, E.B. de Condillac, A.A. Cournot, and J.M. Hoene-Wronski made the value of goods dependent on the subjective feelings of individuals satisfying their needs or performing work.
B14|The language of class in China|Over half a century after the 1949 revolution, China is again being radically transformed, this time from a variant of state socialism to a variant of state capitalism. The country’s double path dependency – on the one hand, from pre-reform Chinese socialism, and on the other, from its newly endorsed globalization – distorts or limits its transition to capitalism, a transition project that is no longer tentative or politically hidden. Yet this project still cannot be openly embraced in official statements due to the enshrined commitment of the People’s Republic to socialism and the enduring attachment of the Chinese people to revolutionary and socialist traditions. This peculiar disjunction causes some extraordinary difficulties, not just in the articulation of class politics, but also in the way class politics operate in practice. The weakness, if not the complete absence, of an independent working class movement in China cannot be explained by repression alone. Multiple impediments to class consciousness and stronger labour mobilization arise from contradictory social changes and their confusing messages. In people’s subjective perceptions, when the ambiguity involved in a ‘socialist’ state taking a capitalist path is set aside, the contrast between visible gains in material prosperity and past scarcity hampers even the most ardent critics of the market transition. Such contradictions function dialectically to stabilize an otherwise crisis-ridden process, in the context of a formerly (and officially still) communist party undergoing a profound self-transformation. The refusal of the language of class, to be discussed in this essay, is a titanic act of symbolic violence on the part of the Chinese state, committed as part of a political strategy to make way for ‘reform and opening’. The tactic is also evident in official phrases such as ‘socialist market economy’, ‘primary socialist stage’, or ‘socialism with Chinese characteristics’ – all of them largely devoid of socialist content. By the same token, China’s working men and women need an alternative vocabulary as a politico-ideological weapon for articulating their situations and demands. At issue is thus not only the way the concept of class is diluted or muted in China’s de-revolutionized polity; it is also about the way in which the lack of a language of class based counter-hegemony helps to explain the lack of counter-hegemonic organizational capacity. To say this is not to endorse the views of those who imagine that class conflicts can somehow be overcome outside the realm of political economy. The damage caused by the kind of identity politics which involves discursive political attacks on ‘class essentialism’ are manifest. The alarming retreat from both gender equality and ethnic peace in China, following the imposed denial of class, makes this powerfully clear. In that light class continues to be what the renewal of a multi-dimensioned, universal struggle for liberation ultimately depends on.
B14|Theories of finance and financial crisis: Lessons for the Great Recession|This paper presents an overview of different models which explain financial crises, with the aim of understanding economic developments during and possibly after the Great Recession. In the first part approaches based on efficient markets and rational expectations hypotheses are analyzed, which however do not give any explanation for the occurrence of financial crises and thus cannot suggest any remedies for the present situation. A broad range of theoretical approaches analyzing financial crises from a medium term perspective is then discussed. Within this group we focused on the insights of Marx, Schumpeter, Wicksell, Hayek, Fisher, Keynes, Minsky, and Kindleberger. Subsequently the contributions of the Regulation School, the approach of Social Structures of Accumulation and Post-Keynesian approach, which focus on long-term developments and regime shifts in capitalist development, are presented. International approaches to finance and financial crises are integrated into the analyses. We address the issue of relevance of all these theories for the present crisis and draw some policy implications. The paper has the aim to find out to which extent the different approaches are able to explain the Great Recession, what visions they develop about future development of capitalism and to which extent these different approaches can be synthesized.
B14|Anomie And Alienation In The Post-Communist Area: A Reapplication Of The Middleton Scale In Russia And Kazakhstan|Unlike commonly used, anomie and alienation not only have different theoretical backgrounds, but also different indicators and predictors. I examine the highly institutionalized alienation scale originally introduced by Middleton (1963), reapplied as a measurement of alienation (Seeman, 1991) and anomie (Huschka and Mau 2005, 2006) in a very relevant context for an anomic situation – the post-Communist countries Russia and Kazakhstan (round six of the World Values Surveys fielded the alienation question in just these two countries). Based on confirmatory factor analysis and multiple group comparisons, I find that the scale consists of two dimensions, which can be described as an anomie and alienation. The anomic dimension consists of indicators “normlessness” and “powerlessness,” whereas the alienative one is comprised by “social isolation”, “meaninglessness,” and “job dissatisfaction.” Though the structure proves to have full invariance in both countries, the predictors for anomie and alienation are different. For both countries, only income is an important predictor for anomie, and though to a lower degree, for alienation. In Kazakhstan, the level of urbanization also provides an impact on the level of anomie. Apart from income, in Russia alienation can be predicted by gender, and type of occupation (manual or intellectual), whereas in Kazakhstan it can be predicted by age
B14|Alienation and rationality—The retreat of postwar socialism|Postwar socialist thought, such as the Frankfurt School, retreated from the Social Sciences due to its theoretical and empirical failures, as well as the discovery of Marx’ Paris Manuscripts. It shifted its emphasis away from exploitation. Instead, it dealt with human alienation in a prosperous world and other more philosophical concerns, such as the nature of rationality. We show that the Frankfurt School is not unique in dealing with these topics. The writings of F.A. Hayek, and, to a lesser extent, James Buchanan, focus on surprisingly similar observations but arrive at different conclusions. We also argue that the modern version of socialism is flawed.

B14|The Limitations of Reductive Wealth Redistribution Strategies for Curtailing Inequality in the Era of Global Capitalism|Poverty and inequality are in all likelihood the most pernicious problems in contemporary life. They contribute greatly to a wide and diverse range of suffering, injustice, and social ills. They have existed since the incipient forms of society emerged, and have plagued nearly every society. They have provoked criticism and resistance across millennia and geographic regions, and were inciting factors for many revolutions and social movements. There is evidence that inequality is rising globally, with economic growth and global capitalism as the primary culprits. Marx’s theory of infinite accumulation and Ricardo’s scarcity principle relate inherent structural qualities of wealth in capitalism to inequality and divergence in income and wealth. Abundant evidence shows that inequality will continue to increase unless there are political and economic measures to oppose it, and that inequality has increased since industrialization. The aims of these strategies is to promote income convergence, usually via reforms to taxes, redistribution, or minimum wage. Two of the most prominent proposals to curtail inequality are Piketty’s global tax rate and Standing’s basic income. However, neither sufficiently accounts for structural limitations in capitalism, such as those described by Marx and Ricardo, as well as Piketty’s study of greater growth rate of capital over income (r>g) and free market ideology. They fundamentally rely upon reductive redistribution and particularly money and income, which do not necessarily contribute to parity in wealth. In structural Marxism, inequality is created and perpetuated by the structural base and super-structure, and both must be somehow reformed or altered to achieve lasting and significant equality. In this paper, I approach inequality with this in mind, and propose a form of paternalism as a means of ensuring wealth redistribution achieves lasting equality.
B14|The Course of the Profit Rate|In discussions on the rate of profit and its tendency to fall and its role in Marxist theory, a number of phrases are often employed without clarifying what these might really mean. Primary among these are such phrases as ‘the rate of profit must ultimately fall’ and ‘the counter-acting factors cannot possibly offset the tendency in the long run’. As a result of this ambiguity, and as a result of a legacy of confusion concerning Marx’s own ideas on the profit rate beginning with the Western reception of Okishio’s (1961) famous theorem, research on the actual mathematical conditions for the profit rate to rise or fall, especially in the long term, has all but ceased. However there is very strong evidence that the rate of profit has, in fact, been falling in most industrialised economies for some considerable time, and there is good reason to suppose this has at least some bearing on the origins of the present prolonged phase of stagnation in these economies. The time is therefore ripe to return to a rigorous study of the general mathematical conditions that might govern the long-term movement of the profit rate. In particular, I will attempt to give mathematical meaning to the two concepts above
B14|Capital In the 21st Century: A Review|This paper reviews Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century. Piketty's Capital seeks to bring the issue of inequality back to the centre of social analysis and to encourage discussion about the evolution of wealth and inequality with a view to inform policy. The book uses data stretching as far back as the 1700's. The main thesis of the book is that capitalism automatically generates inequality and wealth concentration since the rate of return on capital always exceeds the growth rate of income. To resolve this problem, the book proposes a progressive tax on wealth and income. I show that Piketty's book is based on a misunderstanding of classical political economy, particularly Marx. Piketty's view of the development and phases of capitalism is inadequate. His tax proposals, though progressive, will not resolve the inequality problem. Lastly, his conclusion that modern economic growth made it possible to avoid the Marxist apocalypse is not borne out by his data.
B14|Claudio Napoleoni e il Capitale monopolistico di Baran e Sweezy (Claudio Napoleoni and Monopoly Capital by Baran and Sweezy)|The article introduces the present issue, which focuses on Marxist interpretations of the crisis. The author describes and puts into context Claudio Napoleoni’s interpretation of the labour theory of value and Baran and Sweezy’s Monopoly Capital. The article highlights how Napoleoni’s interpretation, which was at the time very unconventional, was later substantiated by the publication of new material by the two US economists (Sweezy in particular). The author concludes with some reflections of the applicability of Napoleoni’s ideas to the current stage of capitalism.

The lecture, edited by Riccardo Bellofiore, concerns Baran and Sweezy’s Monopoly Capital and its relation to Marx’s theory of value.
B14|Crisi e centralizzazione del capitale finanziario (Crysis and Centralization of Financial Capital)|The possible nexus between economic crises and what Marx and Hilferding referred to as “centralisation” of capital is one of the themes raised by the “great recession”. The article reviews the main studies devoted to such a nexus, comparing the Marxist and mainstream economic literature. A double causal relation is analysed: both concerning the role of centralisation in feeding the contradictions of the capitalist system and its recurrent crises, and the impact of these crises on the very process of centralisation.
B14|Engaging Geopolitical Economy|Two-volumes: This work advances geopolitical economy as a new approach to understanding the evolution of the capitalist world order and its twenty-first century form of multipolarity. It revives and redeploys the idea of uneven and combined development (UCD) as a way of uniting the understanding of domestic and international developments, and the struggles of classes and nations, into a single perspective as critical to this task. Geopolitical economy, as developed in VOLUME 30A, sheds light on the nature of contemporary international tensions as never before. VOLUME 30B then advances geopolitical economy as a new approach to the study of international relations and international political economy. Following upon the theoretical limitations exposed in Volume A, the analytical limitations are explored in this volume.
B14|À propos de la théorie du néo-surtravail|Nous nous proposons ici de discuter la théorie du néo-surtravail développée par Guillaume Tiffon. La théorie du néo-surtravail vise à expliciter les conditions sous lesquelles le « travail du client » peut être, dans le cadre de la production d’une « marchandise-service », créateur de valeur d’échange. Elle permettrait ainsi d’asseoir l’idée, déjà développée par ailleurs (Dujarier, 2008), d’un modèle productif reposant sur la mise au travail de la clientèle. Cependant, nous voudrions montrer qu’elle souffre de quelques ambiguïtés et confusions qui altèrent sa cohérence logique.
B14|Was Henri de Man an Early Post-Keynesian Neo-Marxist?|Henri de Man is the author of the dissenting â€œAu-delÃ du Marxismeâ€ (1926) and of the Belgian Plan du Travail (Labor Plan) of 1933. Later he became a Belgian social-democratic leader. He published between 1931 and 1935 18 economic articles in the Bulletin dâ€™Information et de Documentation of the National Bank of Belgium. It is shown that the articles, partly inspired by Keynesâ€™s writings up to 1931, are rather reflecting early Keynesian economic ideas relating to government intervention and public works, and do not contain any reference to the multiplier mechanism. A number of arguments in the articles are, however, advocating a Marxist inspired underconsumption theory. Based on further analysis of these articles, it is concluded that they contain also other important characteristics in common with the post-Keynesian neo-Marxist economic theories developed after the Second World War, such as the importance attached to the external markets of capitalism and a rejection of the labor theory of value, as well as a neglect of the Marxian law of the falling rate of profits. Their economic ideas are rooted in Marxism and the analysis of new economic phenomena, including the early Keynesianism of John Maynard Keynes. Therefore, they should be considered as an early version of these theories.
B14|Социализм с экономической точки зрения. Socialism from the viewpoint of economics|Целью настоящей статьи является обсуждение роли социалистических идей в развитии экономической мысли. Кратко рассмотрена история социалистической мысли. Выделены основополагающие идеи ученых и публицистов, внесших наибольший вклад в разработку социалистических концепций. В них выявлены общие принципы при огромном разнообразии взглядов авторов таких концепций. Рассмотрена критика социалистических идей в работах представителей альтернативных школ и направлений. Особое внимание уделено дискуссии об осуществимости социализма в период между мировыми войнами. Показано, что критика социализма осуществлялась позиций искажения экономической информации, что делало невозможным экономический расчет при социализме, и с морально-этических позиций. Экономисты социалистического направления отмечали положительное влияние снижения транзакционных издержек и предлагали различные варианты рыночного социализма. Предпринята попытка сформулировать основной вклад социалистических теорий в современную экономическую науку с позиций предмета исследования и понятийного аппарата. The purpose of the present article is to discuss the role the socialist ideas played in the development of economic thoughts. The paper considers a brief history of socialist thought, fundamental ideas of the scientists and publicists who made the greatest contribution to development of socialist concepts; common principles at a huge variety of such concepts; and criticism of socialist ideas made by representatives of alternative schools. A special focus of the paper is the discussion held in the period between the world wars on whether socialism could take place. In the critics’ opinion, socialization of the economy resulted in corrupted economic information which made economic calculations impossible in socialism and abolition of private ownership – in both eliminated freedom of choice and lower economic growth. In response, economists-socialists insisted on positive impacts through lower transactional costs and they proposed different types of market socialism. The author also makes an attempt to formulate what the socialist theories contributed to modern economics from the viewpoint of its research subject and definitions.

B14|Eduard März and Joseph Schumpeter|The paper starts off with a portrayal of Eduard März’ life in Vienna and of the impact that environment had on his early scientific work. The paper proposes that the shared experience had a strong bearing on the relationship between the student M¨arz, “that fascinating immigrant” (James Tobin), and his teacher Schumpeter, the “high priest of his science” (M¨arz). The paper highlights the various facets of this unique relationship including the interesting differences in the interpretations of the student and his teacher regards Marxian theory, Austro-Marxism and social policy.

B14|Credit, Indebtedness, and Speculation in the Marxian Paradigm: A Critical Analysis|This paper contends that, in Chapters XVII, XXIX, XXX, and XXXI of Volume III of Capital, Marx develops an incisive conceptual framework in which excessive credit creation, indebtedness, and speculation play a critical and growing role in the reproduction of social capital on an extended basis; however, given the decentralized and anarchic nature of capitalist production, the credit system does so in a highly erratic and contradictory manner which only postpones the inevitable day of reckoning. The paper also highlights Marx’s relatively neglected but highly important analysis of the separation of ownership from management in the advanced capitalism of his day, England, and its modern-day implications for excessive risk-taking and debt-fueled speculation up until the eve of the crash. More importantly, the paper argues that in Vols. II and III Marx implicitly connected the expanding role of credit [which he associated with the development of capitalism] to a significant reduction in the turnover period of capital, thereby boosting the rate of surplus-value, and countering in a highly erratic and contradictory manner, the fall in the rate of profit. The growing role of credit has been relatively ignored in the Marxian literature as an important counteracting factor to the law of the declining rate of profit. It is not mentioned at all by Marx in his famous Chp. XIV, Vol. III of Capital where he discusses other important counteracting forces, nor by Engels [in this particular context] who edited both Vols. II and III.
B14|The Demise of Marx’s Labour Theory of Value and the ‘New Interpretation’: A Recap Note|Marx’s theory of labour value is flawed. This note summarizes the main reasons why this is so. At the same time, it claims that the theory of exploitation does not depend on a labour embodied valuation and can be expounded by resorting to the theory of production prices. Almost all Marxists have now accepted this truth. Most of them have been convinced by a ‘new interpretation’ which has been able to translate the price of net output into an amount of ‘living labour’ and the rate of exploitation into a ratio between unpaid and paid labour. What produced such a surprising result is the use of labour productivity as a numeraire
B14|Karl Marx on wage labour: From natural abstraction to formal subsumption|Marx develops two different theories of the employment relationship: in one it results from a contract for the sale of a commodity, in the other from a contract establishing a social relationship. According to the first, the worker sells a commodity, which is conceived as a flow of abstract labour springing from a stock of labour power. This commodity seems to be a ‘natural’ abstraction with the properties of a productive force. Exploitation occurs when the value of labour power is lower than the value-creating capacity of abstract labour. According to the second theory, the employment relationship is based on a transaction establishing the conditions for the worker’s subordination to the capitalist and the subsumption of his productive capacity under capital. This is an illuminating anticipation of the modern theory which considers the employment contract as an institution generating an authority relationship. It is not liable to criticisms of essentialism, hyposta-tization or naturalism and is able to sustain a consistent and realistic theory of exploitation, which explains it as being based on the power relationship the worker undergoes in the production pro-cess. Now abstract labour is seen not as a productive force, but as a social relationship, and is con-sidered an abstraction that is real in a socio-historical sense rather than in a natural sense
B14|Economics of Unlimited Supply of Labor and Asymmetric Power|Since around 2000 the education premium and the level of employment in high-skill occupations has stagnated, if not actually begun to shrink. This brings into question the generally held view that in advanced countries, while potentially harmful for those who work with their hands, globalization and technological change benefit those who work with their minds. The paper argues that these unexpected labor market trends are the result not so much of autonomous changes in technology as much as they are that of the large power asymmetry between capital and labor that developed in the last few decades. The global oversupply of labor appears to have revived a pattern of skill replacing technological change that is reminiscent of 19th century capitalism. The relative abundance of cheap labor creates an incentive to chip away whatever component can be routinized from complex tasks that are performed by expensive skilled workers so that they can be offshored and automated. The paper develops a game theoretical definition of asymmetric power and shows why in labor markets characterized by a structural imbalance between supply and demand, market exchange ceases to be a positive-sum game, and how that can favor skill replacing technological change over one that augments skills. While autonomous innovations determine what non-routine task can at all be transformed into routine ones, the attractiveness of doing so is not independent of major shifts in labor market conditions.
B14|Contending Conceptions of Competition and the Role of Regulating Capital|This article discusses two major conceptions of competition, the classical and the neoclassical. In the classical conception, competition is viewed as a dynamic rivalrous process of firms struggling with one another over the expansion of their market shares at the expense of their competitors. This dynamic view of competition characterizes mainly the works of Smith, Ricardo, J. S. Mill and Marx; a similar view can be also found in the writings of Austrian economists and the business literature. By contrast, the neoclassical conception of competition is derived from the requirements of a theory geared towards static equilibrium and not from any historical observation of the way in which firms actually organize and compete with one another.
B14|Theories of finance and financial crisis – Lessons for the Great Recession|This paper presents an overview of different models which explain financial crises, with the aim of understanding economic developments during and possibly after the Great Recession. In the first part approaches based on efficient markets and rational expectations hypotheses are analyzed, which however do not give any explanation for the occurrence of financial crises and thus cannot suggest any remedies for the present situation. A broad range of theoretical approaches analyzing financial crises from a medium term perspective is then discussed. Within this group we focused on the insights of Marx, Schumpeter, Wicksell, Hayek, Fisher, Keynes, Minsky, and Kindleberger. Subsequently the contributions of the Regulation School, the approach of Social Structures of Accumulation and Post-Keynesian approach, which focus on long-term developments and regime shifts in capitalist development, are presented. International approaches to finance and financial crises are integrated into the analyses. We address the issue of relevance of all these theories for the present crisis and draw some policy implications. The paper has the aim to find out to which extent the different approaches are able to explain the Great Recession, what visions they develop about future development of capitalism and to which extent these different approaches can be synthesized.
B14|Dreams of order and freedom : debating trade management early 17th century England|The catharsis produced by the early 1620â€™s trade crisis had a significant impact on the way economic themes were regarded by public opinion in England. As a result, those who analyze the ideas put forward in the documents written during that period â€“ be they printed pamphlets or official memoranda â€“ are left with the impression that an adequate supply of money was the undisputed primary concern as regards economic administration. However, as already stressed by Barry Supple, monetary administration only occupied a prominent position in the political agenda of early 17th century England during times of crisis â€“ that is, when the kingdom was faced with a perceived threat of demonetization. This paper tries to show that, during the first two decades of the 17th century, concern with an inflow of bullion and a positive balance of trade was only of secondary importance, being normally overshadowed by a more fundamental aim: promoting a well-ordered structure for the economic relations of the kingdom, according to specific views of what constituted proper trade management. This approach encompassed both foreign and domestic activities, and found its most evident manifestation in the debates about free trade and monopolies which permeated the whole of James Iâ€™s reign.
B14|Legge del valore, legge dello scambio e problema della trasformazione: una nota|Marx’s analysis of the determination of the general rate of profit and of the associated relative prices is based on the conceptual distinction between law of value and law of exchange. The law of value states that simple, necessary abstract labour is the substance and measure of the value of commodities and is fundamental in the analysis of the social relations of the capitalist economy, i.e. for the analysis of the creation of surplus-value; it therefore represents the theoretical framework within which the problem of the distribution of surplus-value among the different capitals may be approached, i.e. the law of exchange must be taken into consideration. The analytical mistakes surrounding the marxian solution of the problem have given the way to the critics of the labour theory of value to question its relevance and coherence as a tool for the analysis of the capitalist mode of production. The aim of the present note is simply to show that it is possible to frame the relationship between law of value and law of exchange along marxian lines while determining in a coherent way the rate of profit and the corresponding relative prices of commodities in such a way that the proportionality between profits and surplus-labour is retained. Actually this is the main result of the “New Interpretation” of the marxian transformation problem which is obtained by defining the conservation of value in terms of the net product and not the gross one and the value of labour power in terms of generalized (or unallocated) purchasing power. This interpretation of the problem is therefore in contrast with the neoricardian one which is based on the refutation of the role of the law of value different from that of the determination of the relative prices of the commodities.
B14|Droit de propriété et économie politique dans l'analyse saint-simonienne|From 1825 to 1832 the Saint-Simonians advocated an evolution of the economic and social order which resulted from their analysis of property right and its effects on the functioning of a society in which the property owners exploit the labourers. Improving the lot of labourers and economic progress require measures which make it possible to lower the revenues of idle owners, to ensure a better allocation of capital to the labourers and to alter the conditions of access to ownership. Setting up a banking system combining centralization and specialization enables lowering the interest rate, reducing the exploitation of the labourers and fostering economic activity. A reform of inheritance law can also put an end to social reproduction. Classification JEL : B12, B14, K11, Z13

The paper presents these two editions and discusses their impact on the interpretation of Marx's economic and philosophical thought.

La forma en que tanto la teoría de la utilidad marginal como la teoría del valor trabajo enfocan esta influencia tecnológica será analizada desde la teoría del cierre categorial, teoría de la ciencia desarrollada por el filósofo español Gustavo Bueno.

The paper also draws important parallels between Marx's analysis of debt-fuelled crises and the events leading up to the subprime debacle of 2007-08. Finally, the paper contends that had Marx lived to re-write Vols. II and III, he would have explicitly connected the expanding role of credit [which he associated with the development of capitalism] to a significant reduction in the turnover period of capital, thereby boosting the rate of surplus-value, and countering in a highly erratic and contradictory manner, the fall in the rate of profit.

B14|Patrones de progreso técnico en la economía brasileña, 1952-2008|En este artículo se analiza el patrón de progreso técnico en la economía brasileña entre 1952 y 2008. El patrón de progreso sesgado en el sentido de Marx, ahorrador de trabajo y consumidor de capital, predominó en el período estudiado. Sin embargo, se distinguen tres fases en el dinamismo del progreso técnico. La primera, de 1952 a 1973, se caracteriza por un gran dinamismo. En la segunda, de 1973 a 1991, dicho dinamismo disminuyó. Finalmente, entre 1991 y 2008, el dinamismo de los cambios técnicos repuntó levemente. La parte salarial se mantuvo relativamente estable durante todo el período. La tasa de ganancia decreció entre 1952 y 1991, y se acrecentó ligeramente de 1991 a 2008. La tasa neta de acumulación de capital se contrajo después de 1975 debido a la caída de las tasas de ganancia e inversión. Entre 2004 y 2008, aumentó la tasa neta de acumulación de capital.
B14|Patterns of technical progress in the Brazilian economy, 1952-2008|This article analyses the pattern of technical change in the Brazilian economy between 1952 and 2008. A Marx-biased pattern of labour-saving and capital-using change predominated in the period under study. Three phases in the dynamism of technical change can be distinguished, however. The first, from 1952 to 1973, was highly dynamic. In the second, from 1973 to 1991, this dynamism lessened. Lastly, between 1991 and 2008, the dynamism of technical change recovered slightly. The wage share held fairly steady throughout the period. The rate of profit dropped between 1952 and 1991 before rising slightly from 1991 to 2008. The net capital accumulation rate contracted after 1975 because of the decline in the rates of profit and investment. Between 2004 and 2008, the net capital accumulation rate increased.
B14|The struggle for legal reform after communism|"The working paper contains an extended review essay of Zdenĕk Kühn, ""The Judiciary in Central and Eastern Europe: Mechanical Jurisprudence in Transformation?"" (2011). The central thesis of the book is that 'there is a deep continuity in the methods of legal reasoning employed by lawyers in the region, starting in the era of Stalinist Communism, continuing through the era of late Communism of the 1970s and 1980s and up to the current post-communist period'. In this respect the book's analysis is retrospective, starting in the late nineteenth century, when the Central European legal culture emerged within the 'Austrian legal tradition'. It provides a rich analysis of legal thinking, institutional practices, and expert as well as public discourse concerning judges, courts and judicial process over the course of the whole of the twentieth century in the region. The book's central argument concerns our time, however. The continuity of Central European legal thinking is, according to Kühn, 'manifested in the problems of the first two decades after the collapse of Communism'. In this regard the book turns to the present and future of Central Europe and becomes missionary, offering a diagnosis together with a prescription. The cure lies, essentially, in catching up with the West and adopting its 'new European legal culture'. More concretely, Kühn argues empathically for the empowerment of the judiciary, which would in his view correspond to the development in the West throughout the second half of the last century. The result is rather ambiguous. On the one hand, the book is engaging and worth reading for anyone interested in post-communist Europe and its past. The book however serves as an interesting exhibit in the gallery of post-communist legal culture, rather than an accomplished study thereof. In what follows I will firstly introduce the book and then turn to its problematic features, which relate to the (still) prevailing discourse concerning post-communism in Europe."
B14|Finance and crisis: Marxian, institutionalist and circuitist approaches|Most mainstream neoclassical economists completely failed to anticipate the crisis which broke in 2007 and 2008. There is however a long tradition of economic analysis which emphasises how growth in a capitalist economy leads to an accumulation of tensions and results in periodic crises. This paper first reviews the work of Karl Marx who was one of the first writers to incorporate an analysis of periodic crisis in his analysis of capitalist accumulation. The paper then considers the approach of various subsequent Marxian writers, most of whom locate periodic cyclical crises within the framework of longer-term phases of capitalist development, the most recent of which is generally seen as having begun in the 1980s. The paper also looks at the analyses of Thorstein Veblen and Wesley Claire Mitchell, two US institutionalist economists who stressed the role of finance and its contribution to generating periodic crises, and the Italian Circuitist writers who stress the problematic challenge of ensuring that bank advances to productive enterprises can successfully be repaid.
B14|Postulat de la monnaie et théorie de la valeur chez Marx|L’article tente de réévaluer la portée de la critique de Carlo Benetti au sujet de la théorie de la monnaie marxienne. Si effectivement il n’est pas possible de déduire logiquement la théorie de la monnaie de la théorie de la marchandise chez Marx, nous proposons de postuler la monnaie à l’intérieur même de la théorie de la valeur. Ce type de postulat serait fondamentalement différent du postulat keynésien de la monnaie qui conduit à rejeter la théorie de la valeur et de la répartition. Cette proposition de « postulat marxien de la monnaie » présente l’avantage de conserver les enseignements qu’apporte l’analyse marxienne de l’économie monétaire.
B14|Credit, The Turnover of Capital, and the Law of the Falling Rate of Profit: A Critical Note|This paper argues that the total turnover period of capital, comprising both its time of production and circulation, has been almost totally ignored in the Marxian literature as an important counteracting factor to the law of the declining rate of profit. It is not mentioned at all by Marx in his famous Chapter XIV, Vol. III of Capital where he discusses other important counteracting forces, nor by Engels (in this particular context), who edited both Vols II and III of Capital. Moreover, this note contends that had Marx lived to re-write Vols II and III, he probably would have explicitly connected the expanding role of credit (associated with the development of capitalism) to a significant reduction in the turnover period of capital, thereby boosting the rate of surplus value, and countering, in an highly erratic, and contradictory manner, the fall in the rate of profit.

To what extent has the attraction for socialist economic theories affected the development of his protoliberalism? Why did Einaudi abstain to participate in the exciting debate over Marxism? Which were his reactions in front of the political crisis experienced by Italian democracy towards the end of the nineteenth century? And how deep were his connections with Turati and the Socialist Party? This essay aims to answer these questions through a careful survey of scientific papers as well as unpublished or little known archival sources, hoping to shed light over some of Einaudi’s ‘dark sides’.
B14|A Critical Marxist Simple Approach to Capital Theory|This essay provides a simple, non-technical reformulation of Marx’s theoretical treatment of value and capital. It implies the abandonment of the ‘pure’ labour theory of value and of the ‘new value’ equality between the net product of the economy and the living labour employed in production of gross output, and a development of the different theoretical perspective outlined by the mature Marx. A correct method for converting quantities of labour-time in terms of money, which accounts for both explicit and implicit costs, is proposed.

B14|Alienation and the Self-Managed Firm System|An analysis of Marxâ€™s alienation theory is the starting point for establishing if alienation would actually be cancelled in a system of self-managed firms. As Marx held that alienation comes at various degrees and is strongest in capitalistic systems with hired labor, the author argues that democratic firm management would doubtless reduce alienation in general, but not eliminate those forms that are specifically related to the division of labor, to scarcity, and the resulting need to work for oneâ€™s daily bread. The author closes his paper with a criticism of Bigoâ€™s approach to alienation in centrally planned economic systems and an analysis of capitalism as an inversed world.
B14|Financialization and Marx|The recent theoretical works of the authors mentioned in the title of the paper provide thorough insights into the workings of contemporary capitalism. Derivatives are the key issue involved here. They comprehend financialization as a development within, rather than a distortion of, capitalist production. They nevertheless underestimate the ability of Marxâ€™s analytical categories to capture the essence of contemporary organization of capitalism. A return to Marx is not only helpful but is also indispensable for clarification of some unformed aspects in their analysis. What is actually involved in financialization is not just the emergence of a structure enabling more effective valuation of financial assets; it is also the development of a technology of power that is superimposed on existing power relations for the purpose of organizing their functioning.
B14|On Marxâ€™s Law of the Falling Rate of Profit: Disentangling Some Entangled Variables|This paper argues that Marxâ€™s law of the falling rate of profit applies to the problematic of choice of technique in the context of accumulation of capital, and not to the problematic of choice of technique in the context of technological change or new innovation as such. In this context, Marxâ€™s â€œthe law itselfâ€ is correct. It is, however, true that Marx does confuse the two contexts at times; but here he seems to be following in the footsteps of Ricardo, who had also made an identical mistake.
B14|The Joint-Stock Company As A Springboard For Socialism|The paper argues that the limited company can be looked upon as a transitional corporate form in-between the capitalistic mode of production and a new mode of production, as a springboard for the creation of a – fully socialist – system of cooperative firms. An additional aim of this paper is to show that Hilferding’s and Lenin’s distinction between the industrial and financial phases of capitalism may help shed light on the way the transition from capitalism to a – genuinely socialist – system of democratic firms may come about in practice.

U ovome radu želimo sugerirati da je cjelokupna ekonomska teorija dovedena u pitanje, ne samo neoklasicna. Mislimo da svijet nema adekvatnu ekonomsku teoriju za rješavanje drame našeg doba. Temeljni subjekt svjetske ekonomije postale su transnacionalne korporacije (TNC), koje imaju toliki kapacitet da mogu zamijeniti nacionalnu državu. Tehnologija u posjedu TNC-a jednostavno ne dopušta obnovu nacionalne države i nacionalne ekonomske politike, bila ona neoprotekcionisticka ili keynesovska. Stoga se nove svjetske institucije moraju razvijati za nove tehnologije i upravljanje razvojem novog svjetskog društva. Standardni udžbenici ekonomije temelje se na principu opadajucih prinosa. Cijelo podrucje mikroekonomije, makroekonomije i, konzekventno, razvojne ekonomije mora se promatrati iz kuta rastucih prinosa i otvorene svjetske ekonomije. Cini se da su vizionari poput Marxa i Hilferdinga bili u pravu, za razliku od Fukuyame, da ne kažemo od Krugmana ili Stiglitza, u videnju buducnosti svijeta.
B14|"Decentralization and veiled corruption under China's ""rule of mandates"""|This paper shows why corruption is especially difficult to detect under China’s system of decentralized authoritarian rule, which I call a “rule of mandates.” Local officials must pursue high priority political targets but have immense discretion over which laws to implement. A relative standard for corruption consequently arises since non-implementation of laws may be mandate-serving or may be corrupt; and determining which requires extra information on why non-implementation occurred. The theory is supported by evidence from original survey and case research on the implementation of the village elections law. I discuss implications for anticorruption efforts, development patterns, and future research.
B14|Why do pluralistic media systems emerge? Comparing media change in the Czech Republic and in Russia after the collapse of Communism|A quarter century after the collapse of Communism in the former Eastern bloc, a wide range of scholarly projects have been undertaken to compare and theorize processes of media change in the region. One question that scholars have sought to address is: what were the factors that crucially impacted how these media landscapes evolved? This essay aims to contribute to this debate by juxtaposing media change in two selected cases: the Czech Republic (as a best-case scenario in terms of convergence with the Western model) and Russia (as a scenario where convergence has been limited). Based on secondary analysis of a wide range of sources, the essay systematically exposes 11 crucial differences between the two countries and illustrates how these have impacted the processes of media change. The conclusion sets out how these findings could serve as a starting point and source of inspiration for future comparative research.
B14|Free Labour, Free Women. Re-appraising Harriet Taylor’s Feminist Economics|Harriet Taylor has been long forgotten as an economist and political philosopher, while merely remembered as John Stuart Mill’s friend and belatedly wife. Never was fate more unjust: we only need to recall that Taylor - whose liberal background soon led her to be fascinated by socialist theories and the evolution of labour movements - wrote chapter VII of the fourth book of the Principles of Political Economy, the well-known On the Probable Futurity of the Labouring Classes. Not to mention, moreover, her reflections on social mobility, women’s rights and female participation to the labour market, delivered in brilliant essays like Enfranchisement of Women. Detaching from mainstream Taylor’s scholarship, this paper tries to confer autonomy to her economic thought (compared to Mill’s) by suggesting that its original feature lies in the correspondence she established amid the liberation of the working classes and women’s enfranchisement, in order to place Taylor’s ideas in a more accurate intellectual perspective.
B14|The Relevance of the Theory of Fiscal Illusion. The Case of the Italian Tax System|This work analyses the phenomenon of fiscal illusion (Puviani, 1903) in the context of the Italian tax system. Financial (or fiscal) illusion refers to mechanisms which cause a cognitive alteration on the part of the taxpayer regarding the evaluation of the costs and benefits of public policies. Puviani (1903) was the first to classify the different types of financial illusions. He highlighted the main strategies used to hide the real costs of financing public goods and services through taxes (illusions on revenue) or to overestimate their usefulness (illusions on expenditure). The main conclusions of the work are that: (i) from a methodological point of view, there is a connection between Puviani’s theory of fiscal illusion and some of the assumptions of the behavioral approach and (ii) from an operational point of view, it is a useful tool to understand the motives that could have inspired several recent taxes and legislative measures within the Italian tax system. These results support the relevance of Puviani’s theory to the contemporary theory and practice of public finance.
B14|Public Debt and J.S. Mill’s Conjecture: A Note|Classical economists - mainly Smith, Ricardo and J.S. Mill - abhorred public debts because of their interference with capital accumulation. J.S. Mill in particular envisaged that a rising public debt leads to higher interest rates and falling real wages, a combination which may be consistent with a mildly increasing trend in the profit rate.
B14|Learning Political Economy in the Chinese Popular Republic. Xu He textbook (1963-1973) and its Italian Edition (1975)|In 1975 the Publisher Mazzotta printed the two volumes of the Italian edition of the treaty of political economy, which had been published in provisional versions since 1963 and in definitive form in 1973. About thirty Chinese economists joined He Xu of the Chinese Popular University in his activity aimed at providing farmers, workers, and students with a tool presenting an interpretation of the economic system along a Marxian perspective. The essay furnishes an historical analysis of the scientific, ideological and political meaning of this editorial initiative. Verifying the existence of editions of this textbook apart from the Chinese original and the Italian ones would generate an interesting historical reading of the spreading of economic ideas across continents.
B14|Georg von Charasoff´s Theory of Value, Capital and Prices of Production|The present paper on the now partly well known Russian mathematician and “amateur economist” v. Charasoff was originally written in 1987 together with H. Duffner three years after Charasoff’s remarkable contribution of 1910 “Das System des Marxismus” (The system of Marxism) had been rediscovered by the Italian economists Gilibert and Egidi. It was then the second mathematical formulation of Charasoff’s contribution on prominent but partly still unresolved topics in Marxian economics. However, though our paper circulated as mimeo it had not been published in a regular journal of economics. Meanwhile, several contributions on Charasoff appeared by such authors as Egidi, Gilibert, Kurz and Salvadori, Stamatis and Mori. But none of them seems to deal with Charasoff’s economics in an exhaustive manner. Therefore and nevertheless, the paper may be still of some interest to the, nowadays regrettably rather narrow, audience of economists specialized in linear models of production, Marxian economic theory and Neoricardianism.
B14|A Parallel between Socialism and Cooperatism|This article sets out to present a parallel between the socialist and the cooperative doctrine, made by Professor Nicolae Ghiulea and exposed in a conference in 1946. Leaving utopian conceptions, sentimentality and related ideologies aside, Ghiulea strictly refers to the scientific socialism built by Marx and Engels, and the modern cooperative, with its principles established by the equitable Rochdale pioneers. Apparently divergent notions, we shall see that the two systems are similar and connected in many ways. Nevertheless, the professor also points out the differences that singularize them.
B14|Standing on the Shoulders of Giants: The Philosophical Cradle of Marxism|This paper is part of a larger study on ‘Poverty of Communism: The Game of Filling in the Marxian Blanks’. As Lenin (1913) remarked, the philosophy of Marxism is materialism. To be more specific, Marxism is both a world view in general and a view of the society and its progress in particular; that world view is dialectical materialism (a term devised by Plekhanov, the Russian Marxist, and first used by him in an article published in 1891) and its application to the study of social history is the materialist conception of history or historical materialism, as called by Engels. Thus, as Stalin wrote in 1938, dialectical materialism is the world outlook of the Marxist-Leninist party; it is called dialectical materialism because its approach to the phenomena of nature, its method of studying and apprehending them, is dialectical, while its interpretation of the phenomena of nature, its conception of these phenomena, its theory, is materialistic. The present chapter seeks to discuss the development of philosophy in general that served as the cradle of Marxism. In this we follow the argument of Engels that the philosophical question whether there are only material entities or only mental entities divided philosophy into two opposite camps: materialism and idealism, and trace out the dialectical development of philosophy through the conflict between the two.
B14|You Cannot Swim Twice in the Same River: The Genesis of Dialectical Materialism|This constitutes a chapter of a book on ‘Poverty of Communism: The Game of Filling in the Marxian Blanks’. Dialectical materialism is the world outlook of Marxism; it is so called, because its approach to the phenomena of nature is dialectical, and its interpretation of these phenomena, its theory, is materialistic. Though the term ‘dialectical materialism’ owes its origin to Plekhanov and Lenin, its first expositor was Engels, who simply called it ‘modern materialism’ and asserted that it was essentially connected with the name of Marx. The present paper traces out the historical development of dialectical materialism, starting with its Greek philosophical origin in Heraclitus, who stressed the unity of opposites in a world of change, and passing through the dialogues of Socrates, and logic of Aristotle, Kant, Hegel, Chalybäus (famous for his exegetical characterization of Hegel’s dialectics in terms of thesis-antithesis-synthesis triad) and Feuerbach, all culminating in Marxism. The paper also discusses the experimental games of Lenin and his followers in filling in the Marxian blanks in dialectical materialism.
B14|Hilferding over Marx: A Political Economy Viewpoint of Struggles in the Left 1900-1933 and the Modern Revival|Abstract: Recent heterodox economic literature makes reference to Hilferding’s “Finance Capital” and Lenin’s “Imperialism” as early insights on the phenomenon of Financialization of capital. In this regard ideas which became dominant in the left during the first decades of the previous century are applied in the explanation of the current crisis, as well as the understanding of contemporary capitalism from a methodological, analytical and political standpoint. This paper traces the underlying argument of the Monopoly model and its main political applications in the first three decades of the 20th century, in an effort to draw rough historical analogies with its revival in contemporary literature. It is argued that the Hilferding model, from which Lenin’s ”Imperialism” is derived, has very little or nothing to do with Marx’s economics but much to do with the neoclassical theory of Monopoly and Oligopoly. This theoretical association abolishes labor value theory from the analytical framework and with it any possibility of inherent breakdown (depression) in capitalist accumulation. Consequently political economy was pushed to the background and the confrontations between Lenin and Kautsky and subsequently Trotsky, Bukharin and Stalin were fought around political and geopolitical considerations a factor which played important part in the outcome. But the most astonishing historical fact is that the revolutionary flood which shook Europe until 1930 gave place to the dominance of the extreme right when circumstances were most favorable for the left in the years of the “great depression”. Drawing from this it is argued further that the main analogy between the 1930s’ and the present is that both back then and now the left is attempting to intervene in a depression environment without a depression theory. Disproportional growth between sectors was the cause of crisis in Hilferding, a contradiction which under the dominance of “Finance Capital” would be resolved and capitalism would move to an “organized stage”. In the same fashion disproportional growth of the financial sector relative to the corporate sector, which emerged following the “great stagflation”, is the cause of the present crisis for contemporary heterodox literature. Crisis can be resolved through state regulation in this line of thought, since Financialization of capital is understood independently from the inherent contradictions of profit motivated growth. In the absence of a depression theory this part of heterodox economics has drifted in a “witch hunt” on whether capital will resolve the crisis introducing a new era of “regulated capitalism” or power shifts in favor of financial capital will preserve the present state of affairs. In the meantime, economic policy suggestions and the political agenda is surrendered in the hands of mainstream economics and right wing politics.
B14|La transitoriedad histórica del capital: La tendencia descendente de la tasa de ganancia desde el siglo XIX<BR>[The historical transience of capital: The downward trend in the rate of profit since XIX century]|This paper presents estimates of the rate of profit on fourteen countries in the long run. The performance shows a clear downward trend, although there are periods of partial recovery in both core and peripheral countries. The behavior of the profit rate confirms the predictions made by Marx, about the historical trend of the mode of production. Finally, an estimate of the global rate of profit for the last six decades is done, also highlighting the particular role of China in systemic profitability.
B14|The ‘new golden age of accumulation’, the new depression and the greek economy|The purpose of this paper is to delve into the deeper causes of the current crisis and its detailed manifestation in the case of the Greek economy. The major argument of the paper is that the root cause of the crisis is fundamentally identified in the declining profitability which past a point leads to a stagnant mass of real net profits thereby discouraging investment spending and leading to rising unemployment. In the case of the Greek economy, this crisis of profitability has been aggravated by the contraction of its major productive activities, that is, manufacturing and agriculture. The contraction of these activities not only worsened the crisis but furthermore paved the way for the development of different forms of its expression; that is, mounting debt and unprecedented high rates of unemployment bringing the whole society into a stalemate.
B14|La Direction centrale de la statistique et la Balance de l’économie nationale de l’URSS en 1923—24<BR>[The Central Statistical Administration and the Balance of the National Economy of the USSR, 1923—24]|In 1918 the Central Statistical Administration (TsSU) was founded with the support of Lenin. Pavel Illich Popov was its first director (1918-1926). TsSU proceeded to the merging and centralization of the former decentralized statistical system of the zemstva (local governments) inherited from Tsarist regime. Between 1918 and 1928, i.e. during the civil war and the NEP, TsSU was at the heart of Soviet Statistics but it came to be controlled and eventually absorbed by Gosplan afterwards. At the TsSU Popov defended his view of social statistics as being a device for the revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat in the political sphere while resting on strong scientific foundations in accordance with international standards. Rooted in Russian statisticians’ tradition, the objectivity and scientific nature of the works issued by the TsSU was Popov’s credo. In 1926, Popov exposed his views in a collective book he edited and published by the TsSU, The Balance of the National Economy of the USSR, 1923―24. In The Balance was exposed for the first time the modern principles of national accounting and intersectoral macroeconometric analysis. According to Popov, these were the relevant devices for social engineering in the NEP. Against “utopian” authors, Popov stressed the importance of founding social engineering and planning on economic theory and political economy. He thus explained how his statistical balance was an outgrowth of Quesnay’s Tableau économique and Marx’s schema of reproduction. Our article aims at examining Popov’s specific contribution as well as identifying its stakes and its significance in the economic debates during the 1920s.
B14|Financialization and Global Imbalances|The concept of â€œfinancializationâ€ has informed recent analyses of the contemporary dynamics of monopoly capitalism. In the wake of the global financial crisis in 2007-08, the strategic role of finance and its capacity to destabilize the real economy and push it to the brink of economic depression has rekindled debates over the historical causes and institutional forms which have characterized this phase of capitalist evolution. In other words, to what extent have the neoliberal policies pursued by most OECD countries over the past 30 years contributed to the emergence of this finance-led regime of accumulation? More specifically, what are the implications of the extraordinary build-up of private debt, which has financed private consumption and fuelled successive asset price and stock market euphoric bubbles over this period? At the same time, the problem of growing global imbalances between the surplus countries/regions and the deficit countries/regions has emerged as a major source of financial instability. It will be proposed that the breakdown of the mechanisms, which have supported the dynamics of financialization, have set the stage for the current global capitalist crisis.

B14|Notes on a Crisis|This paper presents Notebook B113, one of Marxâ€™s unpublished manuscripts, and suggests its importance for highlighting the monetary and financial issues which Marx was investigating after 1867. The contents of this notebook reveal a systematic effort to investigate new features of financial markets and institutions which were spreading throughout Europe during the 1860â€™s, and which were put in sharp evidence by the events that surrounded the Overend, Gurney crisis in England, in 1866. Besides offering valuable clues with respect to Marxâ€™s method of investigation and composition, the relevance of the themes comprised in the notebook for the analysis developed in part five of Capitalâ€™s volume III suggests that these manuscript excerpts and notes were part of the preparatory material for a future revision of that book, which Marx was never able to carry through.JEL Classification: B14; B31
B14|The specificity of manufacturing in Marx's economic thought| This article examines Marx's approach to manufacturing and the extent to which manufacturing could be considered to have a special place in Marx's economic thought, especially in relation to accumulation and growth. The important 'progressive' features of manufacturing that can be found in Marx's writings and which are discussed here include: division of labour; socialisation of labour; mechanisation; increasing returns to scale; learning-by-doing; technological advancement; and overall, superior potential for cumulative productivity increases. These insights anticipate some of the thinking around the specificity of manufacturing found in twentieth-century structuralist development economics and some heterodox schools of thought such as Kaldorian approaches. This article suggests an interpretation of Marx as having a two-dimensional conceptualisation of activity specificity, with not only sectoral but also 'technological--organisational' dimensions, where these two dimensions are not fully independent of each other.
B14|Hayek – „The Road To Serfdom” Romania, Return From The „The Road To Serfdom”|This paper is a version with minor changes of the article published in issue no. 15-16 (1999) of Financial Bulletin (previous name of Financial Studies).
B14|The Environmental Aspect of “Making People Rich as the Top Priority” in China: a Marxian Perspective|Income inequality in China is severe; measured by the Gini-coefficient it amounted to 0.46 in 2011; wealth distribution is even worse with 0.61. These disparities led to a major shift in emphasis of politics in general and of the Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development by the National People´s Congress in particular. While previously the strategy of the Five-Year Plans had been “Making the nation [our emphasis] rich as top priority”, this was changed to “Making people [our emphasis] rich as top priority” in the 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-2015), enacted in March 2011.The strategic change from “nation” to “people” indicates that the political decision-makers in China accepted the aim of a fair income distribution as a political issue of great importance. In this paper, richness is defined in the political-philosophical tradition as the right measure for one’s own needs and wants; only its environmental aspect is focused on in this study. The development of the Chinese environmental conditions is compared with the German ones and the former’s future outlook is judged optimistically because of the achievements in the last five years. However, the complexity and fragility of the environmental system will within a decade confront Chinese politicians with the same problems as it does right now in Germany. In order to provide a solution addressing this development, this paper analyzes what Karl Marx had to say on the long-run dynamics of the economic system. He saw poverty as a necessary yet unintended consequence of the capitalistic system and used this insight as a “precision tool for the study of social change” (Elster 1986), which can also be employed to examine the unintended repercussions of economic activity on nature. Marx, who studied environmental and resource issues in detail, thought that the inventiveness of the capitalistic system would finally overcome all of them in the course of time. In view of the fact that three billion people on earth still have a backlog demand to satisfy basic needs and in addition a further three billion are expected to be born until 2050, the future of the natural environmental conditions looks somber. If it is not possible to decouple economic growth from ensuing environmental strain, Marx may well be right after all in his prediction that the capitalistic system will collapse, although in quite a different manner than he thought. This being the case we take recourse to the thoughts of one of the influential intellectual German figures, to Romano Guardini. He foresaw changes in the self-perception of humankind and in the comprehension of nature. These imply a shift in the ethos of government as well, which would in turn pose three great challenges to politics: (i) understanding nature in a new light, (ii) listening to what drives human hearts, and (iii) governing according to law.
B14|El concepto de excedente en la teoría marxista: debates, rupturas y perspectivas)|El concepto de excedente es central en el análisis del capitalismo. Dentro de la teoría marxista pueden identificarse dos líneas de interpretación: el concepto de excedente de Marx --como resultado del tiempo de trabajo no retribuido--, y la idea de excedente económico de Baran, --continuada por la gran mayoría de los marxistas. Los propósitos del presente trabajo son revisar las discusiones teóricas dentro de la escuela marxista en torno al concepto de excedente; identificar rupturas y continuidades entre los desarrollos teóricos de Marx y de Baran; y analizar las implicancias de utilizar una u otra definición para estudiar el proceso de acumulación.

B14|Revisiting Adam Smith's theory of the falling rate of profit|Purpose - This paper aims to present the salient features of Smith's argument of the falling rate of profit. This theory has usually been interpreted as a result of the intensification of competition in the markets of goods and services of the factors of production. This aspect of Adam Smith had been initially posed by Ricardo and subsequently was widely adopted by the major economists of the past as well as from the majority of the modern historians of economic thought. Design/methodology/approach - This paper reviews the major interpretation of the argument from Ricardo and Marx as well as from major historians of economic thought, and then attempts to reconstruct Smith's argument, which is scattered throughout the Findings - In the author's view, Smith's analysis of the falling tendency in the rate of profit is by far more complex than usually presented and that the intensification of competition is the result of the falling rate of profit rather than its cause which is the capitalization of the production process. Originality/value - This paper presents a review of existing literature and an interpretation of Adam Smith's original model of the falling rate of profit.
B14|From Marxian School Of Economic Thought To System Paradigm In Economic Studies: The Institutional Matrices Theory|The paper discusses some theoretical-methodological basis for the institutional change analysis in transitional countries. First, the paper shows the specific approach of the Marxian school of economic thought to the analysis of social and economic institutions. Second, the most general features of the system paradigm in economic theory (Kornai, 1998) are presented. Third, the institutional matrices theory, or IMT (Kirdina, 2001; Kirdina, 2001, 2010, etc.), developing Marxian approach and systemic ideas, is presented. An explanatory power of IMT is shown by the analysis of post-soviet reforms in Russia and East-European countries.
B14|A imposição do caráter social da produção por meio da concorrência [Imposition of the social nature of production through competition]|The aim of this paper is to show that for Marx, the social character of capitalist production is imposed upon private producers through competition. One direct consequence of this type of resolution of the social nature of production is that social reproduction has a turbulent character that contrasts with equilibrium.
B14|Is the Falling Rate of Profit the Driving Force Behind Globalization?|This paper examines critically the role of the law of the tendency of the falling rate of profit in the geographic expansion (globalization) of competitive capitalism. It contends that Marx did not believe there was an iron-clad connection between the falling rate of profit and globalization; in addition, it argues that Marx believed that the capitalists’ insatiable search for colonial markets was driven by their desire to overcome recurrent (and growing) realization problems in the home market arising from deficient aggregate demand on the part of both workers and capitalists.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
B14|Marxian-Radical Economics. A Heterodox Approach|Marxism emerged from the confrontation between the German philosophy, classic English economics and the French socialism. It was a philosophy, a scientific method, a new vision of economics, an economic policy and an economic system alike. The Marxian economic strain of thought was assimilated not only by its advocates, but also by the critics of this radical current: in defence of capitalism, Keynes and Schumpeter both start from Marx’s work. Starting from the work of classic economists, Marx assumes the valuable scientific elements from the dominant economic theory, but emphasizes the historical, gnosiological and class limits of the classic doctrine. Although he uses the instruments provided by the classics, the German scientist defines his own personal notional system and comes to excel in terms of abstraction. Operating with his own concepts, Marx builds up an infallible logic, which is impossible to turn over if one does not infirm the starting point of the analysis itself – the labour theory of value.
B14|Why recession and depression policies differ|This draft presents a model of internally generated growth and effective demand. It is constructed with the rationale of separating fast and slow variables. Slow variables appear as parameters. We show the reaction of profit growth to different rates of profit (slow variable) through the variation of the rate of interest and the price level (fast variables). The model is within the classical / Marxist tradition in the sense that profitability is the driving force of capital accumulation and the Marxist / post Keynesian tradition in the sense that the rate of interest is a purely monetary phenomenon depending on the competition between borrowers and lenders. Although we let prices and the rate of savings adjust to the rate of capital accumulation and the rate of interest respectively the prevailing rate of profit is the dominant force of accumulation giving insights on the characteristics of depressions and the effectiveness of various policies in that context. More specifically, the model shows the difference between fluctuations in profitability and production which characterize a recession to a standstill in profit growth which is the mark of a depression. As we will show savings adjustments are sufficient to bring an economy out of recession but are totally ineffective in depressions. Therefore, recession and depression policies should differ significantly not only quantitatively but also qualitatively. In a depression increasing, bank liquidity, trough governments and central banks, will not drive the system out of stagnation because profits are too low and outstanding debt is too high for banks to extend credit and corporations to invest. Furthermore, major restructuring involving real wage reductions, mergers and acquisitions of corporations and banks, includes the impairment of the weaker capital which will take a long undefined period of time with persistent high unemployment. Direct state investment, on the other hand, will reduce unemployment and create adequate demand to eventually drive the economy out of stagnation.
B14|Right conclusion with weak evidence: A review of|This paper reviews Andrew Kliman's The Failure of Capitalist Production (2011) with a focus on his critique of the underconsumptionist account of the current crisis. He innovatively refutes the underconsumptionist claims that the deterioration of income distribution and hence the decline of demand is the root causes of the crisis. However, his counterevidence based on the alleged rise in the share of workers' income is not strong enough to support his relevant criticism of the underconsumptionist theory and its political implications. Rather, we suggest an outline of alternative critique which would refute underconsumptionism more effectively.
B14|Ново Познанство С „Несмењивим” Министром<BR>[Reacquaintance with the „irreplaceable ” minister]|English Abstract. The paper considers the renewed interest in the life and work of Arseny Grigorevich Zverev, a long-time people’s commissioner, i.e. the USSR finance minister. The focus is on his secret report prepared for the Prime Minister I. V. Dzugashvili prior to the monetary reform of 1947, one of the most successful reforms in the whole monetary history. Having been published relatively recently in one of the newest historical journals, this report established Zverev as the true author of this reform. At the same time, it presents a brief review of the history of money and monetary systems in Russia, i.e. the USSR, including the monetary reform in the early 1920’s. Serbian Abstract. У раду се разматра обнављање интересовања за живот и дело Арсенија Григорјевича Зверева, дугогодишњег народног комесара, односно министра финансија СССР. У центру пажње је његов тајни реферат припремљен за Ј. В. Џугашвилија уочи новчане реформе 1947, једне од најуспешнијих у целокупној монетарној историји. Објављен релативно недавно у једном од новијих историјских часописа, тај реферат представио је Зверева као правог аутора ове реформе, али је истовремено у њему дат и кратак преглед историје новца и новчаног система у Русији, односно СССР, укључујући и новчану реформу из прве половине 1920-их.
B14|La significación de una Economía Ecológica radical|El surgimiento de la Economía Ecológica (EE) como campo articulador de disciplinas le ha proporcionado un importante espacio de legitimidad para abordar la relación economía-sociedad-naturaleza, requiriendo de la incorporación de un pluralismo metodológico. Ello ha derivado en la manifestación de una heterogénea expresión de corrientes contrastantes entre los practicantes de este campo; cada una partiendo de diferentes premisas epistemológicas y éticas para abordar la relación entre la racionalidad económica y la (in)sustentabilidad. La racionalidad económica (neoclásica) ha tenido fuerte presencia en los enfoques de la EE. Otros intentos metodológicos críticos evidencian el papel de tal racionalidad en la imposición de lenguajes de valoración (monetaria) de la naturaleza y en la generación de los conflictos económicos distributivos. Dado el contexto de una crisis de civilización manifestado en los ámbitos socio-económicos y ambientales, el ejercicio crítico de pluralismo metodológico es altamente relevante. En este artículo se plantea que la perspectiva marxista puede enriquecer a dicho enfoque, no solo en la comprensión de la crisis socio-ambiental y económica que padecemos actualmente, sino también en la identificación de estrategias para su transformación. Esta exploración es identificada como una aportación al necesario debate de la significación de una versión radical de la EE.
B14|En torno a la libertad: Consideraciones entre Trotsky y Friedman|La cuestión de la libertad, en la teoría económica moderna, se ha manifestado siempre como un concepto abstracto e impreciso, esto porque las diversas corrientes intelectuales se han apropiado de él para sustentar las bases axiológicas de sus respectivas doctrinas, otorgándole una multiplicidad de sentidos e intenciones que no permiten una comprensión homogénea del término. En el presente ensayo se analizará la relevancia de discernir las distintas intenciones en torno a la libertad, confrontando la teoría de la libertad económica de Friedman respecto de la tesis bolchevique del trabajo obligatorio plasmada en la obra temprana de Trotsky, con el propósito de revelar la incompatibilidad entre la libertad individual y la liberación colectiva.
B14|Financialization and Marx: some reflections on Bryan’s, Martin’s and Rafferty’s argumentation|The recent theoretical works of the authors provide thorough insights into the workings of contemporary capitalism. Derivatives are the key issue involved here. They comprehend financialization as a development within, rather than a distortion of, capitalist production. They nevertheless underestimate the ability of Marx’s analytical categories to capture the essence of contemporary organization of capitalism. A return to Marx is not only helpful but is also indispensable for clarification of some unformed aspects in their analysis. What is actually involved in financialization is not just the emergence of a structure enabling more effective valuation of financial assets; it is also the development of a technology of power that is superimposed on existing power relations for the purpose of organizing their functioning.
B14|Hilferding on Derivatives|Rudolf Hilferding is a leading Marxist scholar. But Hilferding's approach to derivatives has been left untouched. The paper aims at contributing to the literature. Hilferding realized that the development of the stock exchange was parallel to the development of standardized derivative exchanges. Hilferding understood the economic significance that derivative markets have for the organization of capitalism. The intention of incorporating the futures market in his general approach using Marxian theoretical categories is significant in the long tradition of political economy.
B14|Marx: From Hegel and Feuerbach to Adam Smith|This paper discusses the development of Marx's thought over a period of something like fifteen months, between the spring of 1843 and the autumn of 1844. The focus of the paper is Marx's first encounter with classical political economy as he found it in the Wealth of Nations. The outcome of this encounter was presented by Marx in his Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844. It is argued here that in the classical theory, with which he had hitherto been largely unfamiliar, Marx found all the elements he needed to synthesise the philosophical standpoint he had developed in the preceding months with political economy. The Manuscripts represent the first crucial stage in the development of this synthesis. This first encounter of Marx with classical political economy, and his first steps in the development of his synthesis, have received hardly any attention in the literature. The present paper seeks to fill this gap.
B14|Michal Kalecki and Rosa Luxemburg on Marx’s schemes of reproduction: two incisive interpreters of capitalism|Both Rosa Luxemburg and Michal Kalecki utilised Marx’s scheme’s or reproduction as the starting point of their analysis of economic dynamics. However, Luxemburg did not realise that they were not meant to serve as models of capitalist growth, but rather to show that the conditions for stable growth were unachievable. Luxemburg was an early proponent of the stagnationist thesis which was popularised by Kalecki, Steindl, Baran and Sweezy. She argued that capitalist economies were doomed to stagnate unless markets outside the capitalist arena could be utilised, although she also acknowledged the importance of government expenditure on armaments. Kalecki, while acknowledging some of the limitations of her analysis, was able to extend it to incorporate the main elements of modern capitalist growth.
B14|Regression Model for Proportions with Probability Masses at Zero and One|In many settings, the variable of interest is a proportion with high concentration of data at the boundaries. This paper proposes a regression model for a fractional variable with nontrivial probability masses at the extremes. In particular, the dependent variable is assumed to be a mixed random variable, obtained as the mixture of a Bernoulli and a beta random variables. The extreme values of zero and one are modelled by a logistic regression model. The values belonging to the interval (0,1) are assumed beta distributed and their mean and dispersion are jointly modelled by using two link functions. The regression model here proposed accommodates skewness and heteroscedastic errors. Finally, an application to loan recovery process of Italian banks is also provided.
B14|A Autonomização das Formas Verdadeiramente Sociais na Teoria de Marx: Comentários sobre o Dinheiro no Capitalismo Contemporâneo|If we adopt a dialectical (Hegelian) reading of Marx’s theory of money, we can see that money contains within it the contradiction of commodity itself (between use-value and value) and in so doing, it contains different strata of contradiction that logically and historically have come to the fore. In this process, the truly social forms (for example money – as opposed to commodity, means of circulation – as opposed to measure of value, inconvertible money – as opposed to commodity money, and so on) seem to be stronger than their counterparts (social forms) and, because of this, there is a movement towards an autonomization of these forms. In this sense, value becomes autonomous from use-value; as medium of circulation, the abstract that money represents becomes autonomous from the concrete that the measure of value requires; as medium of payment, money becomes autonomous from the commodity circulation that has produced it, and so on. This paper aims to show that these movements may be behind some of the contemporary phenomena we are currently observing in the sphere of capital circulation (for example, the inconvertible US dollar acting as universal money, the “financialisation” of the valorization process, the spilling over of monetary crisis, bubbles and crashes, etc). Recent literature dealing with some of these themes, such as, Moseley (2004, 2005); Foley (2005); Harvey (2006, 1982); Chesnais (2005, 2008), will also be discussed.

B14|Marx in 1869: Notebook B113, The Economist and The Money Market Review|This paper presents Notebook B113, one of Marx’s unpublished manuscripts, and suggests its importance for highlighting the monetary and financial issues which Marx was investigating after 1867. A combination of deciphering an index prepared by Marx and reading the 1868 editions of The Economist and The Money Market Review may help to improve the understanding of Part Five, Volume III of Capital. A preliminary investigation of Marx’s references to the crisis of 1866 in Notebook B113, and the lack of references to this same crisis in Volume III of Capital supports the conjecture of this paper.

Se utilizarán conceptos de teoría de conjuntos y lógica difusa para formalizar algunos temas relacionados con funciones cognitivas y relaciones de preferencia.
B14|TRIBUTOS Y REBELIONES: La Influencia de las Reformas Borbónicas en las rebeliones de pre-independencia en América|En la historia de la humanidad, las sociedades han recurrido a las rebeliones (pacíficas o violentas) con el fin de eliminar las presiones e injusticias existentes en un periodo determinado para establecer unas condiciones nuevas o para volver a un estado anterior que se considera mejor. Las distintas rebeliones sucedidas en América Latina (en especial los virreinatos de la Nueva España, del Perú y de la Nueva Granada) durante el siglo XVIII, fueron fuertemente influenciadas por las reformas políticas y fiscales de la Corona española en manos de los Borbones quienes intentaron modernizar el aparato administrativo y fiscal de la corona con el fin de adaptarse al nuevo entorno económico-político mundial que comenzaba a liderar Gran Bretaña.
B14|Una primera aproximación a la evaluación del impacto de la neuroeconomía para la teoría económica|El reciente auge de la neuroeconomía ha abierto una serie de preguntas sobre el impacto que esta nueva disciplina puede tener sobre la forma en que se hace teoría económica. Este trabajo busca resaltar la relevancia que la metodología en ciencia económica tiene como herramienta indispensable para resolver las preguntas y los retos que la neuroeconomía le plantea a la corriente principal. Se recopilan aquí los principales argumentos a favor y en contra de los aportes que la neuroeconomía puede brindarle a la economía. Se concluye a favor de una visión que deja abierta la posibilidad de un avance y un aporte sustancial, pero por ahora sólo potencial. Al tiempo se señalan las técnicas retóricas usadas por los exponentes de la corriente neuroeconómica con el ánimo de plantear una discusión donde no se demeriten los avances, pero tampoco se exageren los mismos.
B14|Money in the Grundrisse|The chapter on Money in the Grundrisse shows clearly that the presentation of the nature, properties and functions of money is opposed to the monetary theory of Utopian socialism. Marx emphasizes easily that the exchange value spontaneously objectifies itself in a money distinct from the commodity, but he needs to establish that the distribution of labour activities is mediated by the exchange of labour products under commodity mode of production, to make appear the confusion at the core of the Proudhonians’ reform between exchange of living labour and exchange of labour products and then, the necessity that money embodies itself in a specific commodity.
B14|Education, Growth And Distribution: Classical-Marxian Economic Thought And A Simple Model|This paper examines the interaction between education, growth and distribution from a classical-Marxian perspective. It first briefly examines classical-Marxian ideas on the relation between education and growth and income distribution. Drawing on these ideas to the extent that they are relevant for contemporary capitalist economies, it then develops a simple dynamic model of growth and distribution to analyze the effects of the spread of education on profitability, accumulation, distribution and growth.
B14|Is Globalization Inevitable in the Marxian Paradigm?|This paper examines Marx's views on globalization and its supposed inevitability, and contends that they underwent a substantial evolution and revision after the publication of the Communist Manifesto. In the case of China, a prime example of the Asiatic mode of production, Marx even doubted whether globalization (capitalism) would ever be able to accomplish its historical mission of developing the forces of production and creating the material conditions for a higher mode of production, viz., Communism. While in the Russian case, he seriously entertained the notion that it could bypass the hardships and vicissitudes of capitalism and forge its own unique path to socialism. If accepted, this interpretation represents a serious challenge to the universality and validity of Marx's materialist conception of history.
B14|Technical change, unemployment and labor skills|Purpose - This paper aims to contribute to the open, theoretical debate upon the effects of technical change on the production and labor process. Design/methodology/approach - The “optimistic” approach, which connects the compensation mechanisms and human capital theory, is compared to the dynamic approach of the labor process. Recent Labor Force Survey data are used to identify the trends and characteristics of labor markets in G-7 countries. Findings - In all G-7 countries, unemployment is present and deepening in the last two decades, whereas any employment growth observed is mainly associated with part-time, temporary, low-paid and vulnerable jobs. Moreover, any rise in employment rates refers rather exclusively to unskilful labor. Practical implications - Neither the increase in effective demand (high growth rates), nor the relaxation of labor market rigidities could lead to a sufficient employment growth that would evade unemployment. In addition, the increased investment in human capital failed to upscale workers' position in the production process. Originality/value - The value of this paper lies in its acknowledgement that an effectual policy agenda for labor-related issues should break apart from conventional beliefs that the increase in flexibility of labor market, the abolishment of asymmetries in supply and demand of labor skills and the enhancement of economy's effective demand could cope and provide a solution to current labor market hazards.
B14|Formalizing a new approach to economic policy - Bent Hansen, Gösta Rehn and the Swedish model|In the early postwar years, two trade-union economists, Gösta Rehn and Rudolf Meidner, presented a Swedish alternative to Keynesianism. The so-called Rehn- Meidner model recommends restrictive macroeconomic policies, labor market policy programs and solidarity wages to combine price stability with economic growth, equity and full employment. In the 1950s, Bent Hansen evaluated the effects of the Rehn-Meidner policy and the validity of its underpinning theory. Hansen’s rigor analysis shall not conceal that, even together with Rehn, he was unable to shed light on the positive relationship between average profits and labor scarcity in the Rehn-Meidner model or all relations between its policy means.
B14|The Financial Crisis Viewed from the Perspective of the “Social Costs” Theory|"This paper examines the causes and consequences of the current global financial crisis. It largely relies on the work of Hyman Minsky, although analyses by John Kenneth Galbraith and Thorstein Veblen of the causes of the 1930s collapse are used to show similarities between the two crises. K.W. Kapp's ""social costs"" theory is contrasted with the recently dominant ""efficient markets"" hypothesis to provide the context for analyzing the functioning of financial institutions. The paper argues that, rather than operating ""efficiently,"" the financial sector has been imposing huge costs on the economy-costs that no one can deny in the aftermath of the economy's collapse. While orthodox approaches lead to the conclusion that money and finance should not matter much, the alternative tradition-from Veblen and Keynes to Galbraith and Minsky-provides the basis for developing an approach that puts money and finance front and center. Including the theory of social costs also generates policy recommendations more appropriate to an economy in which finance matters."
B14|Classical competition and regulating capital: theory and empirical evidence|Abstract In this article we discuss the salient features of the classical and neoclassical theories of competition and we test their fundamental propositions using data from Greek manufacturing industries. The cross section data of 3-digit (total 91) industries of the three (pooled together) census years show no evidence of a direct statistical relationship between the degree of concentration and profitability. The econometric analysis of time series data for 2-digit industries lends support to the hypothesis for the long-run tendential equalization of incremental rates of profit to the economy’s average.
B14|Classical vs. Neoclassical Conceptions of Competition|This article discusses two major conceptions of competition, the classical and the neoclassical. In the classical conception, competition is viewed as a dynamic rivalrous process of firms struggling with each other over the expansion of their market shares at the expense of their competitors. This dynamic view of competition characterizes mainly the works of Smith, Ricardo, J.S. Mill and Marx; a similar view can be also found in the writings of Austrian economists and the business literature. By contrast, the neoclassical conception of competition is derived from the requirements of a theory geared towards static equilibrium and not from any historical observation of the way in which firms actually organize and compete with each other.
B14|Smith’s “Perfect Liberty” and Marx’s Equalized Rate of Surplus-Value|Marx’s theory of surplus-value is fundamental to his innovations in the theory of value and Classical Political Economy. When Marx’s theory of surplus-value is considered in the context of the long-period method, the dynamics of surplus-value and its importance to Marx’s overall framework can be properly presented. This approach reveals that Marx’s use of an equalized rate of surplus-value across sectors of production in Volume III of Capital is not merely a convenient assumption. The equalization of the sectoral rate of surplus-value is in fact one of the central tendencies of Marx’s framework, and is elevated to the level of an economic law by Marx. The reasoning behind Marx’s use of an equalized rate of surplus-value is the mobility of labor found in Adam Smith. This reasoning, when combined with the long-period method, reveals that the rate of surplus-value across sectors is subject to the same turbulent dynamics and equalization process as the rate of profit, and should not be deviated from when applying Marx’s vision.
B14|Exploitation and its unintended outcomes. An axiomatic obituary for Marx’s surplus value|The present paper scrutinizes the logical foundation of Marx’s dialectic analysis of the evolving money economy. The minimalistic frame of reference is thereby given with the set of structural axioms. It turns out, first, that the commonplace notion of exploitation has to be replaced by crossover exploitation among capitalists and workers; second, that the concept of surplus value cannot explain the existence and magnitude of overall profits; finally, that the real shares of output are determined in the spheres of income and expenditure and not, as classical, Marxian and neoclassical economists unanimously maintain, in the sphere of production.
B14|The evolution of environmental thinking in economics|This paper discusses the development of environmental economics from the Industrial Revolution in Europe to today. Specifically, it comments on the general similarities and differences between the representatives of the schools of economic thought concerning the environment. Among others, the issues of scarcity of natural resources, of population growth as well as the limits to growth are discussed and the various views are presented. The paper also comments on the trends of environmental, evolutionary and ecological economics.
B14|Competition|Volume III contains entries on the development of major fields in economics from the inception of systematic analysis until modern times. The reader is provided with succinct summary accounts of the main problems, the methods used to address them and the results obtained across time. The emphasis is on both the continuity and the major changes that have occurred in the economic analysis of problematic issues such as economic growth, income distribution, employment, inflation, business cycles and financial instability. Each Handbook can be read individually and acts as a self-contained volume in its own right. It can be purchased separately or as part of a three-volume set.

B14|Crisis, Marxism, and Economic Laws: A Response to Gary Mongiovi|Gary Mongiovi accurately cites my thesis, presented in Freeman (2010a) (henceforth referred to as Positivist Marxism and abbreviated to PM), that “capitalism's inner laws express themselves in … different ways during booms and during crises” and that “When the business cycle is in an upswing … the tensions and contradictions that will eventually interrupt the process of capital accumulation are camouflaged by the commodity form, and so appear as natural laws of motion.” He also expresses general agreement with this thesis, but complains that the way I present it is “marred by a gratuitous methodological argument” which is “misleading and therefore stand[s] in the way of productive discussion.” The methodological argument in question is that no theory based on the method of static equilibrium can provide an explanation of endogenous capitalist crisis; this is the main issue I address in this response. PM applies this argument in order to examine a theoretical current that dominates Western, academic, Marxism. This current interprets Marx's theory as a variant of general equilibrium. In this response I refer to it as simultaneist Marxism (SM).
B14|Relaţii Diplomatice Româno-Portugheze (1919-1933). Martinho De Brederode - Ambasador La Bucureşti<BR>[Romanian-Portuguese Diplomatic Relations (1919-1933). Martinho De Brederode - Ambassador in Bucharest]|"Romanian Abstract: Problematica relaţiilor internaţionale este una de actualitate şi de interes pentru istoriografia europeană, având la bază cunoaşterea legăturilor dintre state, fie ele politice, economice, culturale, militare, religioase etc. În România, în ultimii ani, s-a înregistrat o dezvoltare prodigioasă a cercetărilor ştiinţifice privind relaţiile diplomatice ale statului român cu statele Europei sau ale lumii. Au apărut numeroase lucrări de specialitate, rezultate ale cercetătorilor consacraţi sau ale tinerilor doctoranzi, aflaţi în căutarea ineditului, interesaţi să privească dincolo de graniţele României. Schimbarea regimului politic din România, după 1989, a permis studenţilor şi intelectualilor români să se alăture şi ei efortului de a se rupe din îmbrăţişarea sovietică şi de a se reuni cu cealaltă Europă, cea occidentală. Programele europene, prin bursele oferite, au creat cadrul favorabil studierii în Europa şi pentru studenţii cu mai puţine posibilităţi materiale. În 2003 am beneficiat şi noi de o asemenea oportunitate şi am ales ca destinaţie Universitatea din Coimbra, Portugalia. Aici am cunoscut oameni deosebiţi, colegi extraordinari, profesori dispuşi dialogului şi înclinaţi spre ideea sprijinirii tinerilor cercetători. Sistemul universitar exigent în egală măsură cu toţi studenţii, indiferent de naţionalitatea acestora, a ridicat pretenţia prezentării unor proiecte bazate pe materiale de arhivă, inedite. A fost primul nostru contact cu Arhivele Diplomatice din Ministerul Afacerilor Externe, de la Lisabona. Astfel, a apărut ideea prezentei lucrări, în fapt teza noastră de doctorat: Din istoria relaţiilor diplomatice româno-portugheze. Martinho de Brederode – diplomat (1919-1933). Aria cercetării noastre s-a extins, pe de o parte, asupra relaţiilor bilaterale în contextul relaţiilor internaţionale şi al politicii generale portugheze faţă de Balcani, iar pe de altă parte am insistat asupra raporturilor directe dintre România şi Portugalia, având drept reper în demersul nostru corespondenţa şi activitatea diplomatică a Ministrului portughez Martinho de Brederode. English Abstract: The book analyzes the Portugal bilateral relations with countries in Europe, Africa and Asia, in the international context of the late nineteenth century and beginning of the twentieth century, through the diplomatic activity carried by Martinho de Brederode. His correspondence, along with other published and unpublished sources consulted, gives the researcher the opportunity to outline the general Portuguese policy towards the Balkan nations and highlight the direct relationship stablished between Romania and Portugal, highlighting the ""difficulties in the international promotion of Romanian interests of the time, but the manner in which diplomats in Bucharest understood or wanted to understand the reality de facto"". Martinho de Brederode begins his career as official of the Lusitanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 20 April 1889, with a mission to attach to the Portuguese Legation in Brussels. His career continued with the appointment in Tanger (Marocco), Peking (Macao), Paris, Rome, and finally in the Balkans (Romania, Serbia and Greece)."
B14|Marx’s social analysis of value and Big Pharma. Rethinking the social determinants of value in cognitive capitalism|By analyzing the capitalist dynamics at work in the knowledge-based economy, cognitive capitalism has shown that the classical laws of value creation do not hold anymore. Rethinking the laws of value, however, is no easy task. The first section of this paper reconsiders Marx’s analysis of value, and demonstrates that Marx struggled by trying to mix two distinct and incompatible conceptions of value: the embodied labour approach and the social analysis of value. The paper argues that the former must be abandoned and that we need to focus only on the latter in order to better understand how value is being produced. To analyze the social production of value in cognitive capitalism, the second part of this paper builds on the case of the global pharmaceutical sector.
B14|Revitalizing Marxist Theory For Today'S Capitalism|[Part I] As a few alert mainstream and corporate economists rediscover the certain elements of Marx’s analysis of capitalism, the essays in the first part of this volume demonstrate that they have much more to discover. To their discredit, mainstream understandings – whether of capitalism’s growth or of western capitalism’s interrelated long-term stagnation and financialization – are derailed precisely by political aversion to, or ignorance of, Marxist categories and analyses. [Part II] The chapters in the second part extend Marxist insights into assessing the value of the so-called information, or knowledge-based, commodities, and offer a Marxist critique of Lenin, the only world leader who earlier had deeply studied his own country's economy. The part also presents two important works in translation. The first, read by Marx himself, raises serious questions about the relevance of Hegel in the understanding of Capital and offers its own insightful analysis. The other, by a Marxist collective in the 1970s demonstrates the centrality of politics and the class struggle in the allegedly ‘economic’ devalorization of constant capital. [Part III] The final part contains a debate on the merits of ‘positivist Marxism’ sparked by an article in Volume 26.
B14|The Limits of Radical Institutionalism: A Marxian Critique of Thorstein Veblenâ€™s Political Economy|Some commentators pose Veblenâ€™s political economy as a corrective to the â€œreductionistâ€ character of Marxism. This article counters by highlighting the primary source of differences between Veblen and Marx: their methods. Veblenâ€™s generalized conceptions of monopoly and technology, for example, misread the specificity of the systemic logic of capitalism. These dynamics are fully captured only in Marxâ€™s movement from simple, abstract laws to complex, concrete reality, where â€œnon-economicâ€ factors are not reduced to the economic, but rather intervene at a later moment of the concretization process. JEL classification: B14, B15, P16
B14|The influence of American economists on the Clayton and Federal Trade Commission Acts|The aim of this paper is to analyze American economists’ influence in the passing of the Clayton and Federal Trade Commission Acts (1914). Specifically, it is argued and documented that American economists were important in this process in two ways. Many economists exercised an “indirect” influence by discussing in academic journals and books problems concerning trusts, combinations, and the necessary measures to preserve the working of competitive markets. At least as importantly, if not more so, some economists took an active role in the reform movement both contributing to draft proposals for the amendment of existing antitrust legislation and providing help and advice during the Congressional debates which led to the passing of the FTC and Clayton Acts. Among these, we will focus primarily, albeit not exclusively, on the contribution of John Bates Clark.
B14|An Aristotelian View of Marx’s Method|A number of Marxist scholars have tied aspects of Marx’s thought to certain Aristotelian categories, yet remarkably little is said of Marx’s dialectical materialism in this literature. Here we attempt to lay a foundation for such an effort, paying particular attention to the way in which Aristotle’s mediated starting point resonates in Marx’s method. While Hegel is able to grasp man’s self-creation as a process, his dialectical method proceeds from an unmediated starting point, and impresses Idealism upon the Aristotelian categories. In rejecting the Idealist dimensions of Hegel’s dialectic, Marx implicitly reclaims the materialist dimensions of Aristotle’s system. It will be argued here that such an interpretation sheds important light on the nature of Marx’s departure from Hegel, and on his method in Capital.
B14|Marx’s Appreciation of James Steuart: A Theory of History and Value|This paper argues that despite a growing body of scholarly literature on Sir James Steuart, his theory of history and influence on Marxian political economy has been largely ignored. The approach of this paper is motivated, in part, by Marx’s sympathetic treatment of Steuart found in the opening of his Theories of Surplus Value, and in scattered asides throughout the remainder of his work. We argue that Steuart’s importance to students of the history of political economy is three-fold: First, following Marx, we consider the unique and dynamic role played by history in Steuart’s system. Steuart appears to have been the first thinker in political economy to both recognize the historical specificity of capitalism, and to conspicuously incorporate that realization into his system. Secondly, in Steuart’s approach to the question of value and profit we find conceptions that defy easy classification. Steuart is seen to plainly abandon the mercantilist understanding of profit as determined in the sphere of exchange alone, and to treat what he calls the real value of a commodity as intimately related to its necessary labor time. Finally, we argue that Steuart’s contemporary notoriety made him far more influential than is commonly recognized. In particular, we contend that Steuart, via Hegel, may have exercised an indirect influence on Marx’s own theory of history, in ways that Marx could not have recognized.
B14|Credit, Fictitious Capital and Financial Crises: reviewing the antecedents of the current crisis|This paper deals with the current financial crisis from a Post-Keynesian and Marxist perspective. The more objective character of Marx‟s crises conception is compared with the more subjective origin of crises in Keynesian‟s ideas. This analysis is used to conduct a revision of critical literature about the antecedents of the current crisis, verifying its teachings. The central relationship between capitalist logic, credit and fictitious capital is emphasized, and also the relation with neoliberalism.

B14|Karl Marx: dinero, capital y crisis|"Resumen:El objetivo de este texto es hacer una presentación sintética de la teoría económica de Marx. El núcleo central de su teoría consta de tres estudios: un análisis sobre el valor, un análisis del capital y de la plusvalía y un análisis sobre el dinero. El análisis del valor está basado en el doble carácter del trabajo: trabajo privado concreto que produce valor de uso y trabajo social abstracto productor de valor. El análisis del capital y de la plusvalía está basado en la existencia de una mercancía particular: la fuerza de trabajo, la cual produce una plusvalía apropiada por el capital, puesto que su uso en la producción permite la creación de un valor que resulta ser superior a aquel constatado en el intercambio. La teoría del dinero, una vez descartamos la demostración imposible de que el dinero es una mercancía particular, se concibe en Marx en torno a dos conceptos: unidad de cuenta (dinero ideal"") y medio de compra (dinero ""real""). Esta teoría abre entonces una vía para responder a las preguntas dejadas sin respuesta por la teoría del valor y la teoría del capital y de la plusvalía."""
B14|Some reflections on the dependence of prices on Labour-Values|"Con frecuencia se cree, de una manera bastante esquizofrénica, que una teoría del valor solo debe resolver la cuestión de los precios relativos"" (un problema microeconómico), siendo principalmente la teoría del dinero de la pieza necesaria para la determinación monetaria o del nivel absoluto de los precios (un problema macroeconómico).Por una parte, la determinación del nivel de precios se encuentra teóricamente antes de cualquier consideración del mercado de dinero, mientras que por otro lado ninguna teoría del valor puede aspirar a ser completa sin la determinacióndel nivel absoluto de los valores. Se verá en este trabajo que sólo la teoría del valor trabajo (TVL) puede realizar ambas tareas, produciendo así la integridad y la unidad de la teoría económica."""
B14|Valeur absolue, valeur relative et travail|What do we mean when we speak about the value of work? This article tries to provide an answer to this question by analysing the notions of value and its different forms: absolute and relative value, use value and exchange value, evaluation and the creation of value. It draws especially on Marx’s doctrine of work in capitalism and the communist society.
B14|Pauvreté et économie au XIXe siècle|Poverty was an ubiquitous theme in the literature of the beginning of the 19th century, and its analysis shifted from political or charitable perspectives to embrace a young science, namely the political economy. Stendhal’s example shows how political economy had become the only legitimate approach to viewing poverty. This article examines two economic theories that explained the causes of poverty and the means of eradicating it. One is liberal and the other is reformist. They were formulated by two emblematic authors, Ricardo and Walras. Divergences between the two theories arise less from their ideological and doctrinal oppositions than from their epistemological differences.
B14|Land Conflicts, Property Rights, and the Rise of the Export Economy in Colombia, 1850–1925|This research attempts to explain the poor performance of the Colombian economy in the world markets during the late nineteenth century. Based on data on exportable production at the municipal level in 1892, coffee production in 1925 and of public land allocation and land conflicts during the nineteenth and twentieth century, we found that the greatest obstacle that faced Colombian export development was the weakness of settlers´ property rights in the frontier lands. The quantitative results show that in the absence of land conflicts, the municipality´s exportable production would have been at least twice as muchas that observed.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
B14|Équilibre Et Possibilité De Crises Dans Le Modèle De Reproduction Élargie De Marx|In the numerical examples used by Marx to study the reproduction of social capital, the economy reaches a steady growth path in only two periods. This surprising outcome has been interpreted by Marx‟s readers as a property of a model which excludes any sort of economic crisis. This paper shows that this is not the case. Depending on the proportion between sectors and on the accumulation rate in the sector producing the means of production, two kinds of crises can occur. Following a suggestion of Marx, we emphasize the analysis of the physical conditions of reproduction and, on such a basis, we determine the critical proportions beyond which a crisis occurs. If, as in Marx, commodities are exchanged at their labor value, the critical proportions will be changed
B14|Von Mises, Kantorovich and in-natura calculation|The article reviews the idea of calculation in kind. It is argued that Kantorovich and subsequent mathematicians essentially validated the idea of in-kind calculation. This has not been evident because Kantorovich nowhere deals with the Austrian school and they for their part have ignored him. The article continues by examining improvements in linear optimisation since Kantorovich and the implications these have for economic planning. Finally it discusses the problem of deriving the plan ray in the context of markets for consumer goods.
B14|Desenvolvendo a solidariedade no caminho da transição: um ensaio sobre a teoria do socialismo a partir de Marx|Developing the solidarity in the path to transition: an essay on the socialism theory based on Marx - According to the main ideas that one may extract from Marx?s works on a transition theory, the socialism would be an intermediate stage for a superior system ? the communism ? made possible only after the complete development of the productive forces, capitalism?s ?historical mission?. This thesis represents one of Marx?s biggest controversies and history has demonstrated that the reproduction and the expansion of the capitalism have not been limited by the advance of the technique ? and that neither a transition process would emerge from a sudden revolutionary reaction. In this work, we put on discussion some aspects of Marx?s thought, his transition theory and the current process of crisis of the reproduction of the capitalist relations of production. In the conclusions, a series of experiences of self-management with the heading of solidarity economics are discussed.

In the light of the ""New Value Controversy"" which opposed neo-Marxist and Sraffian theorists, the author of this essay, a critical Marxist, reconsiders Marx’s labour theory of value. Attention is paid to the Marxian analysis of capital, value and surplus value. The truthfulness of the crucial but unproven Marxian assumption of equality of new value and living labour is questioned. A matrix model describing the productive structure of a capitalist system is used for this purpose. Marx’s labour theory of value is then examined in relation to the theories of capital and investment, which deal with value in process. Some recent suggestions to improve the reckoning of real costs of production are analysed. A draft of a labour-and-capital theory of value is outlined. And as a measure of value a ""monetary expression of value"" (MEV) is proposed, instead of the ""monetary expression of labour time"" (MELT)."
B14|Equilibre et possibilité de crises dans le modèle de reproduction élargie de Marx|In the numerical examples used by Marx to study the reproduction of social capital, the economy reaches a steady growth path in only two periods. This surprising outcome has been interpreted by Marx’s readers as a property of a model which excludes any sort of economic crisis. This paper shows that this is not the case. Depending on the proportion between sectors and on the accumulation rate in the sector producing the means of production, two kinds of crises can occur. Following a suggestion of Marx, we emphasize the analysis of the physical conditions of reproduction and, on such a basis, we determine the critical proportions beyond which a crisis occurs. If, as in Marx, commodities are exchanged at their labor value, the critical proportions will be changed.
B14|Income distribution, persistent unemployment, and the classical growth cycle:evidence from South Africa|I formulate and calibrate a small 3D classical growth cycle model to explain the rise of income inequality, growth stagnation and the persistence of unemployment in South Africa between 1970-2005. This model exhibits interactions between economic growth, the employment rate, and the rate of profit. Simulation of the estimated model produces an underlying 59-year growth cycle for the South African economy, which is close to the one observed in the data. I find that the South African economy entered a phase of employment-enhancing growth in output around 2005, implying an estimated 37-year depression of the labour market.

It is shown that a falling rate of profit is not a necessity for the capitalist mode of production.
B14|Greece and the EU: capitalist crisis and imperialist rivalries|This paper studies the relationship between Greek capitalism and the European Union in the light of the recent developments (i.e. the current global crisis and the fiscal and debt crisis of Greece). The first part analyses the turbulent historical course of Greek capitalism and its passage from phases of development to crises and waves of capitalist restructuring. In particular, it pinpoints its status as a second-generation middle-range capitalism with limited imperialist abilities. The second part analyses the position of Greek capitalism within the European imperialist bloc and the advantages but also the dangers stemming from its participation in it. It focuses especially on the waves of capitalist restructuring inaugurated after the 1973 crisis and their concomitant results and problems. The third part focuses on the current global crisis and how it has been expressed in Greece. It is depicted as a twin crisis, i.e. a combination of (a) the current global crisis (a crisis of overaccumulation of capital caused by the falling tendency of the rate of profit), with (b) particular Greek structural problems (most of them derived from its participation in the European imperialist bloc). The last part concludes with the proposal for a radical alternative to the policies of the EU and the Greek bourgeoisie. The main pillar of this proposal is the disengagement from the European imperialist integration process and the radical restructuring of the Greek economy towards a process of socialist transition.
B14|Brains that make revolutions: the neural theory in the French Revolutions (1789-99, 1848-51, 1870-71), Iran (1977-81) and Bolshevik (1917-1924)|This paper work assesses the key aspects of a framework for research on revolutions. Our approach includes a heuristic based on an idea suggested by Marx in the 18th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte: “The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brain of the living”. From this maxim of Marx advance on conventional interpretations by postulating that the language and metaphors are a challenge in several respects: (1) The brain is a physical basis for understanding key political revolutions, (2) advances in neuroscience and language (Lakoff/Johnson/Narayanan) have allowed the reconstruction of conceptual frameworks in various fields, including philosophy, mathematics and politics (3) The language expressed in songs, text, flags, emblems, illustrations, slogans, speeches and rumors is key to represent and demonstrate loyalty to the idea of revolution and, more crucially, to “make” the revolution, (4) Metaphors are a powerful rational action in revolutionary processes. One interpretation of these can contribute to decipher, for example, how the brain are activated in neural systems that link past and present, how to operate the symbolic frameworks of language to influence political opinion, how metaphors interact with processes artificial simulation or how metaphors evolve in a revolution from simple metaphors.
B14|The Exaggerate Socialism Of Raul’s Cuba|Cuba’s post-revolutionary economic history was penalized by the twin sets of distortions stemming from its former, artificial trade relations with the CMEA and from the very nature of the state socialist model, let alone the severe costs imposed by the US embargo. Conversely, Cuba’s centralized resource allocation system and the consistent priority accorded to the satisfaction of basic needs were instrumental in engineering a remarkable accumulation of human capital and an extraordinary development of public services, and serendipitously endowed the country with a lingering comparative advantage in some advanced, knowledge-based services sectors. However, the tension between Cuba’s exceptional human development achievements and the weakness of their material foundation cannot be maintained indefinitely. The intrinsic deficiencies of the central planning mechanism, the need for expanding the role of the market and of monetary-commercial relations, and the inescapability of respecting the law of value and the socialist principle of distribution according to work should be fully acknowledged and translated in a structural reform program. The ultimate goal of such a program should be that of definitely superseding the traditional state socialist model, leading to a transition towards a specifically Cuban form of market socialism.
B14|Cuba: the surge of export-oriented services|Since the inception of the special period and the loss of its traditional export markets for sugar and other goods, Cuba has turned towards services as new sources of foreign exchange. Tourism has been reactivated and its performance has been broadly satisfactory, yet its long term growth potential should not be overstated. Since the mid-2000s, a new sector - professional services - has become the island's largest foreign exchange earner. Cuba's comparative advantage in this sector is the product of decades of human capital investment in social services. Yet, the sustainability of Cuba's present trade structure cannot be taken for granted. In the future, export-oriented professional services, and the health cluster in particular, might not only contribute to release the balance of payments constrain, but also play a pivotal role in steering the evolution Cuba's economy towards a knowledge-based development path. To this purpose, however, major changes in the area of industrial and macroeconomic policies are required.
B14|Από Την Οικονομική Άνθηση Στην Κρίση Του 1930<BR>[From Economic Prosperity to the Depression of 1930s]|This chapter starts with a discussion of the economic situation in the USA and UK in the 1920s and 1930s and argues that the fundamentals of these two economies in the 1920s were already in a bad shape. In fact, we show that in the US economy the fall in the rate of profit and the stagnation of the mass of real profits preceded the collapse of the stock market in the 1929 and the depression of 1930s. The discussion continues with the economic and political situation in the case of the Greek economy and the way in which she was affected by the depression. From the study of the Greek economy in the 1930s, we derive some useful conclusions that may shed new light to the current depression and debt problems of the Greek economy.
B14|Crisis and “law of motion” in economics: a critique of positivist Marxism|This chapter restores the concepts of freedom, consciousness, and choice to our understanding of “economic laws,” so we may discuss how to respond to economic crisis. These are absent from orthodox economics that presents “globalization” or “the markets” as the outcome of unstoppable forces outside human control.They were integral to the emancipatory political economy of Karl Marx but have been lost to Marxism, which appears as the inspiration for mechanical, fatalistic determinism. This confusion arises from Marxism's absorption of the idea, originating in French positivism, that social laws are automatic and inevitable.The chapter contests the organizing principle of this view: that economic laws are predictive, telling us what must happen. Marx's laws are relational, not predictive, laying bare the connection between two apparently distinct forms of appearance of the same thing, such as labor and price. Such laws open the door to democracy and choice, but do not unambiguously predict the future because what happens depends on our actions.The commodity form conceals these laws, disguising the true social and class relations of society. Accumulation, however, undermines the circumstances that permit the commodity to play this role. The result is crisis, defined in this chapter as the point when the blind laws of the commodity form are suspended and open political forces come into play.In past crises, capitalism has restored the rate of profit through such destructive interventions as imperialism, war, and fascism. Economic laws, properly defined, offer society the real choice of alternative outcomes from crisis.
B14|What Causes Booms?|This paper was presented to the joint conference of the AFEP, AHE and IIPPE in Paris, July 2012. A more developed and substantially revised version was presented to the conference on ‘Marxism: Marx and Beyond’ in Calcutta, 22-24 March 2012 and is due to be published. The paper argues that booms, not depressions, are the exception in capitalist history; this inverts the general approach of economics. I argue that booms are recurrent, but irregular events that arise when certain specific sets of political and economic conditions are met. If we can establish these conditions this will help understand what booms can achieve, what their dangers are, and whether their historical potential is exhausted, shedding light on such intractable problems in political economy as what causes growth, whether it is desirable, what circumstances bring about economic development, and what causes so-called depressions JEL Codes: B1, B14, B3, B5
B14|Josef Macek mezi liberálním socialismem a sociálním liberalismem (Podnět k diskusi nad liberálním aspektem Mackova myšlení)<BR>[Josef Macek Between Liberal Socialism and Social Liberalism]|My article is an impetus for a discussion on liberal aspect of the thinking of social democratic politician and economist Josef Macek (1887-1972). In the first part I define Macek´s approach to liberalism (his understanding of the basic notions, concept of the relationship between an individual and the society, idea of the relationship between socialism and liberalism and his interpretation of Adam Smith). My conclusion is that though Macek was a conscious socialist and he had limitations in respect to libertarian interpretation of the classic liberalism of the 19th century, he was at the same time to a considerable extent influenced by liberalism and he constantly oscillated on the threshold between socialism and liberalism. In the second part of the article I contemplate possible sources of inspiration of Macek´s opinions - I primarily question the extent of the influence of F. Oppenheimer and J. M. Keynes - and, moreover, I consider the general ideological context in which Macek´s opinions could be embedded. In this respect I conclude that Macek was influenced both by Oppenheimer as well as Keynes but by each of them in a different manner, on a diverse level of commonness and at a different moment. However, the liberal aspect of Macek´s thinking far more likely grew out of his knowledge of Oppenheimer and some Anglo-Saxon authors, who have either never or seldom been put in context with Macek, than from his knowledge of Keynes.
B14|The Democratic Road to Socialism|Two main subjects are dealt with in this paper: the democratic road to socialism in Marx and Engels’s works and, more generally, a feasible transition to a new social order. Starting out from the Marxian definition of revolution as the transition from one production mode to another, the author expatiates on different possible modes of transition. Marx and Engels often declared themselves in favour of a transition realised through a worker management of firms, and one purpose of this article is to suggest that the establishment of a system of producer cooperatives would be the correct way out of capitalism.
B14|"Retrospectives: Who Said ""Debauch the Currency"": Keynes or Lenin?"|"One frequently quoted passage from the work of John Maynard Keynes is that ""the best way to destroy the capitalist system [is] to debauch the currency."" The passage, attributed to Vladimir Illyich Lenin, appears in Keynes' book The Economic Consequences of the Peace , which became an international bestseller when it was published in 1919. Economic historian Frank W. Fetter and others have expressed doubt that Keynes was really quoting Lenin because they found no such statement in Lenin's collected published writings. Fetter suggested that Keynes based his remark on stories about what the Soviets were supposed to be saying that he heard at the Paris peace conference of 1919. It is now possible to show that Keynes based his remark on a report of an interview with Lenin published by London and New York newspapers in April 1919. Keynes' discussion of inflation in the Economic Consequences can then be read as an extended commentary on the remarks attributed to Lenin in the interview. While the report of the interview was not reprinted after 1919, it will be also shown here that Lenin responded to Keynes in a speech that was reprinted in his Collected Works ."
