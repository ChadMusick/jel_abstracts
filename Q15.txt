Q15|Preferences, Uncertainty, and Biases in Land Division: A Bargaining Experiment in the Field|Divisions of rural land in developing countries reduce the possibilities of farmers to profit from agricultural returns to scale. We design and conduct a framed bargaining experiment to study whether land overvaluation (due to affective reasons) and uncertainty in land values are drivers for land division. In our bargaining game, two players with different agricultural productivity jointly inherit a land plot and individually inherit some tokens they can use to agree on a land allocation. The possible set of land allocations and the spread of land returns vary across treatment arms in the game. We conduct this experiment with 256 participants in eight rural municipalities of the Northeast of Colombia. We find that when players are allowed to divide the land plot, 75% of the bargaining interactions yield the most egalitarian, but less efficient, land allocations. Based on the predictions of a Nash bargaining model and the observations from a sample of 120 college students, we rule out land overvaluation as a driver for land divisions in the context of our game. We also find that uncertainty in land yields reduces the efficiency of land allocations when we do not allow land divisions, by increasing the likelihood of the least productive player keeping the entire land plot. Our results are consistent with a bounded rationality rule in which subjects incorporate a behavioral response to uncertainty by first bargaining over land, which is a certain outcome, and then bargaining over a token transfer. **** RESUMEN: Las divisiones de tierras rurales en los países en desarrollo limitan las posibilidades de los agricultores en estos países de aprovechar economías de escala derivadas de la mecanización. Diseñamos y llevamos a cabo un experimento de negociación para explorar si la sobrevaloración de la tierra (debido a razones afectivas) y la incertidumbre sobre el valor de la tierra explican divisiones ineficientes de tierras en contextos agrícolas. En nuestro juego de negociación, dos jugadores con diferentes niveles de productividad agrícola heredan conjuntamente una parcela de tierra e individualmente heredan algunas fichas que pueden usar para acordar una repartición de la parcela. Variamos aleatoriamente, entre grupos de tratamiento en el juego, el conjunto de posibles reparticiones de la parcela y la dispersión de los retornos de la tierra. Llevamos a cabo este experimento con 256 participantes en ocho municipios rurales del nororiente de Colombia. Encontramos que cuando se permite a los jugadores dividir la parcela, el 75% de las interacciones de negociación generan las asignaciones de tierra más igualitarias, pero menos eficientes. Con base en las predicciones de un modelo de negociación de Nash y las observaciones de una muestra de 120 estudiantes universitarios, descartamos la sobrevaluación de la tierra como motor de divisiones de tierra en el contexto de nuestro juego. Por otro lado, encontramos que una mayor incertidumbre en los rendimientos de la tierra reduce la eficiencia en las asignaciones de tierra cuando eliminamos las divisiones igualitarias del conjunto de posibles reparticiones. Nuestros resultados son consistentes con una regla de racionalidad limitada en la cual los sujetos incorporan una respuesta conductual a la incertidumbre, al negociar primero sobre una asignacin de tierra, que es un resultado fijo y determinado, y luego negociar sobre una transferencia de fichas.
Q15|Structural Transformation, Industrial Specialization, and Endogenous Growth|The introduction of new technologies in agriculture can foster structural transformation by freeing workers who find occupation in other sectors. The traditional view is that this increase in labor supply in manufacturing can lead to industrial development. However, when workers moving to manufacturing are mostly unskilled, this process reinforces a country's comparative advantage in low-skill intensive industries. To the extent that these industries undertake less R&D, this change in industrial composition can lead to lower long-run growth. We provide empirical evidence of this mechanism using a large and exogenous increase in agricultural productivity due to the legalization of genetically engineered soy in Brazil. Our results indicate that improvements in agricultural productivity, while positive in the short-run, can generate specialization in less-innovative industries and have negative effects on productivity in the long-run.
Q15|Is Collective Titling Enough to Protect Forests? Evidence from Afro-descendant Communities in the Colombian Pacific Region|During the mid-1990s, one of the most ambitious land reforms in recent decades took place in Colombia. The reform recognized collective land rights of 5 million hectares by Afro-Colombian groups, with the dual goals of improving livelihoods and preserving valuable ecosystems. We estimate the impact of this collective land titling program on forest cover using panel data and a difference-in-difference empirical strategy. We find that overall, collective titling significantly reduces deforestation rates, but the effect varies substantially by sub-region. We observe that the larger effects are in Nariño and Valle del Cauca especially in places with higher deforestation threat, closer to the forest frontier, to roads, and to navigable rivers, as well as in places without illegal crops. Our qualitative analysis suggest that this might be the result of communities being able to expel private companies from their lands which is more challenging with actors promoting illegal crops. We conclude that under the adequate conditions, titling can lead to forest conservation.
Q15|Historical grievances and war dynamics: Old land conflicts as a cause of current forced displacements in Colombia|We explore the role of unfairly resolved land conflicts on the long-run dynamics of Colombia’s war. We claimed that inadequately or unfairly resolved land conflicts can explain not only the emergence of rebel groups but also their repertoires and targets of violence—notably forced displacements. The identification strategy used combines the use of instrumental variables — distance of the municipality to the railroad in 1900- with a methodology of neighbor-pair fixed effects to test the causal relation between old land conflicts and recent forced displacements. Moreover, we use mediation analysis to test the mechanisms that we hypothesize as links between the independent and dependent variables—presence of armed groups and unfair land reform allocations. Our results show that, indeed, early 20th century land conflicts and recent forced displacements are causally linked, and their connection is mainly produced through the mediation of unfair land reform allocations and the presence of violent armed groups. We argue that unfair land reforms harbor the formation of peasant-based rebel groups and such groups promote displacements in the very same places that experienced old land conflict.
Q15|Adecuación de tierras y el desarrollo de la agricultura colombiana: políticas e instituciones|La adecuación de tierras, en general, y el riego, en particular, desempeñan un papel muy importante en el crecimiento y el desarrollo de la agricultura. Por ejemplo, la irrigación impacta la mayor productividad de los cultivos, lo que repercute en un mayor nivel de ingresos de los agricultores y en la reducción de la pobreza rural. En Colombia, a pesar de que la política agropecuaria ha tenido como uno de sus principales instrumentos la adecuación de tierras, en la actualidad, la utilización del riego en las actividades agropecuarias se encuentra lejos de sus potenciales. Esto contrasta con los avances que en esta materia han tenido algunas naciones latinoamericanas (como Brasil, Chile, México y Perú). Dada la importancia que tienen la adecuación de tierras y el riego para el crecimiento y el desarrollo de la agricultura y el sector rural, así como el importante potencial de expansión que tiene el sector agropecuario del país, Fedesarrollo adelantó el presente estudio, cuyo objetivo es establecer la situación actual de la adecuación de tierras y el riego en Colombia y, con base en dicho análisis, proponer las medidas de política e institucionales necesarias para expandir el uso del riego en las actividades agropecuarias.
Q15|Glyphosate Use in Agriculture and Birth Outcomes of Surrounding Populations|This paper assesses the impact of glyphosate use in agriculture on birth outcomes of human populations in surrounding areas. Glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide in the world. Still, despite ongoing controversy, little is known about its effects on human populations at large. Our empirical strategy relies on the fact that glyphosate is strongly complementary to the use of genetically modified seeds in soybean production. We use an instrument based on the gains in productivity from adoption of genetically modified soybeans and look at externalities across municipalities sharing the same water resources. We detect negative and statistically significant effects of glyphosate use on birth outcomes. Our results indicate externality effects of glyphosate use on populations distant from the original locations of use, but receiving water from these locations.
Q15|Climate Change, Inequality, and Human Migration|This paper investigates the long-term implications of climate change on local, interregional, and international migration of workers. For nearly all of the world's countries, our micro-founded model jointly endogenizes the effects of changing temperature and sea level on income distribution and individual decisions about fertility, education, and mobility. Climate change intensifies poverty and income inequality creating favorable conditions for urbanization and migration from low- to high-latitude countries. Encompassing slow- and fast-onset mechanisms, our projections suggest that climate change will induce the voluntary and forced displacement of 100 to 160 million workers (200 to 300 million climate migrants of all ages) over the course of the 21st century. However, under current migration laws and policies, forcibly displaced people predominantly relocate within their country and merely 20% of climate migrants opt for long-haul migration to OECD countries. If climate change induces generalized and persistent conflicts over resources in regions at risk, we project significantly larger cross-border flows in the future.
Q15|Worlding aspirations and resilient futures: framings of risk and contemporary city-making in Metro Cebu, the Philippines|In the Philippines, calls for creating ‘global’, ‘sustainable’ and ‘resilient’ cities are placing urban poor communities in increasingly precarious positions. These communities have long been the targets of urban development and ‘modernisation’ efforts; more recently the erasure of informal settlements from Philippine cities is being bolstered at the behest of climate change adaptation and disaster risk management (DRM) agendas. In Metro Cebu, flood management has been at the heart of DRM and broader urban development discussions, and is serving as justification for the demolition and displacement of informal settler communities in areas classed as ‘danger zones’. Using Kusno's (2010) interpretation of the ‘exemplary centre’ as a point of departure, this paper interrogates the relationship between DRM, worlding aspirations (Roy and Ong, 2011) and market-oriented urbanisation in Cebu, and considers the socio-spatial implications of these intersecting processes for urban poor communities. Through analysing the contradictions inherent in framings of certain bodies and spaces as being ‘of risk’ or ‘at risk’ over others, I argue that the epistemologies of modernity, disaster risk and resilience endorsed and propagated by the state are facilitating processes of displacement and dispossession that serve elite commercial interests under the auspices of disaster resilience and pro-poor development.
Q15|Regional inequalities in African political economy: theory, conceptualization and measurement, and political effects|There is growing recognition in the economics literature that African countries are characterized by very large economic disparities across subnational regions. Yet the lack of systematic and reliable empirical data at subnational levels of aggregation has made it difficult to explore possible links between these spatial inequalities and political dynamics. This paper reviews some of the empirical literature that attempts to measure and compare spatial inequality within and acorss African countries, and asks whether and how it might be used to bring studies of Africa into dialogue with comparative political economy work on regional inequality in other parts of the world.

Q15|Trashing Johannesburg: Ponte City-as-archive of everyday loss|Trash is rarely just trash. As cultural geography regularly insists, it is also often relational and resourceful, poetic even. It is, in short, a material of rich aesthetic and political value. But what of this relational geography is left when a space is cleaned up? What is lost? In Johannesburg, a city that has long prospered, spatially at least, through habitual cycles of rubbish and renewal, the impulse towards the sanitary has historically betrayed its tendency towards racial exclusion and erasure. As the city labours once again to clean up its self-image, I explore the everyday absence this pattern produces as well as the aesthetic interventions that this geography otherwise enables. In Mikhael Subotzky and Patrick Waterhouse’s part-visual, part-textual exhibition Ponte City (2014), I locate a mode of melancholy representation that gives creative, specifically archival form to the ordinary loss imposed upon Johannesburg’s tallest residential tower as part of its aborted redevelopment in 2007. In this, I attempt to reorient cultural geography’s attention away from the materiality of trash, reflecting, instead, on the allied abundance of its absence.
Q15|Learning cooperation from the commons|"The paper discusses the link between commons as they might have been used in prehistoric Norway and the rules concerning the exploitation of the commons as found in the oldest known legislation for regions of Norway, Gulating Law and Frostating Law. One clear social dilemma has been identified: the setting of a common date for moving animals from the home fields up to the summer farms and home again in the fall. The problem was obvious and the solution not particularly difficult to institute. Many more problems were of course present, but they did not rise to the level of a social dilemma. All such problems were managed by the rules enacted by the bygdeting along with other problems of a community. In particular the process of inheritance, the problems of fencing, how to change borders between neighbours and between individually owned fields and the commons, were treated by extensive rules. The bygdeting managed such issues from prehistory until the 16th and 17th centuries when reforms initiated by the Danish-Norwegian kings started to take effect, making the rule-of-law more uniquely a task for the central authorities and of less concern for the local communities. Maybe the basic legacy of the long history of local rule was a strong belief in the court system, that it would secure the old saying: ""By law the land shall be built, not with unlaw wasted""."
Q15|Are land-poor youth accessing rented land? Evidence from Northern Ethiopia|Continued strong population growth in already densely populated rural areas in parts of Sub-Saharan Africa makes it harder for youth to choose agriculture as their main source of income. We investigate whether near landless youth still can access rented land as a complementary source of income. We utilize a unique data of rural youth that have been allocated rehabilitated communal land to form formalized business groups for joint business activity. They rely on complementary sources of income and land renting is one of these. Utilizing a sample of 3500 youth business group members from 360 youth business groups collected in 2016 and 2019 in five districts in Tigray region of Ethiopia, we find that 42% of the youth had access to rented land in 2016 and 47% in 2019. Average area rented was 0.66ha in 2016 and 0.74ha in 2019. Land renting is the most important source of income for 17 and 16% of the youth in 2016 and 2019 and the second most important source of income for 14 and 20% in 2016 and 2019, respectively. Access to rented land is constrained, however. Male youth who own oxen are much more likely to be able to rent in land. Utilizing a trust game to elicit trust and trustworthiness of the youth, we also found a positive association between trustworthiness and access to rented land. Trust reduces transaction costs and more trustworthy youth have better access to rented land. The importance of trust is also illustrated by the dominance of kinship contracts and contracts with close neighbors reducing the costs of monitoring tenants. The prohibition of land sales in Ethiopia limits the potential of the “agricultural ladder” to facilitate that youth can climb out of poverty through purchase of land. The youth group model may, however, help to overcome the barrier associated with very small and shrinking farm sizes and facilitate the development of larger and more professional land-based production units. Land renting is one of the rural livelihood diversification options that youth pursue and that help to sustain the youth business groups.
Q15|Transaction costs and land rental market participation in Malawi|We assess the extent of access and degree of participation by smallholder tenants in the land rental market in Malawi. Our study is based on three rounds of nationally representative Living Standards Measurement Surveys collected in 2010, 2013 and 2016, from which we construct a balanced panel. We apply the transaction cost theory, which suggests transaction costs to be non-linear and depend on resource as well as socioeconomic characteristics within the customary tenure system that determines who hold, use and transfer land. Controlling for unobserved heterogeneity, the dynamic random effects probit and Tobit models show that transaction costs in the rental market (on the tenant side) are non-linear, high and lead to state dependency in the market. This implies that past land rental experience, social capital and networks, trust and reputation significantly reduce transaction costs and facilitate entry and extent of participation in the rental market. The results point towards the need for land tenure reforms that can reduce these high transaction costs. Access to information through social network could be one way that can improve land access for land-poor and potential tenants, thereby enhancing both equity and efficiency effects of land rental markets.
Q15|Income, Education and Democracy|This paper puts forth a unified theory of growth and polity in which economic development affects a country's polity and polity affects its development. Education crucially impacts both trajectories, first by moving resources out of the traditional sector and decreasing incomes of the landed class and second, by increasing the de facto power of the masses. An autocrat aligned with the landed class will try to retard education of its citizens but eventually will relinquish power when the transfers needed to prevent the masses from revolting become too large. At this point society democratizes and the economy's growth path is determined by the median voter. The model is calibrated to the economic and political histories of Britain from 1200-2000 and used to quantify the role of education, land inequality, constraints on the executive, and school curricula for the timing of modernization and democratization. The effects of these factors are found to be large, on the order of centuries. The paper also contributes to the empirical literature by showing that support for the modernization hypothesis based on System General Method of Moments estimation is more robust than previous research suggests and by showing that only primary education predicts democracy in this estimation method.
Q15|Land as collateral in India|Land is often regarded as a crucial factor enabling credit access because it serves as an ideal collateral, for both borrowers and lenders. Yet in reality, in developing countries like India land is not used as collateral for a variety of reasons. This paper maps the use of land as collateral for borrowings by Indian households using a nationally representative survey of households, the All India Debt and Investment Survey (AIDIS) of 2012-13. The goal of the paper is to document the extent and patterns of use of land as collateral. We supplement this with insights from a field survey in select talukas of Maharashtra that examines borrower perceptions of use of land as collateral.
Q15|Glyphosate Use in Agriculture and Birth Outcomes of Surrounding Populations|This paper assesses the impact of glyphosate use in agriculture on birth outcomes of human populations in surrounding areas. Glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide in the world. Still, despite ongoing controversy, little is known about its effects on human populations at large. Our empirical strategy relies on the fact that glyphosate is strongly complementary to the use of genetically modified seeds in soybean production. We use an instrument based on the gains in productivity from adoption of genetically modified soybeans and look at externalities across municipalities sharing the same water resources. We detect negative and statistically significant effects of glyphosate use on birth outcomes. Our results indicate externality effects of glyphosate use on populations distant from the original locations of use, but receiving water from these locations.
Q15|Politiques agricoles, emploi et revenu des femmes au Burkina Faso|Lâ€™eÌ conomie burkinabeÌ€, baseÌ e sur lâ€™agriculture, occupe environ 70% de la population active.

It contribution to GDP is estimated on average at 35%. In agricultural sector, 83% of women produce 75% of food production despite their limited access to land and productive resources. Faced to these constraints, the Government has adopted measures to improve the living conditions of rural women through their access to land and agricultural inputs in particular. Our study uses a static computable general equilibrium model to assess the macroeconomic and sectorial effects of these measures on women's employment and income. Results show that, increasing the supply of land, agricultural equipment, and reducing the cost of fertilizer contribute to food security, economic growth and improve living conditions of women through job creation and improved household income.
Q15|Off-Farm Participation, Agricultural Production and Farmersâ€™ Welfare in Tanzania and Uganda|Panel data from the Living Standards Measurement Study-Integrated Surveys on Agriculture for Tanzania and Uganda were analyzed to investigate the impact of off-farm participation on agricultural production and farmersâ€™ welfare. Using strategies ranging from simple least squares to a dynamic panel model, we demonstrated how each of the intermediate models, such as the random effects Tobit model, could tackle censoring bias. Our results reveal that off-farm participation had a negative impact on agricultural production in both countries, though the impact was positive on welfare for Tanzania only. Policy makers should consider the complexities surrounding the formulation of pro-agriculture and pro-welfare policies aimed at producing desirable outcomes from off-farm participation. In that effort, policies that minimize the trade-off between agricultural production and off-farm participation and which enhance positive welfare effects are vital.
Q15|Protection and Profit: Empirical Evidence of Governmental and Market-based Forest Policies|In this paper, I study the effectiveness of privately managed FSC certified forests and public sustainability reserves distributed over the entire Brazilian Amazon from 2002-2015. The paper uses high-resolution data on forest cover derived from satellite images and organized in a grid of 1 km2 cells. Using a difference-in-differences estimator in a regression discontinuity environment, I find an increase in deforestation of an annual area of 8,057 ha in FSC forests after the certification. Public sustainability zones' impact on deforestation is also positive but declines over time. The effectiveness of both type of zones improves if they are located closer to (export) markets or existing infrastructure.
Q15|The Contrasting Importance of Quality of Life and Quality of Business for Domestic and International Migrants|We examine whether bilateral regional migration flows are driven by the city’s quality of life (QL) or quality of business (QB). The QL and QB measures are constructed using (quality-adjusted) rents and wages in each city. QL and QB reflect the willingness to pay of households and firms, respectively, for local amenities. The measures are constructed for 31 urban areas in New Zealand using five-yearly census data covering 1986 to 2013. We adopt a gravity model of regional migration – augmented by destination and origin QL and QB – to model bilateral flows of working-age migrants (post tertiary education and pre-retirement age). We also model flows between urban and rural areas and flows for the urban areas to and from overseas locations. We find different attractors for international versus domestic migrants according to the type of city amenity. International migrants are more attracted to cities with productive amenities whereas domestic migrants are more attracted to places with consumption amenities. Thus, in deciding on the type of city amenity to enhance, city officials implicitly choose the type of migrant that they attract as well as the type of city that may result.
Q15|The Effects of Decentralized and Video-based Extension on the Adoption of Integrated Soil Fertility Management – Experimental Evidence from Ethiopia|The slow adoption of new agricultural technologies is an important factor in explaining persistent productivity deficits among smallholders in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Farmers delay in particular the uptake of technology packages. Since knowledge constraints are an important barrier to adoption, effective extension approaches are key. In recent decades, extension systems in many SSA countries have moved towards decentralized “bottom-up” models involving farmers as active stakeholders. In this study we assess the effects of a decentralized extension program and an additional video intervention on the adoption of integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) among 2,382 farmers in Ethiopia using a randomized controlled trial. ISFM should enhance soil fertility and productivity by combining organic and inorganic soil amendments. We find that both extension-only and extension combined with video increase ISFM adoption and knowledge. We further find evidence for increased adoption of ISFM practices among farmers in treatment communities that do not actively participate in the extension activities. The additional video intervention shows a significant complementary effect for these non-actively involved farmers, in particular regarding the combined use of the practices on the same plot. A causal mediation analysis reveals that increases in knowledge explain part of the treatment effects on adoption.
Q15|Do Property Rights Alleviate the Problem of the Commons? Evidence from California Groundwater Rights|Property rights are widely prescribed for addressing the tragedy of the commons, yet causal evidence of their effectiveness remains elusive. This paper combines theory and empirics to produce a causal estimate of the net benefit of using property rights to manage groundwater. We develop a model of dynamic groundwater extraction to demonstrate how a spatial regression discontinuity design exploiting an incomplete property rights setting can recover a lower bound on the value of property rights. We apply this estimator to a major aquifer in water-stressed southern California, finding groundwater property rights led to substantial net benefits, as capitalized in land values. Heterogeneity analyses suggest that gains arise in part from the tradeability of property rights, enabling more efficient water use across sectors.
Q15|Are small farms really more productive than large farms?|We revisit the long-standing empirical evidence of an inverse relationship between farm size and productivity using rich microdata from Uganda. We show that farm size is negatively related to yields (output per hectare), as commonly found in the literature, but positively related to farm productivity (a farm-specific component of total factor productivity). These conflicting results do not arise because of omitted variables such as land quality, measurement error in output or inputs, or specification issues. Instead, we reconcile the findings emphasizing the role of farm-specific distortions and returns to scale in traditional farm production. We exploit unique regional variation in land tenure regimes in Uganda in evaluating the role of farm-specific distortions. Our findings point to the limited value of yields (or land productivity) in establishing the farm size-productivity relationship. More generally, we demonstrate the limitation of using farm size in guiding policy applications.
Q15|Evaluating the environmental impact of agricultural policies|The relationship between agricultural support policies (adapted from the OECD Producer Support Estimate (PSE) classification) and a selection of environmental impacts are analysed in a range of country settings, using a farm-level and a market-level model. Based on the methods and environmental indicators used, market price support and payments based on unconstrained variable input use were the most environmentally harmful among the various PSE measures. Decoupled support payments based on non-current crop area were the least harmful, even when considering their impacts on the behaviour of risk averse farmers. The impacts of support policies that clearly change the competitiveness of one production activity in relation to another, such as payments based on current crop area or on animal numbers, were more equivocal. Support payments subject to environmental constraints can improve environmental outcomes compared to coupled support without restrictions, however, they can also have unintended environmental impacts.
Q15|An Analysis of Adaption Policies to Climate Change: Gdyn-W Model|This paper develops a dynamic CGE-Water (Gdyn-W) model to analyse the effectiveness of adaptation policies to climate change. In the model, water is introduced as an explicit primary factor of production used for irrigation purposes. For empirical analysis, we employ the latest GTAP database version 9 focusing on the South Asian countries: Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Our simulation results revel that the domestic production in all the countries under analysis decreases after the temperature rises by 1 °C until 2040. However, such production losses can be reduced greatly by the adaptation policy to climate change. The costs associated with such a policy are marginal compared to the overall benefits from such a policy.
Q15|Оценка На Устойчивостта На Българското Селско Стопанство<BR>[Sustainability Level of Bulgarian Agriculture]|This paper assesses the integral, governance, economic, social and environmental sustainability of Bulgarian agriculture. On the base official aggravate (statistical, etc.) and survey data approbation is made of elaborated holistic framework and evaluated sustainability level at different levels - national, sub sector, region, (agro)ecosystems, and farm. Website of the project: https://zem.alle.bg
Q15|Устойчивост На Селското Стопанство В България<BR>[Sustainability of Bulgarian agriculture]|"This paper gives answer to topical and debated research and practical questions at the current stage of development of Bulgarian agriculture - „what is sustainability of agriculture"", „how to assess sustainability of agricultural in the conditions of EU CAP implementation in the country“, and „which are critical factors for improvement of socio-economic and environmental sustainability in the sector“. Evolution of the „concept“ of agrarian sustainability and the major approached for its assessment are discussed More precise definition of sustainability of Bulgarian agriculture is suggested and the requirements for the system of its assessment are characterised. For the first time a new „governance“ pillar of agrarian sustainability is included along with the universally accepted economic, social and environmental pillars (aspects). Practically applicable for the specific conditions of Bulgarian agriculture holistic framework for assessing sustainability level of agrarian systems of different types (sector, sub-sector, region, ecosystem, agricultural farm) is suggested. The later included 25 principles, 66 criteria, and 163 indicators and reference values for assessing integral, governance, economic, social and environmental sustainability as well as approach for their calculation, integration and interpretation. Approbation of the elaborated framework in assessment of agrarian sustainability at various levels (national, sub-sector, region, (agro)ecosystem, and farm) is made on the base of official statistical, etc, information and original farm surveys. Critical factors for improving sustainability of Bulgarian agriculture are identified, and recommendation made for amelioration of research and assessment practices, public policies and farming strategies for sustainable development.

Q15|Multilevel assessment of agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria|The goal of this study is to unpack sustainability in terms of understanding and evaluation using as a case Bulgarian agriculture. A hierarchical system for assessing agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria at national, regional, sub-sectoral, ecosystem and farm level is proposed. It includes 3 aspects(pillars), 17 principles, 35 criteria, and 46 indicators and reference values for evaluating sustainability as well as approach for their integration and interpretation. Assessment is made of agrarian sustainability in the country at various level using aggregate macro and farm level micro data. The assessment has found out that there is a considerable differentiation in the level of integral and aspects sustainability of different type of farms, ecosystems, subsectors and regions. Nevertheless, results on the integral agrarian sustainability based on macro aggregate and micro farm data are quite similar. The later indicates that both approaches are reliable and could be simultaneously used according to the level of analysis, needs of decision makers, and available data. Major factors encouraging improving economic sustainability are market demand and price; direct state subsidies; market competition; financial capability; participation in public support programs; possibility of benefitting immediately; possibility of benefitting in the near future; tax preferences; possibility of benefitting in the long term; and integration with buyers of farm products. Main factors encouraging the enhancement of social sustainability are personal convictions and satisfaction; social recognition of individual contribution; immediate benefits for other people and groups; regional community initiatives and pressure; access to advisory services; European Union policy; and existing regional problems and risks. Important factors encouraging environmental sustainability are problems and risks existing at the global scale; official regulations, standards, and norms; existing regional problems and risks; and European Union policies. Public policies and instruments that improve economic sustainability of Bulgarian agriculture include: direct area-based payments; national top-ups for products and livestock; modernization of agricultural holdings; green payments; support for semi-market farms. At the same time the impact of national and European policies on social and environmental sustainability is relatively weak. Having in mind the importance of holistic assessments of this kind for improving agrarian sustainability, farm management and agrarian policies, they are to be expended and their precision and representation increased. The latter requires a closer cooperation between and participation of all interested parties as well as improvement of the precision through enlargement of collected statistical data, number of surveyed farms, and incorporating more “objective” data from field tests and surveys, monitoring, expertise of professionals in the area, etc.
Q15|Sustainability of agro-ecosystems in Bulgaria|Ecosystem approach has been increasingly incorporated in the management and evaluation of sustainability levels. Despite huge progress in the theory and practice of this new area, still there is no consensus on how to assess the sustainability of agro-ecosystems due to diverse understandings, approaches, methods, employed data, etc. In Bulgaria there are practically no deep studies on sustainability level of diverse agro-eco-systems. This paper tries to fill the blank and assesses the sustainability level of agro-ecosystems of different type in Bulgaria. First a holistic hierarchical framework for assessing integral, economic, social and ecological sustainability of agro-ecosystems in Bulgaria is suggested including 17 principles, 35 criteria, and 46 indicators and reference values. After that, an assessment is made on overall and aspects sustainability of large (agro)ecosystems in North-Central, South-Eastern, South-Central and South-Western geographic regions, and particular main and specific types of agro-ecosystems of the country - mountainous, plain-mountainous, plain, riparian (Struma, Maritza, Yantra), southern Black Sea, mountainous area with natural constraints, non-mountainous area with natural constraints, protected areas and reserves, Western Thracian Plain, Middle Danube Plain, Dupnitsa and Sandansko-Petrich Valley, Sredna Gora Mountains and Western Rila Mountains. The assessment is based on first-hand information collected though in-depth interviews with the managers of “typical” farms in the respective ago-ecosystems. The study has found out that there is a considerable differentiation in the level of integral sustainability in agricultural ecosystems of different types. Furthermore, there are substantial variations in the levels of economic, social and ecological sustainability of agro-ecosystems of different type, and the critical indicators enhancing or deterring overall and particular sustainability of individual agro-ecosystems. Results of the integral agrarian sustainability level of this study, based on the micro agro-ecosystem (farm) data, are similar to the previous assessment based on the aggregate sectoral (statistical, etc.) data. There are large differences in the impact of socio-economic, institutional, behavioral, international, natural, etc. factors and individual public policy instruments on the sustainability of farming enterprises of different types and agro-ecosystems. Having in mind the importance of holistic assessments of this kind for improving agrarian sustainability, farm management and agrarian policies, they are to be expended and their precision and representation increased.
Q15|Spatial Spillovers in the Implicit Market Price of Soil Erosion: An Estimation using a Spatio-temporal Hedonic Model|Abstract: We estimate the implicit market price of soil erosion, fitting a spatio-temporal hedonic price model using quarterly data of 3,563 agricultural farms traded in Uruguay between 2000 and 2014. A unique feature of our estimation is that we allow for possible spatial spillovers. We find evidence of a negative and statistically significant association between erosion and land values. A 1% increase in own topsoil loss due to own erosion is associated with a decrease of 0.22% in the per-hectare price of agricultural land (p-value: 0.013, 95% CI: -0.0039, -0.0005). This is equivalent to a decrease of 7.7 USD in the average price per hectare and USD 1,040 in the price of the average farm (134 hectares). This value increases to USD 1,277 when we add the average cross marginal effect of erosion in nearby farms. Our estimates are sensitive to our measure of erosion and our specification of the spatio-temporal weighting matrix. We also find evidence consistent with our hypothesis that farms entering a governmental erosion control plan sent a valuable signal to the market regarding soil management. An indicator of whether the farm has at least one parcel under the government erosion control plans is associated with a 29% increase in the farm´s per-hectare price (p-value: 0.000, 95% CI: 16.26%, 41.53%) higher than those with no parcel under these plans. The average total marginal effect (own plus cross effects) of the erosion control plans is 35.37% (p-value: 0.000, 95% CI: 20.33%, 50.40%).
Q15|Agriculture in 2018: decline or growth?|Over recent years, agriculture – if we choose to look at available data prior to their adjustment based on the results of the All-Russia Agricultural Census – has been growing at a sufficiently high rate: in 2013 – by 5.8 percent, in 2014 – by 3.5, in 2015 – by 2.6, in 2016 – by 4.8, and in 2017 – by 2.5 percent3. Overall, growth over the course of 5 years amounted to 20.7 percent. Based on Rosstat’s current statistics, managers on both the federal and regional levels describe the development pattern of the agroindustrial complex (AIC) as a breakthrough and a leap forward. We likewise mentioned this fact in our overviews released over several previous years2. However, in 2018, there were some problems involved in the estimation of the growth rate both for 2018 and for the previous years.
Q15|Women’s Asset Ownership: Evidence from Georgia; Mongolia; and Cavite, Philippines|Since the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals, significant global progress has been achieved in promoting gender equality in education and health. However, progress has not been as remarkable in advancing women’s rights on asset ownership and control, which is critical for securing gender equity in economic participation and opportunity, and delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals. Part of the problem comes from the lack of standards on collecting sexdisaggregated data on the topic. The Evidence and Data for Gender Equality (EDGE) initiative aims to develop standardized methods and guidelines for collecting sex-disaggregated data on asset ownership. This paper provides rich inputs to the methodological guidelines being developed by the United Nations and development partners by drawing on the key findings from the pilot surveys conducted in Georgia; Mongolia; and Cavite, Philippines. Furthermore, survey results suggest substantive gender gaps in ownership across different types of assets and countries. These variations confirm the importance of understanding the social norms governing gender roles in society and legislation that can facilitate or impede women’s asset ownership.
Q15|Wahrnehmungen und Erfahrungen von Landwirtinnen und Landwirten in SüdostÖsterreich zu betrieblichen und regionalen Maßnahmen zur Regulierung des Westlichen Maiswurzelbohrers|Die Etablierung des Westlichen Maiswurzelbohrers (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera) stellt eine zentrale Herausforderung für die österreichische Maisproduktion dar. Eine aktive Regulierung ist unerlässlich, um weitere Schäden zu verhindern bzw. zu reduzieren. Die Umsetzung bzw. Nicht-Umsetzung von einzelbetrieblichen Maßnahmen, z.B. Fruchtfolgen oder Pestizidanwendungen, hat insbesondere in kleinstrukturierten österreichischen Agrarlandschaften Auswirkungen auf benachbarte Betriebe. Die Anwendung von Maßnahmen auf regionaler Ebene in Zusammenhang mit dem WMB, z.B. die Koordination von Fruchtfolgen oder Pestizidanwendungen, ist bisher gering. Um entsprechende Maßnahmen – auf einzelbetrieblicher sowie regionaler Ebene – aus Sicht der Beratung und Politik zu unterstützen, bedarf es der Kenntnis von Wahrnehmungen und Erfahrungen betroffener LandwirtInnen. Im Herbst 2017 wurden 23 leitfadengestützte Interviews mit betroffenen LandwirtInnen in der Projektregion der ARGE Innobrotics (Burgenland, Kärnten, Steiermark) geführt. Die Auswertung der Interviews erfolgte mit Hilfe einer qualitativen Inhaltsanalyse. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die Anwendung von Maßnahmen zur Regulierung des WMB von zahlreichen Faktoren beeinflusst wird, darunter den persönlichen Kenntnissen und betrieblichen Gegebenheiten, der wahrgenommenen Wirksamkeit, dem Betriebstyp oder der landwirtschaftlichen Struktur. Weiters spielen äußere Rahmenbedingungen, wie rechtliche Vorschriften, klimatische Bedingungen, ökonomische Aspekte oder das wahrgenommene Verständnis der Gesellschaft gegenüber den Maßnahmen eine wichtige Rolle. Zudem beeinflussen persönliche Erfahrungen und Einstellungen, wie das wahrgenommene Schadensausmaß oder wahrgenommene Umweltauswirkungen von Pestizidanwendungen, die Umsetzung. Die Notwendigkeit der aktiven WMB-Regulierung wird von allen befragten LandwirtInnen erkannt, die Wahl der Maßnahmenkombinationen ist aber heterogen. Maßnahmenvorschläge zur Regulierung auf regionaler Ebene werden positiv beurteilt. Eine Umsetzung können sich viele befragte LandwirtInnen jedoch nicht vorstellen, wenngleich einzelne von Planungen bzw. auch erfolgreichen Umsetzungen auf regionaler Ebene berichten.
Q15|Revisiting water and economic growth from a long-term perspective|Water use has increased notably throughout the world over the last 250 years. The industrial revolution and the long-term economic growth processes, first experienced by Western countries, and then by many other regions, put growing pressure on water resources. If we focus on economic growth, structural change and the rise in per capita income have been key factors in explaining water use trajectories. In addition, population growth has also boosted water needs worldwide. On the contrary, the increase in water use efficiency, mostly driven by technological developments, but also by improved institutions and environmental awareness, has slowed down water requirements. In this general context, our study aims to analyse the drivers of water use from a long-term perspective. More specifically, we analyse world and regional trends in water use over the last century and their relationships with population, economic growth and technological change. We pay particular attention to the second half of the last century and the twenty-first century, given the rising demands linked to trade, the emergence of new economies with increasing per capita income and demands and the smooth technological change observed in developed countries.
Q15|Climate change, chemical fertilisers, and sustainable development â€“ panel evidence from Tanzanian Maize farmers|We study the impact of rainfall risk on fertiliser use by Tanzanian maize farmers using newly available spatially disaggregated agronomic survey data on Tanzanian maize producers. We show that fertiliser use is highly sensitive to rainfall risks. Our discussion embeds these findings into the wider debate around environmental sustainability and mineral fertilisers, thus relating directly to the countryâ€™s government efforts of climate mainstreaming into their (agricultural) policies. We conclude that chemical fertilisers are useful for agricultural productivity growth but that they should be used to supplement more economically and environmentally sustainable practices.
Q15|Regression tree analysis of soil fertility and agro-economic practices and the effects on yield in Tanzania|Food security and yield production have been extensively studied in regard to fertiliser response in the context of Sub-Saharan Africa. Soil fertility gradients within farms interact with other complex factors such as plot management, alongside bio-physical as well as socio-economic constraints, to create extensive heterogeneity in yield production. Hence, blanket recommendations regarding increasing inputs may not just lead to limited or no change in productivity but may affect long term sustainability. To try and explore the relationships between these factors, Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis was used to simplify the effect of plot management decisions. Data was from the focal plots of the 2016 and 2017 Tanzanian Agronomy Panel Survey (TAPS 2017; n = 580) with a range of yields and socio-economic contexts (2.10tha-1 â€“ 3.68tha-1). Results suggested that in low resource fields, management factors are subservient to extreme soil degradation while in high resource fields good management such as optimal planting are needed for maximum predicted yield (4.48tha-1; n = 51). Boundary line analysis was conducted, and maximum yield-nutrient response values calculated. The yield gap obtained suggested only up to 60% of locally obtainable yield is reached, highlighting the necessary balance between intensity of resource use and good management for sustainable and sufficient crop production, especially in the case of extreme soil degradation.
Q15|Trade-offs between carbon sequestration, landscape aesthetics and biodiversity in a cost-benefit analysis of land use options in Norway|Norway is considering a national afforestation program for greenhouse gas (GHG) sequestration on recently abandoned semi-natural pastureland. However, the program may have negative impacts on landscape aesthetics and biodiversity. We conducted a national choice experiment survey to estimate non-market benefits of the afforestation program, compared to an alternative program of recovering pastures and the status quo of natural reforestation. Combining the preference data with secondary data on costs, we derive the social net return on land use alternatives. We find that restoring half of the abandoned pastures for grazing yields the highest net present value. Rural households closer to abandoned pastures are the largest beneficiaries of this policy due to the value they place on pastures and their disutility of natural reforestation. Their willingness to pay (WTP) for recovering pastures is more than three times that of urban households, while non-use values derived from carbon sequestration and biodiversity seem more constant across space. The net present value of all land use alternatives are still positive when limiting the aggregation of WTP to rural households, and when allowing for the presence of substantial hypothetical bias in benefit estimates and for cost increases. Results indicate that landscape and biodiversity values are substantial and should be considered when designing agricultural and climate policies.
Q15|Property rights, market access and crop cultivation in Southern Rhodesia: evidence from historical satellite data|Agriculture plays a central role in the efforts to fight poverty and achieve economic growth. This is especially relevant in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where the majority of the population lives in rural areas. A key issue that is generally believed to unlock agriculture potential is the recognition of property rights through land titling, yet there is no overwhelming empirical evidence to support this in the case of SSA (Udry, 2011). This paper investigates access to markets as an important pre-condition for land titles to result in agricultural growth. Using the case of Southern Rhodesia, we investigate whether land titles incentivised African large-scale holders in the Native Purchase Areas (NPAs) to put more of their available land under cultivation than their counterparts in the overcrowded Tribal Trust Areas (TTAs). We create a novel dataset by applying a Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning algorithm on Landsat imagery for the period 1972 to 1984 - the period during which the debate on the nexus between land rights and agricultural production intensified. Our results indicate that land titles are only beneficial when farmers are located closer to main cities, main roads and rail stations or sidings.
Q15|Are Small Farms Really more Productive than Large Farms?|We revisit the long-standing empirical evidence of an inverse relationship between farm size and productivity using rich micro data from Uganda. We show that farm size is nega- tively related with yields (output per hectare), as commonly found in the literature, but positively related with farm productivity (a farm-specific component of total factor pro- ductivity). These conflicting results do not arise because of omitted variables such as land quality, measurement error in output or inputs, or specification issues. Instead, we reconcile the findings emphasizing decreasing returns to scale in farm production and farm-specific distortions. We exploit regional variation in land tenure regimes in Uganda in evaluating the role of farm-specific distortions. Our findings point to the limited value of yields (or land productivity) in establishing the size-productivity relationship. More generally, we highlight farm size as an ineffective instrument for policy implementation since size is deeply con- founded by distortions in developing countries.
Q15|The Effects of Land Markets on Resource Allocation and Agricultural Productivity|We assess the effects of land markets on misallocation and productivity by exploiting policy-driven variation in land rentals across time and space arising from a large-scale land certification reform in Ethiopia, where land remains owned by the state. Our main finding from detailed micro panel data is that land rentals substantially reduce misallocation and increase agricultural productivity. Our evidence builds from an empirical difference-in-difference strategy, an instrumental variable approach, and a calibrated quantitative macroeconomic framework with heterogeneous household-farms that replicates, without targeting, the empirical effects. These effects are nonlinear, impacting more farms farther away from efficient operational scale, consistent with our theory. Using our model, we find that more active land markets reduce inequality, an important concern for the design of land policy. We also find that the positive effects of land markets are mainly driven by formal market rentals as opposed to informal rentals. Finally, our analysis also provides evidence that land markets increase the adoption of more advanced technologies such as the use of fertilizers.
Q15|Investment in farming under uncertainty and decoupled support: a real options approach|Under the current version of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), payments to EU farmers are decoupled from the production of agricultural commodities. In fact, farmers qualify for CAP support as soon as their land is maintained in good agricultural and environmental condition. In this paper, we study how decoupled payments influence the decision to invest in farming. We show that decoupling is implicitly providing a costless hedge against volatile farming profits. Consequently, a higher decoupled payment leads the potential farmer to hasten its investment but also results in a farm with lower productive capacity.
Q15|Unraveling local preferences and willingness to pay for different management scenarios: A choice experiment to Biosphere Reserve management|Economic valuation of ecosystem services has emerged as a valuable tool to promote conservation and sustainable land management. Our study adds to this literature, by reporting the results of a discrete choice experiment used to analyse local population preferences and willingness-to-pay for selected ecosystem services resulting from different management scenarios in the Urdaibai Biosphere Reserve (Biscay, Spain). The ecosystem services considered include quality of water bodies, agricultural production, native forest protection, biodiversity, and recreation. The results indicate that the local population is willing to financially support a new management plan focused on the improvement of ecosystem health and landscape multifunctionality and sustainability, with recreation being the least valued ecosystem service. These findings may be used to inform conservation and management policies to maximize social well-being. They can also help to prioritize investments and allocation of funding and hence minimise land use conflicts.
Q15|Government Policy and Land Price Dynamics: A Quantitative Assessment of China's Factor Market|This paper examines the role played by government policy regarding factors of pro- duction in shaping the dynamics of a growing economy. Using land as an example of an important productive factor, we develop a quantitative model with endogenous land price policy regimes to rationalize the following three economic reforms in China: introduction of non-SOEs (state-owned enterprises); reform of SOEs characterized by their retreat from the competitive manufacturing sector and the establishment of state monopolies in factor markets around 2000; and a regime switch from dual-track land pricing to land price discrimination by use. We calibrate our model to key economic indicators for China and quantify the e ects of these reforms. Our calibrated mo- del can match several stylized facts for China after 2000 such as widening disparity in land prices by use, rapid growth in housing price, land revenue, and government expenditures on public goods, and the steep decline in labor share for income.
Q15|Bodengebundene Einkommensteuern in einer strukturschwachen ländlichen Gemeinde|In diesem Bericht wird für eine ländliche Gemeinde im Landkreis Stendal (Sachsen-Anhalt) die Höhe der Steuern abgeschätzt, die auf Einkünfte aus der Verpachtung und Bewirtschaftung von Landwirtschaftsfläche im Gemeindegebiet zu entrichten sind. Zudem wird ermittelt, welcher Anteil dieser Steuern der Gemeinde selbst zukommt und welcher Anteil ihr dadurch entgeht, dass Teile der Landwirtschaftsfläche Eigentümern mit auswärtigem Wohnsitz gehören bzw. von auswärtigen Landwirten bewirtschaftet werden. Die Untersuchung beruht auf Daten aus den Liegenschafts- und Grundsteuersystemen der Gemeinde, die im Hinblick auf die Wohnsitze der Steuerpflichtigen ausgewertet wurden. Die Untersuchung zeigt, dass mehr als die Hälfte des privaten landwirtschaftlichen Flächeneigentums auf nicht Ortsansässige entfällt und mehr als die Hälft der Landwirtschaftsfläche von auswärtigen Landwirten bewirtschaftet wird. Die Steuereinnahmen, die der Gemeinde dadurch entgehen, sind aber relativ gering im Verhältnis zu anderen Finanzierungsquellen im Gemeindehaushalt. In agrarstruktureller Hinsicht zeigt diese Untersuchung erstmals an einem konkreten Beispiel eine Methode zur Ermittlung von Eigentums- und Bewirtschaftungskonzentration landwirtschaftlicher Flächen auf Gemeindeebene.
Q15|Land Measurement Bias: Comparisons from Global Positioning System, Self-Reports, and Satellite Data|Agricultural statistics derived from remote sensing data have been used primarily to compare land use information and changes over time. Nonclassical measurement error from farmer self-reports has been well documented in the survey design literature primarily in comparison to plots measured using Global Positioning System (GPS). In this paper, we investigate the reliability of remotely sensed satellite data on nonrandom measurement error and on agricultural relationships such as the inverse land size–productivity relationship and input demand functions. In our comparison of four Asian countries, we find significant differences between GPS and remotely sensed data only in Viet Nam, where plot sizes are small relative to the other countries. The magnitude of farmers’ self-reporting bias relative to GPS measures is nonlinear and varies across countries, with the largest magnitude of selfreporting bias of 130% of a standard deviation (2.2-hectare bias) in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic relative to Viet Nam, which has 13.3% of a standard deviation (.008-hectare bias). In all countries except Viet Nam, the inverse land size–productivity relationship is upwardly biased for lower land area self-reported measures relative to GPS measures. In Viet Nam, the intensive margin of organic fertilizer use is negatively biased by self-reported measurement error by 30.4 percentage points. As remotely sensed data becomes publicly available, it may become a less expensive alternative to link to survey data than rely on GPS measurement.
Q15|El paisaje rural medieval: del estudio de los dominios monásticos a la arqueología agraria|This study analyses the main lines of research developed in medieval Rural History in the last twenty years in the Iberian Peninsula, both in the Andalusian society and in the Christian kingdoms. We present special attention to the take-off of agrarian archeology, the characterization of the medieval peasantry and the study of livestock.
Q15|Climate Change and Agriculture: Farmer Adaptation to Extreme Heat|This paper examines how farmers adapt, in the short-run, to extreme heat. Using a production function approach and micro-data from Peruvian households, we find that high temperatures induce farmers to increase the use of inputs, such as land and domestic labor. This reaction partially attenuates the negative effects of high temperatures on output. We interpret this change in inputs as an adaptive response in a context of subsistence farming, incomplete markets, and lack of other coping mechanisms. We use our estimates to simulate alternative climate change scenarios and show that accounting for adaptive responses is quantitatively important.
Q15|Governance and Land Reform in the Palm Oil Value Chain in the Philippines|The chain literature (Global Commodity Chains/Value Chains/Production Networks) have remained surprisingly silent about the role of land as a factor of production. I use fieldwork experience from the palm oil industry in Agusan del Sur, Philippines to illustrate the way in which the buyer-driven nature of the chain interacts with a major institutional change, namely the redistributive land reform, Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP). I argue that the CARP has not resulted in the desired redistribution of power from the landed to the landless, but reinforces the unequal distribution of power between plantation/milling companies and beneficiaries, producing economic and social downgrading trajectories for reform beneficiaries and farmworkers.
Q15|The Impact of Climate Change on U.S. Agriculture: The Roles of Adaptation Techniques and Emissions Reductions|We investigate the impact of climate change on U.S. agricultural productivity using county-level yield and weather data from 1950 to 2015. We present two new methods of modelling how producers adapt agricultural techniques to harsh temperatures, including a new panel data estimator that allows for two-dimensional fixed-effects in slopes. We find evidence of adaptation to geographic and temporal variation in climate, but it has stalled since 1989. We show that adaptation implies fixed-effects slope heterogeneity in the relationship between crop yield and temperature, and ignoring this leads to biased estimates of temperature sensitivity. We use our estimates to project corn yields to 2100 using a variety of climate models and emission scenarios, and find that unmitigated climate change will have severe effects on yields. Our models indicate that adaptation techniques can mitigate 10 to 45% of the damage, but significant emissions reductions can mitigate far more (i.e., 42 to 91%).
Q15|A Matter of Time: An Impact Evaluation of the Brazilian National Land Credit Program|This paper provides an impact evaluation of the Programa Nacional de CrÃ©dito FundiÃ¡rio, a market assisted land reform program in Brazil. The paper uses a panel dataset and pipeline control group to evaluate the programâ€™s impact on agricultural production and earned income, using a difference in differences model with either municipal or individual fixed effects. The heterogeneous effect of additional years of land ownership is investigated. The findings suggest that the program increases production and earned income by about 75% and 35%, but only after four years of land ownership. The conclusions are supported by a number of robustness tests, although considerable attrition and potential bias due to unobserved variables suggests caution. The benefits of the program largely go to making debt payments. If the impact on income continues to grow, as it did in the first five years, improvements in net wealth and current welfare could both be achieved.
Q15|Evolving Practice in Land Demarcation|This paper analyzes social choice with respect to the demarcation of land boundaries, distinguishing between physical and legal demarcation. In contrast with the influential “land administration” literature and the World Bank’s policy guidelines, the analysis supports voluntary—instead of mandatory—demarcation as well as non-integrated services for land administration. Consistent with these theoretical arguments, the paper empirically verifies that demarcation conflicts play a lesser role in title-, land- and property-related litigation, which seems to increase in all these areas after physical demarcation is made mandatory. Relying on World Bank data, it also observes that linking and merging cadastres and land registries does not correlate with lower transaction costs.
Q15|Large-Scale Farms and Smallholders: Evidence from Zambia|In light of the surge in large-scale farms in developing countries, concerns have been raised that smallholders may be negatively affected. There is, however, very little evidence beyond case studies to support these claims. Drawing on nationally representative household data sets and an inventory of large-scale farms in Zambia, this study investigates the relationship between large-scale farms and smallholders. First, we analyse the geographical contexts of wards that host large-scale farms and show that large-scale farms are found in wards with good infrastructure and soil quality. Second, we adopt a difference-in-differences approach to estimate the impacts of large-scale farms on smallholders' area cultivated, maize yields, and access to fertiliser. We find that smallholders in wards with large-scale farms increase their area cultivated and maize yields, but have lower fertiliser usage. This hints at positive spillovers at the extensive and intensive margins but not at improved access to agricultural inputs. It is likely that these results are also driven by the emergence of medium-scale farms in these regions.
Q15|Kazakhstan’s cotton sector reforms since independence|" With the goal of reducing the dependency on oil revenues, the Government of Kazakhstan has recently increased its budget allocations to prop up the domestic agricultural sector. Yet, many observers agree that it is less the amount of public spending that induces long-term growth than the quality of the regulatory environment. Against this background, the current paper analyses the nature and effects of state regulation in the cotton sector. In the early 2000s, it was considered to be the only example of private vertical coordination in Kazakhstani agriculture, which contrasted sharply with the state mandates imposed on producers in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. However, in 2007, regulation in Kazakhstan forced ginneries to use a complex warehouse receipt system without making sure that it was accepted by stakeholders and without appropriate institutions for implementing it in place. At the same time, it imposed financing restrictions on ginneries, which were major loan and input providers to farmers. Further measures included the establishment of a special economic zone to host a ""cotton cluster"". In the following years, private producers and investors turned away from cotton, and cotton area and output fell substantially. We argue that the cotton sector performance after 2007 shows how ill-designed regulation and government interference can turn a promising economic sector into decline. As an unintended side effect, the regulation promoted more diversified crop rotations based on high value crops.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>"
Q15|Could/should Jubilee debt cancellations be reintroduced today?|In this paper the authors recall the history of Jubilee debt cancellations, emphasizing what their social purpose was at that time. They note that it would not be possible to copy that procedure exactly nowadays, primarily because most debt/credit relationships are intermediated via financial institutions, such as banks, insurance companies, etc., rather than by governments or wealthy families directly. But the authors argue that the underlying social purpose of such Jubilees - to keep debt within the reasonable ability to be paid without social and economic polarisation - could be recreated via alternative mechanisms, and they discuss the politico-economic arguments for, and against, doing so.

Q15|Bewässerung in der Landwirtschaft - Tagungsband zur Fachtagung am 11./12.09.2017 in Suderburg|"Am 11. und 12. September 2017 fand an der Ostfalia Hochschule, Campus Suderburg, eine vom Thünen-Institut, dem Julius-Kühn Institut und der Ostfalia Hochschule gemeinsam organisierte Fachtagung zum Thema ""Bewässerung in der Landwirtschaft"" statt. Dazu wurden deutschland-weit Experten des Fachgebiets Bewässerung eingeladen, aktuelle Einschätzungen zur Entwicklung des Bewässerungsbedarfs und der Bewässerungswürdigkeit verschiedener Kulturen an unterschiedlichen Standorten in Deutschland sowie zur Entwicklung der Bewässerungstechnik zu geben. Die Bewässerung von Kulturen im Freilandgemüsebau oder Sonderkulturbereich gehört in ganz Deutschland seit langem zur gängigen Praxis. Die Rentabilität der Bewässerung weiterer landwirtschaftlicher Feldkulturen war bisher auf einige wenige, trockene Standorte begrenzt. Im Zuge des Klimawandels werden seit einigen Jahren eine steigende Jahresdurchschnittstemperatur und veränderte Niederschlagsmuster (v. a. geringere Niederschläge zu Beginn der Vegetationsperiode im Frühjahr) in Deutschland beobachtet. Für die Zukunft sind laut der Ergebnisse von Klimamodellen eine weitere Zunahme der Temperaturen und weitere Veränderungen der Niederschlagsverteilung, z. B. eine Abnahme der Sommerniederschläge und eine Zunahme der Winterniederschläge, zu erwarten. Der Tagungsband gibt einen Überblick über neueste Erkenntnisse aus der Forschung und diskutiert mögliche alternative Quellen für die Deckung des Beregnungswasserbedarfs landwirtschaftlicher Kulturen. Dabei werden auch Aspekte des Landschaftswasserhaushalts und hydrologische Zusammenhänge in der Agrarlandschaft angesprochen und Lösungsansätze präsentiert. Einblicke in mögliche Nutzungskonflikte der Wassernutzung und praktische Erfahrungen mit der Erarbeitung von Lösungsansätzen werden begleitet von der Darstellung der rechtlichen Rahmenbedingungen der Wassernutzung. Ergänzt werden die Beiträge durch Berichte langjähriger Beregnungs-Feldversuche der Landwirtschaftskammer Niedersachsen. Einerseits ergaben die Versuche, dass die Bewässerung die Nährstoffeffizienz der Pflanzen und die Qualität der Ernteprodukte erhöhen kann. Andererseits werden der derzeitige Stand der Technik der Bewässerung erläutert und Grenzen sowie Möglichkeiten für eine Steigerung der Effizienz in der Zukunft dargelegt. Zur Steigerung der Effizienz der Bewässerung kommt der Bewässerungssteuerung eine hohe Bedeutung zu, deren aktueller Stand dargestellt und die Trends für die Zu-kunft aufgezeigt werden. Die Rentabilität der Investitionen in Bewässerungstechnik wird in zwei Beiträgen dargestellt. Hier werden sowohl die verschiedenen Techniken als auch deren Rentabilität bei verschiedenen Kulturen betriebswirtschaftlich beurteilt. Als Abrundung wird die Entwicklung des regionalen Bewässerungsbedarfs am Beispiel Nordrhein-Westfalens aufgezeigt. Der Tagungsband schließt mit einem Kapitel zur Übersicht über bisherige Projekte im Bereich des Wassermanagements und zu Fragen der Bewässerung landwirtschaftlicher Nutzflächen im Hinblick auf zukünftige Klimaveränderungen in Deutschland."
Q15|Wirkungen von Direktzahlungen in der Landwirtschaft - ausgewählte Aspekte mit Bezug zum Strukturwandel|Die flächenbezogenen Direktzahlungen der ersten Säule der Gemeinsamen Agrarpolitik (GAP) stellen den größten Teil der öffentlichen Mittel an die aktiven Landwirte dar. Im Jahr 2016 beliefen sich diese Zahlungen für Deutschland auf 4,84 Mrd. Euro. Pro Hektar werden somit jährlich ewa 280 Euro gezahlt. Im Hinblick auf die Weiterentwicklung der GAP für die Zeit nach 2020 und aufgrund der großen finanziellen Bedeutung der Direktzahlungen für die Landwirte, werden teilweise kontroverse Diskussionen über die künftige Mittelverteilung und den Einsatz dieser Zahlungen zur bestmöglichen Erreichung von agrar- und umweltpolitischen Zielen geführt. Ein viel diskutiertes Thema ist insbesondere die Umverteilung der Direktzahlungen zugunsten kleinerer Betriebe. Um die Informationsbasis für Verhandlungen zu verbessern, hat das Bundesministerium für Ernährung und Landwirtschaft (BMEL) das Thünen-Institut beauftragt, die Wirkungen der Direktzahlungen auf den Strukturwandel in der Landwirtschaft zu analysieren. Besondere Aspekte des uftrags waren die Überwälzung der Zahlungen an Verpächter, die Auswirkungen auf den betrieblichen Strukturwandel sowie Größeneffekte hinsichtlich des Betriebsaufwands und der Unternehmensgewinne. Um die Ergebnisse einer interessierten Öffentlichkeit zugänglich zu machen, ird die auf einzelne Fragen des BMEL antwortende Stellungnahme nun publiziert. [...]
Q15|The Value of Biodiversity as an Insurance Device|This paper presents a benchmark endogenous growth model including biodiversity preservation dynamics. Producing food requires land, and increasing the share of total land devoted to farming mechanically reduces the share of land devoted to biodiversity conservation. However, the safeguarding of a greater number of species is associated to better ecosystem services – pollination, flood control, pest control, etc., which in turn ensure a lower volatility of agricultural productivity. The optimal conversion/preservation rule is explicitly characterized, as well as the value of biological diversity, in terms of the welfare gain of biodiversity conservation. The Epstein-Zin-Weil specification of the utility function allows us to disentangle the effects of risk aversion and aversion to fluctuations. A two-player game extension of the model highlights the effect of volatility externalities and the Paretian sub-optimality of the decentralized choice.
Q15|Impact Of Climate Dynamics On Cyclical Properties Of Wine Production In Douro Region Using A Time-Frequency Approach|In this paper we model the impact of climate dynamics on wine production temporal cycles for the period 1933 to 2013 in the Douro wine region. We identify the cyclical properties of wine production and which cycles are de-termined by spring temperature and soil water levels during summer. We find that the in-season spring temperature as well as the temperatures of two and three years ago explain about 65% of the variability of wine pro-duction. When the soil water level in summer is incorporated, the R2 in-creases to 83% minimizing the Akaike criterion. The effects of soil water in wine production are depending on the timing. The in-season effect of an increase in soil water is negative, whilst soil water from two and three years ago have a positive effect on wine production. There is a stable but non- constant link between production and the spring temperature. The temper-ature is responsible for two long-medium cycles of 5.8 year and 4.2 years as well as a short one of 2.4 years that began since the 80s. The soil water level can explain 60% of the 7 years cycles of wine production as well as a short one of 2.3 years cycle which has been happening since the 90s. We also identify a shift of the relative importance away from temperature to soil water. Despite using a new an extended dataset, our results largely confirm the results of the impact of climate on the wine production in Douro region in our previous research. Modelling the impact of climate on the wine production can be an important instrument contributing for mitigation strategies facing the projected climate conditions in order to remain com-petitive in the market.
Q15|Optimal coverage of an emission tax in the presence of monitoring, reporting, and verification costs|Environmental policies often include exemptions for some firms, e.g. the small emitters. This paper explores the implications of such exemptions in the case of an emission tax, and in the presence of monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) costs. We develop an analytical framework capturing the trade-off between the cost-effectiveness of a broader tax base, and the savings on MRV costs enabled by a partial coverage. Second-best partial coverage is defined by a threshold value of some characteristic of the firms below which firms are exempted. We characterize the optimal threshold and discuss its welfare implications. Since determining this threshold is demanding in terms of information regarding firm-level MRV and abatement costs, we show how limited knowledge about these costs at the aggregate level can be used in practice to approximate the optimal threshold. We apply this framework to assess the welfare implications of such an instrument in the case of greenhouse gas emissions from European agriculture. The findings indicate that exempting the small emitters may provide significant savings on MRV costs compared to the full coverage, while still incentivizing cost-effective reductions in emissions.
Q15|Groundwater Management in a Food Security Context|Abstract This article analyzes the sustainability of market-based instruments such as tradable permits for the management of a renewable aquifer used for irrigated agriculture. In our dynamic hydro-economic model, a water agency aims at satisfying a food security constraint within a tradable permit scheme in the presence of myopic heterogeneous agents. We identify analytically the viability kernel that defines the states of the resource yielding inter-temporal feasible paths able to satisfy the set of constraints over time and the associated set of viable quota policies. We then illustrate the theoretical results of the paper with numerical simulations based on the Western La Mancha aquifer.
Q15|Do European Agri-environment Measures Help Reduce Herbicide Use? Evidence From Viticulture in France|Agri-environmental schemes (AES) are a central component of the European environmental policy, but few of these schemes have been carefully evaluated and doubts are often expressed about their effectiveness. We use original data collected from winegrowers who participated in an AES targeting non-point source pollution from herbicides in 2011 and 2012 in the South region of France. Using the variation in the implementation of the scheme across time and space and a matching approach, we show that the quantity of herbicides used by participants in the scheme in 2011 ranges from 38 to 53% below what they would have used without the scheme and this percentage is between 42 and 50% in 2012. Further, our results suggest that least demanding AES options are effective in avoiding pollution peaks when weed pressure is high, whereas more demanding AES options guarantee an overall reduction in herbicide use, even during relatively easy farming years in which less weed pressure is experienced.
Q15|Farmland Rental Values in GM Soybean Areas of Argentina: Do Contractual Arrangements Matter?|We study the determinants of rental prices of farmland in the Argentinean Pampas. In particular, we examine the value of lease contract characteristics within a hedonic price framework, while controlling for other potential sources of variation. Using first-hand data for 255 parcels, our results indicate that both short-term contracts and contracts with sowing pools push rental prices upwards. We also find that soybean yields have a significant impact on land rental rates. These results suggest that if Argentina intends to protect the enormous natural advantage it has for agricultural production, it should consider strictly regulating land rental contracts.
Q15|Is GM Soybean Cultivation in Argentina Sustainable?|This paper explores the long-term sustainability of Argentina’s specialization in genetically modified (GM) soybean cultivation. We perform an evidence-based assessment of the most relevant economic, social, and environmental implications of the “soybeanization” of Argentinian agriculture. Our diagnostic relies on a combination of published sources and a unique data set drawn from a field survey carried out in 2011 in two provinces of the Argentinian Pampas. This data set allows us to evaluate with a reliable empirical base the socio-economic impacts of GM soybean cultivation. Our analysis suggests a conflict between the success of the “soybeanization” of Argentinian agriculture measured in terms of production and profit records, and the social, economic, and environmental sustainability of this new model of production. On the one hand, GM soybean technological package adoption has increased farm productivity, and reduced the costs per unit produced, resulting in a dramatic increase in profits. On the other hand, the specialization of Argentinian agriculture on soybean cultivation has increased the dependence of public finances on the foreign exchange revenue generated by exports earnings. We also find a mixed empirical picture of changing land distribution patterns and labor displacement resulting from GM soybean expansion. Finally, we find that the environmental implications of agricultural biotechnology appear alarming and the long-term sustainability of GM crops highly questionable. Promoting sustainable agricultural growth has become not only desirable but necessary.
Q15|Minnelige avtaler ved grunnerverv|Statens vegvesens grunnerverv ender i større grad enn før med minnelig avtale enn skjønn. Etter 2000 har ca. 95 % av alle deres grunnerverv endt med minnelig avtale. Med bakgrunn i dette ønsker vi å undersøke hvorfor grunneiere inngår minnelig avtale. Vi har utarbeidet en spørreundersøkelse som vi har sendt til grunneiere som har inngått minnelig avtale ved grunnerverv. Spørreundersøkelsen har en svarprosent på 39,45 % og svarene har blitt brukt til forskjellige typer analyser, som sammen med resultatene har dannet grunnlaget for drøfting av problemstillinger. Analysene avslører at grunneierne har angitt forskjellige ting som utslagsgivende for deres avtale. Gjennomsnitt viser at vegens betydning for lokalsamfunnet er mest utslagsgivende. Videre kommer det frem at noen inngår avtale for å unngå skjønn, mens andre er fornøyd med erstatningen. Grunneiere inngår minnelig avtale fordi de får dekket behov som er nødvendig for dem for at de skal godta avtalen.
Q15|Variation in output shares and endogenous matching in land rental contracts| We investigate the extent of variation in output sharing in land rental contracts and alternative hypotheses to explain this variation. Close to half of the rental contracts in our study in northern Ethiopia have output shares that deviate from the dominant 50-50 equal sharing. Variation in land quality, the relative bargaining power of landlords and tenants, production risks and shocks are hypothesized to influence output shares. Matched data of landlords and tenants are used. The importance of endogenous matching of landlords and tenants is investigated by assessing how endogenous tenant characteristics are correlated with landlord characteristics. We find evidence of negative assortative matching for key resource characteristics. A control function approach is used to control for endogenous matching in the output share models. The results reveal that production risks as well as relative bargaining power affect output shares in the reverse tenancy setting with tenants being relatively wealthier and influential than landlords.

Q15|Land rental as a complementary income source for land-poor youth|Continued high population growth in already densely populated rural areas in parts of SubSaharan Africa makes it harder for youth to choose agriculture as their main source of income. We investigate whether near landless youth can still access rented land as a complementary source of income. We utilize a unique data set of rural youth that have been allocated rehabilitated communal land to form formalized business groups for joint business activity. They rely on complementary sources of income and land renting is one of these. Using data from a sample of 1138 youth business group members from 119 youth groups in five districts in the Tigray region of Ethiopia, we find that land renting is a complementary income source for 29% of these youth. It is the most important source of income for 16.8% of the youth and the second most important source of income for 14% of the youth. Access to rented land is constrained, however. Male youth who own oxen and ploughs are much more likely to be able to rent land. Utilizing a trust game to elicit trust and trustworthiness of the youth, we also found a positive association between trust and access to rented land. Trust reduces transaction costs and more trustworthy youth have better access to rented land. The importance of trust is also illustrated by the dominance of kinship contracts and contracts with close neighbors reducing the costs of monitoring tenants. The dominance of sharecropping contracts also contributes to rationing and low allocation efficiency in the market. The prohibition of land sales also limits the potential of the “agricultural ladder” to facilitate youth climbing out of poverty through purchase of land.
Q15|A comment on changes in the Norwegian Land Consolidation Act|The Land Consolidation Act has recently been revised. The changes came into force on 1 July 2006 and 1 January 2007. The main changes in the Act are that the land consolidation court now has formal jurisdiction to handle land consolidation cases for all types of properties independent of location, unless particular cases are specifically removed from the court's jurisdiction in the Act. The Act provides for two new types of land consolidation cases in Section 2. The paper analyzes these different revisions.
Q15|Grunnvassforvaltning. Om Elinor Ostrom si tilnærming til forvaltning av grunnvatn|The paper discusses the challenges present in the management of groundwater. The theoretical approach of Elinor Ostrom is presented and her study of the management of groundwater in Southern California in the 1960ies is used illuminate how the bottom up process for developing a sustainable system of governance works in California. The most general challenge for a management system is to establish reasonably accurate knowledge about the extent of the groundwater reservoir, a list of the holders of rights to access or pump the groundwater, and the amount taken by those who exercise their rights. If the rights holders are to govern themselves, they need an institutional framework that allows them to create a legally valid constitution for these who have rights in the groundwater. The system of Home-rule that governs local management of public affairs in California provides such framework. This has been studied as polycentric governance.
Q15|Understanding Norwegian Commons|he paper reviews the development of the legal status of Norwegian commons from the first known legislation on commons. The development can be divided into 5 periods. The first period lasted until about 1300. In this period, the commons changed from being a local matter for the chiefs and the local thing to become a national resource where also the King had rights to resources for defence of the realm. The second period is the big population decline 1350-1550 where Norway lost 60% of its population and the King and his bureaucracy moved to Copenhagen. The commons reverted to a local issue. The third period lasted from about 1550 to 1814. The powers of ownership were now seen to reside in the Crown. It had moved from the local community to the state. The rights of common were respected and should remain as they had been from old on. Limitations on the commoner's exploitation were introduced. Rights of common were held by active farms and stinted to the needs of the farm. At the same time, the Crown started large-scale exploitation of the forest resources and selling off forestland to sawmill owners and timber merchants. In the period 1814 to 1857/ 1863 the state’s ideas about the commons were recast into 3 types of commons and one type not mentioned in the legal texts that here is called hamlet commons. In the period after 1863 the limitations and regulations of the exploitation of the commons continued. By the end of the 20th century, the rights of common were reduced to rights of forests and pasture tailored to the needs of the farm. However, the development in farming and recreation activities of the population changed the usage of the commons. The rights of fishing and hunting in state commons came close to an all men’s right. The national community expanded its use of the commons by defining much of their areas to be protected lands providing landscapes for recreational activities and production of ecosystem services.

Q15|Climate change and Migration: Is Agriculture the Main Channel?|Migration and climate change are two of the most important challenges the world currently faces. They are connected as climate change may stimulate migration. One of the sectors most strongly affected by climate change is agriculture, where most of the world’s poor are employed. Climate change may affect agricultural productivity and hence migration because of its impact on average temperatures and rainfall and because it increases the frequency and intensity of weather shocks. This paper uses 50 years of data, from 1960 to 2010, for more than 150 countries to analyse the relationship between weather variation, agricultural productivity and migration. Our main findings are that, in line with theoretical predictions, negative shocks to agricultural productivity caused by weather fluctuations significantly increase migration in middle and lower income countries but not in the poorest and in the rich countries. The results are robust to different econometric specifications.
Q15|Evolving practice in land demarcation|This paper analyzes social choice with respect to the demarcation of land boundaries, distinguishing between physical and legal demarcation. In contrast with the influential “land administration” literature and the World Bank’s policy guidelines, the analysis supports voluntary—instead of mandatory—demarcation as well as non-integrated services for land administration. Consistent with these theoretical arguments, the paper empirically verifies that demarcation conflicts play a lesser role in title-, land- and property-related litigation, which seems to increase in all these areas after physical demarcation is made mandatory. Relying on World Bank data, it also observes that linking and merging cadastres and land registries does not correlate with lower transaction costs.
Q15|Disseminação de informações em sistemas socioecológicos : análise de um modelo híbrido de dinâmica de sistemas e modelagem baseada em agentes|This study aimed to identify if it is possible, merely through opinion leaders, to disseminate information in irrigation systems. System Dynamics, Agent-Based Modeling, and Social Network Analysis approaches were used for the construction of a hybrid simulation model. An analysis of the characteristics and structural aspects of social networks of the Gorutuba Irrigation Perimeter, in the northern semiarid region of Minas Gerais, was performed. It was observed that the most central agents are in key positions for the flow of information or on compulsory routes for their spread, thus allowing them to filter, retain, or even distort the produced information. The results showed that policies to improve the flow of information to increase resilience of such systems should be based on targeting leading actors.
Q15|Droits de propriété foncière et performance des petits producteurs agricoles des pays en développement : une synthèse de la littérature empirique|This article reviews the methods and results of empirical studies analyzing the impact of land property rights on the performance of smallholder farmers in developing countries. The results of previous empirical studies are mixed about the real effects of land property rights. The heterogeneity of the results is related to both the evaluation techniques used and the local context of the tenure system’s management. However, the results converge toward an endogenous relationship between land property rights and smallholder farmers’ performance in contexts where customary land management is predominant. Cet article fait la revue critique des méthodes et résultats des études empiriques qui analysent l’impact des droits de propriété foncière sur la performance des petits producteurs agricoles des pays en développement. Les résultats des études empiriques antérieures sont contrastés quant aux effets réels des droits de propriété. L’hétérogénéité des résultats est liée à la fois aux techniques d’évaluation utilisées et au contexte local de gestion du système foncier. Toutefois, les résultats convergent vers une endogénéité entre les droits de propriété et la performance des producteurs dans les contextes où la gestion coutumière du foncier est prédominante.
Q15|Efectos de las decisiones de inversión en la formalización de tierras de los hogares rurales colombianos|Este trabajo estima la efectividad de las inversiones permanentes en predios sobre la formalización de tierras de hogares rurales, en el contexto de la ley de reforma agraria colombiana. Utilizando un modelo de probabilidad lineal con efectos fijos de hogar, se encuentra que un aumento de 1% en estas inversiones aumenta en 0.22% la probabilidad de formalización, en tres microrregiones colombianas entre el 2010 y el 2016. Además, se propone una posible solución a sesgos por simultaneidad y selección entre la inversión y la formalización, con variables rezagadas e instrumentando con choques de precipitación. La investigación ofrece una explicación sobre la permanencia en la informalidad de los pequeños productores, a pesar de la creación de políticas que promueven la formalización.
Q15|Retos asociados al uso del suelo: El dilema entre conservación y producción en los Bosques Andinos de Robles del Corredor Ecológico Guantiva-La Rusia-Iguaque|Preservar los Bosques Andinos de Robles es de gran importancia dado su valor intrínseco y los servicios ecosistémicos ofrecidos que favorecen el bienestar humano. No obstante, las prácticas de ganadería extensiva en el territorio nacional generan presión sobre su existencia. Aplicando un modelo de optimización dinámica que considera el valor del bosque por diversos servicios ecosistémicos, se busca entender el trade-off entre conservación y ganadería, así como las complejas relaciones entre los hombres y la naturaleza. De acuerdo a los resultados, debería conservarse entre el 62.7% y 99.4% del bosque dependiendo de la magnitud y valores de los parámetros. Finalmente, este documento busca aportar a la discusión sobre recomendaciones de política que favorezcan la conservación de los ecosistemas boscosos.
Q15|Limitantes sociales y políticos de la industrialización por sustitución de importaciones en Colombia 1950-1980|El presente trabajo tiene como objetivo lograr un acercamiento a las dificultades sociales y políticas por las cuales atravesó el modelo de Industrialización por Sustitución de Importaciones (ISI) en Colombia. A lo largo del texto se realiza un recorrido por diversos problemas afrontados en el país entre 1950 y 1980, periodo durante el cual el problema agrario, el conflicto armado y la falta de una élite económica que propiciara un proceso de industrialización aparecen como razones generadoras de dificultades en el proceso de industrialización colombiano. Finalmente, se concluye que estos motivos generan consecuencias que no permiten consolidar un mercado interno fuerte, factor fundamental para el proceso de industrialización.
Q15|The Perversion of Land Reform by Landed Elites: Power, Inequality and Development in Colombia|Over two centuries, Colombia transferred vast quantities of land, equivalent to the entire UK landmass, mainly to landless peasants. And yet Colombia retains one of the highest concentrations of land ownership in the world. Why? We show that land reform’s effects are highly bimodal. Most of Colombia’s 1100+ municipalities lack a landed elite. Here, rural properties grew larger, land inequality fell, and development improved. But where land is concentrated in the hands of a rural elite, distributed land was diverted to bigger farms, resulting in fewer small and more large farms, greater land dispersion, and lower levels of development. We show that these effects – positive and negative – flow through political participation, competition, and policy-making. Landed elites use patron-client ties to distort local and national politics to their benefit. Land reform’s secondary effects, on the distribution of power, are more important than its primary effects on the distribution of land. *** Desde la independencia, Colombia ha transferido una vasta cantidad de tierra, equivalente al área del Reino Unido, principalmente a campesinos desterrados. Sin embargo, Colombia mantiene hoy en día uno de los más altos niveles de concentración de la tenencia de la tierra en el mundo. ¿Por qué? En este artículo mostramos que los efectos de la reforma agraria son bimodales. La mayoría de los más de 1100 municipios no cuentan con una élite terrateniente. En estos municipios, la propiedad rural creció y la desigualdad de la tierra se redujo. Pero, donde la tierra está concentrada en manos de una élite rural, la distribución de la tierra se orientó hacia los beneficios de los grandes terratenientes, con mayor dispersión en la tierra y menor nivel de desarrollo. Mostramos que estos efectos –positivos y negativos- se vinculan a la participación política, la competencia y la implementación de políticas. La élite terrateniente utiliza los vínculos patrón-cliente para distorsionar los beneficios de la política local y nacional. Los efectos secundarios de la reforma agraria en la distribución del poder, son más importantes que los efectos primarios en la distribución de la tierra.
Q15|How Large Are the Contributions of Cities to the Development of Rural Communities? A Market Access Approach for a Quarter Century of Evidence from Chile|This article estimates the impact of cities on the economic development of rural communities in Chile, following a market access approach. The effect of the proximity to cities on the development of rural communities is analyzed by estimating the impact of market access on the population, and farm and non-farm employment of rural communities. Using population censuses and remote sensing data, we find, in our preferred estimations, that a 10% higher market access induced a 10%–14% increase in the population of rural communities. Additionally, higher positive elasticities are found in the non-farm sector rather than in the agricultural one. These results widely support the hypothesis of structural change and the diversification of the rural economy for rural communities with better access to markets. Notwithstanding, the evidence also suggests that the farm sector took important advantages from market access in places with better agro-ecological conditions.
Q15|Construir sobre la tierra: ensayo sobre los modelos de racionalidad en la agricultura del territorio de Colombia en el siglo XIX|En el presente ensayo se realiza una reflexión sobre el entramado de ideas que en el siglo XIX se usó como paradigma de las formas de organización agraria posibles para el país, en medio de un contexto marcado por la violencia, el subdesarrollo y la lucha de clases que resultó en un pronunciado contraste entre los efectos esperados y los resultados conseguidos. Se exploran las alternativas vinculadas al agro y una ponderación entre éstas y el modelo de desarrollo capitalista para finalmente hacer una breve reflexión sobre la posibilidad realista de su aplicabilidad. Se pretende demostrar así que, las condiciones del país no respondían a los modelos idealizados de desarrollo externos, porque se trataba de un territorio con condiciones singulares que requerían una interpretación propia. ****** In this paper, a reflection is made on the framework of ideas that in the 19th century were used as a paradigm of possible forms of agrarian organization for the country, in the midst of a context marked by violence, underdevelopment and class struggle which triggered in a sharp contrast between the expected effects and the results achieved. The alternatives linked to agriculture and a weighting between them and the model of capitalist development are explored, to make a brief reflection on the realistic possibility of its applicability. This is to demonstrate that the conditions of the country did not respond to the idealized models of external development, because it was a territory with unique conditions that required its own interpretation.
Q15|Feeding the farmer, or taking food away from the farmer? the expansion of the agricultural frontier in Colombia|This paper analyses the expansion of the agricultural frontier in Colombia using the theories of Marx and Ricardo to understand which of them is closer to the Colombian process. This essay begins with a theoretical framework that defines the theories of both authors. Then, the most important moments of the expansion of the agricultural frontier are presented: the colonization of Antioquia and the expansion of the agricultural frontier between 1936 and 1972. A justification and representation of these processes are built from historical works on the topic. Finally, a balance of the overall process and missing areas of investigation are presented.****** Este artículo analiza la expansión de la frontera agrícola en Colombia utilizando las teorías de Marx y Ricardo para comprender a cuál de ellas está más cerca del proceso colombiano. El ensayo comienza con un marco teórico que define los postulados de ambos autores. Luego, se presentan los momentos más importantes de la expansión de la frontera agrícola: la colonización antioqueña y la expansión de la frontera agrícola entre 1936 y 1972. Se construye una justificación y representación de estos procesos a partir de algunos trabajos históricos sobre el tema. Finalmente, se presenta un resumen del proceso general y las áreas potenciales de futuras investigaciones.
Q15|Could/Should Jubilee Debt Cancellations be Reintroduced Today?|In this paper we recall the history of Jubilee debt cancellations, emphasizing what their social purpose was at that time. We note that it would not be possible to copy that procedure exactly nowadays, primarily because most debt/credit relationships are intermediated via financial institutions, such as banks, insurance companies, etc., rather than by governments or wealthy families directly. But we argue that the underlying social purpose of such Jubilees- to keep debt within the reasonable ability to be paid without social and economic polarisation - could be recreated via alternative mechanisms, and we discuss the politico-economic arguments for, and against, doing so
Q15|Mise en place d’un Dispositif de connaissance, suivi et évaluation socio-économique et environnemental de la Nouvelle Aire Protégée (NAP) du Makay, Madagascar|D’une superficie d’environ 4 000 km2, la Nouvelle Aire Protégée du Makay, Madagascar, officialisée en 2017, est emblématique de la richesse de la biodiversité, avec un taux d’endémisme exceptionnel, et du patrimoine naturel et culturel malgache. Le présent document expose les enjeux et les options méthodologiques pour la mise en place d’un dispositif de connaissance, suivi et évaluation socio-économique et environnemental. Le dispositif se compose de trois bras articulés, combinant sciences sociales et sciences de la nature et de la terre, aussi bien quantitatifs que qualitatifs : un dispositif quantitatif d’enquêtes socio-économiques et environnementales auprès des populations du Makay ; un dispositif de suivi écologique ; un dispositif qualitatif de type socio-anthropologique. En mettant les populations qui vivent aux pourtours du Makay au coeur du dispositif, il se propose de repousser la frontière des systèmes d’informations existants, à ce jour balbutiants dans ce domaine, malgré leur importance décisive à l’échelle mondiale, afin de mieux comprendre les liens entre conservation et développement._____________________________________________________________________ Covering an area of approximately 4,000 km2, the New Protected Area of Makay, Madagascar, formalized in 2017, is emblematic of the richness of biodiversity, with an exceptional rate of endemism, and the natural and cultural heritage of Madagascar. This document presents the challenges and the methodological options for setting up a socio-economic and environmental knowledge, monitoring and evaluation system. The device consists of three articulated arms, combining social sciences and natural and earth sciences, both quantitative and qualitative: a quantitative arm of socio-economic and environmental surveys among the populations of Makay; an ecological monitoring arm; and a qualitative socio-anthropological arm. By putting the people who live on the edge of the Makay at the heart of the device, it proposes to push the frontier of existing information systems, still underdeveloped in this field, despite their decisive importance on a global scale, in order to better understand the links between conservation and development.
Q15|Tall Building and Land Values: Height and Construction Cost Elasticities in Chicago, 1870 - 2010|Cities around the world are experiencing unprecedented vertical growth. Yet, the economics of skyscrapers remain empirically understudied. This paper analyzes the determinants of the urban height profile by combining a micro-geographic data set on tall buildings with a unique panel of land prices covering 140 years. We provide novel estimates of the land price elasticity of height, the height elasticity of construction cost, and the elasticity of substitution between land and capital for tall buildings. In line with improvements in construction technology, the land price elasticity of height increased substantially over time, rationalizing a trend to ever taller buildings. The land price elasticity of height is larger for commercial than for residential buildings, suggesting that the typical segregation of land uses within cities is not exclusively shaped by the demand side, but also by the supply side.
Q15|The urban village, agrarian transformation, and rentier capitalism in Gurgaon, India|Gurgaon, India's “millennium city”, is today synonymous with India's embrace of global real estate capital and private sector‐led urban development. This paper asserts that Gurgaon's spectacular urbanisation has been fundamentally underpinned by an uneven process of land acquisition, exemption and agrarian transformation. Shifting away from dispossession‐centred analyses of contemporary urbanisation in India, this paper explores Gurgaon's “urban villages” to consider the uneven integration of agrarian classes into emerging urban real estate markets. Through an examination of differential experiences of land acquisition and agrarian social change among Gurgaon's landowning classes, the paper seeks to trace complex and nonlinear processes of agrarian transformation which make possible landscapes of global accumulation.
Q15|Adaptation to climate change in the tropical mountains? Effects of intraseasonal climate variability on crop diversification strategies in the Peruvian Andes|La diversificación de cultivos, la selección de cultivos tolerantes y el cultivo intercalado son algunas de las estrategias que los agricultores andinos, al igual que los agricultores de otras regiones montañosas, han utilizado históricamente para enfrentar los riesgos relacionados con el clima y para aprovechar las tierras agrícolas heterogéneas (con parcelas ubicadas en distintas altitudes, enfrentando diferentes condiciones ambientales). Este estudio analiza el papel de la variabilidad climática —durante el período de crecimiento— en el uso de estas estrategias, en un contexto de cambio climático en la región andina. Utilizando datos censales agrarios de 1994 y 2012 (panel distrital), la autora encuentra que —controlando por otras condiciones climáticas y factores socioeconómicos—, un aumento en la variabilidad climática intraestacional lleva a los agricultores de las áreas más frías (
Q15|Growth factors in the agriculture of Russia|In 2017, the harvest of cereals, including wheat, Russia’s top agricultural export commodity, hit its record high. This happened mostly due to a significant rise in wheat harvest against the three previous years (Tables 34, 35). At the same time, the record-high harvest caused problems with the transportation of grain from the regions of the Siberian Federal District. Agricultural producers also note a decline in the profitability of agricultural production (on the average, by 8.4 percent, to 12-14 percent[1]) due to the accelerated growth in the prices of inputs by comparison with that of the sales price of grain, which lagged behind because of the record-high harvest.
Q15|Do U.S. Anglers Care about Harmful Algal Blooms? A Discrete Choice Experiment of Lake Erie Recreational Anglers|Despite the growing awareness of harmful algal blooms (HABs) in the United States and abroad, estimates of welfare losses due to their presence are missing from the literature. Using a mail survey of 767 Ohio Lake Erie recreational angler respondents and a choice experiment, this study provides the first empirical quantification of the economic impacts of HABs on U.S. recreational anglers. Our results demonstrate a significant and substantial willingness to pay by anglers for reduction in HABs, beyond the benefits associated with conventional water quality measures such as catch rates and water clarity. For instance, we find that anglers are willing to pay $8 to $10 more per trip for one less mile of boating through HABs en route to a fishing site. This finding suggests that explicit measures of HABs need to be collected and considered when valuing water quality in nutrient-rich bodies of water. We evaluate the welfare improvements resulting from several nutrient reduction policies, and find that anglers are willing to pay on average $40 to $60 per trip for a policy that cuts upstream phosphorus loadings by 40%. The majority of welfare gains for anglers result from improving the non-catchable component of the fishing experience, notably water clarity and HAB reduction, as opposed to better chances of angler success.
Q15|2018 Iowa State University Land Value Survey: Overview|"Farmland represents over 80 percent of all U.S. farm assets, and is arguably often a farmer's single largest investment item, a major source of collateral, and a key component of the farmer's debt portfolio. Since 1950, the Iowa State University Land Value Survey has been the only data source that provides a county-level land value estimate for each of the 99 counties in Iowa. The 2018 Iowa State University Land Value Survey reported a 0.8 percent decrease to $7,264 per acre in average Iowa farmland values from November 2017 to November 2018. This modest drop is the fourth decline in Iowa farmland values over the past five years and represents a 17 percent decline from the 2013 peak in nominal land values, or a 24 percent drop in inflation-adjusted values. The recent decline is largely attributable to lower commodity prices, higher interest rates, and to some extent the trade disruptions. On the other hand, the magnitude of this decline is still very modest and overall the land market is largely stable. In general, the results from the 2018 Iowa State University Land Value Survey echo results from other surveys, which all showed relatively stable farmland market trends.

Q15|Unraveling the Threads of Decentralized Community-Based Irrigation Systems in Bolivia|Irrigation is a key determinant of agricultural productivity, income, and sustainable development. This paper estimates the impact of the National Irrigation Program with a Watershed Approach (PRONAREC) on the value of agricultural production, investments in complementary technologies, household income, and water resource management in rural communities in Bolivia. We use a unique cross-sectional data set collected from a sample of 1,682 farmers (583 beneficiaries and 1,099 controls) for the 2014-2015 agricultural cycle. To evaluate the effects of the program, we exploit special features of the program design by comparing two rounds of program participants: treated communities are those that received the program first, while control communities are those that were in the pipeline to receive the treatment at a later period. The strategy controls for program placement and self-selection bias at the community level, and we control for self-selection based on observable characteristics with the implementation of Propensity Score Matching. The results show that participation in the program improved the value of agricultural production, and it triggered a deeper process of technological change that led to investments in complementary inputs. Additionally, there is evidence PRONAREC has strengthened farmers’ access to markets, increased household incomes, promoted the formalization of water users’ associations, and improved the organization and management of irrigation systems. Nevertheless, the lack of effects on agricultural productivity suggests program beneficiaries are in the upward sloping curve of the learning process
Q15|Climate change and agriculture: farmer adaptation to extreme heat| This paper examines how farmers adapt, in the short-run, to extreme heat. Using a production function approach and micro-data from Peruvian households, we find that high temperatures induce farmers to increase the use of inputs, such as land and domestic labor. This reaction partially attenuates the negative effects of high temperatures on output. We interpret this change in inputs as an adaptive response in a context of subsistence farming, incomplete markets, and lack of other coping mechanisms. We use our estimates to simulate alternative climate change scenarios and show that accounting for adaptive responses is quantitatively important.

This report provides a unique and detailed description of the state of the Ivorian agricultural sector, including all agricultural value chains of the country. Agricultural, livestock and fishery productions are reviewed and their dynamics, opportunities and constraints are analysed. Finally, the report revises all agricultural policies and development programs implemented since the 1990s in CÃ´te dâ€™Ivoire as well as the future ones.
Q15|La culture attelÃ©e dans le bassin cotonnier en CÃ´te d'Ivoire. Analyse et modÃ©lisation des impacts d'un programme de relance de la culture attelÃ©e|"En CÃ´te d'Ivoire, le secteur cotonnier a particuliÃ¨rement souffert au cours des annÃ©es 2000, en raison de la crise militaro-politique ouverte en Septembre 2002, d'un contexte socio-Ã©conomique dÃ©gradÃ© et d'une importante chute du cours international du coton. De nombreux producteurs ont alors abandonnÃ© la culture du coton et la production nationale a Ã©tÃ© divisÃ©e par trois au plus fort de la crise. Cette situation a incitÃ© l'Union EuropÃ©enne, Ã travers sa DÃ©lÃ©gation en CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Ã soutenir la recapitalisation des producteurs via divers projets d'appui Ã la filiÃ¨re, notamment le ""Projet de Relance de la Culture AttelÃ©e"" (PRCA).

Q15|Adaptation to Climate Change via Adjustment in Land Leasing: Evidence from Dryland Wheat Farms in the U.S. Pacific Northwest|This paper investigates how dryland wheat farm operators adapt to climate through the use of land leasing in the U.S. Pacific Northwest region. Using a farm-level dataset from the U.S. Census of Agriculture, we build a statistical relationship between climate and leased acreage for dryland wheat farms. We find that a warmer and wetter climate reduces leased dryland wheat farmland, suggesting that land leasing is a potential strategy for adaptation to future climate. Using climate projections from 20 global climate models, we predict that, by 2050, leased acreage for dryland wheat farms on average will decline by 23% and 29% relative to 2012 levels under the medium and high greenhouse gas emission scenarios, respectively.
Q15|Real estate and land property automated valuations systems: a taxonomy and conceptual model|Purpose - Automated valuation models have been in use at least for the last fifty years in both academia and practice, while a proper definition was coined only in the last decade. Automated valuation models is a very mature topic that has recently reemerged as very important with the rise of digital infrastructure. Therefore, this paper provides needed analysis and synthesis of the accumulated body of knowledge, and proposes a conceptual framework adapted to reemerging trend.Design/methodology/approach - This imply two-sided contribution of this paper, a taxonomy and a conceptual framework. In order to address properly a broad notion of automated valuation models’ use, this paper introduces automated valuation system as a term and its taxonomy based on key facets, properties and measurements. Proposed taxonomy is non-hierarchical because all automated valuation systems have the same importance and each one has these facets. Furthermore, conceptual model represents the relationships between the facets. The conceptual model for automated valuation system is based on the visualized decision support system consisting of decision, end user, interface data and model. Both taxonomy and conceptual model came into being after literature review that included a bit more than one hundred references.Findings - The overview of facets, their properties and their dummy measurement is discussed only with examples that would be sufficient to illustrate their regularities. Examples are selected as the most cited articles for each of the newly introduced automated valuation approaches. As mentioned, all indicated facets are visualized in a conceptual model that is again an adapted version of the most visuals example of a decision support systems.Research limitations/implications – As mentioned, taxonomy and conceptual model are built upon although relatively broad but selective choice on more than one hundred references. Perhaps a systematic literature review process could additional validate the proposed taxonomy and conceptual model.Practical implications - Assuring the credibility of an automated valuation model that is based purely on comparing the predictive accuracy of method ‘a’ versus method ‘b’ has become a common practice. Therefore, discussion of the use of the proposed automated valuation has been push forward. In addition, as a domain of price estimates has been far surpassed any unique discipline, term that is more generic would be appropriate to accommodate future research coming from multitude of disciplines.Originality/value – By knowledge of the authors this is the first paper that develops taxonomy and conceptual model of automated valuation systems.
Q15|International Agricultural Mitigation Research and the Impacts and Value of Two SLMACC Research Projects|Evaluating the benefits of publicly funded research is always a challenging task. This paper cannot produce air-tight quantification of the benefits of Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change (SLMACC) research. We do, however, demonstrate the key building blocks of significant impact have been obtained. First, it is clear that public funding has contributed importantly to New Zealand’s positioning itself as one of the leading global contributors to agricultural mitigation research. Second, the prominence of the research combined with the low likelihood of research occurring on this scale without public support suggests strongly that the results would not have been obtained absent public funding. Finally, though the realization of ultimate environmental and/or economic benefits will depend on the evolution of farming practices and climate change policy settings, the advances in genetic markers for low CH4 animals and identification of emission-reducing management practices have the potential for GHG emission reductions that would be significant in environmental terms, and whose value at likely carbon pricing levels would be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Although the results discussed are conditional on several factors such as future policy implementation, adoption rates and the practical availability of mitigation options and practices for different farm landscapes; the impacts, economic and environmental values attached to mitigation research cannot be overlooked and provide important insights to the benefits that public investments can make to the development of a more sustainable agricultural system for the country.
Q15|Engineering Informal Institutions: Long-run Impacts of Alternative Dispute Resolution on Violence and Property Rights in Liberia|Informal institutions govern property rights and disputes when formal systems are weak. Well-functioning institutions should help people reach and maintain bargains, minimizing violence. Can outside organizations engineer improvements and reduce violent conflicts? Will this improve property rights and investment? We experimentally evaluate a UN and civil society mass education campaign to promote alternative dispute resolution (ADR) practices and norms in rural communities, where violent land disputes are common. Prior work showed a fall in violence and unresolved disputes within one year. We return after three years to test for sustained impacts and channels. Treated communities report large, sustained falls in violent disputes and a slight shift towards nonviolent norms. Treated residents also report larger farms, though overall effects on property rights and investments are mixed. Politically-connected residents report more secure property rights while those with fewer connections feel less secure. Sustained social engineering is feasible but politics shapes distributional outcomes.
Q15|Property Rights to Frontier Land and Minerals: US Exceptionalism|Property rights are the most fundamental institution in any society. They determine who has decision-making authority over assets and who bears the costs and benefits of those decisions. They assign ownership, wealth, political influence, and social standing. They make markets possible; define timelines; and provide incentives for investment, innovation, and trade. They mitigate the losses of open access and provide the basis for long-term economic growth. Economists and economic historians have long recognized the importance of secure property rights for economic outcomes. Other political economy, philosophy, historical, and legal literatures emphasize different, but critical attributes based on how property rights are allocated and to whom. The linkages among the social, political, and economic effects are examined here with respect to US and Latin American frontier land and minerals. Property rights were sharply different across the two frontiers with apparent long-term consequences for economic growth, innovation, wealth distribution, private investment in public goods, as well as social and political stability. The distinct assignment of property rights to land and minerals is likely a basis for long-term US exceptionalism in economic performance, individualism, mobility, and optimism. The mechanisms through which property rights to land in a frontier society affect outcomes in a contemporary, highly urban one are complex. Because property rights to land were broadly distributed, Americans could participate in capital markets using land as collateral. This ability shaped opinions regarding markets, capitalism, and individual opportunity. In the 21st century, these critical attributes may be eroding, inviting more analysis from economists and economic historians.
Q15|Douglass C. North: Transaction Costs, Property Rights, and Economic Outcomes|Douglass North asked why some societies historically and contemporarily have rising per-capita incomes and individual welfare, whereas others do not? He argued that successful economies had property rights that encouraged markets, trade, and investment in new production and organizational methods. In other economies, transaction costs, especially those due to the political process, blocked more efficient property rights. Property rights grant decision making over valuable resources and are the basis for investment, and market exchange. They mold the economy and the distribution of wealth and political power. Politicians and coalitions of privileged elites with stakes in the status quo join to preserve it. Inefficiencies create their own constituencies. There is no clear remedy for general citizens in North’s cases. Despite the power of North’s argument, transaction costs are not clear in aggregate studies of economies. They are more apparent in US common-pool resource problems with large, continuing losses in resource rents. This evidence runs counter to the facile arguments in the welfare and environmental economics literatures for addressing externalities that are reminiscent of the simplistic recommendations in the growth and economic history literatures that North challenged. If the observed costly political response to open access losses is characteristic of regulation in general, then welfare losses permeate developed economies as well and are more pervasive than the dramatic examples of development failure examined by North and others. Mitigation requires competitive interest groups that benefit from more secure property rights and greater resource rents to offset powerful elites that align with politicians and capture bureaucratic agencies to achieve particularistic benefits that undermine general welfare.
Q15|The Critical Role Of Markets In Climate Change Adaptation|Markets, especially land markets, can facilitate climate change adaptation through price signals. A review of research reveals that urban, coastal, and agricultural land markets provide effective signals of the emerging costs of climate change. These signals encourage adjustments by both private owners and policy officials in taking preemptive action to reduce costs. In agriculture, they promote consideration of new cropping and tillage practices, seed types, timing, and location of production. They also stimulate use of new irrigation technologies. In urban areas, they motivate new housing construction, elevation, and location away from harm. They channel more efficient use of water and its application to parks and other green areas to make urban settings more desirable with higher temperatures. Related water markets play a similar role in adjusting water use and reallocation. To be effective, however, markets must reflect multiple traders and prices must be free to adjust. Where these conditions are not met, market signals will be inhibited and market-driven adaptation will be reduced. Because public policy is driven by constituent demands, it may not be a remedy. The evidence of the National Flood Insurance Program and federal wildfire response illustrates how politically difficult it may be to adjust programs to be more adaptive.
Q15|Federal Lands, Opportunity Costs, and Bureaucratic Management|The federal government owns and administers 472, 892,659 acres or 21% of the land area of the lower US, making it both the country’s largest land owner and among the largest by a central government among western democracies. This condition is surprising, given that the US generally is viewed as more oriented toward private property rights and markets. The land largely is managed by the US Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management, staffed by unelected, career civil servants who hold tenure to their positions. Access and use regulations are administered by agency officials who have wide latitude under all-purpose legislation passed by Congress. Their actions are influenced by bureaucratic incentives and by lobby groups seeking to influence federal land policy. General citizens have little information about how policies are determined and only costly recourse to challenge them. Other than the comparatively small, 27,400,000 acres in National Parks, most of the land has no important amenity values nor apparent major externalities associated with use. These lands were to be transferred to private claimants under 19th century land laws. This paper examines how this vast area came to be withheld by the federal government and the role of the environmental movement in the process. Market failure and externalities were asserted justifications, but there is no strong supportive evidence. Although externalities were possible, the most obvious solution was to define property rights more completely. This option was and remains rejected by politicians, agency officials, and those lobby groups that sought permanent management and control over federal lands. Sustained-yield was an overarching objective, but it is a biological and not an economic concept and the human welfare outcomes of bureaucratic management may be large.
Q15|Accounting for Unobservable Heterogeneity in Cross Section Using Spatial First Differences|We develop a simple cross-sectional research design to identify causal effects that is robust to unobservable heterogeneity. When many observational units are dense in physical space, it may be sufficient to regress the “spatial first differences” (SFD) of the outcome on the treatment and omit all covariates. This approach is conceptually similar to first differencing approaches in time-series or panel models, except the index for time is replaced with an index for locations in space. The SFD design identifies plausibly causal effects, even when no instruments are available, so long as local changes in the treatment and unobservable confounders are not systematically correlated between immediately adjacent neighbors. We demonstrate the SFD approach by recovering new cross-sectional estimates for the effects of time-invariant geographic factors, soil and climate, on long-run average crop productivities across US counties — relationships that are notoriously confounded by unobservables but crucial for guiding economic decisions, such as land management and climate policy.
Q15|Land use and ecosystem services|This report assesses the crucial drivers of ecosystem services and proposes actions to develop a more effective policy mix. Several elements form the basis of this report. First, a literature review provides an overview of the state and trends of ecosystem services linked to agriculture, including issues related to land use. Secondly, results are presented from a quantitative model developed to illustrate the potential benefits of improving policy design as well as to investigate synergies and trade-offs among ecosystem services. This report also includes a review of experiences in an inventory of ecosystems in selected countries and policy initiatives that address ecosystem services linked to agriculture.
Q15|Land consolidation as technical change: impacts on-farm and off-farm in rural Vietnam|This paper studies whether land consolidation – reduction of land fragmentation – promotes or hinders the Vietnamese government’s policy objectives of encouraging agricultural mechanization and stimulation of the off-farm rural economy. It does this by viewing land consolidation as a form of technical change, making it possible to apply the insights developed in the economic literature on technical change. This treatment reveals that the impacts of land consolidation depend partly on its factor bias and partly on the degree to which labor is substitutable in production for other factors. At a theoretical level, if a technical change is factor neutral, it will reduce off-farm labor supply and slow rural structural transformation away from agriculture; if it is labor-augmenting and the elasticity of substitution between factors is low enough, the opposite effects are predicted. The paper studies these issues empirically for rice production in Vietnam, focusing on the impact that consolidation of rice land has on rice production, machinery use, and labor allocation. The findings confirm that land consolidation raises both farm productivity and farm income and stimulates increased machinery use. It also reduces farm labor supply, lowers labor intensity in farming, and thereby releases more farm labor to off-farm development, consistent with government policy objectives. Based on these findings, the paper concludes that land consolidation should be encouraged through development of land ownership rights and the promotion of land rental markets.
Q15| ¿Semillas mejoradas como escape de la pobreza? Evidencia cualitativa y cuantitativa para la sierra sur del Perú| El presente trabajo tiene como finalidad esclarecer y cuantificar los potenciales efectos de la adopción de tecnologías agrícolas ―semillas mejoradas― en la reducción de la pobreza rural, enfocándose en los hogares productores a pequeña escala en los Andes peruanos del sur. Para ello se emplea un método de análisis basado en el ‘propensity score matching’ para hallar las relaciones causales del tratamiento. Los resultados indican que existe una relación robusta y significativa entre la adopción de dichas tecnologías y el bienestar de los agricultores, aunque estos resultados dependen en gran medida del tamaño de la parcela y de la proporción regada de la misma. Asimismo, la evidencia cualitativa indica que la asistencia técnica y capacitación (semillas y tecnificación del riego) deben de ser implementadas tomando en cuenta las características idiosincráticas y culturales de los poblados andinos, además de hacerlos parte del planteamiento de la solución al problema de la baja productividad agrícola. El reto de mitigar la pobreza debe pasar por un acompañamiento no solo durante el proceso de producción agrícola, sino también en el proceso de articulación al mercado y organización empresarial de los productores.

Q15|Establishing the Link Between Poverty and Changes in Climatic Conditions in the Philippines|This paper investigates whether changes in climatic conditions significantly contribute to incidence of poverty in the Philippines. Due to the lack of sufficient regional estimates of poverty, this study utilized food cpi data to proxy for poverty level. The relationship between poverty level and food cpi were tested and found to be moving in parallel direction, and hence, could be substituted for each other for this study’s purposes. The relationship between poverty and food prices has also been verified in the literature, as higher food prices is the dominant variable that results in higher poverty levels. The results show that higher agricultural wages as well as extreme climate-influenced shocks such as El Niño and La Niña were significant determinants of poverty. Higher agricultural wage benefits agricultural workers, but the income effect may be small, and that overall, the net effect of is higher food prices that, in turn, exacerbates overall poverty. The negative impact of El Niño and La Niña on food prices (and therefore, poverty level) could be attributed to the consistent and appropriate government response to these weather shocks, which have stabilized supply of food. Government programs to stock up on rice during weather shocks, and the automatic assistance to farmers during calamities, have had the overall effect of neutralizing the potential poverty impacts of climate-related shocks. These are useful insights in carving out a climate-resilient economic development plan, and emphasize the importance of timely and appropriate government action and adaptation programs.

Q15|Управление И Оценка На Аграрната Устойчивост – Опит, Предизвикателства И Уроци От България И Китай<BR>[Governing and assessment of agrarian sustainability - experiences, challenges, and lessons from Bulgaria and China]|This paper applies interdisciplinary approach and assesses the system of governance and the level of agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria and China. The first part presents a holistic and practically applicable for the contemporary conditions of development of Bulgarian and Chinese agriculture framework for assessing the system of governance and the level of agrarian sustainability. The suggested approach is broadly experimented in Bulgaria for assessing the governance system of agrarian sustainability and the sustainability level of Bulgarian agriculture. In the second part the system of governance of agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria is analyzed and the efficiency of institutional environment and diverse market, private, collective, public and hybrid modes are evaluated. In the third part an assessment is made on the economic, social, environmental and integral sustainability of Bulgarian agriculture at national, sectoral, regional, ecosystem and farm levels. Factors for improving agrarian sustainability are also identified and the innovation activity and sustainability of alternative agriculture estimated. In the fourth part the governance and sustainability in Chinese agriculture at national, regional and local levels is analyzed, and results of a number of in-depth studies from Shanghai area are presented. Comparative study is also made on the systems of governance and the levels of agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria and China. Finally, the experiences and challenges in the governance and assessment of agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria and China are summarized and directions for improvement of research, management and assessment practices suggested.
Q15|Poverty, agrarian change and form of labour in neo-liberal India - a comparative analysis of tribal and upper caste|This paper elaborates nature of semi-proletarianization of the Schedule Tribe practised after the period of neo-liberal reforms in different dimensions. Further, an attempt has been in this paper to check how the change in occupational structure varies between the different social groups viz Schedule Caste, Schedule Tribe and Other due to agrarian distress and increasing pattern of dispossession in the era of economic reform and how it influenced the poverty situation among the different social groups. Now in doing so, it contradicts the view of decreasing gap of poverty between social groups concluded several present researchers. It has been found that although it is also evident that, using expenditure as the dimension of poverty, the poverty among ST have a declining trend, but the rate of decline is lower than the that of the upper caste thus the ratio of the poverty index between the social groups taking ST poverty index as numerator is increasing over the time since the neo-liberal policies have been introduced. This indicates a strong divergence which contradicts the view of decreasing gap of poverty between social groups concluded several present researchers. Further, using econometric analysis, it has been found that increasing semi-proletarianisation among STs relative to that of Others is one of the reasons increasing divergence between ST and Others.
Q15|Impact of governing modeson agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria|Specific system of governance in different countries, regions, subsectors, etc., eventually determines the speed and type of socio-economic development. Despite its big academic and practical importance, in Bulgaria and other countries in East Europe, there are very few empirical studies on dominating governing structures in agriculture, and their impact(s) on agrarian sustainability. In this paper the interdisciplinary New Institutional Economics framework is incorporated, and the impact of diverse market, private, collective, public and hybrid modes of governance on agrarian sustainability at the current stage of development in Bulgaria assessed. First, the methodological framework of the study is outlined. After that dominating governing modes in Bulgarian farms of different juridical type, size, specialization, ecological and geographical location are identified, and their impacts on agrarian sustainability and its economic, social, and environmental pillars evaluated. In conclusion implications for further research, public policy improvement, and private managerial strategy formation are presented. Agricultural producers of different use quite unlike mixture of effective market, private, collective and hybrid modes for governance of their activities and relations. Individual factors and modes most contributing to improvement of agrarian sustainability at the current stage of development are: manager’s personal convictions and initiatives, farms resources and innovation potential, near future profit and benefits strategies, market prices levels and dynamics, area-based EU subsidies, and informal agreements. Research on relations between the governing structure and agrarian sustainability is to continue though increasing representation, and the spectrum of specific governing modes used by farms of different type as well as assessments of the impact of institutions on agrarian sustainability and the impact of the governance at different hierarchical levels. The latter however, requires a new kind of micro and macro data, and a close cooperation between all interested parties.
Q15|Integration and Analysis of Resource Inventory Data for Risk Assessments of Environmental Contamination in Mixed Use Landscapes in Pakistan|This paper examines the various metals that are associated with land contamination for instances arsenic, cadmium, lead, chromium, nickel, and mercury that are well known as the ingredient of contamination of the ecology in the region where there is a high rate of anthropogenic burden. The study investigates land contamination in Pakistan's context. The researches have used the quantitative method to analyze the most recent literature available on the land contamination of Pakistan following funnel approach. The three main steps followed to analyze are first, assessment of the site initially, secondly, assessment of the exposure of the contaminated site that also contains a survey of few places and the amount of contamination found and lastly, remediation of the site. The finding revealed that the contamination in Pakistan is both men made as well due to the terrain they belong to that contains various anthropogenic elements, which are harmful to live beings. Additionally, it is evident that the different elements, which can cause soil contamination, are higher in many places in Pakistan than the standard or tolerable rate mentioned by WHO and other survey board. Lastly, the paper confirms that the pollution can be reduced only if there is a reduction in the man made cause of the land contamination such as oil spill and other industrial emissions that constitute most of Pakistan’s land contamination.
Q15|Efficiency of agrarian governance in Bulgaria|Empirical studies on efficiency of the governance system in agriculture are very rare. That is a consequence of both theoretical and practical challenges. The criteria and approach for assessing social efficiency are still debated while appropriate statistical, accountancy, etc. data for evaluation diverse mechanisms and modes of governance are not readily available. This is a first attempt for a comprehensive empirical study on the efficiency of the system of agrarian governance in Bulgaria. Since there is a social “contract” about sustainable agrarian development in EU and Bulgaria, the impact to sustainability is taken as a criterion for assessing the social efficiency of the governance system. The interdisciplinary New Institutional Economics framework is incorporated, and the impact of institutional environment and diverse market, private, collective, public and hybrid modes of governance on agrarian sustainability at the current stage of development in Bulgaria assessed. First, the methodological framework of the study is outlined. After that impact of major components of institutional environment of agrarian sustainability evaluated. Following, dominating governing modes in Bulgarian farms of different juridical type, size, specialisation, ecological and geographical location are identified, and their impacts on agrarian sustainability assessed. In conclusion implications for further research, public policy improvement, and private managerial strategy formation are presented.
Q15|Institutions and sustainability – insights from Bulgarian agriculture|The specific system of governance is a critical factor, which to a great extent (pre)determines the type and speed of development in different countries, industries, regions, communities, etc. This article tries to fill the gap and assesses the impact of institutional environment on agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria. The interdisciplinary New Institutional Economics framework is applied and assessment made on specific effects of major components of the “external” institutional environment on agrarian sustainability level in different administrative, geographical and ecological regions, subsectors of agriculture, and farms of various juridical type and size. Our study has found out that individual elements of external institutional, market and natural environment affect quite unequally farms of different types, individual subsectors of agriculture, and specific ecological and geographical regions. This type of studies is to be expended and their precision and representation increased. The latter however, requires a close cooperation between all interested parties, and participation of the farmers, agrarian organisations, local and central authorities, interest groups, research institutes and experts, etc.
Q15|China-Bulgaria Rural Revitalization Development Cooperation Forum|Proceedings of China-Bulgaria Rural Revitalization Development Cooperation Forum, hold on 23 April, 2018, in Sofia. Chapters give a deep insights on diverse issues associated with agrarian and rural development in Bulgaria and China.
Q15|Application of Optimized SFCL and STATCOM for the Transient Stability and LVRT Capability Enhancement of Wind Farms|In this paper, the combined superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL) and STATCOM are used to improve transient stability and low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) capability of wind turbine generation system (WTGS). The SFCL absorbs the accelerating energy of the generator, and therefore, improves the WTGS transient stability. Also, STATCOM helps the restore connecting point voltage to improve LVRT capability by reactive power compensation (RPC) after fault clearing. The optimization problem of SFCL resistance and STATCOM capacity is formulated based on the transient stability and LVRT capability of WTGS. The Simulation study shows the superior improving LVRT capability of combined SFCL and STATCOM over individual SFCL or STATCOM. Also, the requirement capacity of STATCOM for RPC is significantly reduced. PSCAD/EMTDC software(V4.2) is used for simulation.
Q15|Forestland and household welfares in North Central Provinces, Vietnam|This paper investigates the effects of forestland on household income, poverty and inequality among households in Vietnam’s poorest rural districts, the North Central Provinces, using data from the Quantitative Socio-Economic Survey for Emission Reduction-Program (ERP) Provinces Areas [QSESERPA]. Local people are extremely poor, with 54% living below the poverty line. Forest income constitutes about 17% of their total income; only wage income (37%) ranks higher. Surprisingly, those better off depend on forest income more than the poor do. Such income is comprised mainly of non-timber forest plants (77%), followed by timber products (18%). Our micro-econometric analysis indicates that gaining access to more forestland would increase household per capita income and reduce the incidence and intensity of poverty, even after controlling for all other variables in the model. In addition, we find that forest income was the second largest contributor to overall income inequality and had the largest marginal effect on it. A policy implication here is that increasing the access of the poor to forest resources and improving their efficiency in forest management could have a substantial effect on income, poverty and inequality in the study area.
Q15|Постижения И Предизвикателства На Устойчивото Аграрно Развитие В България И Китай<BR>[Achievements and challenges of sustainable agrarian development in Bulgaria and China]|This paper summarizes the main achievements and most important challenges of agrarian sustainable development in Bulgaria and China at current stage. The study has found out that, in the last several decades in Bulgaria and China took place unprecedented modernization of institutional structure in agriculture as legislation and regulation framework has been innovated along with the extent and modes of public intervention/and support to the sector, the importance and diversity of provide and collective structure of production, marketing, food security, eco-management, etc. Simultaneously in Bulgaria and China and in the individual regions of each country exists a considerable specificity of socio-economic conditions, natural resources, institutional structure, cultural and historical development, efficiency of public governance and multiple challenges. The contemporary agrarian development in both countries is characterized with a number of similar socio-economic and ecological challenges most important of which are: low comparative productivity and competitiveness of a great portion of agricultural production; unequal public support to different type of farms, subsectors of production and regions of the country; increasing discrepancies in income and living standards of population in different regions, sectors of economy and type of economic organizations; insufficient involvement of all interested parties at all levels of decision making, control, sustainability assessment, etc.; aging of population in rural areas and lack if young and qualified labors in farms; existence of large informal sector with uncontrolled products for quality, safety, intellectual property, ecology, etc. and with dominating informal (including illegal) structures; significant adverse impact of agrarian development on agricultural lands, waters, air, biodiversity, etc.; serious risks for food security in the future in accordance with the trends in production and consumption, etc. Having in mind the importance of such comparative studies they have to continue and deepen with the employment of micro economic and other data, in-depth and case studies, etc.
Q15|Drivers of Farmers' Income: The Role of Farm Size and Diversification|The study finds that a U-shaped relationship exists between farm size and farm / farmer's income. The results also show that both on-farm and off-farm diversification have an inverted U-shape relationship with farm / farmer's income. That is, diversification up to some level helps improve income but excessive diversification might lead to misallocation of resources and hence a fall in income. The results also show that engagement in public works programme such as MGNREGA has an adverse impact on farm / farmer's income, possibly due to the opportunity cost of time spent in such programmes. Finally, positive effect of education on income is seen only at somewhat high education levels.
Q15|The Expansion of Modern Agriculture and Global Biodiversity Decline: An Integrated Assessment|The world is banking on a major increase in food production, if the dietary needs and food preferences of an increasing, and increasingly rich, population are to be met. This requires the further expansion of modern agriculture, but modern agriculture rests on a small number of highly productive crops and its expansion has led to a significant loss of global biodiversity. Ecologists have shown that biodiversity loss results in lower plant productivity, while agricultural economists have linked biodiversity loss on farms with increasing variability of crop yields, and sometimes lower mean yields. In this paper we consider the macro-economic consequences of the continued expansion of particular forms of intensive, modern agriculture, with a focus on how the loss of biodiversity affects food production. We employ a quantitative, structurally estimated model of the global economy, which jointly determines economic growth, population and food demand, agricultural innovations and land conversion. We show that even small effects of agricultural expansion on productivity via biodiversity loss might be sufficient to warrant a moratorium on further land conversion.
Q15|Stabilize the peasant economy: Governance of foreclosure by the shogunate|Regulation of foreclosure in a financial crisis has been a centuries-long conundrum to authorities. Japan in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries had free financial, land and coercive labor markets. It raised the growth but resulted in recurrent financial crises. Therefore, the Edo shogunate, 1600–1868, banned coercive labor, protected peasants’ property right and regulated the farmland-collateral loans. Seeking an appropriate degree of regulation, the shogunate first banned foreclosure and invited a credit shrink. Then the shogunate introduced legislation to legalize foreclosure of pledged farmland as clarifying the rights of borrowers. The regulation asymmetrically lowered interest rates for timely repayment.
Q15|Forced off Farm? Labor Allocation Response to Land Requisition in Rural China|Land requisition has been an important process by which Chinese local governments promote urbanization and generate revenue. This study investigates the impacts of land requisition on farmers' decisions of labor allocation between agricultural and non-agricultural sectors. We argue that, conditional on village fixed effects, land requisition can be explored as a quasi-natural experiment to identify the relationship between land rights and labor allocation of farmers. We find that young farmers (age 16-44) are not affected in their migration decisions by land loss through requisition, while some older farmers (age 45-55) are affected. In response to land loss through requisition, the probability that older farmers living beyond the mean distance from the county seat migrates to cities increases by 8.5 percentage points. An econometric test confirms that the finding is unlikely to be driven by unobserved variables associated with household experience of land loss. This finding raises concerns about the wellbeing of the farmers who may not be competitive in the urban labor market and therefore unlikely to leave farming unless they have to.
Q15|Institutional arrangements governing wetland utilization and conservation in communal areas of Zimbabwe|Wetland degradation and loss has persisted in developing countries due to existence of poor institutional frameworks supporting wetland governance. Therefore, wetland ecosystem services that support the livelihoods of most subsistence populations in rural areas are concomitantly lost. This paper explores the nature and consequences of institutional arrangements governing wetland access, utilization and conservation in six communal wetlands in Zimbabwe. Data were collected through a household survey targeting one hundred and twenty-three household heads, sixty teenagers and key informant interviews. The results of the study indicate a complex, multi-institutional involvement and the roles and relationship of participating institutions often compromise wetland resources conservation as a result of conflicts, confusion and tensions exacerbated by divergent motives. There is no homogeny in the number of institutions determining utilization at each wetland nor their degree of influence on management decisions;a situation reflecting inconsistency in existing institutional structure at communal level. Given the proximity of traditional leaders and wetland committees to the people and wetlands and the poor participation of government agencies, an institutional structure which places local institutions at the core of the governance system should be formulated. This shouldbe complemented by a clear framework which promotes co-ordination of institutional roles and clarification of their relationships in order to minimize discord in execution of their duties; a situation that currently contributes todegradation of wetland ecosystems. The necessary policy and legal framework to support such institutional framework should be put in place and resources for its operations made available. Classification JEL: Q01, Q15, Q24, Q25, Q28
Q15|Land tenure policy and women’s off-farm employment in rural China|Using the data from three waves (1995, 2002 and 2008) of the Chinese Household Income Project (CHIP), which covers nine provinces in China, this paper investigates the impact of land tenure security on farmers’ labor market outcomes in rural China, especially for women’ s labor market behavior. To identify the effect of land tenure security, this paper used difference-in-differences strategy to control for time invariant heterogeneity, and a number of observed time-varying economic characteristics for its validity. The paper finds that in response to more security land rights, both women and men increase their probability of wage employment participation and individual income.
Q15|Evaluation Index System (Eis) For The Ecological- Economic- Social Performances Of Ousteri Wetland Across Puducherry And Tamil Nadu|Wetlands play a key role in the ecological conservation, in environmental quality improvement, and in human habitat environment improvement. Primer field investigations, primary survey and series of stakeholder meetings were utilised to evaluate the performance of the wetland. It was done using the complex index system covering wider aspect to correlate the comparative status of both Tamil Nadu and Puducherry zone of the Ousteri wetland. Compared with the researches applying the ecosystem service evaluation method, the proposed scoring method in this study can evaluate on some important performance indices (aquatic vegetation coverage, plant community integrity, integrity of management operating system, stakeholders feedback on the wetland protection, public satisfaction) that cannot be ignored and unable to be transformed to a monetary form. The Delphi method was used to screen preset 35 subindicators prior to evaluation. By using Delphi and Analytic Hierarchy Process method, as well as the weighted linear combination model, the ecological-economic-social performances were obtained. This indices system was applied to the case of Ousteri wetland with respect to Puducherry and Tamil Nadu scenario separately. With the help of the Evaluation Index system (EIS) established in this study, decision makers can obtain more omni-visual information so that an ecological subsidy policy by incorporating rewards and punishments mechanisms according to the performance evaluations can be formulated to enable the greatest returns on investment in the wetland conservative measure.
Q15|Examining the Land Use Change of the Ousteri Wetland using the Land Use Dynamic Degree Model|Land use/cover change is a major factor for global change because of its interactions with climate, cosystem processes, biodiversity, and, even more important, human activities, research on land use/cover change has become an important aspect of global change. The present research paper aims to investigate the land use changes over the time period, 2005 to 2014, in the Ousteri wetland. The information collected through the ecological, hydrological and geological analysis was used to carry out the quantitative research on Ousteri wetland land use/cover change. The temporal changes of land use characteristics were quantitatively analyzed and then the driving forces of land use changes were examined based on natural and artificial factors. As the result of natural factors and human disturbances, the area of wetland shrunk, bringing the conversion from wetland to terrestrial land use type. The annual conversion rates indicated the land use changes in Ousteri wetland.
Q15|Large Scale Land Investments: Impact on Child Health|This paper investigates the impacts of large scale land investments on the health of children. I use household data of the 2005 and 2011 Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) for Ethiopia and combine them with information of large scale land investment projects provided by the Land Matrix Observatory. This data provides information about the location of the land investments and about the location of children. With this information I develop an index that indicates the level of investment intensity for each child’s residential area. Taking advantage of the repeated cross sectional structure of the DHS data, I estimate the e ect of an increase in the investment intensity of a child’s residential area and how this e ect changes over time. The results indicate that the e ect is negative for children born between 2000-2005, but it rises over time by getting less negative or even positive for children born between 2006-2011. The di erence-in-di erences estimation with Gaussian kernel propensity score matching shows a benefit in the development status of children that are exposed to large scale land investments. This paper investigates the impacts of the recent wave of large scale land investments on the health of Ethiopian children that are exposed to such investments. I use household data of the 2005 and 2011 Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) for Ethiopia and combine them with information of large scale land investment projects provided by the Land Matrix Observatory. This data allows to identify the location of the land investments as well as the location of children born between 2000-2011. I use these information to construct an index that indicates the level of investment intensity for each child’s residential area. Taking advantage of the repeated cross sectional structure of the DHS data, I estimate the e ect of an increase in the investment intensity of a child’s residential area and how this e ect changes over time. The results indicate that the e ect is negative for children born between 2000-2005, but it rises over time by getting less negative or even positive for children born between 2006-2011. The di erence-in-di erences estimation with Gaussian kernel propensity score matching shows a benefit in the development status of children that are exposed to large scale land investments.
Q15|Großflächige Agrarinvestitionen in Entwicklungsländern: Ausmaß, Akteure und Land Governance|Nach Jahrzehnten in denen der Agrarsektor für Investoren kaum von Interesse war, ist seit 2007/08 ein erheblicher Anstieg in der weltweiten Nachfrage nach Agrarland zu beobachten. Der Mangel an sicheren und gewinnbringenden Anlageformen in Zeiten der Finanzkrise sowie der steigende Bedarf an Nahrungsmitteln und Biotreibstoff hat diesen Anstieg ausgelöst. In dieser Arbeit geben wir einen Überblick über die rasant wachsende Literatur, welche sich mit dem Thema großflächiger Landakquisitionen beschäftigt. Wir tragen dazu die verschiedenen Erkenntnisse bezüglich des Umfangs und der Akteure der Akquisitionen zusammen. Dabei legen wir einen verstärkten Fokus auf die Darstellung der Angaben der Land Matrix. Es zeigt sich, dass es sich bei den Investoren nicht, wie in den Medien zumeist dargestellt, allein um staatliche Akteure aus China und den Golfstaaten handelt. Vielmehr handelt es sich häufig um private Investoren, die ihren Sitz Europa oder in den USA haben. Des Weiteren zeigen wir die möglichen Folgen der Landakquisitionen für die Zielländer auf und diskutieren diese im Hinblick auf die politischen Implikationen.
Q15|Economic incentives and conservation: Crowding-in social norms in a groundwater commons|Price-based interventions can be corrective where users extract from a common resource, but may also impact existing social norms, often crowding them out. In contrast, I find a pumping fee implemented by a group of irrigators in Southern Colorado effectively crowds-in pro-conservation norms, enhancing the financial incentive's impact. Using a unique, spatially oriented panel-data set of groundwater wells, I separate the direct role of increased pumping costs from the indirect effect transmitted through altered conservation norms. To quantify conservation behavior, I estimate how pumping at one well responds to pumping at nearby wells – using instrumental variables to address simultaneity bias – and interact that behavior with a difference-in-difference framework to assess the influence of the intervention. In the preferred specification, the fee directly accounts for approximately 74% of the reduced pumping and the remaining 26% comes from crowding-in conservation norms.
Q15|From decentralized to centralized irrigation management|Centralized organizations can internalize transaction costs and externalities, addressing possible inefficiencies of decentralized management. In practice, however, centralized organizations can have its own inefficiencies and decentralized management can do relatively well. Empirically testing relative efficiency is difficult because distinct organizations emerge endogenously in various contexts. This paper, in contrast, draws upon the unique history of New Mexico, leveraging a natural experiment to assess how the partial transition in the early 20th century from the original small decentralized communal Spanish irrigation systems (acequias) to centralized quasi-public irrigation districts altered agricultural development and production. Surface water irrigators in arid regions confront public good issues for building and maintaining shared infrastructure as well as common-pool resource issues to appropriate the surface water. My results confirm that irrigation districts can significantly improve outcomes when investing in costly infrastructure to expand irrigated acreage, increasing farmland values up to 33%. However, I find no broader evidence that the centralized control of water distribution provides any gains to acreage previously under irrigation by the decentralized acequias.
Q15|Climatic variation as a determinant of rural-to-rural migration destination choice:Evidence from Tanzania|This paper attempts to establish if climate acts as the determinant of destination choice in case of rural-to-rural migration. In the context of climate change where the link between climate and rural income has been well established, it is argued that migrants who move within rural areas choose destinations with more favourable climate conditions allowing for higher incomes. Employing the alternative-specific conditional logit model, this paper shows that such indirect effect of climate on migration destination choice is non-negligible, since one per cent increase in the expected income differentials between origin and destination, attributable to climate, increases the probability of choosing a given destination by at least nine percentage points. On the other hand, distance acts as a constraint for migration, in particular for the poorest individuals who might be inhibited from reaping full benefits of mobility
Q15|Modelling the potential impact of New Zealand’s freshwater reforms on land-based Greenhouse Gas emissions|The National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management (NPS-FM) establishes the need to set and manage water resources within limits. This report is the first national assessment of the indirect impacts of the NPS-FM on New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). The water quality improvement aspect of New Zealand’s freshwater reforms are expected to drive significant changes in land and water management across the country. Emissions benefits through the freshwater reforms could potentially result in significant savings for New Zealand by starting the transition to low emissions in the agricultural sector and helping to achieve New Zealand’s overall climate goals. For farmers, changes in land use and management to meet water quality targets will reduce their potential future exposure to needs to reduce GHG emissions. GHG emissions reductions are a combination of reduced emissions through changes in management and de-stocking and increased carbon sequestration associated with planting riparian buffers or afforesting part of the farm. Key results are that without land use change, agricultural GHGs (primarily methane and nitrous oxide) could be reduced by 2.4% or 0.82 million metric tonnes of carbon-dioxide equivalent per annum (MtCO2e/yr) along with an additional 0.11 MtCO2e of forest carbon sequestration as a result of planting riparian buffers and pole planting for erosion control (for a net reduction of 0.92 MtCO2e/yr or 13%). If afforestation is perceived to be a feasible freshwater mitigation option, up to 800 000 ha of additional trees could be planted, thereby increasing carbon sequestration by 5.4 MtCO2-e/yr. In this case gross (net) GHGs could be reduced by 2.9 (8.2) MtCO2e/yr, primarily through reduction in stock numbers and increases in forest carbon sequestration. This option could reduce net emissions by nearly 80%. The majority of the emissions impact occurs in the sheep and beef sector, with a gross (net) reduction of 0.61 (0.72) MtCO2e/yr. Nitrogen targets most strongly drive on-farm GHG reductions for all the modelled scenarios that limit mitigation to on-farm changes. This is primarily because actions to mitigate N are most closely related to practices that can also mitigate GHGs (e.g. stock management).
Q15|How Transaction Costs Obstruct Collective Action: Evidence from California’s Groundwater|Collective action to remedy the losses of open access to common-pool resources often is late and incomplete, extending rent dissipation. Examples include persistent over-exploitation of oil fields and ocean fisheries, despite general agreement that production constraints are needed. Transaction costs encountered in assigning property rights are an explanation, but analysis of their role is limited by a lack of systematic data. We examine governance institutions in California’s 445 groundwater basins using a new dataset to identify factors that influence the adoption of extraction controls. In 309 basins, institutions allow unconstrained pumping, while an additional 105 basins have weak management plans. Twenty of these basins are severely overdrafted. Meanwhile, users in 31 basins have defined groundwater property rights, the most complete solution. We document the critical role of transaction costs in explaining this variation in responses. This research adds to the literatures on open access, transaction costs, bargaining, and property rights
Q15|Estimating the Impact of Crop Diversity on Agricultural Productivity in South Africa|Crop biodiversity has the potential to enhance resistance to strains due to biotic and abiotic factors and to improve crop production and farm revenues. To investigate the effect of crop biodiversity on crop productivity, we build a probabilistic model based on ecological mechanisms to describe crop survival and productivity according to diversity. From this analytic model, we derive reduced forms that are empirically estimated using detailed field data of South African agriculture combined with satellite derived data. Our results confirm that diversity has a positive and significant impact on crop survival odds. We show the consistency of these results with the underlying ecologic and agricultural mechanisms.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Q15|Property Rights, Land Misallocation and Agricultural Efficiency in China|This paper examines the impact of a property rights reform in rural China that allowed farmers to lease out their land. We find the reform led to increases in land rental activity in rural households. Consistent with a model of transaction costs in land markets, our results indicate that the formalization of leasing rights resulted in a redistribution of land toward more productive farmers. Consequently, the aggregate productivity of land increased significantly. We also find that the reform increased the responsiveness of land allocation across crops to changes in crop prices.
Q15|Evaluation of the relevance of border protection for agriculture in Switzerland|Switzerland’s overarching agricultural policy objectives reflect societal concerns about various production aspects of agriculture, such as environmental sustainability and animal welfare, and the expectation that agriculture will provide public goods demanded by society. Among the various policy instruments used by Switzerland to achieve these objectives, border protection represents a significant component of support. This study assesses the relevance of border protection for agriculture in Switzerland. It finds that border protection is not relevant for achieving the overarching objectives of Swiss agricultural policy, with one exception. By stimulating domestic production, high levels of border protection ensure that Switzerland meets its target rate of gross food production. But border protection is unlikely to deliver the other outcomes and public goods desired by Swiss society. This is because support provided through border protection is not conditional on delivery of the outcomes and public goods demanded by Swiss society, and is untargeted towards the activities, inputs and regions most strongly related to those outcomes and public goods. Moreover, border protection imposes significant costs on the Swiss economy. The study concludes by proposing alternative policies in place of border protection.
Q15|The Potential Benefits of Transboundary Co-operation in Georgia and Azerbaijan: Kura River Basin|This study was one of the first attempts to evaluate and quantify the benefits of transboundary co-operation between Georgia and Azerbaijan. A specific framework for inventorying these benefits, taking into account all the different dimensions of transboundary water management, was built and applied to the major transboundary water bodies. Though a thorough assessment of the costs and benefits of transboundary co-operation in the two selected cases was not possible due to the lack of some quantitative and economic data, the assessment results highlighted the importance of promoting the integration of economic thinking in transboundary water management. The present and future prospects for transboundary co-operation on water management are still very positive: the two countries are working on a Transboundary Agreement, which will provide the necessary regulatory framework for co-operation and, most importantly, will set up a Joint Commission on Sustainable Use and Protection of the Kura River Basin. The outcomes of this study allowed for the identification of priorities for future work on transboundary co-operation between Georgia and Azerbaijan, and namely, support to developing guidelines on mechanisms to update databases, but also on new tools and systems.
Q15|Managing multi-purpose water infrastructure: A review of international experience|In this paper, the term multi-purpose water infrastructure (MPWI) encompasses all man-made water systems, including dams, dykes, reservoirs and associated irrigation canals and water supply networks, which may be used for more than one purpose (for economic, social and environmental activities). While MPWI plays a significant role in the socio-economic development and ensuring water, food and energy security of many countries (not least in water-stressed Central Asia), many MPWI projects face various challenges. These including unsustainability of business models for financing, operation and maintenance, lower-than-expected performance or the emergence of unforeseen risks and negative externalities. This paper explores the complexity in designing, financing, regulating and managing MPWI projects, with the objective to inform policy and decision-making. It attempts to identify key issues related to managing MPWI, lessons learned from international experience and possible solutions to the challenges. It examines several principles, approaches and instruments to enhance the sustainability of MPWI, drawing on international experience. Finally, the paper identifies knowledge and experience gaps, needs for further research and possible areas of future work.
Q15|The Diversity Of Socioeconomic Development Of Rural AreasIn The Western Borderland And The Problem Of Post-State Farm Localities|One of the major dilemmas of regional policy is the answer to the question whether the growth should be concentrated at the core or if there is growth and development potential in each territory (Barca, McCann, Rodriguez-Pose 2012, p. 149). The arguments which refer to the place-based policy stress the fact that making use of the unused potential of intermediate and poorly developed territories may actually influence the local and national level of development (Farole et al., 2011). Rural areas, especially peripheral areas, are undoubtedly the territories of unused potential. The aim of the research is to measure the socioeconomic development, including the spatial diversification leading to the development of rural peripheral areas. Development is a multidimensional phenomenon. Therefore, its level will be determined by means of the synthetic feature. The synthetic feature will be used as the starting point for identification of peripheral areas and their delimitation. The results of the analysis showed significant differences level of socioeconomic development of rural areas in the western borderland. The research findings did not show a simple dependence between rural development and the share of former state-owned farms in the communes. Areas with a high share of former state-owned farms could be found both in the group of best and least-developed communes. Due to the range of research it is illegitimate to make other than intuitive inferences. Thus, we can intuitively indicate that the following group of factors triggered the process of development and helped to break the barriers resulting from the liquidation of state-owned farms: location in an urban agglomeration, natural and tourist values as well as the activity of local authorities. The research should be continued in order to identify the factors and pathways of development in individual areas under analysis.
Q15|Leasing of Agricultural Land Versus Agency Theory in the Light of Study Results|Agency theory examines relations between entities as contract relations. The agency relation is always present when the situation of one person depends on the activities of another person. The individual who performs such activities is the agent, and the other party dependant on the activities of the agent is called the principal. The agency relation occurring between the above-listed parties is one of the oldest and most extensively codified modes of social interactions. Relationship studies: andlord - tenant, belong to the earliest and classic examples of agency relationships, analyzed by economists.the determination of the significance of the lease in Polish agriculture with the use of agency theory. The theoretical basis is primarily provided by a review of the literature encompassing publications devoted to agency theory, legislative acts pertaining to leases, as well as domestic and foreign scientific studies. Statistical data deriving from the Agricultural Property Agency. The time range of the analysis encompassed the years 1992–2015. The empirical section was prepared on the basis of results of our own studies.According to the analysis of the results of the author’s own studies, the most important advantage of leasing for the lessees is the possibility of expanding the farm (76.1%). Very similar importance was also assigned to the possibility of the pre-emptive right (70.1%). Most frequently (42.4%) this answer was indicated by the respondents who held over 75% under lease in total used land. This may be justified by the fact that farms with a high share of lease function in the environment of a relatively higher level of risk than farms with the majority of ownership, whereas purchase of leased land contributes to its minimisation.
Q15|Governance, economic, social and environmental sustainability of farms of different luridical type in Bulgaria|The issue of assessment of absolute and comparative sustainability of major farming structures is among the most topical for researchers, farmers, investors, administrators, politicians, interests groups and public at large. Despite that practically there are no assessments on sustainability level of Bulgarian farms of different juridical type in conditions of European Union Common Agricultural Policy implementation. This article applies a holistic framework and assesses absolute and comparative sustainability of Bulgarian farming enterprises of different juridical type. Initially the method of the study is outlined, and overall characteristics of surveyed holdings presented. After that an assessment is made of integral, governance, economic, social, environmental sustainability of farming structures of different juridical type. Next, structure of farms with different sustainability levels is analyzed. Finally, conclusion from the study and directions for further research and amelioration of sustainability assessments suggested.
Q15|Renewable energy, arable land, agriculture, CO2 emissions, and economic growth in Morocco|The autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds approach to cointegration and Granger causality tests are used to investigate the dynamic short and long-run causality relationships between per capita renewable energy (RE) consumption, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, real gross domestic product (GDP), agricultural value added (AVA), and arable land use (LUSE) for the case of Morocco during the period 1980-2013. Two models are used: the first with the AVA variable, and the second with the LUSE variable. The Wald test confirms the existence of a long-run relationship between variables for each considered model. Our long-run estimates indicate that an increase in economic growth, agricultural production, and arable land use contribute to increase the use of renewable energy, while a decrease in CO2 emissions increases renewable energy consumption. Granger causality tests reveal the existence of a short-run unidirectional causality running from AVA and from LUSE to RE consumption; a long-run unidirectional causality running from LUSE to RE, and a long-run bidirectional causality between AVA and RE. We recommend that Morocco should continue to encourage renewable energy use because this latter is not in competition with agricultural production for land use, but rather it is a complementary activity.
Q15|Assessment Of Sustainability Of Bulgarian Farms|The New Institutional and Transaction Costs Economics framework is incorporated to transitional Bulgarian agriculture, and level of sustainability of dominating subsistent farming, production cooperatives, small-scare commercial farms, and large agro-firms assessed. New framework for assessing sustainability of farms and for governing of sustainable development is suggested taking into account: role of specific institutional environment, comparative efficiency of various market, private, public and hybrid governing modes, transaction costs and critical factors (frequency, uncertainty, asset specificity, and appropriability) of farm transactions. Analysis of sustainability of different types of Bulgarian farms is made, and further domination of subsistence farming, cooperatives, large agro-firms, and some part of small commercial farms projected.
Q15|Investigating the interdependence between non-hydroelectric renewable energy, agricultural value added, and arable land use in Argentina|We examine the dynamic relationships between per capita carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, real gross domestic product (GDP), non-hydroelectric renewable energy (NHRE) consumption, agricultural value added (AVA), and agricultural land (AGRL) use for the case of Argentina over the period 1980-2013 by employing the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds approach to cointegration and Granger causality tests. The Wald test confirms the existence of a long-run cointegration between variables. There are long-run bidirectional causalities between all considered variables. The short-run Granger causality suggests bidirectional causality between AVA and agricultural land use; unidirectional causalities running from AGRL to NHRE and from NHRE to AVA. Long-run elasticity estimates suggest that increasing AVA increases GDP and reduces both pollution and NHRE; increasing NHRE reduces AVA and AGRL. Thus it seems that agriculture and renewable energy are substitute activities and compete for land use. We recommend that Argentina should continue to encourage agricultural production. The substitutability between agricultural and non-hydroelectric renewable energy productions, and their competition for agricultural land use, should be at least reduced or even stopped by encouraging R&D in second-generation (or even in third-generation) biofuels production and in new renewable energy technologies more efficient in land use.
Q15|Framework for analyzing and assessing the system of governance and the level of agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria and China|This framework is a part of a bilateral research cooperation project between Bulgaria and China on „Governing and Assessment of Agrarian Sustainability - Experiences, Challenges, and Lessons from Bulgaria and China“ funded by the Bulgarian Science Fund and the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China (http://bg-china.alle.bg/). First, major definitions are presented. After that a Framework for analyzing the system of governance of agrarian sustainability is outlined. Finally, a Framework for assessing sustainability levels of agriculture is presented. Theoretical and mythological approaches are previously presented by another publication (Bachev, Ivanov, Toteva, Sokolova). This framework is being used for analyzing the system of governance and the level of agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria and China, and comparative analysis between two countries
Q15|Fiscal Instruments for Sustainable Development: The Case of Land Taxes|Economists argue that land rent taxation is an ideal form of taxation as it causes no deadweight losses and has therefore no adverse effects on growth. Nevertheless, pure land rent taxation is rarely applied and, if so, revenues collected remain rather small. Property taxes share some of the characteristics of land taxes and generate small revenues, inter alia also in developing countries. This report revisits the case of land taxation for developing countries that are often characterized by large informal sectors, low public spending and poor tax or land administration institutions. We first provide a comprehensive overview of direct and indirect welfare and development effects of land rent taxation, ranging from increased efficiency in the fiscal system and in financing infrastructure, over environmental effects due to changes in land use to distributional effects. Barriers and constraints of implementing land taxes are also discussed, particularly the existence of a land registry, the role of administrative costs, compliance, evasion and political economy aspects. We extend this review with an in-depth analysis of current land tax systems and reform options in six case study countries. For four countries, we provide an additional quantitative analysis based on micro-simulations with household data that allow us to quantify revenues and distributional effects of various land tax regimes. Our main finding is that land taxes provide a large and untapped potential for financing governments. Formalizing and securing land tenure by establishing a land registry is a pre-condition that further provides substantial co-benefits for various sustainable development objectives. Widespread concerns regarding the feasibility and costs of implementing land taxes are rarely valid, as land taxes are in these aspects comparable to other taxes. Political will and investment in the quality of administration are, however, decisive. Considering some key principles in designing the land tax can help reduce administrative costs, avoid adverse distributional effects and increase compliance.
Q15|An Investigation of Factors for Changing Land Use Pattern in Bihar with a Piercing Insight on Current Fallow Lands|In the present study, an effort has been made to analyze the factors responsible for changes in land use pattern especially increasing current fallow lands, shrinking net sown area and shifting of lands for non-agricultural purposes in the state. The categories of land such as barren land, culturable waste land and permanent pastures and grazing land have shown declining trend. Further, declining trend in net sown area and other fallow lands has been noticed. Current fallows reduced over the period till 2000s but it began to rise since 2000s afterwards. The rainfall and road length did have significant impact on the level of current fallows. Erratic monsoon and scarcity of labour during the study period of present century resulted/led to accumulation of current fallow lands. It was further observed that the non-agricultural use of land was identified as the dominant factor for changes in common lands as it affected the current fallows negatively. It is a challenging task for policy makers to maximize the income of farming community from continuous decline in net sown area, deteriorating climatic condition (erratic monsoon) as well as labour scarce conditions thus finally resulting in aggregation of current fallows. In order to discourage/ arrest the rising tendency in current fallows or put the current fallows under profitable cultivation, cheap source of irrigation is needed to be made available to cultivators.
Q15|Growth Performance and Resource Use Efficiency of Maize in Bihar: An Economic Perspectives|The present investigation was undertaken to evaluate the growth in area, production and productivity and resource use efficiency of maize in various agro-climatic zones of Bihar. The growth pattern in production and productivity were also observed to be positive and statistically significant. The trends in area, production and productivity were also observed positive for both the growth models, linear and compound.The resource use efficiency was evaluated zone-wise and for state as whole levels using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) technique for the block period 2008-09 to 2010-11. Technical efficiencies at state level in maize production were found to be 64% for kharif maize and 71% in rabi maize. Allocative mean efficiencies for kharif and rabi maize were calculated 68% and 65%, indicating that farmers could reduce costs by 32% and 35% by using optimum proportions of inputs considering it’s prices while selecting it’s quantities. Farmers of zone-II of Bihar are well known for large scale production of rabi maize, but still there exist technical inefficiency by 24% and AE by 9%. The value of cost efficiency (CE) emphasizes the reduction of cost by 30% to produce exiting level of output at least cost. The farmers of zone-III are more technically sound as compared to zone-I, zone-II and thus, even at state level too, the TE was observed 88% and 87% for kharif and rabi maize, respectively but AE is very less as compared to other zones i.e. 52% for rabi maize
Q15|Shrinking Net Sown Area and Changing Land Use Pattern in Bihar: An Economic Analysis|Land is vital natural resource for any developmental activity. The judicious use of land is an earnest demand of time as the increasing demand for food and shelter is rapidly increasing with the burgeoning population. Bihar shares about 8.63% of the total population in the country while the share in total land area of India is only 2.86%. There are about 1.61 crore farm holdings of which 91% is marginal still about 68 percent of population earns their livelihood from agriculture and allied sector. Agriculture holds a vital role in food and nutrition security of the state in addition to overall development. Land is an important input for the agriculture sector.Hence, any change or changes in land use pattern has significant implication in food security for the state in particular and nation in general. This paper is based on secondary data published by Government of Bihar. An attempt has been made to investigate agro-climatic zone wise land use of the state and state as a whole. The study reveals that the net sown area has declined both on zonal level and also at state level. Decline in net sown area in agro-climatic zone-III is more pronounced than that of zone-I & zone-II. Being centre of the state, urbanization has taken place in faster way in the zone-III. The other reasons for changes undergoing in land use pattern may be increasing population, fragmentation of land holdings and declining water table in this region. Zone-I & zone-II come under flood prone area, farmers put their land as current fallow due to devastating flood threat causing damage to their crops. Land under trees and groves have also witnessed positive percentage change over the decade and also in growth rate, this may be the other reason for decline in net sown area in the state. Shrinking of net sown area is of great concern to feed the up warding growth of population. Motivating farmers to increase productivity to protect growing population and serving their demand for food and nutritional security, we have to make such kind of strategies which may lead to enhance the income of the cultivators as well as fulfill the food demand of growing population, keeping in mind the fast changing climatic conditions all over the world and protecting wasteful and careless use of natural resources for betterment of coming generation.
Q15|Cost-effectiveness of buying land for conservation versus paying land-users for conservation measures – the case of preserving an oligotrophic lake in a Natura 2000 area in North Germany|Cost-effective implementation of measures to conserve biodiversity is often a major target of conservation organisations, and choosing the correct mode of governance can be important in this context. Nature conservation organisations can, in principle, choose between two distinct modes of governance to implement conservation activities: they can (1) buy desired areas of interest and implement conservation measures themselves (buy option), or (2) offer payments to landowners to incentivize them to voluntarily preserve or create habitat on their land (compensation option). In this paper we analyse the cost-effectiveness of these two modes of governance in a case study on a conservation project in a Natura 2000 area in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. The actual costs of the buying option are compared with the potential costs of implementing the compensation option. We developed a costing framework to compare the costs of both options over time, given they generate the same ecological results on an identical project area. We find that the cost-effective solution depends, among other things, on the conservation timeframe considered and on cost components such as transaction costs, leasehold rent and land prices.
Q15|Rural Waste Management Issues at Global Level(Introductory chapter)|This chapter intends to draw attention to solid waste management sector toward rural areas where bad practices and public health threats could be avoided through traditional and integrated waste management routes. The expansion of waste collection services across rural municipalities should be a priority for many countries. Agricultural and municipal waste diversion from wild dumps and open burning practices must be avoided through smart solutions at the local level which are cost-efficient particularly in developing countries. The book further examines, on the one hand, the main challenges in the development of reliable waste management practices across rural regions and, on the other hand, the concrete solutions and the new opportunities across the world in dealing with rural solid waste.
Q15|Sustainability level of Bulgarian agriculture|This paper presents a holistic approach for assessing agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria based on its economic, social and ecological aspects on sectoral macro-level. It is based on official statistical and other information as well as on expert evaluation. Our study has found that the Bulgarian agriculture on macro-level has good sustainability. Some of the sustainability aspects have higher levels (e.g. the economic aspect) while others (social and environmental) are inferior. Study results could help in focusing the political efforts, so that the agrarian sustainability, in its social and ecological aspect, could be increased. However, a further research is needed to evaluate the level of sustainability at micro-level, so that the major issues and problem areas are addressed accordingly.
Q15|Environmental sustainability of Bulgarian agricultural Farms – assessment, state, factors|The issue of assessment of diverse aspects of sustainability of agricultural farms is among the most topical in the last decades. In Bulgaria there are no comprehensive studies on environmental sustainability of farms in general or different types. This article applies a holistic framework for assessing environmental sustainability of Bulgarian farms. Initially the multiprinciple, multictiteria and mulriindicator framework for assessing environmental sustainability of farm in the country is outlined. After that a level of environmental sustainability of Bulgarian farms is evaluated in general and of farms different juridical type, size, production specialization, and ecological and administrative location. Sustainability assessment is based on a first large-scale survey on environmental aspects of sustainability of agricultural farms in the country carried out in 2016. Third, relations between environmental and socio-economic and integral sustainability of Bulgarian farms are specified. Finally, factors for improving environmental and overall sustainability of agricultural farms in the country are identified. Our study has found out that environmental sustainability of Bulgarian farms is at a good level. Nevertheless due to an inferior level of governance and economic sustainability the integral sustainability of Bulgarian farms is lower and the improvement of the latter two is critical for maintaining overall sustainability of Bulgarian farms at current stage of development.
Q15|Продовольственное Обеспечение Нуждающихся: Концепция Социально Ориентированного Сельского Хозяйства, Институциональная Среда Продовольственной Помощи Населению, Потенциал Органического Земледелия, Пилотные Проекты<BR>[Food provision requiring: the concept of a socially-oriented agriculture, the institutional environment of food aid to the population, the potential of organic farming, pilot projects]|"In the present work, the socio-economic essence and role of the institutional in the system of providing food aid to the needy population is investigated, the composition and functions of institutions, the mechanism of interaction between participants in the production, social, credit and financial and trade spheres are determined. The potential of the resource base and the institutional environment for the functioning of organizations within the region's internal food aid system has been assessed.A methodology for determining the resource potential of the region is proposed, based on an integrated approach that includes both an assessment of the possibility of self-sufficiency in the population's food supply and the potential of land resources for environmentally friendly production by involving unsuitable for intensive farming of soils; as well as the mechanism for increasing the production capacities of processing enterprises for food production and the approach in which the development vector is aimed at motivating land users to use saving technologies with tools of the state support system within the green box of WTO norms. New approaches to establishing the interaction of food trade agents are substantiated, the essence of which is to change the architecture of the trade process, the introduction of production and logistics centers in the product chains. This will allow commodity producers, bypassing trade networks, to increase the amount of conditioned food that meets technological requirements; use the resources of transnational trade network structures in the interests of the region, develop the logistic potential, obtain a synergistic effect The book addresses the complex problem of forming the infrastructure of domestic food aid to the population in the region: resource supply of food; restoration of fertility of degraded lands for the production of environmentally friendly food; state support of economic entities in the sphere of production and processing within the framework of the green box of WTO norms. It is proposed to introduce production and logistics centers into the composition of product chains; alternative forms of trade in food; form payment systems for targeted assistance to the population; use the resource of trade network structures in the development of the region's logistics potential. The publication is designed for employees of government and municipal government, infrastructure links of the food security system, social protection of the population Keywords. food security for the needy population, a socially-oriented economy, an infrastructure for food aid to the population, organic farming, pilot projects,a ""green WTO basket»."
Q15|The evolution of chemical properties of soil under the influence of tillage systems and fertilization at the culture of wheat in the period 2007-2016 at ARDS Turda|"Through the experiment realized at ARDS Turda in 2007, was monitored in comparativ, the evolution the soil under the influence of the tillage system, the crop plant, and the level of fertilization. Increasing the reserve in the macro -elements is much more significant in the case of the conservative system compared to the classic system, especially at the depth of 0-20 cm. The production data registered at the variety of autumn wheat Ariesan in the period 2007-2016, indicates the suitability of cultivation in the ""no tillage"" system, the difference in production between the two systems, the classical (5535 kg/ha) - ""no tillage"" (5435 kg/ha) being only 100 kg/ha."
Q15|Development of coopeatives in the Republic of Moldova|The paper presents the review of the development of cooperatives in the Republic of Moldova during the post independence period. After the massive land privatization a large number of small scale agricultural producers occurred that hardly can compete with large scale producers. This preserves a state of underdevelopment of small farmers and of the rural sector. To identify problems that jeopardize cooperation processes and potential solutions a study on the development of cooperatives in the country was carried out. The major problems and possible solutions were identified through a semi-structured survey that encompassed 150 agricultural producers purposively selected in North, Central and South regions of the country. Addressing this critical situation can be made by coagulating dispersed efforts of small scale farmers to reduce costs of purchasing agricultural inputs and services, improve the access to post harvest, processing, transportation, financing, consulting services. Access to more stable markets and negotiation of better prices and better conditions of delivery can also be achieved through consolidated efforts agricultural producers’ groups.
Q15|Profiles of rural households in the North—East Development region of Romania. case studies|The rural household epitomizes the central socioeconomic unit of the vernacular village. The territorial resources, livestock and human capital shape the particular features of each place and zone. The present study relies upon field research, namely a questionnaire undertaken in 354 rural households across the counties from the North-east Development Region. The main conclusions highlight visible zonal differences among them, all with clear distinctive features that draw the traditional element of each zone.
Q15|Research on the influence of the soil tillage system on soybean yield at ARDS Turda|The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the soybean yield obtained from the application of the minimum tillage system compared to the classical tillage system. Conservative tillage systems have become an important part of agriculture, and the need to apply these systems is justified by the growing area of land degraded by the erosion process. Experimental factors: Factor A - the tillage system: classical tillage system and minimum tillage system (chisel variant); Factor B - soybean varieties: Onix, Felix, Mălina TD and Darina TD; Factor C - experimental years: 2015 and 2016. Following the application of the conservative tillage system, there is a slight decrease in yield compared to the classical tillage system, and between the two years studied, in 2016 there are yields with significantly higher differences compared to 2015. The application of conservative tillage systems brings important long-term benefits to both the soil and the environment by reducing soil compaction and fossil fuels used in crop technology.
Q15|Agricultural Mobility of Tribes: A Village -Level Study in Kerala|This paper epitomizes the dynamics in agrarian livelihood of a tribal community. The study probes the transformation taking place over the period with a focus on their agricultural patterns. Outcome of the inquiry reveals that a shift in the pattern and practices of cultivation enforced by the outside elements as a direct outcome of the injection of money economy has not fulfilled the targeted benefits in their life. It has disrupted not only their resource base but their livelihood fabric also. The additional risk of irreversible climate changes further erodes the livelihood trajectory of this resource oriented group. If not checked timely, the situation will result in further downward mobility in agricultural as well as livelihood.
Q15|Social and economic dimensions of land reform - a territorial aproach|Agricultural land represents one of the most valuable natural resources of a country, being both a significant form of national wealth, and an important source of economic and political power. The land reform has been a constant presence in the policy promoted by the governments leading Romania after the year 1990. By its amplitude and importance this represented a study issue treated and debated in many scientific works. Though, there is in Romania, a more reduced concern as regards the territorial dimensions linked to the land reform. The goal of the present paper is to bring a contribution in this field. The analysis was concentrated on the following main dimensions: the ownership structure of the agricultural land fund, the farms’ structure and the land market’s features. Within the context of the bigger and bigger importance given to de-centralization, the territorial approach could contribute efficiently to the supporting of the sustainable rural development.
Q15|The influence of mineral fertilization upon production and quality of spring barley on agricultural research and development station Turda|In order to clarify some aspects of the spring barley reaction on the production and accumulation of the protein in grain, at different levels of fertilization, some estimates of this chemical component were made at 16 levels of fertilization with N: P: K in the period 2016-2017 . The increase in protein content was achieved at the highest levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, even when potassium fertilizers were not used, but the highest protein content in grain accumulating at the level of N60P80K0 was 11.78%. The highest yield can be attributed to the fertilization variant N120P80K40, which confirms the negative relationship between production and protein content.
Q15|Reflections on the impact of the Association Agreement Between the Republic of Moldova and the European Union on the economy of the national rural space|"European authorities have given and increased attention to rural areas. Still in Agenda 2000, the European Commission has included ""coherent sustainable rural development policies"". Moldova is ""condemned"" to pay more attention to rural areas, as the majority of the population is located here. Moreover, the share of the rural population increases from 52.6% in 1990 to 57.5% of the total population in 2016. The approach of the rural development problem is also conditioned by the difficult condition of the village. Incidentally, paragraph (d) of Article 68 of the Association Agreement between the Republic of Moldova and the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the other part, initialed in November 2013 (hereinafter referred to as "" Agreement ""), urges us to"" exchange knowledge and good practices on rural development policies to promote the economic well-being of rural communities "". The basic unit of the rural area in our country, in administrative terms, is the village, which according to the ""European Rural Country Book"" [14,9] is assigned the following functions: economic, ecological, socio-cultural. The article meditates on the economic function, which includes the sustainable use of natural resources, the development of an efficient agricultural production system, the promotion of tourism and other services. As a result, the authors come up with some proposals that would contribute to the sustainable economic development of the national rural economy."
Q15|Analysis of the impact of the use or non-use of neonicotinoids in agriculture|"Neonicotinoids are a class of chemical insecticides derived from nicotine. Like nicotine, neonicotinoids act on certain types of receptors in nerve synapses. They are much more toxic to invertebrates, such as insects, than to mammals and birds. The popularity of neonicotinoids for pest control is their water solubility, which allows them to be applied to the soil and taken over by the plants. The present paper will present, analyse and evaluate the impact of the use of these insecticides in the agriculture of Romania. In the first phase of the study, we will present the overall situation of the main cultures for which these neonicotinoids are used, by qualitative and quantitative analysis of data from local, national, European and international databases. In the second phase the effect and effort of the use or non-use of these insecticides in agriculture will be estimated. Thus, the difference in production will be determined in an untreated and treated one, and we will see the value of the neonicotinoids in production, on the other hand, the less positive effects of the use of these types of insecticides, namely pollution, or what they call some ""ecological disaster"", but also its effect on apiculture and implicitly on bees. This study will be pertinent and objective, without favoring or disfavoring any person or institution in these two areas."
Q15|Impact of Institutions on Rural Livelihoods Case Study of Village Mundoti|Proposed study presents an analysis of the linkages between the Livelihood strategies of the rural area and their Institutional impact on the rural livelihoods. Agriculture is the main livelihood option of the majority of the rural people in rural area. As a coping strategy for food production and income generation, wetlands and uplands are used in an integrated manner by the rural people to achieve sustained livelihoods. The researcher has presented trend by graphs and used models between the variables to analyze the relationship between institutions and livelihoods in rural area. Study has taken primary data source through direct interaction with the household of rural area, Mundoti village in Kishangarh Tehsil of Ajmer district in Rajasthan, India.
Q15|Numerical Investigation of Head Frontal Velocity of nonconservative Dense Flows in Small Inclined Beds|Non-conservative dense flow frontal velocity has been simulated two dimensionally by fluent numerical code. The outcomes have been compared with experimental results. Numerical simulation was conducted as two-phase through Euler-Lagrange method. Reynolds-Stress Turbulent Model (RSM) with non-uniform grid and shredding mesh on the channel floor. The results obtained from numerical model of head frontal velocity show a good compliance with experiment results and greatly help analyzing the pattern of fluid movement in different scales.
Q15|Land Resource Utilisation in Tea Industry: Current Problems and Future Prospects with Special Reference to Labour|Central focus of this study is to analyse two very important issues: land utilization patterns in tea gardens and the socio-economic profile of tea garden labour. In India there are presently an estimated thirteen hundred tea factories and thirty seven thousand large and small estates with more than two million people earning their livelihood from tea related activities. These mainly include production, value addition at different levels, marketing of tea and related activities. In the tea industry, it is well known that despite such overwhelming dependence on tea related activities, the country is perhaps operating much below its capacity. In this regard, we observed that vast areas located under the big tea estates are not under tea plantation. Proper use of unutilised resource may generate higher returns to capital and land along with higher employment levels. However, the question remains as to what level of production and employment should be deemed optimal in tea plantations. This study strives to look at some of these aspects with the help of detailed survey based data from West Bengal, Assam and Tamil Nadu. Based on this extensive sample survey on tea gardens in all these major tea producing regions the study pragmatically examines the labour market issues too.
Q15|The impact of environmental regulations on the farmland market and farm structures: An agent-based model applied to the Brittany region of France| Nitrate pollution remains a major problem in some parts of France, especially in the Brittany region, which is characterized by intensive livestock production systems. Although farmers must not exceed a regulatory limit of nitrogen contained in manure per hectare, many farmers in this region exceed this limit. Therefore, they must treat the excess of manure that they produce or export it to be spread in neighbouring farms and/or areas, inducing fierce competition in the land market. Another adaptation strategy consists of modifying production practices or the production system as a whole, i.e., changing the structure of the farm. In this paper, a spatial agent-based model (ABM) has been developed to assess policy options in the regulation of manure management practices. The objective is to highlight the potential effects of these policies on the farmland market and the structural changes that they induce. Our results show that the different policies, which result in similar environmental benefits, induce different changes in the land market and in agricultural structures.
Q15|The Stolypin Reform and Agricultural Productivity in Late Imperial Russia|We study the effect of improvements in peasants’ land tenure, launched by the 1906 Stolypin reform, on agricultural productivity in late Imperial Russia. The reform allowed peasants to obtain land titles and consolidate separated land strips into single allotments. We find that consolidations increased land productivity. If the reform had been fully implemented, it would have doubled grain production in the empire. We argue that an important factor determining the positive impact on productivity is a decrease in coordination costs, enabling peasants to make independent production decisions from the village commune. In contrast, the titling component of the reform decreased land productivity and we present evidence that transaction costs explain this short-run decline.
Q15|Non-financial hurdles for human capital accumulation: landownership in Korea under Japanese rule|Abstract This study examined the relationship between land inequality and human capital accumulation in the Korean colonial period by using a panel data set from 1934 to 1942. Evidence of the adverse relationship between land inequality and the accumulation of human capital has thus far only been presented by using data from Western countries and from countries that achieved industrialization not under colonial occupation but by their own economic interest. The presented findings thus contribute to the body of knowledge on this topic and confirm the generalizability of the Galor model by analyzing the unique Korean context under Japanese rule in the early twentieth century. It is the first study to present evidence that inequality in landownership had an adverse effect on the level of public education in the Korean colonial period (i.e., it is a non-financial hurdle for human capital accumulation). By using a fixed effects model and a fixed effects two-stage least squares model with an instrumental variable estimation, this study exploits variation in inequality in land concentration across regions in Korea, accounting for the unobserved heterogeneity across these regions. Overall, this analysis establishes a highly significant adverse effect of land inequality on education in the Korean colonial period.

Q15|A Ricardian analysis of the impact of climate change on Italian agriculture|This research investigates the potential impact of warming on Italian agriculture. Using a detailed dataset of 16,000 farms across Italy, the study examines likely warming impacts in different regions and for different sectors of Italian agriculture. The study finds that farm net revenues are very sensitive to seasonal changes in temperature and precipitation. Livestock and crop farms have different responses to climate as do rainfed farms and irrigated crop farms. The overall results suggest mild consequences from marginal changes in climate but increasingly harmful effects from more severe climate scenarios.
Q15|A Spatial Econometric Analysis of Land Use Efficiency in Large and Small Municipalities|We estimate the relationship between urban spatial expansion and its socio-economic determinants in Lombardy, the most urbanised region of Italy (and one of the most urbanized of the European Union), at the municipality level. Test results suggest that this relationship varies significantly among municipalities of different size and findings support the hypothesis that larger ones are more efficient in managing land take. In particular, we find that the marginal land consumption per new household is inversely related to the size of the municipality and we link this evidence to the fact that, since more space is often available, small municipalities pay less institutional attention to the issue of land take and consequently internalise less the environmental externalities. This evidence calls for a reflection on the role of planning policies and the effectiveness of undifferentiated measures to contain land take, especially in the case of Italy, where the municipalities, more than 99% of which have less than 50,000 inhabitants, decide on land use transformations.
Q15|Estimating location values of agricultural land|“Bodenrichtwerte” reflect the average location value of land plots within a specific area. They constitute an important source of information that contributes to price transparency on land markets. In Germany, “Bodenrichtwerte” are provided by publicly appointed expert groups (Gutachterausschüsse). Using empirical data from Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania between 2013 and 2015, this article examines the relation between “Bodenrichtwerten” and statistically determined location values. It turns out that “Bodenrichtwerte” tend to underestimate location values of arable land by 11.5 percent on average. This underestimation can be traced back to the pronounced increase of land prices in the observation period. As an alternative to the expert-based determination of location values, we suggest a nonparametric smoothing procedure that rests on the Propagation-Separation Approach. The application of this data-driven procedure achieves an accuracy comparable to that of official “Bodenrichtwerte” at the one-year ahead prediction of location values without the requirement of expert knowledge.

Our results show that the different policies, which result in similar environmental benefits, induce different changes in the land market and in agricultural structures.
Q15|Conjunctive On- and Off-farm Surface Water Investment influence on Crop Mix and Groundwater Use on an Agricultural Landscape| The use of surface water to replace groundwater for irrigation is often viewed as an effective approach for reducing groundwater overdraft on an agricultural landscape. The expected increase in the aquifer volume in the presence of surface water does not occur unless the off-farm water price is low enough to generate a significant shift away from groundwater. There is a change in the crop pattern toward more irrigation intensive crops, and the net effect can be a rise in groundwater extraction.
Q15|Return on investment in irrigation practices in response to the rate of adoption on an agricultural landscape| Concerns about groundwater depletion from conventional agricultural irrigation in the Mississippi Delta have led to the technological innovation of more-efficient irrigation practices. With Arkansas being the largest producer of rice and the tenth largest producer of soybeans in the United States, the irrigation demand of these crops has put pressure on producers to find ways to irrigate more efficiently. Research into water conserving irrigation techniques has helped preserve water resources, maintain yields, and maximize farm profits. As groundwater levels in the Delta continue to decrease, the price of pumping water increases, making the prospect of investment in new technologies more attractive. The paper will address potential returns on investment in efficient irrigation practices for furrow irrigated soybeans and flood irrigated rice. The depletion of the aquifer and the return on investment from efficient irrigation practices depends on the well-pumping decision of farms across the landscape. More farms adopting the efficiency-enhancing practices will increase the return on investment in those practices because these methods stabilize groundwater levels across the landscape. We explore how the rate of adoption of efficient irrigation practices on the landscape ultimately influence the return on investment.
Q15|An Examination of the Relationship Between Net Crop Returns and Cash Rent Values in Indiana| This paper examined the relationship between cash rent and net crop returns for Indiana. As expected, there was a significant and positive relationship between net crop returns and cash rent values. The relatively low coefficients on lagged net crop returns in the cash rent equations reinforces the existing literature that asserts that cash rent values are sticky. As a result, the recent decline in net crop returns in Indiana will not be fully realized for several years.
Q15|The Economic Benefits of Irrigation Districts under Prior Appropriation Doctrine: An Econometric Analysis of Agricultural Land‐Allocation Decisions|The economic literature has established that prior appropriation doctrine induces heterogeneity in risk among water users, which leads to an inefficient allocation of resources. In this study, we show that irrigation districts alleviate that risk by deviating from the strict application of prior appropriation doctrine. As a result, farmers inside irrigation districts are able to plant more water‐intensive crops than farmers outside irrigation districts, which increases average profitability. We empirically examine this hypothesis by leveraging a georeferenced panel data set at the spatial scale of the individual water right and spanning 2007–14 in Idaho's Eastern Snake River Plain. Our results indicate that on average, irrigation districts allocate larger portions of their land to drought‐sensitive, high‐value crops such as sugar beets and potatoes. As a result of differences in planting decisions, members of irrigation districts earn on average $16.20 per acre, or 6.0% more per year than those outside of irrigation districts. La littérature économique a établi que la doctrine d'appropriation préalable entraîne une hétérogénéité du risque parmi les utilisateurs d'eau, conduisant à une allocation inefficace des ressources. Dans cette étude, nous montrons que les districts d'irrigation réduisent ce risque en s’éloignant de l'application stricte de la doctrine d'appropriation préalable. Par conséquent, les agriculteurs à l'intérieur des districts d'irrigation peuvent planter plus de cultures grandes consommatrices d'eau que les agriculteurs à l'extérieur de ces derniers, augmentant ainsi la rentabilité moyenne. Nous examinons empiriquement cette hypothèse en tirant parti d'un ensemble de données de panel géoréférencées à l’échelle spatiale du droit individuel à l'eau, qui couvrent la période de 2007–2014 dans la Eastern Snake River Plain de l'Idaho. Nos résultats indiquent qu'en moyenne, les districts d'irrigation allouent de plus grandes portions de leurs terres à des cultures de haute valeur sensibles à la sécheresse telles que les betteraves à sucre et les pommes de terre. En raison des différences au niveau des décisions de plantation, les membres des districts d'irrigation gagnent en moyenne 16,20 $ par acre, ou 6,0 % de plus par an que ceux qui se retrouvent à l'extérieur des districts d'irrigation.
Q15|Rural Land Transfer and Financial Impact: Evidence from China| Land is the most valuable capital that farmers own. Land transfer can improve income of farmers through an optimal allocation of factors of production. The land transfer is not only transferring of the ownership but also transferring of the management rights. Chinese rural land system has its unique characteristics: ownership, contract, and management rights. Ownership rights are owned by collectives, farmers have contract management rights which are divided into management transfer rights and contract rights. Since 2008, farmers are provided with both land contract rights and land management transfer rights. This reform has provided farmers with financial opportunities to obtain revenues using different channels. Transferring-in land needs additional capital thereby causing demand effects, but transferring-out land allows farmers to earn income thereby causing supply effects. Land transfer also changes farmer’s agricultural investment and insurance behavior. This paper uses 2014 data from nine Chinese provinces to test farmers’ financial behavior change between land management rights transfer-out and transfer-in. Results from doubly-robust estimator with inverse probability weighting estimator, regression-adjustment, and propensity score matching indicate a significant difference of financial selection between land transfer-in farmers and land transfer-out farmers. Land market gives an unblocked transmission channel to rural financial market through mechanism innovation.
Q15|Women's Property Rights and Outreach of Microfinance Institutions Targeting Women| The right to legally own and control property is vital to the ability of an individual to receive credit. Women in developing countries often lack property rights and are therefore at a disadvantage when applying for loans. In addition, even where women have been granted equal or near-equal rights as men, there is often a disconnect between what is codified as law and what occurs in practice. Therefore, I seek to examine how women’s property rights, both as codified and in enforcement, affect outreach activities of Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) serving women. I initially hypothesized that in MFIs targeting women, the breadth of outreach to women would be positively affected by both the legal strength and enforcement of women’s property rights. Results of a Heckman selection model and a Seemingly Unrelated Regression model both contradict that initial hypothesis, instead showing that MFIs give a far greater portion of their loan funds to women clients in countries with more discriminatory women’s property rights, and that enforcement of property rights does not show any significant effect on the ability of MFIs to reach women borrowers.
Q15|The fruit of inequality: wine, efficiency, agrarian contracts and property rights in Catalonia (1898-1935)|With the aim of drawing lessons that can act as a reference for reforms in today’s developing countries, economic historians are showing a renewed interest in the European experiences of agrarian reform. But in some developing countries property rights over the land show‘oddities’ with respect to the ‘Western canon’. Drawing on the case of Catalonia, this paper maintains that, if their work is to be useful, historians should be sensitive to the fact that in Europe – including the United Kingdom – oddities were not rare either. In Catalan vineyards, sharecropping contracts that granted the sharecropper ownership rights over the land were in widespread usage. Around 1900, sharecroppers’ rights became insecure, which led to several dysfunctions that the paper analyses.
Q15|Land Inequality And Growth: Meta-Analysis And Relevance For Contemporary Development In Africa|In this paper we review the literature on inequality and growth, with a focus on land inequality, and apply meta-analysis to the subset of studies that have focused on the impact of land inequality on long term growth. Next we discuss the relevance of the issue, focusing on Africa. The literature on inequality and growth has firmly established a strong role of land inequality as a determinant of income inequality, and the negative impact of land inequality on long term growth, and also that inequality in assets ownership, once established, is very difficult to reverse. Land inequality negatively affects growth essentially in the long run and in the developing areas. Next, the article argues the contemporary relevance of the topic, through the example of Africa, where complex land markets and strong commercial pressure on land, including large scale land acquisitions by foreign investors, may result in land concentration.
Q15|Is Marx’S Absolute Rent Due To A Monopoly Price?|Absolute rent, in Marx’s view, has an upper limit represented by the difference between the value and the price of production of agricultural commodities. The actual relevance of this limit was questioned by Bortkiewicz and other scholars because of the difficulties concerning the argument which Marx based it on. The lack of this upper limit prompted a number of scholars to claim that there is no difference between absolute rent and a rent paid by a monopoly price. Referring to the classical/Marxian theory of monopoly price, we shall argue that is still possible— notwithstanding the missing upper limit—to distinguish absolute rent from a rent actually due to a monopoly price. In particular, the difference between the two rests on the removability (in the case of absolute rent) or the persistency (in the case of monopoly rent) of the obstacle to the expansion of agricultural production.
Q15|La reforma agraria de la dictadura militar en el sur de Chile: parceleros en las provincias de Valdivia y Osorno, 1973-1989|This article examines the process of distribution of individual parcels of land to peasants labouring on large expropriated estates in the period of the agrarian reform before 1973. This land distribution took place in the second half of the seventies, under the regime of the military dictatorship. The challenge faced by the new small-scale landowners in seeking to keep their parcels of land is discussed, with special focus on what happened in southern Chile. Based on documents obtained from the Ministry of Agriculture, the Agricultural Reform Corporation (CORA), notary public archives, interviews and laws, this study also examines the procedure used to divide the land into parcels, and how the selection of beneficiaries was carried out. The number and percentage of plots sold by the beneficiaries in the provinces of Valdivia and Osorno and their motivation to sell are outlined in detail. The new agrarian reform implemented by the military dictatorship had the purpose of redefining the foundations of capitalist accumulation, and the distribution of individual plots of land is an example of this. The new small-scale landowners had few tools to cope with the new neo-liberal scenario; yet they were left to fend for themselves as the state had no interest in supporting them.
Q15|Land, Food and Labour in Pre-Industrial Agro-Ecosystems: a Socio-Ecological Perspective on Early 19th Century Seigneurial Systems|Research on seigneurial agriculture and its role for agricultural changes in general has a long tradition within European Agricultural History. Still, much discussion arises on whether to emphasize «peasant paths» or “landlord paths” of agricultural development. This study contributes to the debate by introducing a social ecology perspective. Using the nineteenth-century case study of Grundherrschaft (manor) Grafenegg, we offer a first attempt at conceptualizing and empirically scrutinizing resource use and distribution in (late) Central European seigneurial agriculture. We integrate rich archival material to reconstruct the distribution of three central resources –land, food and labour– among the agrarian agents (e.g. manorial farmsteads, peasant farms and smallholdings). We found that the three central resources in pre-industrial agriculture were distributed unequally between the various farmsteads involved; labour was abundant, whereas food and land were scarce. The labour surplus extracted by the landlords caused subsistence pressure on most of the peasants, forcing them to use their modest resource base more efficiently, which in turn had effects on the local agroecology.
Q15|La desecación de las Tablas de Daimiel (1750-1987): cambios agrarios e impactos medioambientales a partir de la interpretación del registro sedimentario|Located in a semi-arid zone of the central Iberian Peninsula, the Tablas de Daimiel National Park is a wetland of international significance that has experienced intense agricultural pressure since the eighteenth century. The impact of this is recorded in the sediments within the wetland, which have been studied by means of surveys. Several sediment anomalies have been found that were caused by an increase in agricultural activities, distinguishing this wetland from natural sedimentary behaviour. Four phases of significant disturbance have been established: the first drainage project in the 1750s, an increase in cultivated area in the surrounding land during the second half of the nineteenth century, a drainage attempt during the Spanish Second Republic and a final degradation in the second half of the twentieth century. Dated with some uncertainty due to the laboratory methods used, these disturbances have been corroborated by historical sources. In conclusion, one can establish that deforestation in the surrounding land, changes in land use, continual ploughing and drainage projects are all crucial in explaining the impoverishment of this wetland.
Q15|A microeconometric analysis of climate change drivers for coffee crops transition to cacao in Mesoamerican countries|Climate change will have a permanent impact over Mesoamerican agricultural sector. Present day crops such as coffee may not be enough to secure agricultural subsistence levels, therefore, the first stages of crop diversification are being observed in countries such as Nicaragua. Implementation of new crops such as cocoa may lead to new impacts over the environmental structure of the Mesoamerican ecosystem. These impacts may be of different, nature, but being diversification an already undergoing process attention must be paid to the underlying motivation and decision-making processes involved. This study analyses subjacent motivations and contexts that lead to the potential incorporation of cocoa crops in present-day Nicaraguan coffee farms. In order to achieve that, three main motivations were identified: climatic, economic and governmental. An econometric analyse was performed over the variables that affect farmers? motivations and decisions, in order first to analyse this decision-making process, and second, to understand how social and climatic evolution over the next decades will impact the context under which agricultural output is shaped. It was found that climatic perspectives are most closely affecting the smallholders? decision of incorporating cocoa plantations into their farms. Therefore, climate change will most certainly have a major role in the reshaping of agricultural structure in most of Nicaraguan geography. Moreover, results show a lower impact of market conditions and public subsidies over farmers? choices and decisions. These results favour the intuition that risk-reduction is a preferred strategy among Nicaraguan smallholders.
Q15|Nudging Participation and Spatial Agglomeration in Payment for Environmental Service Schemes|The environmental benefits from Payment for Environmental Service (PES) schemes can often be enhanced if landowners can be induced to enrol land in a spatially - coordinated manner. This is because the achievement of many targets for biodiversity conservation policy or water quality improvements are increasing in the spatial connectedness of enrolled land. One incentive mechanism which has been proposed by economists to achieve such connectedness is the Agglomeration Bonus (AB). There has also been an interest within the literature on PES design in using “nudges” to enhance participation and scheme performance. This paper explores whether a specific nudge in the form of information provided to participants on the relative environmental performance of their group can improve participation and spatial coordination, and enhance the AB performance. We design a laboratory experiment whereby the environmental benefits generated by a PES scheme are materialized by real contributions to an environmental charity, mirroring the situation in actual PES schemes where participants derive utility from contributing to the environmental outputs of the scheme, in addition to the monetary payoffs they receive. The experimental results confirm positive environmental outcomes derived under an AB, but the impact of the nudge is less environmentally effective. Interestingly, we find that the nudge does not significantly supercharge the AB, and can even worsen its performance
Q15|Climate change in India: how to protect farmers?|The effects of climate change on Indian agriculture under different alternative climate scenarios are empirically studied. This article uses the Ricardian approach that links net revenues per acre as a function of climate, farm and households’characteristics. We estimate the net revenues per acre function using cross-sectional data and quantile regression. Empirical results show that farms with higher net revenues per acre look to be more affected by climate variables in magnitude. Farms with lower net revenues per acre tend to benefit more from crops mixing than farms with high income per acre. In a second step, we implement two climate scenarios which differ according to the assumptions on changes on average temperature and total rainfall. Farms with low net revenues per acre experience losses less important in magnitude but larger in percent change than farms with high net revenues per acre. At the district level, results show more heterogeneity. Under both scenarios, districts in the North of India tend to experience a decrease in net revenues per acre while an opposed effect is found for districts in the South of the country.
Q15|Effects of Climate Change on Agriculture: a European case study|The effects of climate change on European agriculture under different alternative scenarios are empirically studied. Empirical results exhibit the effects of seasonal weather variables on both mean yields and the variance of wheat and corn yields. Prices show a positive and significant impact on wheat yields for northern Europe, only after the CAP reform. Prior to this reform, the effect of prices on yields were not statistically different from zero. The empirical models are then used to assess the effect of climate change on yields. Four climate projection scenarios reflecting greenhouse gas concentration trajectories are tested. Mitigate spatio-temporal effects are found. Wheat yields would increase at the European scale under most scenarios, but the gains would decrease with time for regions in the north in the long-run. Results are less optimistic for corn yields. In the short-run, some northern regions would experience gains in yields, but these gains would transform into losses in the long-run. Those losses would even be higher in the south of Europe.
Q15|Determinants of the Adoption of Organic Tea Production in Northern Vietnam: A Robustness Analysis|Increasing consumer awareness on sustainable and healthy food choices gave rise to a growing demand for organic tea in the past decades. Most of this demand is met by imports from developing countries. This article examines the main factors affecting the choice of farm households to adopt organic tea production in Northern Vietnam. We apply a logit model to survey data on 241 Vietnamese tea farming households. We assess the robustness of the results by addressing three important statistical issues: (i) regressor endogeneity, (ii) unobserved heterogeneity at farm level and (iii) missing values. The main results are chiefly robust and largely in line with the theoretical predictions. We find that farm households with higher revenues and located in rich natural and physical environments are significantly more inclined to adopt organic tea production. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that farm households being consulted by extension agents and belonging to a tea association increase the odds for the adoption of organic tea cultivation.
Q15|Migration in Kenya: beyond Harris-Todaro|This paper examines the impact of agrarian structures on the migration behavior and destination of rural household heads and individuals in Kenya. To explore the complexity of migration we extend the standard Harris-Todaro framework to account for land inequality and size as well as type of destination. Using logistic regressions, we show that Kenyan household heads born in districts with higher land inequality, smaller per capita land and lower per capita rural income are more likely to migrate. We show that for individuals whose incomes are squeezed by larger land inequality, migration from villages to suburban Nairobi, smaller cities, and villages in different districts could be a preferable strategy to migrating to Metro Nairobi. The impact of land inequality is more significant for male than female migration. Moreover, the level of education, age, marital status, gender, religion and distance to Nairobi play a role in migration behavior.
Q15|Indigenous knowledge for sustainable livelihoods: Lessons from ecological pest control and post-harvest techniques of Baduy (West Java) and Nguni (Southern Africa)|With the impending threat of global climate change, the last decades have witnessed an increasing recognition of the potential contribution of indigenous knowledge to tackling global challenges of environmental sustainability. The sources and wisdom of indigenous knowledge have however much more to contribute to global knowledge, well beyond environment conservation and traditional medicine. This paper uses the examples of swidden cultivation, pest control and rice preservation techniques of the Baduy in West Java (Indonesia) and comparable grain pits utilisation by Nguni tribes in Southern Africa to discuss how indigenous sources of knowledge can be an inspiration for greater social cohesion and sustainable livelihoods. It also draws lessons showing that combining indigenous knowledge systems with modern scientific methods can make it possible to achieve results that neither system can do alone.
Q15|Coercive state, resisting society, political and economic development in Iran|In my studies, I have explored the political economy of Iran and particularly the relationship between the state and socioeconomic development in this country. The importance of the oil revenue in economic development of contemporary Iran has been underlined since the early seventies and a vast literature on the rentier state and authoritarian modernization has scrutinized the specificities of the political and economic natural resource 'curse' in Iran. A new critical social history of the oil industry has recently endeavored to reconsider the spread effects of this industry on the emergence of new cities and labor activities. In this sense, the impact of oil revenue on economic development should be mitigated: it has not been only a 'curse' but also a 'blessing'. The precious results of natural resource curse or blessing notwithstanding, this approach is insufficient to explain why some predatory states reliant on natural resources could contribute to economic development while others hinder such development. Two recent examples provide a salient illustration: why did the Shah's regime which was dependent on oil revenues enhance economic development during 1962-1974, while Ahmadinjead's two terms presidency (2005-2013) imped economic growth despite the quadrupling of oil revenues? In this essay, I will first introduce my theoretical framework and distinguish two types of predatory states, i.e. inclusive and exclusive (section 1). I will then apply this framework to explain oil and economic development (section 2). Section 3 will be devoted to the Shah's regime as an inclusive predatory state, and section 4 to Ahmadinjead's presidency as an illustration of an exclusive predatory state. A short conclusion will follow.
Q15|Assessing the Impact of Weather Risk on Land Use Intensity: A Nonstationary and Dynamic Panel Modeling Approach|Climatic variation, or weather risk, plays an important role in production agriculture. Using district-level panels for 42 years from India and nonstationary and dynamic panel estimation procedures, we estimate the impact of weather risk on land use intensity. Our results suggest the impact of weather risk on land use intensity is negative in the short run. Additionally, we find a positive effect of share of high yielding varieties production and share of irrigated acreage on land use intensity. Our study also indicates that the impact of weather risk on land use intensity has diminished in the post–market reform period (after 1990).
