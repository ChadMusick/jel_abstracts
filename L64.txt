L64|Dynamic Determinants of Access to Weapons: Global Evidence|This study investigates the determinants of and persistence in access to weapons using a global sample of 163 countries for the period 2010 to 2015. The empirical evidence is based on Generalised Method of Moments (GMM). Hysteresis in access to weapons is consistently more apparent in countries with below-median levels in access to weapons, compared to their counterparts with above-median levels in access to weapons. The hysteresis hypothesis within this context is the propensity of past values of access to weapons to influence future values of access to weapons. Factors that consistently drive access to weapons are: perceptions of crime; criminality; conflict intensity; political instability; military expenditure, violent demonstrations and terrorism. The effects of these drivers are contingent on initial levels of access to weapons. Policy recommendations for managing access to weapons are discussed.

L64|Projected Costs of U.S. Nuclear Forces, 2019 to 2028|The nationâ€™s nuclear forces are reaching the end of their service life. CBO estimates that the Administrationâ€™s current plans to operate, maintain, and modernize them would cost $494 billion over the 2019â€“2028 period, or about 6 percent of the total 10-year costs of the plans for national defense outlined in the Presidentâ€™s 2019 budget submission. The current estimate is 23 percent (or $94 billion) higher than CBOâ€™s 2017 estimate for the 2017â€“2026 period, largely because modernization programs are further along in their development and some new programs have been added.
L64|The Cost of Replacing Todayâ€™s Army Aviation Fleet|The U.S. Army has about 4,300 piloted aircraft. The replacement of three large helicopter fleets (Apaches, Black Hawks, and Chinooks) dominates the Armyâ€™s future aviation procurement costs. Because the Army made considerable investments in aircraft between 2007 and 2016, CBO projects that the annual costs of replacing the aircraft in the Armyâ€™s current fleet would decline during the 2020s, from about $4 billion in 2018 to about $1.5 billion in 2027. It would then rise to a peak of about $4.7 billion in 2032 before drifting downward between 2035 and 2045.
L64|Arms Production, National Defense Spending and Arms Trade: Examining Supply and Demand|Scholars have estimated demand functions for national defense spending and investigated international arms trade for a long time. The relationship between supply and demand for military goods has, however, only been examined on aggregate level or in formal models yet. I investigate how the supply of military goods by arms-producing companies and the demand for military goods by both the national government and foreign governments are related by using a panel of up to 195 arms-producing companies in 21 countries for the period 2002-2016. The results show that if the demand for national defense spending increases by 1%, the arms sales by a country’s largest arms-producing companies increase by up to 1.2%. If exports of major conventional weapons increase by 1%, sales increase by up to 0.2%. Arms imports do not affect domestic arms sales because imported and domestically produced arms are complements, and countries mainly import those arms they do not produce themselves. Country-specific estimation results suggest that differences among countries in geopolitical conditions and international relations determine whether a country’s arms industry serves economic rather than security purposes.
L64|Wars Have Become Too Cheap to Boost Growth|FROM THE NOTE: This week, with the Federal Reserve Banks of New York and Atlanta anticipating sharply lower GDP growth for 2019:Q1, President Trump presented a ‘Budget for A Better America’, calling for a smaller government and a bigger military. Forty years ago, the very same call was hailed as the best recipe for renewed growth. The U.S. ruling class was getting ready to install Ronald Reagan as President, abandon the Cold War and embark on neoliberalism, and it argued that, for that shift to succeed, the country needed a leaner government in order to unleash its entrepreneurial spirit and crowd-in private investment, and that it required a strong military in order to boost its global muscle and open world markets for its products and capital. Ideology aside, one key reason for the growth optimism of the time was rising military spending…

L64|The Depot-Level Maintenance of DoD's Combat Aircraft: Insights for the F-35|Depot-level maintenance of military aircraft consists of in-depth maintenance that is beyond the capability of maintenance staff at an aircraftâ€™s operating location. Depot-level maintenance is essential to ensuring an aircraftâ€™s capability to perform missions and can influence whether an aircraftâ€™s life can be extended cost-effectively. This report focuses on depot-level maintenance practices for the Air Forceâ€™s and Navyâ€™s combat aircraft as sources of insights for the new F-35 fighter aircraft.
L64|Comparing a 355-Ship Fleet With Smaller Naval Forces|In 2016 the Navy released a new force structure assessment that called for a fleet of 355 ships. CBO has estimated the costs of achieving such a fleet under two alternative approaches and has compared those scenarios with alternatives involving a fleet of 280 ships or 230 ships in 2047. This report explores the effects on shipbuilding and operating costs, the composition and capabilities of the fleet, and the shipbuilding industry.
L64|A Historical Survey of Ship Reactivations|In December 2016, the Navy released a new force structure assessment that called for a ï¬‚eet of 355 shipsâ€”substantially larger than the current force of 283 ships. This report focuses on one of several approaches that the Navy could use to increase the size of its fleet: reactivating decommissioned ships. It draws insights from past experiences that might inform lawmakersâ€™ decisions about reactivating retired ships in the future.
L64|Operating Costs of Aging Air Force Aircraft|As aircraft age, they generally become more expensive to operate. The rate at which costs grow is important for setting operating budgets and for deciding when to replace aging systems.
L64|The Cost of Replacing Todayâ€™s Air Force Fleet|The U.S. Air Force has about 5,600 aircraft, which range in age from just-delivered to 60 years old. Many of those aircraft are nearing the end of their service life. In this report, CBO estimates that replacing those aircraft would cost an average of $15 billion a year in the 2020s. That figure would rise to $23 billion in the 2030s and then fall back to about $15 billion in the 2040s. In comparison, appropriations for procuring new aircraft averaged about $12 billion per year between 1980 and 2017 (in 2018 dollars).
L64|Costs of Building a 355-Ship Navy|CBO estimates that construction costs to build a fleet of 355 ships would average $26.6 billion (in 2017 dollars) per year over the next 30 years, which is 60 percent more than what the Navy has spent on average over the past 30 years. In addition, operating costs for a larger fleet would increase substantially compared with those of todayâ€™s Navy.
L64|Análisis de la producción y del comercio de maquinaria agrícola argentina en la competencia regional (2002-2014)|Durante la última década, el sector de maquinaria agrícola fue señalado como puntal de un aparente nuevo modelo productivo. Este escenario estaba motivado por nuevos emprendimientos y el crecimiento en las exportaciones de ciertos productos de la rama, a mercados como Venezuela y Rusia, entre otros. No obstante, la crisis de 2014 desnudó los inconvenientes de la actividad. En ese sentido, reconstruimos los indicadores generales del mercado de maquinaria agrícola y de su mercado externo, sin obviar la perspectiva histórica, para comprender los factores que permitieron su desarrollo y también los que lo limitaron. El objetivo es aportar a la comprensión de los límites exportadores de la industria argentina. Buscamos comprender si los problemas actuales responden a una situación coyuntural o pasajera; o bien, si representan límites estructurales de este tipo de producción.
L64|The sectoral configuration of technological innovation systems: Patterns of knowledge development and diffusion in the lithium-ion battery technology in Japan|Technological innovation systems (TISs) have found favor for analyzing a technology’s innovation dynamics. Complementary to TISs, the sectoral innovation systems approach focuses on sectoral peculiarities regarding innovation. This paper represents a first step towards integrating the sectoral dimension into TIS analysis. This seems particularly relevant for multi-component technologies, since their underlying innovation dynamics involve multiple sectors. We introduce the “sectoral configuration” of a TIS, which relates to the number and types of sectors linked via a TIS’s value chain, and elaborate how the sectoral configuration plays out for a TIS’s functional dynamics. We apply our theoretical framework to the knowledge development and diffusion function. Based on a quantitative analysis of patent data for lithium-ion batteries in Japan (1985–2005), we find that different sectors vary in importance for knowledge development and diffusion, especially with regard to the technology’s evolution over time. Our findings suggest that the sectoral configuration deserves more attention in future TIS analyses. This would support a better understanding of functional mechanisms, and therefore offer the potential to derive enhanced TIS-based policy recommendations regarding the nature and balance between demand-pull, technology-push and interface improvement policies.
L64|Industry Evolution in Varieties of Capitalism: a Comparison of the Danish and US Wind Turbine Industries|In this study, we combine Klepper's framework on the evolution of industries with the Varieties of Capitalism approach to argue that industry evolution is mediated by institutional differences. We expect that new industries will evolve with a stronger connection to established industries in coordinated marked economies than in liberal market economies. Our assumptions are supported by the survival analysis of US and Danish wind turbine manufacturers from 1974 to 2014.
L64|The restructuring of the European land armaments industry: Between political incentives and economic pressures|Within the context of the restructuring of the European defense industry since the end of the cold war, this article addresses the land armaments sector in general, and armored vehicles in particular. The industry is generally divided into the aerospace, naval, land, and electronics sectors, of which aerospace and electronic are highly internationalized while the land and naval ones remain fragmented and nationally based. Economic characteristics of the land armaments industry—lower R&D costs and longer production runs—still permit the predominance of a nationally-focused production model, yet post-cold war market changes toward lighter platforms, and resulting synergies with the civilian truck industry, imply a comparative weakening of state sovereignty and, consequently, stronger market contestability as compared to the other defense industry sectors.
L64|The European military helicopter industry: Trends and perspectives|This article discusses the European military helicopter market. It first recalls historical antecedents in the structural development of the main helicopter programs that helped to consolidate the industry and then reviews the industry’s current major trends. A paradoxical situation is identified: While European countries presently are able to cope with both, the growing needs in helicopter capabilities and the maintenance of ageing fleets, no large helicopter programs for the future have been launched. Some uncertainties regarding how future helicopter procurement will be organized are identified. The current situation underlines the challenges that European states will face to maintain both industrial skills in the industry and sovereignty in military helicopter capabilities. A number of industry options are discussed: more exports, more cooperation, more dual use, and more reliance on support and service sales.
L64|Global perspectives on the European arms industries|The authors of this article offer perspectives on the symposium on the European arms industries published in volume 12, number 1 of The Economics of Peace and Security Journal. The symposium contributions cover the history, current situation, and likely future prospects of the European naval, land armaments, military helicopter, aerospace, and outer space industries. The perspectives then comment on the articles as a group and do so from a global vantage point inasmuch as the commentators constitute a group of prominent researchers and policy analysts drawn from around the world.
L64|Against the odds: The evolution of the European naval shipbuilding industry|Despite a low volume of production at national levels, the European naval industry remains quite fragmented 25 years after the end of the cold war. Contrary to what might be expected from an industrial or budgetary perspective, neither cross-border consolidation nor cooperative programs have resulted in European restructuring. The sovereign nature of shipyards has led to the promotion of a domestically-centered industry transformation. Again, contrary to what might be expected, this appears to be a potentially sustainable approach due to the long-term relationship between navies and their domestic industrial partners. Even so, one can question the sustainability of the current economic model, reliant as it is on export contracts and insufficient margins to manoeuver.

L64|Collaboration in international technology transfer: the role of knowledge boundaries and boundary objects|Firms increasingly use choose collaborative arrangements to get access to the most recent and advanced technologies instead of trying to develop them in-home. Several emerging economies use such arrangements particularly in the defence industry as a vehicle for technology transfer to the local industry. The effectiveness of technology transfer, however, is affected by many factors. This paper analyzes international technology transfer as a challenge of inter-firm collaboration and a challenge of cross-boundary knowledge management, and highlights the role of boundary objects to mitigate problems of knowledge boundaries such transfers. Building on a comparative case study of two international technology transfer projects, the paper contributes to the understanding of how collaboration problems can affect the transfer of knowledge across knowledge boundaries and how the use of appropriate boundary objects may improve collaboration management and the knowledge transfer.
L64|Firm growth and knowledge flows: comparative analysis between defence and civil areas|In this paper, we seek to understand how technological duality influences the growth of companies. Since the end of the Cold War, defense budgets are strongly discussed. In this context, the dual policy (convergence between civil and military areas) is presented as an optimization strategy of the defense budgets. Nevertheless, the 1990s are also characterized by a wave of defense restructuring in the United States around large private companies. Therefore, we choose to study the results of duality for these groups as they are more at stake. In order to do so, we use structural analysis tools as a way of understanding duality as the relocation of defense activities in the?innovation system center. As a result, we show that the duality of defense activities is specific because it has an opposite effect on centrality of civil activities on firms? growth. JEL Codes: B52, C55, L64, O33, O51

L64|Distorting Economic Balance and its Consequences on the Regional Market of Consulting Services|At the present time on the background of the stagnation of the professional consulting services market, the potential capacity of this market is rather sufficient to be attractive for investments. On the basis of the survey according to the representative selection of consulting companies and representatives of small and medium-sized business of the South-East of the Republic of Tatarstan, the spread between the demand and the supply on the regional market of consulting services was revealed. The market of consulting services in Almetyevsk was analyzed. Based on the obtained results, offers on using the potential of the regional market of consulting services and decreasing the stable “spread” between the demand and the supply were presented.
L64|Can Russia's Military Expansion be Impossible Mission Force for its V-Shaped Growth Recovery under Declining Oil Prices?|This paper investigates whether Russia's expansion of military goods can be Impossible Mission Force (IMF) for its V-Shaped growth recovery under declining oil prices. Looking at long-run relationships between domestic outputs and international oil prices for 1995–2016, we focus on the impact of the military output expansion on growth of GDP and manufacturing for 2011–2016. We demonstrate that the military output expansion checked further growth retardation for 2012–2014 as a counter power against deteriorating oil prices or economic sanctions, while the military output expansion would not be likely to bolster up Russia's growth from 2015 onward without next oil windfalls.
L64|The Internationalization Of Mnes From And To Brics Countries: The Case Of The Industrial Machinery Industry|Global investment trends changed radically in past decades. An important issue, still open in the literature, refers to emerging multinational enterprises (EMNEs) internationalization processes and whether they are dissimilar or not to those of developed countries multinational enterprises-DMNEs. The aim of this analysis is to study the different internationalization patterns and drivers of EMNEs and DMNEs by using the acquisitions and joint ventures from BRICSs to Triad countries and from Triad countries to BRICSs occurred in the industrial machinery industry from 2000 to 2014. Our data shows that DMNEs internationalisation pattern is profoundly different from the EMNEs internationalisation pattern. This is in line with EMNEs need to control critical assets and resources, especially technologies and “knowledge assets”. In fact they acquire firms high technological potentialities. DMNEs balance their transaction between acquisition and joint-ventures, looking at non innovative firms when they use the acquisition mode while they are more focused on innovative firms and branded firms when they establish a joint-ventures.
L64|Value Creation Networks, Knowledge Co-creation, and the Foundation of Dynamic Capabilities – Insights from an Organizational Learning Perspective|In our paper we discuss how firms are affected by newly evolving service-driven market conditions. We especially focus on understanding how the need to establish a more service-oriented business logic affects organizational learning processes. Our research is based on the service-dominant logic concept, the dynamic capabilities approach, and the 4I model of organizational learning. We extend the 4I model of organizational learning by adding a value creation network perspective as well as three specific service-related capabilities (adapting, absorbing, and collaborating). In doing so, we show how a service-dominant business logic and service related capabilities can serve as an additional microfoundation of dynamic capabilities. The purpose of our conceptual paper is to provide a holistic perspective on the highly complex relation between service-related changes in the business logic, value creation network-based learning, and the development of dynamic capabilities. Our insights are reflected by three sets of propositions we develop. The paper enhances existing knowledge by introducing a solid, theory-based framework that builds a groundwork for future empirical research.
L64|Path dependence as a barrier to business model change in manufacturing firms: insights from a multiple-case study|Abstract Business model change processes are a still underresearched phenomenon. Especially barriers to business model change and in this context path dependence of business models lack a deeper understanding. We address this issue by examining business model change processes of manufacturing firms that pursue service transition against the background of a multiple-case study. The contribution of our paper is twofold: (1) We show how business model change processes take place in detail. In doing so, we considerably enhance business model literature that employs a processual perspective on business model change. (2) Our findings allow for a new perspective on business model change as we provide empirical evidence that path dependence needs to be considered in this context. We are able to identify determinants and mechanisms that influence to which extent path dependence affects business model change processes. Hence, we enrich business model literature by applying the path dependence concept on a business model level.
L64|Vice versus virtue investing around the world|This paper assumes the role of advocatus diaboli by testing whether an investment in sin stocks can financially outperform an investment in socially responsible stocks. We create a set of global, regional, and domestic portfolios consisting of a large number of stocks belonging to what could be labeled as a sextet of sin: adult entertainment, alcohol, gambling, nuclear power, tobacco, and weapons. We assess the performance of sin stocks against well-known benchmarks, and rerun the identical assessment for socially responsible stocks. We find no compelling evidence that sin stocks, or socially responsible stocks outperform or underperform, and establish this result in several ways. Consistent with this finding, a hedge portfolio long in sin stocks and short in socially responsible stocks does not outperform the market, either. However, sin stocks are substantially tilted towards value, bear less market risk with an average beta below one, and are prone to momentum relative to socially responsible stocks.

L64|Vertical organization of production and firm growth|This paper empirically explores if different vertical organizational forms (i.e. vertical integration versus disintegration) give rise to unlike growth “behaviors” within the same industry. An econometric analysis is conducted in a sample of around 500 Italian machine tool (MT) builders for the period 1998–2007. Ceteris paribus, vertically integrated firms result to be characterized by a less dispersed distribution of growth rates than their disintegrated counterparts. By means of analyzing how different organizational forms map into the distribution of output growth rates, this work provides insight into the firm dynamics in a mature industry in which both vertically integrated and disintegrated firms coexist.
L64|Vertical organization of production and firm growth behavior|Many industries are characterized by a marked heterogeneity in vertical boundaries among their firms: some firms are vertically integrated in the production of inputs while others adopt disintegration strategies. This paper empirically explores if different vertical organizational forms are associated with unlike growth “behaviors” within the same industry. To this end, an econometric analysis is conducted over a sample of around 500 Italian machine tool (MT) builders for the period 1998-2007. Ceteris paribus, vertically integrated firms show a distribution of growth rates with a higher number of episodes of “moderate” growth, and this is true in case of both output expansion and contraction. Adjustment costs, organizational slacks, a better coordination along the production chain and a more effective handling of changes in customers’ needs may all concur to explain their more “moderate” growth profile with respect to disintegrated firms. This work provides insight into the output dynamics in a mature industry in which both vertically integrated and dis-integrated firms coexist.
L64|The role of Services in Enhancing Indian Manufacturing Exports: A Firm Level Analysis, 2000-01 to 2011-12|In this paper, we try to examine and assess the contribution of services towards India’s manufacturing exports at the firm level. In other words, the role of services in shaping the international competiveness of the Indian Manufacturing Sector at the firm level is examined. Services are instrumental in connecting to the world market and can help firms to differentiate their products. However, only bits and pieces of the relation between services and exports have been analyzed in the earlier literature. Most of the earlier studies relating to services have explored the link between services and Total Factor Productivity. The relation between services and exports has not been explored at the firm level in case of India. This also gives a justification for conducting the present study. With now firm level databases available, it allows us to explore this part in details. For exploring this link, the firm level data was collected from the Centre for Monitoring of The Indian Economy (Prowess Database) for the years 2000-01 to 2011-12. The Manufacturing firms had used different types of services according to their needs and the expenditure for the all the different services were not the same. The expenses incurred by the manufacturing firms for services like business services, repairs and maintenance, Professional services, Research & Development and others etc. were added together to get total expenses on the services variable. Two alternative econometric methods (Panel Regression method and Tobit model) were used in our study. The findings confirm that services have contributed to enhanced export competitiveness of the Indian manufacturing firms. The paper looks at the firm specific factors like firm size, age, previous years export performance, group versus non-group, labor productivity and services that affected the export performance of the Indian manufacturing firms. The overall results show that the firm specific factors such as firm size, extent of use of services, group versus non-group firms, and previous years export performance played a positive role in improving the Indian manufacturing exports.
L64|Industry structure, entrepreneurship, and culture: An empirical analysis using historical coalfields|There is mounting evidence demonstrating that entrepreneurship is spatially clustered and that these spatial differences are quite persistent over long periods of time. However, especially the sources of that persistence are not yet well-understood, and it is largely unclear whether persistent differences in entrepreneurship are reflected in differences in entrepreneurship culture across space as it is often argued in the literature. We approach the cluster phenomenon by theorizing that a historically high regional presence of large-scale firms negatively affects entrepreneurship, due to low levels of human capital and entrepreneurial skills, fewer opportunities for entry and entrepreneurship inhibiting formal and informal institutions. These effects can become self-perpetuating over time, ultimately resulting in persistent low levels of entrepreneurship activity and entrepreneurship culture. Using data from Great Britain, we analyze this long-term imprinting effect by using the distance to coalfields as an exogenous instrument for the regional presence of large-scale industries. IV regressions show that British regions with high employment shares of large-scale industries in the 19th century, due to spatial proximity to coalfields, have lower entrepreneurship rates and weaker entrepreneurship culture today. We control for an array of competing hypotheses like agglomeration forces, the regional knowledge stock, climate, and soil quality. Our main results are robust with respect to inclusion of these control variables and various other modifications which demonstrates the credibility of our empirical identification strategy. A mediation analysis reveals that a substantial part of the impact of large-scale industries on entrepreneurship is through human capital.

This study aims to analyze this industry’s recent behavior in a period when the Brazilian economy regained momentum. We will evaluate some opportunities for several segments in the Brazilian economy by breaking down investment into several activities while we simultaneously evaluate the Brazilian capital goods industry’s ability to benefit from these mentioned opportunities. Data from IBGE and MDIC will be used in this study and also from Capital Flow Tables (CFT) and from BNDES’ operations and estimates of future investments.
L64|Imposing of Arms Sanctions in the Sanctions Practise of the European Union|The contribution focuses on arms sanctions imposed by the European Union. It introduces EU arms embargoes in a context of current sanctions practice. It explains differences between UN and EU arms sanctions and analyses their causes and consequences. It offers a comparison on several levels, mentions differences in institutional and legal background, in the contents, scope and temporal link. It considers the possibilities of targeting of arms sanctions, and studies how are arms sanctions combined with other restrictive measures (assets freezing and travel bans). It explains different ways of implementation of UN arms embargoes in EU practice. It devotes intensive attention to EU autonomous arms sanctions, points to wider possibilities of EU by imposing of sanctions.
L64|Defacto and Deeded Intellectual Property: Knowledge-Driven Co-Evolution of Firm Collaboration Boundaries and IPR Stragtegy|"Research on intellectual property has focused on formal legally recorded rights that we call deeded, most often measured by granted patents. Meanwhile, other ""defacto"" IP (mainly purposive secrecy and natural excludability) has become more important because of the increasing closeness of commercial technologies to cutting edge science. A ""corporate-academic"" model has developed and become institutionalized over the last three decades which emphasizes attracting the best and brightest scientists, providing them with a commensurate increase in autonomy including initiation of bench-level collaborations with top university scientists in which valuable tacit knowledge is transferred in both directions. We provide suggestive evidence that both firm and university scientists learn from these collaborations, e.g., both types of scientists experience sharply higher patenting rates once they have engage in university-firm collaborations. We propose and test two indicators of adoption of the corporate-academic model, whether or not the firm has ever: (a) co-authored an article with a university scientist and (b) applied for (an eventually granted) patent with non-patent references, where these references are used importantly to cite scientific articles and other scientific materials. Both were robustly positive and statistically significant across four measures of U.S. high-tech firm success (publishing, patenting, obtaining venture capital, and going public) for six broad S&T areas (bio/chem/med, information technology, nanotechnology, semiconductors, other science, and other engineering). Star scientists publication as or with firm employees, SBIR grants received, and citation-weighted patents and articles all played comparatively supporting roles in the empirical estimates. We concluded that the most successful high-tech firms have adopted a strategy of operating near the edge of the scientific envelope where high levels of tacit knowledge provide substantial natural excludability reducing or preventing entry of imitators."
L64|How do US state firearms laws affect firearms manufacturing location? An empirical investigation, 1986–2010|We exploit variations in US state firearms laws to study their relation to the spatial distribution of more than 2700 federally licensed manufacturers of firearms for the civilian and law enforcement markets across the country. Accounting for a variety of economic factors—such as cost, tax burden and agglomeration effects—we find that states with relatively permissive, end-user friendly laws host more firearms manufacturing establishments than do states with relatively restrictive, end-user unfriendly laws. This supply side-oriented paper complements a literature that predominantly attends to the market’s demand side. It thus opens up a new avenue to study the US civilian firearms market.
L64|Trust your neighbour. Industrial relatedness, social capital and outsourcing|Relying on a unique dataset of small, machine-tool firms located in Emilia Romagna, Italy, we estimate the separate effects of industrial relatedness and social capital on the propensity to fully or partially outsource production activities. We focus on a series of 29 production phases, for which we have information on whether they are accomplished in-house or outside the firm. After controlling for endogeneity, we find that: (i) full outsourcing is positively related to social capital, but this effect vanishes as industrial proximity with neighbouring firms increases; and (ii) firms engage in concurrent sourcing only when industrial relatedness with neighbouring firms is high. Also phase estimates show that: (iii) while social capital matters for full outsourcing of core activities, for full outsourcing of peripheral activities it is industrial relatedness that is relevant; and (iv) there is no significant effect of either industrial relatedness or social capital on the concurrent sourcing of core and peripheral activities.
L64|Non-public contracts, cash flows and firm value: the case of Lockheed|Purpose - – This study aims to examine a large, non-disclosed production contract awarded to Lockheed Corp. in the context of a trade-off between a contractually required non-disclosure clause and the need (as a publicly traded firm) to disclose material information to its shareholders. This production contract generated significant cash flows to the firm as evidenced by growth in its earnings. However, the existence of the production contract and its contribution to Lockheed’s earnings, was not disclosed by the firm to shareholders and potential investors while the production contract was being executed. Design/methodology/approach - – The authors examine the market reaction to several key contract events which were not disclosed at the time they occurred, in compliance with the contractually required non-disclosure clause. Findings - – A statistically significant stock price reaction around the time of the award of this non-public contract, indicative of trading by some capital market participants using non-public information was documented. Originality/value - – Because similar large non-public contracts funded by the government are common in the industrial economy, we conclude by discussing implications for organizational structure, firm’s cost of capital, equity-based compensation and market efficiency.
L64|Gilda: El coste de lanzar un guante a un oligopolista/Gilda: The Cost to Challenge a Cartel Member|El cine es sorprendente, incluso cuando introduce de tapadillo temas económicos. En Gilda, lo que parece ser un recurso cinematográfico, en realidad lleva detrás una buena investigación en asuntos que nada tienen que ver con la trama original de la cinta. ¿Por qué el protagonista es el jefe del cartel del tungsteno y no de otro mineral? ¿Por qué el protagonista es alemán? ¿Por qué se refugia en Argentina? A lo largo del film se van respondiendo a estas preguntas, pero el guionista no tenía la mera intención de entretener con un texto plagado de frases ingeniosas, quería mostrar cómo se resuelven los conflictos económicos en los que hay mucho dinero en juego, que no es el juego del casino, aunque también. Cinema is amazing, even when the sly introduces economic issues. In Gilda, what appears to be a film resource really brings back good research on issues that have nothing to do with the original plot of the film. Why is the chief pro¬tagonist tungsten cartel and not another mineral? Why the protagonist is German? Why looked for refuge in Argen¬tina? Throughout the film are going to respond to these questions, but the writer did not intend merely to entertain with a screenplay full of one-liners, he wanted to show how to resolve economic disputes where there is big money at stake, it is not casino game though too.

Non-traditional version of the discounted cash flow method is applied to their decision. The model uses available market and technical information and takes into account both the planned overhauls and the ones due to random failures. The model allows to find the dependence of the value of equipment item on its age and working time in the current overhaul interval and also operatively to make a well-grounded choice between overhaul and decommissioning of an item.
L64|Has Medical Innovation Reduced Cancer Mortality?|I analyze the effects of four types of medical innovation and cancer incidence on US cancer mortality rates during the period 2000–2009, by estimating difference-in-differences models using longitudinal (annual) data on ∼60 cancer sites (breast, colon, etc.). The outcome measure used is not subject to lead-time bias. I control for mean age at diagnosis, the stage distribution of patients at time of diagnosis, and the sex and race of diagnosed patients. Under the assumption that there were no pre-dated factors that drove both innovation and mortality and that there would have been parallel trends in mortality in the absence of innovation, the estimates indicate that there were three major sources of the 13.8% decline of the age-adjusted cancer mortality rate during 2000–2009. Drug innovation and imaging innovation are estimated to have reduced the cancer mortality rate by 8.0 and 4.0%, respectively. The decline in incidence is estimated to have reduced the cancer mortality rate by 1.2%. The social value of the reductions in cancer mortality attributable to medical innovations has been enormous, and much greater than the cost of these innovations. (JEL codes: C23, J11, I12, O33)
L64|Strategies Of Internalization In The Industry Of Mining Ma-Chines And Appliances|Currently, the industry of mining machines and appliances in Poland, as a result of considerable economic improvement on the market of energetic resources, gains an incredible opportunity for further development. However, its use is de-pendent on the intensification of activity internationalization. Polish sales mar-ket, due to hard coal mining decrease and financial problems of mining enter-prises, does not guarantee sales increase.Therefore, the basic objective of this article is to assess the currently used internationalization strategies of Polish enterprises performing in the industry of mining machines and appliances. In the article, in the theoretical part literature studies concerning enterprises interna-tionalization are used. Next, the characteristics of the industry of mining ma-chines and appliances in Poland are presented, ending with a SWOT analysis. In the part devoted to a strategy of internationalization, the results of a question-naire research conducted in the group of producers of mining machines and ap-pliances in the 2012 were used. According the research results, Polish enterprises from the industry of mining machines and appliances in the internationalization of their activity use the simplest strategies that do not require engagement of capital on foreign markets. Some examined enterprises have been functioning on popular markets, offering the same products. Other ones conquer new markets and/or modify the products in order to adjust them to geological-mining require-ments of target markets. Diversification strategy is not used because of high risk. The examined enterprises are not able to use dumping, due to global competitors and Chinese producers. It is not profitable to use direct investments either in exploration and penetration. The reason is mostly a lack of recognition of mar-kets remote geographically and culturally, as well as low domestic production cost which cause that Polish producers choose a focus strategy instead of a diver-sification strategy.
L64|From here, from there, and from beyond: endogenous and exogenous factors triggering change along the cluster life cycle in a multi-scalar environment|While explaining cluster internal impacts on cluster development, cluster life cycle theory fails to explain the influence of cluster external factors. Based on a multiscalar approach, this study investigates factors causing change within an agritech cluster applying a qualitative approach. Main shifts in cluster development and their inducing factors from multiple scalar and thematic contexts are investigated. Concluding, incremental changes are mainly induced by knowledge dynamics within the same industry, especially from the local level. Radical change is the result of an exogenous shock from the national institutional environment. In total, specific changes are induced by specific factors from specific scales.
L64|Innovation in small and medium-sized companies: Knowledge integration mechanisms and the role of top managers’ networks|Past research has revealed that knowledge integration is an important prerequisite for the success of new product development. For this reason, companies deploy a number of formal mechanisms to foster integration across multiple functions and hierarchical levels. In many SMEs, however, such formal mechanisms are complemented or even replaced by informal social networks among managers and employees. Despite the relevance of intraorganizational networks, past research on SMEs, however, was focused mainly on the interorganizational level of analysis. To cover this gap, we map ego networks of senior managers in SMEs and explore their knowledge exchange relationships both inside and across functional and hierarchical boundaries. Our study shows that these social networks are an essential driver of knowledge integration and innovation.
L64|Metals and Engineering Vision 2025|Abstract European metals end engineering industry has managed to keep its position in global competition. Germany has become the leading manufacturer of machines and equipment. Metals and engineering products are used in nearly all industries and businesses, and especially due to emerging economy growth the demand outlook is favourable. New materials, new production methods, like additive manufacturing, and new moving power solutions improve the products’ raw material and energy efficiency. Increasing application of information and communication technology raises the effectiveness of production and products. Thanks to automation and robotics machines can be substituted for human labour in inconvenient and hazardous environments. Industrial internet creates new business opportunities.
L64|Price Discrimination and Bargaining: Empirical Evidence from Medical Devices|Many important issues in business-to-business markets involve price discrimination and negotiated prices, situations where theoretical predictions are ambiguous. This paper uses new panel data on buyer-supplier transfers and a structural model to empirically analyze bargaining and price discrimination in a medical device market. While many phenomena that restrict different prices to different buyers are suggested as ways to decrease hospital costs (e.g., mergers, group purchasing organizations, and transparency), I find that: (i) more uniform pricing works against hospitals by softening competition; and (ii) results depend ultimately on a previously unexplored bargaining effect. (JEL C78, L13, L14, L64)
L64|Importing Skill-Biased Technology|The production of capital equipment is concentrated among a small group of countries, and many countries import a large share of their equipment. If capital-skill complementarity is an important feature of technology, international trade may have important effects on the skill premium through its impact on equipment accumulation. In this paper we propose a tractable framework for evaluating this effect, provide simple analytic expressions linking observable changes in import shares by sector to changes in real wages of skilled and unskilled workers (and, therefore, the skill premium), and quantify the importance of this effect for a large set of countries.

L64|Origens, Evolução e Tendências da Indústria de Máquinas Agrícolas| This paper aims to resume the agricultural machinery history and development, as well as their majors companies, in order to understand the current market structure and the prospects for their future. The first discussion is related to the importance of technical progress to compete in this environment. We study the competition and technical progress in this industry, focusing on technological trajectories and on collecting information from the literature about the development of this industry. The study concludes that the industry retains some differentiated oligopoly characteristics, with innovation and product differentiation as important competitive tools. Another key aspect is the global nature of this competition.
L64|The Machine Tool Industry in Italy: Industrial Innovations and Performances|The machine tool industry has a leading role in the Italian manufacturing system, above all in Northern Italy. This industrial branch is a strategic intermediate point in many manufacture dies, with an average innovation intensity higher than that of many other industrial branches. This work investigates if and in which way the innovation and the R&D processes carried out in the sector firms affect their productivity. We built a significant sample, which answered a questionnaire based on the CIS (Community Innovation Survey). Also a regional geographic dimension is used, to test the presence of specific local effects. Results show a positive and strong contribution from human capital to productivity, while, in the short term, physical capital have a negative impact, a result probably influenced by the economic crisis.
L64|Differences in Initial Training and Wages of Japanese Engineering and Retailing Companies - Who Pays for Higher Training Costs?|The optimal human resource and skill development strategy is one important factor of economic success. This paper, therefore, analyzes industry-specific differences in the training provision between engineering and retailing companies in Japan and focuses in particular on the initial training provision for intermediate skills at the firm level. Based on 11 in-depth interviews in the retailing and the engineering sector in Japan, we find that gross training costs per basic trainee are significantly higher in engineering than in retailing. However, not only the engineering companies, but also their employees bear higher costs than their counterparts in retailing. The absolute and relative entrance wages for production employees are significantly lower than the entrance wages of employees in sale. Even though wages in engineering increase significantly stronger within the first five years, the absolute and relative wages in engineering remain still significantly lower. The results relate to the qualification levels of new trainees and the career paths.
L64|R&D Venture: proposition of a technology transfer concept for breakthrough technologies with R&D cooperation: A case study in the energy sector|At times when the market demands strong active innovation, large industrial corporations with established R&D organizations benefit from screening and developing breakthrough innovation. The ability of established organizations to absorb for future technologies is a key to successfully recognize, explore and capture breakthrough innovations. R&D Venturing is a practical way of bringing about technology transfer and exploration of future technologies through R&D cooperation, which is described in this paper by a multiple case study in the energy sector. Existing literature has been reviewed and an R&D Venturing concept will be suggested with a number of propositions for implementation. The results of the case study strongly support that different perspectives of the concept from industry, academia and the ventures themselves have to be carefully understood. Based on the results of the case study, a conceptual framework and propositions for a successful implementation have been derived. A critical discussion of the R&D Venturing concept shows the need for further empirical investigation. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2013
L64|Vertical integration and efficiency: an application to the Italian machine tool industry|This paper analyzes the relationship between firm efficiency and vertical integration in the Italian machine tool (MT) industry. The link may really be the result of a two-way causality: the effect may run from productive efficiency to the type of vertical organization (i.e. vertical integration or outsourcing), as a self-selection mechanism, or an effect from the organizational mode to the firm’s performance may (also) be at work. This relationship is empirically investigated in a novel panel dataset comprising about 500 Italian MT builders, implementing two equations and instrumental variables for the two directions of causality. The evidence clearly indicates the self-selection mechanism of the most efficient firms in vertically integrated structures, while an effect from the organizational mode to the firm’s efficiency is not supported.

L64|Competitiveness of Russia’s Machine-tool Industry|The paper considers the competitiveness of Russia’s machine-tool industry on the world and domestic markets. The authors have conducted a comparative analysis of machine-tool sector and products in Russia, developed and new industrial countries, using specific indicators that characterize its competitiveness. The results of the analysis testify to low competitiveness of Russia’s machine-tool industry and an average level of competitiveness of its products in limited segments of machine-tool manufacturing. The main obstacle in the way of increasing the competitiveness of this sector and expanding the product range are adverse financial conditions for investments into machine-tool industry and other low-profit industrial sectors.
L64|Mergers failure in the European defence technological and industrial base. The case of EADS / BAE systems|This paper deals with the project of a merger between BAE systems and EADS, announced in September 2012 and finally cancelled one month later. It investigates the rationale of the merger project and the reasons that explain its collapse. Our first aim is to assess the importance - usually put forward in the literature - of the pre-merger phase in the success or the failure of a merger project. Our second aim is to put forward the specificities of mergers when defence firms are involved. Using a single case study methodology, we show that the economic rationality of the project was based on industrial complementaries, economic synergies and personal motives. We then investigate the many political divergences, specific to the defence industry, that emerged during the pre-merger phase. Finally, considering the economic and political stakes, we suggest the merger project appeared as too big to succeed.
L64|Energy-saving regulations and commodity prices|This paper studies how environmental regulations affect prices. We use monthly point-of-sale data in the Japanese refrigerator market and employ the hedonic approach. Our central issue of environmental regulations involve two different types: one is the energy-saving regulation by government at the leading runner approach, associated with an eco-label. The second is the non-chlorofluorocarbon regulation resulting from industry self-regulation. As a result of Box–Cox regressions, we find that these environmental regulations result in a rise in price. Copyright Springer 2013
L64|SMEs’ Absorptive Capacities and Large Firms’ Knowledge Spillovers: Micro Evidence from the Machining Industry in Mexico|The aim of this paper is to analyse the relationship between large firms’ knowledge spillovers and small and medium enterprises’ absorptive capacities. We build ad hoc indicators for these two concepts following a factor analysis methodology, and carry out a structural equations analysis to determine the relationship between them. Based on firm level data from a survey that focuses on SMEs of the machining industry in a Mexican locality, this paper argues that in a low-tech and mature sector, which operates in a loosely articulated local system, two knowledge spillover mechanisms are relevant – the backward linkages and the employees’ mobility. SMEs’ absorptive capacities are strongly influenced by organisational capabilities and innovation and learning activities. We also argue that large firms’ knowledge spillovers are strongly correlated with SMEs’ absorptive capacities within the sector and locality analysed.
L64|Estimación de la eficiencia del sector metalmecánico en colombia: análisis de frontera estocástica|En este documento se evalúa el desempeño del sector metalmecánico en Colombia,durante el período 1998-2007, utilizando técnicas de frontera estocástica (SFA)que, a través de la estimación de las desviaciones de una función ideal de costos,permiten medir los niveles de eficiencia económica de las diversas unidades deproducción. Los resultados indican que existen diferencias significativas en eldesempeño de los doce departamentos incluidos en el análisis, por lo que se sugiereque se podrían obtener importantes ganancias en términos de reducción de costossi las unidades de producción se acercaran a los niveles de operación de las máseficientes. Adicionalmente, se encuentra que, durante el periodo de análisis, seobserva un cambio significativo en la eficiencia de costos del sector, lo cual se puede explicar debido al impacto de la crisis económica registrada en el país, a finales de la década de los noventa, sobre las unidades de producción del sector.

Sintetizzando il quadro emerso dalla ricerca, l’articolo presenta alcune brevi considerazioni circa le possibili implicazioni di policy.
L64|La meccanica strumentale in Germania e Italia: due modelli a confronto|Germany and Italy are the only two developed countries to retain high levels of specialization in mechanical engineering, and both play a leadership role in the international markets. Based on the empirical evidence produced by an analysis of the financial statements of a sample of Italian and German mechanical engineering firms in the 2007-2009 period, the paper identifies the key trends shared by the two countries and highlights the main differences. In fact, compared with Italy, Germany has more large firms and a sectoral innovation system, although the analysis points out many other significant differences, in particular, the average size of the companies and their levels of profitability. While this latter probably is due to structural differences, the country effect should not be disregarded and, in the case of Italian firms, it probably depends on the reluctance of the banking system to provide adequate financial support, on the lack of a sectoral innovation system, and on longer payment terms.
L64|Fuzzy Rule-Based Analysis of Industrial Service Flexibility in Collaborative Networks|The focus of this study is to analyze the factors influencing industrial service flexibility (SF) in Taiwan's manufacturing industry (TMI). This study develops a rule-based decision-support mechanism using fuzzy set theory and an analytic hierarchy process to evaluate SF in TMI. This study finds that the external collaborative network makes a greater contribution to SF than the internal collaborative network. Also, government support does not significantly improve SF because companies in TMI need core competencies and collaborative networks to integrate vertical and horizontal collaborations and maximize the effectiveness of SF.
L64|How do companies adjust their organization to national institutions: evidence from matched-pair engineering companies|Companies face competitive advantages or disadvantages depending on a country’s national institutional setting. The question is whether and how companies with highly similar product markets and technologies are able to stay competitive if they are located in disadvantaged national institutional settings. Building on the Varieties of Capitalism approach, we analyze the effect of different national institutional settings on one important characteristic of a company’s organizational structure, the span of control of production supervisors. Through plant interviews, we generated a unique dataset of matched-pair engineering companies in Germany, Switzerland, the UK, and the U.S. The findings indicate that the span of control is an important mechanism of adjustment to national institutional settings. Production supervisors in companies producing in coherently coordinated market economy like Germany have on average a broader span of control than those in coherently liberal market economy like the U.S. However, in mixed institutional settings like Switzerland and the UK, we find companies with a broad and companies with a narrow span of control, thus indicating that companies have the strategic power to adjust with their own company-level institutions to either complementing or substituting national institutions.
L64|Technology network for machine tools in Vietnam|When Vietnam joined the WTO, it accepted foreign direct investment and started to grow. Technically, it was then greatly influenced by the enterprises that entered the country through direct investment. This report shows that the technology network for machine tools is formed via direct investment and subcontracting.
L64|Effetti della crisi internazionale sulla subfornitura meccanica in Emilia Romagna|The engineering industry in Emilia-Romagna is a strategic asset for the development of Italy. What are the effects of the 2008 crisis on this industry in the region? What were the responses from companies? What questions for public policy emerge from the reading of the structural features of the regional industry and effects of the crisis? To outline the answers to these questions, in addition to the statistics available from official sources and to previous empirical research, information were drawn from a series of more than forty interviews (carried out between January and April 2011) to 28 engineering companies in the provinces of Bologna and Modena and to associations of firms in the two provinces. A background of the debate on development issues in manufacturing sectors introduces the relevance of mechanical production of the Emilia-Romagna region. The results of the empirical investigation focus on the networks of relationships that characterize the mechanical filières in the region. In the second part of the paper, 28 case studies are presented with regard to their structural characteristics, the pre-crisis strategies, the effects of the crisis and post-crisis strategies, problems, perspectives of local subcontracting. Issues of public policy are highlighted. For eight companies that have agreed to the disclosure (Ima, Sacmi, Marchesini, Tetra Pak, Partena, Rossi, Caprari, CBM) extended description drawn from interviews are also available
L64|Indian non-electrical machinery industry|Despite the implementation of economic reform measures, availability of cheap skilled and unskilled labour, good domestic demand and higher growth trend witnessed since 2003/04, India remains a marginal global player in the non-electrical machinery industry. The present status of the industry is unsatisfactory. It faces serious disadvantage while competing with the countries like China, which has developed strong presence in this industry. The industry is beset with many external and internal problems. Government of India may take important steps in creating level-playing field for the Indian manufacturers of machineries and equipments. Indian firms may attract FDI through MNEs with their potential to offer critical resources and assets, for developing additional capacities as well as for achieving global competitiveness in this industry.

L64|Kone- ja metallialan koulutuksen laadullinen ennakointi|Machinery and metal products industry employs about 130,000 people in Finland and another 100,000 people in foreign subsidiaries of Finnish companies. This report focuses on this sectors qualitative or substantive projections for vocational education and training (vocational schools and polytechnics). The starting point was a relatively rich body of research studies on future changes in the sectors job tasks and functions, which are listed in the bibliography. Based on these studies the researcher and the training committee identified the five most important future areas of expertise and related trends, which are as follows : i) customer know-how, where solution orientation and deep understanding of clients generate value for clients, ii) research and development, the importance of which is continually growing in their operations iii) the internationalization of production networks in the wake of globalization as especially leading companies seeking to manage production and marketing on a continent-by-continent basis, iv) information technology and increasing automation of intelligence in machines and automation processes, and v) energy and environmental expertise, because it is precisely these areas that will spawn new businesses. In the future educational co-operation with other sectors should be increased regarding the application of ICT to machinery, goods, and industrial processes, teaching of procurement and skills required in international research, development and innovation (RDI), such as teaching of languages, cultures and marketing. This is a pilot study. In the future a systematic analysis should be carried out based on surveys designed to pinpoint the sectors main job tasks, their frequency and importance. The result of this study would be the specification of the main job categories and job profiles of professionals in this field. Experts in this sector could be asked to assess the changes going on in these areas. This information can be used to plan the future development of curricula and teacher training so that the new educational demands can be met.
L64|Competitiveness and future challenges of Pohjois-Savo - A report for The Regional Council of Pohjois-Savo (in Finnish with English abstract and summary)|The turnover of the companies in North Savo in 2011 was nearly 10 billion euros, of which industry accounted for just under a third. The industrial structure of the region is not strong, but on the other hand it is not alarmingly thin either, because it does have certain successful niches. North Savos production and export growth has been on par with the average of other regions. The region is specialized in forestry and machinery industries as well as food production. The forest and machinery industries are export-oriented. Promising growth businesses include biopharmaceutical research, testing and production. These segments will be the engines of growth for the region in the future. In the forest industry the wood products industry is strong and its special products, such as heat treated wood, glue-laminated timber and hardwood floors, are selling well. Pulp and paper production have suffered losses, but the carton is in demand. In the machinery industry, power plant boilers, forestry tractors and mining machinery are global successes. Their production networks include a considerable number of local sub-contractors. Counterflow strategies will be the key to future development. The forest industry will evolve into a biotechnology industry, where decentralized local bio-oil production instead of large plants will play a large role. Clusters can be built around wooden apartment buildings. The key skills of the machinery industry should be kept as Savos own secret, but the network of services and output should go global. In addition to timber, milk is one of the regions precious raw materials, the production of which should be safeguarded in the future. Research can facilitate processing of milk and timber into more lucrative products with higher value-added. Fresh, local and organic food production can be promoted via entrepreneurial training, product development, and use of competitive bidding in purchases of fresh food products by public institutions. Development of the pharmaceutical industry is following a dual strategy : the development of the biopharmaceutical industry is based on synergies and investing in research, entrepreneurship and the raising of risk capital. Neighbouring Russia is investing in the development of its pharmaceutical industry. Kuopios medical cluster could participate by helping in the development of medicines, approval process, manufacturing and packaging, as well as marketing to Western markets. Industrial development requires close-knit co-operation with government departments. The University of Eastern Finland, the Savonia University of Applied Sciences, vocational schools, research institutes and laboratories, Kuopio University Hospital and the Finnish Medicines Agency as well as authorities responsible for business development and funding are key players is this development.

L64|The contributions of warfare with Revolutionary and Napoleonic France to the consolidation and progress of the British industrial revolution|My essay surveys a range of printed secondary sources going back to publications of the day (and includes research in primary sources) in order to revive a traditional and unresolved debate on economic connexions between the French and Industrial Revolutions. It argues that, on balance, the costs flowing from the reallocation of labour capital and technical knowledge to wage warfare from 1793-1815 have been overstated in relation to the range of benefits analysed below that accrued from: crowding out a potential invasion by Napoleon’s armies; improvements to the skills and discipline of the workforce; the integration of Ireland into a national market; the accelerated diffusion of technologies associated with coal and iron; the circumvention of diminishing returns to agriculture and above all from a victory that left the Royal Navy with undisputed command of the oceans and the realm’s maritime sector, poised and ready to retain most of the gains from trade and servicing the international economy, obtained at the expense of rivals during these long wars with France. My conclusion is that the costs and benefits derived from participation in a global war from 1793 to 1815, that was integral to the era’s geopolitical and mercantilist international economic order could never be measured. But in the context and history of that order it is difficult to represent their outcome as anything other than positive and significant for the consolidation and progress of Britain’s famous transition to become Europe’s First Industrial nation.
L64|Foreign Manufacturing Multinationals and the Transformation of the Chinese Economy: New Measurements, New Perspectives|What is the relationship between foreign manufacturing multinational corporations (MNCs) and the expansion of indigenous technological and managerial technological capabilities among Chinese firms? China has been remarkably successful in designing industrial policies, joint venture requirements, and technology transfer pressures to use FDI to create indigenous national champions in a handful of prominent sectors: high speed rail transport, information technology, auto assembly, and an emerging civil aviation sector. But what is striking in the aggregate data is how relatively thin the layer of horizontal and vertical spillovers from foreign manufacturing multinationals to indigenous Chinese firms has proven to be. Despite the large size of manufacturing FDI inflows, the impact of multinational corporate investment in China has been largely confined to building plants that incorporate capital, technology, and managerial expertise controlled by the foreigner. As the skill-intensity of exports increases, the percentage of the value of the final product that derives from imported components rises sharply. China has remained a low value-added assembler of more sophisticated inputs imported from abroad--a “workbench” economy. Where do the gains from FDI in China end up? While manufacturing MNCs may build plants in China, the largest impact from deployment of worldwide earnings is to bolster production, employment, R&D, and local purchases in their home markets. For the United States the most recent data show that US-headquartered MNCs have 70 percent of their operations, make 89 percent of their purchases, spend 87 percent of their R&D dollars, and locate more than half of their workforce within the US economy--this is where most of the earnings from FDI in China are delivered.

L64|Kilpailukyky ja globaalin toimintaympäristön muutos - Suomen koneteollisuus maailmantaloudessa|The report analyses the impacts of globalization on competitiveness of national economies, industries and firms. The focus is in mechanical and electrical engineering and machinery. Global division of labor has significantly changed over the past few decades when the large emerging economies notably China have increased their role in worlds industrial production. Prices of industrial goods relative to GDP prices of developed countries have been falling thereby pressing the price competitiveness of industrial-country- firms who have been looking for new competitive edge on the global market. This includes offshoring and outsourcing and moving to service provision. The Finnish mechanical and engineering industry has adapted to changing global competitive environment through major structural changes the firm and plant structures have changed as consequence of exits and major reallocation of resources from less productive to higher productive units.

L64|Detecting Illegal Arms Trade|We propose a method to detect illegal arms trade based on investor knowledge. We focus on countries under arms embargo and identify events that suddenly increase or decrease conflict intensity. If a weapon-making company is trading illegally, an event that increases the demand for arms may increase stock prices. We find positive event returns for companies headquartered in countries with high corruption and low transparency in arms trade. We also suggest a method to detect potential embargo violations based on chains of reactions by individual stocks. The presumed violations positively correlate with the number of UN investigations and Internet stories. (JEL D74, F13, G14, K42, L64)
L64|The Role of Trust and Risk Aversion in Farmers' Used Machinery Transactions| Results of a nationally representative survey of US farmers link previously validated survey measures of risk aversion and interpersonal trust to farmers’ intended use of online venues for transacting used equipment. Other factors affecting online purchase propensity includes the quality of farmers’ relationships with local equipment dealerships. Understanding the factors that impact farmers’ use of internet market venues is crucial as rural internet penetration deepens, farm equipment needs grow more specialized and local offline markets thin. These results may also help explain past observations of severe discounting of used farm equipment sold in online venues.
L64|The Impact of Terrorism on the Defence Industry|This paper analyses the impact of terrorism on Israeli companies related to the defence, security or anti‐terrorism industries, relative to its impact on other companies. We match every Israeli company to the American company with the closest expected return among all the companies that belong to the same industry and trade in the same market, in order to isolate the effect of terrorism from other common industry shocks. The findings show that whereas terrorism had a significant negative impact of 5% on non‐defence‐related companies, it had a significantly positive overall effect of 7% on defence‐related companies.
L64|Does Productivity Differ in Domestic and Foreign Firms? Evidence from the Indian Machinery Industry|This study aims to evaluate the productivity performance of foreign and domestic firms of the machinery industry in India. Using information of more than 200 firms of three sub-industries namely electrical, electronics and non-electrical, we compare both types of firms’ total factor productivity (TFP) for the period of 1994-2006. At the first stage, our empirical analysis utilizes a non-parametric approach based on the principle of first order stochastic dominance. Comparing the distributions of the measures of firms’ performance across the groups, we find that the distributions for foreign firms dominate that of domestically owned Indian firms in two industries. In the next stage, the study estimates determinants of productivity growth of firms. The results of our analysis suggest that in the electrical industry foreign ownership matters, however, in other two industries there is no significant difference between both types of firms. The results also reveal that those firms which import and have in-house R&D facilities are more productive. Finally, the role of public infrastructure is found to be vital in the firms’ productivity growth for the sample of industries considered.
L64|Relationship between Efficiency Level of Working Capital Management and Profitability of Firms in the Textile Sector of Pakistan|The main aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between working capital management (WCM) and firm’s profitability in the textile sector of Pakistan. WCM plays an important role in firm’s financial management decisions. An optimal WCM is expected to contribute positively to the creation of firm’s value and enhancement of its profitability. Working capital, fixed assets’ cost, Cost of production, cost of debt (interest expense), and size (capital) of the firm as control variables are also used to investigate their effect on profitability (net income). A sample size of 55 textile companies in Pakistan has been selected for a period of six years, from 2003 to 2008. The relationship between WCM efficiency and profitability is examined using correlation, regression analyses and ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) test. The results show a strong positive significant relationship between WCM and firm’s profitability in Pakistan’s textile sector. In case of control variables, it is found that there is a significant relationship between working capital, fixed assets’ cost, cost of production, and size (capital) and profitability. However, results show a significant negative relationship between debt used by the firm and its profitability. The findings enhance the knowledge base of WCM and will help companies to manage working capital efficiently. Moreover, it will help the policy makers and decision making authorities to better orient themselves towards considering and adopting efficient ways of managing working capital.
L64|Development of Dynamic and Comparative Functions of Estimation of Innovative Potential|Questions of the rate fixing of different indexes of work of industrial enterprises are considered in the article. Special attention is paid to indexes which form the separate constituents of the innovative potential of machine manufacturing enterprises. The author offers two different approaches to the setting of norms for indexes of work in enterprises, the use of which will have a considerable economic effect in practice.
L64|The Impact of Vertical Integration and Outsourcing on Firm Efficiency: Evidence from the Italian Machine Tool Industry|In this paper we made use of an econometric approach to efficiency analysis in order to capture the role of vertical integration and outsourcing on firm's efficiency. Vertical integration is considered an indicator of structure, while outsourcing represents the process of its change. We consider inefficiency measures as indicators of organizational heterogeneity, related to the firm's choices regarding the phases of the production process that are under its control. We find support for the hypothesis of a relationship between vertical integration and efficiency. The results on outsourcing activity, and in particular the interaction between outsourcing and vertical structure, indicate that heterogeneous patterns, far from tending to cancel out each other as a consequence of common external changes, are reinforcing. Moreover, the sensitivity of inefficiency variance to the cycle, indicate that different firms may have different dynamic properties.
L64|The Estimation of Technical Efficiency Effects Models with an Example Applied to the Thai Manufacturing Sector| This paper does two things. First, it presents alternative approaches to the standard methods of estimating productive efficiency using a production function. It favours a parametric approach (viz. the stochastic production frontier approach) over a nonparametric approach (e.g. data envelopment analysis); and, further, one that provides a statistical explanation of efficiency, as well as an estimate of its magnitude. Second, it illustrates the favoured approach (i.e. the â€˜single stage procedureâ€™) with estimates of two models of explained inefficiency, using data from the Thai manufacturing sector, after the crisis of 1997. Technical efficiency is modelled as being dependent on capital investment in three major areas (viz. land, machinery and office appliances) where land is intended to proxy the effects of unproductive, speculative capital investment; and both machinery and office appliances are intended to proxy the effects of productive, non-speculative capital investment. The estimates from these models cast new light on the five-year long, post-1997 crisis period in Thailand, suggesting a structural shift from relatively labour intensive to relatively capital intensive production in manufactures from 1998 to 2002.
L64|Industry structure and innovation in the U.K defense sector|The defense industry in the United Kingdom has experienced significant structural change since the end of the Cold War. Consolidation has occurred and overseas suppliers have entered while some domestic prime contractors have exited. The implications of consolidation for innovation have been studied in the U.S. environment but much less so in the case of Britain. In this article we report briefly on the changes to structure and review the theory and empirical evidence that suggests how such change might be related to innovation. Firms’ own-financed R&D in British defense industry is proposed as a useful indicator of innovation activity and is observed to have fallen sharply. Possible explanations are sought in the recently-revived inverted-U hypothesis linking competition to innovation, and in government demand fluctuations and British defense procurement reforms. The authors caution against government taking policy action to influence industry structure until more and better data are available to analyze the potential consequences. Investigating in-contract incentives to encourage industry innovation are recommended as a possible alternative.
L64|A new arms race? The political economy of maritime military modernization in the Asia-Pacific|During the 2000s, navies in the Asia-Pacific region have experienced a significant, if not unprecedented, bout of naval expansion. This buildup has been quantitative, but more importantly, qualitative as well, and in many cases goes beyond mere modernization. It has been driven by both rising regional defense spending and by an increasingly competitive arms business, which is resulting in the export of some of the most advanced types of weaponry. Regional military modernization activities are intended to increase national deterrent and defensive capabilities, but the process of mutual, reciprocated arming with increasingly advanced conventional weapons can also lead to costly arms competitions, perhaps draining resources from other, more pressing social needs. It also contains the kernel of a classic security dilemma, whereby such arming can actually undermine that very security it was intended to improve.
L64|Supply Chain Cooperatives in Taiwan's Machine Tool Industry|Increasingly sophisticated machinery, short product life-cycles, and demanding user requirements have increased competition in the machine tool market. Because all machine tool companies have limited resources, they must seek competitive advantages. Strategic collaborations have become particularly important to Taiwanese machine tool manufacturers, who increasingly seek to integrate the upstream, midstream, and downstream parts of their supply chains. To evaluate modern SCM in the machine tool industry, one must consider the entire process, including the initial cooperative stage, the middle stage of supply-chain strategy, and the final performance evaluation stage. This study has used questionnaires to collect quantitative data regarding machine tool companies located in the central area of Taiwan. Further, this study has applied theories of transaction cost, resource base, and organizational learning to analyze the performance of SCM in Taiwan¡¦s machine tool industry. The analysis involves cooperative types, abilities, and strategies as intermediary factors. Results show that the cooperative type has significant impact on SCM effectiveness and strategy, and the mutual influences of cooperative ability and type positively affect the performance of SCM.
L64|Internationalization process of Russian construction industry: Inward investments perspective|Inward investments as the cornerstone of the entry mode choice are still considered a frontier issue within the field of internationalization – as judged from the academic interest as well as from the numerous articles published in scientific journals. Despite considerable progress in later years in formulation of theories, many weaknesses still exist within this field. A further development of theory is therefore needed. Nowadays emerging markets show the greatest activity in the field of internationalization, e.g the Russian market, which is considered by most potential entrants as a huge opportunity. The methods of entry and models of operations of international contractors in the Russian market, based on the investment decisions, are investigated in this paper.
