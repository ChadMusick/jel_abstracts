P39|FDI in Selected Developing Countries: Evidence from Bundling and Unbundling Governance|The objective of this study is to assess governance drivers of FDI in a panel of BRICS and MINT countries for the period 2001-2011. We bundle and unbundle governance determinants using a battery of contemporary and non-contemporary estimation techniques. Our findings reveal the following: Firstly, for both contemporary and non-contemporary specifications, while the majority of our governance determinants of Gross FDI are significant, they are overwhelmingly insignificant for Net FDI. Secondly, the significance of the governance dynamics in increasing order of magnitude are general governance, political governance, economic governance, political stability, regulation quality and government effectiveness. Thirdly, for non-contemporary specifications, the significance of governance variables is as follows in ascending order of magnitude: economic governance, institutional governance, general governance, corruption-control, political governance and political stability. The importance of combining governance indicators is captured by the effects of political governance, economic governance and institutional governance. The results indicate that the simultaneous implementation of the various components of governance clarifies a countryâ€™s attractiveness for FDI location. Policy implications are discussed with particular emphasis on the timing of FDI and its targeting.

P39|The Slow growth of Foreign Direct Investment in Central African Republic|Large amounts of foreign direct investment have been attracted by many African countries. Yet the Central African Republic is by far less attractive in the perspective of potential investors. The aim of this paper is to investigate the slow inflows and growth of FDI in the country. In the short-run and long-run we found out that the Gross Domestic Product growth, the domestic credit to private sector, the electricity production and the quality of public administration are not significant. The Error Correction Mechanism is significant at 0.05 which demonstrates that the speed of adjustment of the model from short-run to long-run is about 46%. It is very important for Central African Republic to renovate the national electricity supply company by increasing the hydro- electric production.
P39|The effect of Western TV on crime: Evidence from East Germany|This paper explores the potential causal influence of Western television programming on crime rates. We exploit a natural experiment involving access to West German TV within the German Democratic Republic (GDR) in which only geography and topography determined the allocation of individuals to treatment and control groups. Focusing on violent and property crime (as these domains were most likely to be affected by the marked differences in TV content), we find that in the post-reunification decade in which TV content was harmonized, regions that had access to Western TV broadcasts prior to the reunification experienced lower rates of violent crime, sex crime, and theft, but more fraud.
P39|Media content's role in the making of a democrat: Evidence from East Germany|This paper explores the causal infl uence of access to Western television programming on voting behavior. We exploit a natural experiment involving access to West German TV within the German Democratic Republic in which only geography and topography determined the allocation of individuals to treatment and control groups. Focusing on both the shares of extremist parties and voter turnout, we find that in the post-reuni cation decade in which TV content was harmonized, regions that already had access to Western TV broadcasts before reunification experience lower vote shares of extremist parties and higher voter turnout.
P39|China's Decentralized Privatization and Change of Control Rights|A distinct feature of China's privatization is that its design and implementation are decentralized and administered by the local governments. Based on a proprietary survey dataset containing 3,000 firms in over 200 cities, this paper studies how city governments choose among various privatization methods, how these methods transfer control rights, and how they influence privatization outcomes. We find that less political opposition to labor downsizing and greater fiscal capacity prompt cities to choose direct sales to insiders (MBOs) as their privatization method. This method transfers the most control rights to private owners, retains the least government supports and is associated with most hardened budget constraints, restructure most effectively, and achieves the greatest performance improvement.
P39|Migration and (Macro) Economic Risksâ€“Romania s Case|Migration is one of the predominant phenomena in debating core issues of politics, economy and society at the beginning of the 21st century. In order to understand the complexity of this phenomenon, it is necessary to investigate its main determinants that maintained from historical perspective some of the characteristics from the beginning of the 20th century; however, at increased complexity, in the context of constant changes of geopolitical and economic regional configurations. The European enlargement towards the central and eastern part of the continent brought about also changes regarding increased demographic and economic risks in the absence of global migration governance, but also due to the frailty of national institutions in the field of migration and labor market. The paper intends to briefly enumerate main (macro)economic and demographic risks for Romania by underpinning the contribution of institutional factors to improving the management of this phenomenon at national level.
P39|De communismi legibus|An economic model of how a Marxist state should work
P39|The Healthcare System and the Hidden Traps of ITS Logistics|The analysis of the society development is more complex than one might think at first glance. So is the market. There are angles and activities not easy to see and one needs high capabilities and strength to look beyond the appearances and notice whatâ€™s not visible. One of the grey areas is linked to the crossing boarder sectors that no men land between legal and black activities; this territory is very vivid and actions and profits are higher than ever can one imagine. This side of the economy has its tentacles piercing the legal boarder of the sound economy and functions through movements that effect all sectors and activities pushing to get huge black profits. Romanian health sector makes no exception. The wish to getting higher and higher profits doesnâ€™t go with performing and satisfactory management when the corporate liaisons are oriented more on discussions and less on integrative quality and satisfaction of people concerned; thus the so called guys in white coats are necessarily oriented to another sort of motivation â€“ linked to networked process of getting black money and laundering it through the backing support of the informal more than legal procedures. The loss is always paid by individuals and community as: fewer funds from taxes, stratified salaries caused subjective application of norms and procedures, decreased labour quality, inappropriate economic behaviour, losses in the robustness of the future generations. Through such channels, the informal economy last running building up a strong logistic that develops parallel activities, utterly designed to respect specific customs based on gestural understanding and communication that encourage the unfairness, the aggressiveness in competition and hot money/short run investments. This paper intends to catch some of the general aspects of what black and informal economy can carry out, through procedures that use the imperfect legal methodology decision and its implementation into informal possibility to fraud both the public funds and peoples savings. The present paper touches also the public consequences of the undeclared work of employees of public and private sectors. This paper seeks to emphasise also the need to identifying some specific roles to play in the future by the services business planning, the law application and the policy of autonomy to help the medical market blossom vigorously. In conclusion, we imply that the fair action is not an alternative conception of developing, in the fashion neither of human evolution nor of need-based growth. There is a higher need to model individual awareness and motivation in the direction of increasing the self-responsibility for building a better environment based on a proactive personal development, from within and connected to the outer world. In conclusion, we sustain that the fair action is not an alternative conception of developing, in the fashion neither of human evolution nor of need-based growth. There is a higher need to model individual awareness and motivation in the direction of increasing the self-responsibility for building a better environment based on a proactive personal development, from within and connected to the outer world.
P39|Drivers of FDI in Fast Growing Developing Countries: Evidence from Bundling and Unbundling Governance|We assess drivers of FDI in a panel of BRICS and MINT countries for the period 2001-2011. We bundle and unbundle governance determinants using a battery of contemporary and non-contemporary estimation techniques. The following findings are established. First, for both contemporary and non-contemporary specifications, while determinants for gross FDI are significant, they are not for net FDI. Second, for contemporary specifications, the significance of the governance dynamics is as follows in increasing order of magnitude: general governance, political governance, economic governance, political stability, regulation quality and government effectiveness. The motivation to bundle governance variables is articulated by the effect of political governance. Third, for non-contemporary specifications, the significance of governance variables is as follows in ascending order of magnitude: economic governance, institutional governance, general governance, corruption-control, political governance and political stability. The importance of combining governance indicators is captured by the effects of political governance, economic governance and institutional governance.

P39|Institutional effects on economic performance in post-socialist transition: A dynamic panel analysis|This article uses dynamic panel analysis to investigate the relationship between institutional improvement and economic performance in 29 transition countries. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we find that per capita GDP is determined by the entire history of institutional reform under transition and that, conditional on this history, per capita GDP adjusts to recent institutional changes. Moreover, we find that the time-horizon over which we measure institutional change matters, with five-year changes showing the clearest effects on current levels of per capita GDP. Secondly, we address the pronounced methodological heterogeneity of this literature. To compensate for incomplete theoretical guidance from the institutional literature, we draw upon an institutional meta-regression analysis to inform our model specification. Our analysis covers the period 1992–2007.

P39|Exposure to television and individual beliefs: Evidence from a natural experiment|Does the information provided by mass media have the power to persistently affect individual beliefs about the drivers of success in life? To answer this question empirically, this contribution exploits a natural experiment on the reception of West German television in the former German Democratic Republic. After identifying the impact of Western television on individual beliefs and attitudes in the late 1980s, longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel is used to test the persistence of the television effect on individual beliefs during the 1990s. The empirical findings indicate that Western television exposure has made East Germans more inclined to believe that effort rather than luck determines success in life. Furthermore, this effect still persists several years after the German reunification.
P39|Comparative Analysis of Local and Foreign Banks Efficiency: A Case Study of Pakistan|Purpose – The core objective of this study is to measure the relative efficiency of domestic and foreign banks operating in Pakistan and secondly to emphasize on the basic factors which badly influence the efficiency of banks. The comparative efficiency of sample banks is estimated through application of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The Banker, Charnes and Cooper (BCC) model was used for the measurement of input oriented efficiency and Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes (CCR) model was used for the estimation of output oriented efficiency. The first stage of findings indicates that foreign banks are more efficient in minimization of inputs compared to local banks. The results at the second stage also show that foreign banks are more efficient than local counterparts in maximization of outputs. Finally, the third stage indicates that under benchmarking, the National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) and Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) remained the best performing and standard of excellence for the other banks.
P39|Ceremonial Science: The State of Russian Economics Seen Through the Lens of the Work of ‘Doctor of Science’ Candidates|The paper investigates the current status of economic research in Russia using a previously unexplored dataset of Russian ‘Doctor of Science’ (Dr. Sc.) theses. The Dr. Sc. degree is a postdoctoral qualification necessary for career advancement at most Russian universities. Thus, by looking at the Dr. Sc. theses we are able to provide a systematic overview of ‘average’ scientific standards in Russia, particularly at the mass universities at which most administrators and bureaucrats are trained. We show that the level of integration of Russian economics into the international scientific community remains very low. Moreover, we obtain a picture of a mostly ‘ceremonial’ science. Researchers combine references to ‘classical’ research, formal methods and practical application merely as an instrument for presenting the mostly verbal argument in a more scientific’ way.
P39|Democratic Ideal and Democratic Institution ??Study on Mihailo Marlcovic?s Democracy Thought|In the democratic history, there are inner conflicts always between democratic institution and democratic ideal. It is due to the inherent ideal dimension of democracy that each democratic society is inherent imbalanced regardless of which in history or in reality.Mihailo Marlcovic?the philosopher of Yugoslavia Praxis Group, in the view of constructing people?s genuine relationship,he reflected upon what the connotation of democratic ideal is.He argued the deviation between the democratic institution and the democratic ideal, as well as the hazard of this deviation.At the same time; he explored the possible ways to integrate these two democratic dimensions. His research is a significant contribution to nowaday democratic society?s development.
P39|'Safety Crime' in Neoliberal Post-communist Society: The collapse of the Maxima supermarket in Riga, Latvia|The causes of disaster, both immediate and underlying, that resulted in 54 fatalities in Riga in November 2013 are analyzed in this paper. The collapse of the Maxima supermarket is seen as a safety failure resulting from longer-term deregulation in Latvia encouraged by external advisors such as the World Bank and the EU, and the specific crisis-induced drive to minimize regulation by local political actors, especially in the aftermath of ongoing austerity. The paper raises the issue of what is a ‚safety crime‘ in the context of post-communist Baltic states, and asks whether the notion of ‚corporate killing‘ or corporate manslaughter is applicable to the circumstances of the disaster. The paper suggests the need to establish accountability for social harms caused by the unfettered pursuit of private profit over public safety.

P39|Motivation to Work in Russia: The Case of Protracted Transition from Noncompetitive to Competitive System|This paper aims to determine what challenges Russia faces upon transitioning to a competitive system. As a main characteristic of the labour force, the motivation to work is studied in terms of three dimensions: 1) the value of current work, 2) orientation to a potential job, and 3) aspirations with respect to work. Analysis revealed the existence in Russia of homogeneous groups of workers, in terms of their motivation; this status quo is typical of both late-industrial and postindustrial societies. The author therefore argues for the complexity of ‘competitive areas’ and the simplicity of ‘noncompetitiveness’ in contemporary Russia. Meanwhile, the socioeconomic limitations to the proliferation of intrinsic and nonhygiene motivations on the one hand, and the predominance of monetary and extrinsic motivations on the other, provide evidence that one should consider Russia a country in protracted transition.
P39|The shadows of the socialist past: Lack of self-reliance hinders entrepreneurship|We provide empirical evidence that the experience of a socialist regime leads to a lack of self-reliance by comparing East and West Germans conditional on regional differences in current economic development. This meaningful lack of self-reliance persists after the regime's breakdown and hinders the development of an entrepreneurial spirit, which might hamper the transition process. Since East Germany adopted the formal institutions of a market economy quasi overnight when reunifying with West Germany, we avoid simultaneity issues regarding current institutions and preferences. Further tentative evidence suggests that the socialist regime also affected the composition of the East German population by inducing selective migration before the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961.
P39|Modeling transition in Central Asia: the Case of Kazakhstan|This paper presents a small macro-econometric model of Kazakhstan to study the impact of various economic policies. It uses a new approach to test the existence of a level relationship between a dependent variable and a set of regressors, when the characteristics of the regressors??? non-stationarity are not known with certainty. The simulations provide insights into the role of a tight monetary policy, higher foreign direct investment, and rises in nominal wages and in crude oil prices. The results obtained are in line with economic observations and give some support to the policies chosen as priority targets by the Kazakh authorities for the forthcoming years.
P39|Land market in Russian agriculture: institutes’ transformation and practice|TIn this publication the author analyzes land turnover through institutes’ transformation and their impact on transaction costs. The paper provides analysis of farm lands classification and gives reasons in favor of transition from category of land to a plot of land, taking into consideration suitability of each of them for one or another purpose. The author addresses the issue of setting aside plots of farm lands depending on the types of authorized use and inter-settlement zoning.
P39|The Shadows of the Past - How Implicit Institutions Influence Entrepreneurship|This paper investigates the impact of implicit institutions on the decision to become an entrepreneur. Implicit institutions are here defined as mindsets that have developed as the result of norms and traditions and we expect they will have an influence on risk attitudes and opportunity recognition. We conduct a natural experiment based on Germany's recent history and compare individuals born and raised in the former socialist East Germany (GDR) with their West Germany (FRG) counterparts. Our analysis confirms the expected difference in values between individuals from East and West Germany and also shows that these differences influence the probability of being self-employed. In the process of our analysis, we also sketch the ongoing economical transition process in East Germany, which severely disturbs a proper analysis of the institutional differences from a macro-perspective.
P39|Vietnamese Local State-owned Enterprises (SOEs) at the Crossroads: Implications of SOE Restructuring at the Local Level|This paper aims to capture the changing features of local SOEs under the nationalSOE restructuring program in the 2000s. The national policy on SOE reform in thisphase had an effect of considerably clarifying and narrowing down the raison d'êtreof SOEs, which has been put into practice at the local level through provincial masterplans. Consequently, some signs of an important change are observed: the structureof the local SOE sector is being standardized to a certain extent, and the remaininglocal SOEs are becoming more geared to the needs of a market economy. Thistrend would have far-reaching implications for the policy implementation and publicservice delivery by localities, which in turn would affect the long-term developmentof non-state sectors.
P39|Social capital, Chinese style: individualism, relational collectivism and the cultural embeddedness of the institutions-performance link|China is the odd man out in the research on social capital and economic performance. A brief survey of recent World Values Survey data depicts China to be a high-trust, achievement oriented society, which does not fit into popular pictures of rampant corruption and abuses of power. I argue that one difficulty results from methodological issues in research on social capital, where a universally accepted theory of social capital is lacking, including theoretically grounded methods of measurement. These resulting applications often generalize a Western notion of civil society as a benchmark, implicitely. I propose that social capital has to be conveived as a context-bound intermediate level theoretical term, putting methodological arguments by Durlauf (economics) and Little (Chinese studies) together. The resulting empirical method is that of triangulation across different disciplines, combining emic and etic approaches. I present an application on the notorious phenomenon of guanxi in China, which results into their re-conceptualization as Ego-centric networking and relational collectivism, based on a culturally specific framing of affectual aspects of social relations. With this notion of culturally specific social capital, we can better understand the relation between institutions and economic performance in China.
P39|Household specialisation and gender equality in transition. Paid and unpaid work of women and men in Soviet and post-Soviet Taganrog|Using unique survey data from the Russian industrial city Taganrog in 1989 and 1998, we analyse changes in the gender division of labour among gainfully employed women and men, pre- and post-transition. In Soviet Taganrog, dual earner families predominated, but nevertheless men were usually primary earners, while women did the bulk of housework. After transition, contrary to early predictions, aggregate female and male employment rates have declined to a similar extent but the time-use data indicate increased gender specialisation among the employed .Thus, the dual earner norm mainly remains but the pre-existing gender difference within it has increased considerably, particularly among couples with pre-school children.
P39|Educational inputs and outcomes before the transition from communism|Conventional wisdom suggests that the stocks of human capital were one of the few positive legacies from communism. However, if factories under communism were so inefficient, why would the education system not have been? Using the education production function approach and new data on educational inputs and outcomes from 1960 to 1989, we find evidence suggesting that the official human capital stocks figures were ‘overestimated’ during the communist period. In other words, we find that the official human capital stock numbers are significantly higher than those predicted not only in relation to countries at similar levels of development, but also on the basis of educational systems with comparable features and efficiency levels.

P39|Gender and time allocation differences in Taganrog, Russia|Data from a time-use survey made in 1997 and 1998 for the city of Taganrog, Russia, is used to analyse the socio-economic determinants of allocation of time and the gender division of housework among mar-ried/cohabiting couples. The main objective of this essay is to identify and assess the impact of a range of socio-economic factors expected to influence the gender division of labour and the time devoted to household activi-ties. The reasons why men and women allocate time differently may be ascribed to efficiency aspects, relative bargaining power, normative and/or discriminatory factors. The results of our estimations suggest that variables such as having children (age 0-12), household income and share of labour income affect the time women spend on housework to a larger extent than men. Furthermore, male education seems to affect both men and women, whereas the education of women has little importance. Thus it seems probable that efficiency factors alone do not suffice to explain the gender differences in time allocation. Our results are to a large extent in line with pre-vious research and do not indicate that Russia differs from Western experience more than Western countries differ among themselves. Gender differences in time allocation show the same pattern over countries and regions even if societies may differ in many other aspects.
P39|The interplay of legal and social norms and the failure of the bank credit market in Bulgaria|We take up the widely held view that the observed discrepancy between law on the books and law in action has prevented economic transition and investigate its role for the failure of the Bulgarian credit market. In doing so, we focus on the role of injunctive informal institutions which have become internalized in the course of social development. Based on cross-cultural psychology, we show that a particular bundle of fundamental social norms which constitute basic value orientations have both prevented the development of stabilizing regulations and an overall compliance with prevailing laws.
P39|Transformation of the Rice Marketing System and Myanmar's Transition to a Market Economy|Creating a rice marketing system has been one of the central policy issues in Myanmar's move to a market economy since the end of the 1980s. Two liberalizations of rice marketing were implemented in 1987 and 2003. This paper examines the essential aspects of the liberalizations and the subsequent transformation of Myanmar's rice marketing sector. It attempts to bring into clearer focus the rationale of the government's rice marketing reforms which is to maintain a stable supply of rice at a low price to consumers. Under this rationale, however, the state rice marketing sector continued to lose efficiency while the private sector was allowed to develop on condition that it did not jeopardize the rationale of stable supply at low price. The paper concludes that the prospect for the future development of the private rice marketing sector is dim since a change in the rice market's rationale is unlikely. Private rice exporting is unlikely to be permitted, while the domestic market is approaching the saturation point. Thus, there is little momentum for the private rice sector to undertake any substantial expansion of investment.

P39|Rethinking the Economic Performance of Chinese Special Economic Zones|Beginning with the 1979 open-door policy, China began its transition from a planned to market economy. Special Economic Zones (SEZ), the first step toward an open door policy, were established. Although Shenzhen, as a representative of SEZ, is widely known for excellent outputs, we do not altogether agree that Chinese economic growth was heavily induced by the development of SEZ. The objectives of this paper are to analyze the economic performance of each SEZ, to explain that China's economic performance relied not only on unbalanced development policy but also on initial conditions, and to prove the role of continuous and increasing open-door policy in Chinese economic growth. This paper closely analyzed economic performance of all SEZ (Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, Xiamen, and Hannan) from 1980 to 2002 and found the following conclusions: 1) economic development of SEZ are more affected by location and initial conditions instead of a special policy; 2) the effect of SEZ to economic growth is not known; 3) widely performed open door policy revealed a bigger effect to economic growth than development of SEZ. Therefore the effect of the SEZ to economic growth was restricted considerably, and the growth of the Chinese economy is feasible by continuous and stepped up open-door policy
P39|Trends in China's Special Economic Zones and Suggestions for Korean Economy|China's Special Economic Zones (SEZs) have been entering a new development stage after China's entry into WTO. China has been developing 'China's economic development model', in which SEZs have ideally been combined with FDIs. China's SEZs concentrated in the east coastal region geographically, specialized in secondary industry, and put in practice many important favourable policies. China's SEZs also play an important role in regional development with the growth pole. At the time of entering the WTO, China's SEZs have been faced with new changes. This paper analyses this new change in China's SEZs, and considers the effect to Korea in the view of policy. In the past ten years, Korea has acquired a better development in the field of economic cooperation. The industrial structure of the two countries has become more and more closed. Especially, the FDI cooperation of the past ten years mostly concentrated on China's SEZs. From the view of country's spatial division, Korea needs to adjust FDI its strategy more diversely in investment regions and industries, and it needs more joint cooperation.
P39|Is Tomorrow Another Day? The Labor Supply of New York City Cab Drivers|I model the labor supply of taxi drivers as the result of optimization based on an inter-temporal utility function. Since income effects in response to temporary fluctuations in daily earnings opportunities are likely to be small, cumulative hours will be much more important than cumulative income in the decision to stop work on a given day. However, if these income effects are large due to very high discount and interest rates, then labor supply functions could be backward bending, and, in the extreme case where the wage elasticity of daily labor supply is minus one, drivers could be target earners. Indeed, Camerer, Babcock, Lowenstein, and Thaler (1997) and Chou (2000) find that the daily wage elasticity of labor supply of New York City cab drivers is substantially negative and conclude that it is likely that cab drivers are target earners. I conclude from my empirical analysis, based on new data, of the stopping behavior of New York City cab drivers that, when accounting for earnings opportunities in a reduced form with measures of clock hours, day of the week, weather, and geographic location, cumulative hours worked on the shift is a primary determinant of the likelihood of stopping work while cumulative income earned on the shift is weakly related, at best, to the likelihood of stopping work. This is consistent with there being inter-temporal substitution and inconsistent with the hypothesis that taxi drivers are target earners.
P39|Cambios institucionales en la economía rusa: de las reformas de mercado a la consolidación monetaria|The main characteristic of the transition from a planned to a market economy in Russia has been the barter economy. Firms are using non-monetary transactions as a result of the scarcity of the means of payment and as a means to avoid taxes and reduce fiscal obligations. The barter economy is a rational mechanism of survival and protection from new market reforms, and for taking advantage of the networks inheritated from the centralized period. This non-monetary functioning of the Russian economy has increased the costs of the economic system and new market economy reforms concentrated on monetary consolidation haven’t produced the expected results, because public polices were not credible and policy makers didn’t anticipate the appearance of new firms in the transition period.

P39|Change the Regime ??? Change the Money: Bulgarian Banknotes, 1885-2001|The money we use has symbols and images on it that communicate information. One part of this are pictorial and symbolic elements that draw attention to aspects of the country that issuer is proud of and that convey the message that it wishes to convey. As one would expect, as regimes change, so do the banknotes. Bulgaria has a rich history of change having gone from being a (nominally) Ottoman principality to an independent Kingdom, an agrarian socialist state, a quasi-fascist Monarchy, a People???s Republic, and most recently, a Parliamentary Republic.
P39|Unemployment, Labour Market Programmes and Wage Determination: Evidence from the Czech and Slovak Republics|This paper studies effects of unemployment and labour market programmes on real wages in the Czech and Slovak Republics using district paneldata for the period 1992-1998. Clear wage exists in both countries. The estimated unemployment elasticity of pay is, however, higher in the Slovak Republic, than in the Czech Republic. The wage subsidy and the public works programme exert upward pressure on real wages in Slovakia. When accounting for effects from adjacent districts, a positive significant effect of labour market programmes is also estimated for the Czech Republic.

P39|A Long Way to Go: The Hungarian science and technology policy in transition|Central European countries highlight the importance of institutions as they are of somewhat different nature in this diverse group of countries, given their different history. Briefly, before World War II there was a market economy in place in Central Europe – as opposed to most Eastern European countries and former Soviet republics – based on private property. These economies were linked to the wider European economic space via foreign trade, subsidiaries of, and joint ventures with, foreign firms operating there and subsidiaries of Central European firms active abroad. Then they went through the planned economy period and right now the transition process. As three rather distinct socio-economic systems and their impacts on the national system(s) of innovation can be observed in these cases, it is a ‘living’ laboratory where evolving institutions, including re-emerging old ones, can be explored. Thus it seems worthwhile studying these cases in-depth as they might provide a number of important, perhaps eye-opening, lessons for more general theorising. This chapter analyses institutional changes in Hungary from the point of view of science and technology (S&T) policy by pulling together some recent theoretical developments in the economics of innovation and a fairly descriptive approach. The underlying question is whether it is possible to devise a coherent, feasible S&T policy and implement it in an efficient – or at least a satisfactory – way in a transition economy, or whether S&T policy, together with other major institutions, is also evolving. In other words, is S&T policy an outcome of conscious, well-designed and co-ordinated efforts in this period (can it be?), or should it be seen as a resultant of deliberate and unintended consequences of actions and interactions of a host of actors? Theories and models of innovation as theoretical foundations for S&T policy are briefly outlined in section 2. Then section 3 describes the legacy of central planning in Hungary. Recent changes in the science and technology system are analysed in section 4, and policy conclusions are presented in the final section.

P39|A nonprofit szervezetek szerepe a kilencvenes évek magyar társadalmában és gazdaságában<BR>[Roles played by the nonprofit organizations in the Hungarian economy and society in the 1990s]|A magyarországi nonprofit szektor 1989 óta bekövetkezett gyors növekedése bonyolult jelenség, benne a gazdaság több különböző szereplőjének törekvései összegeződnek. Ezek a törekvések nem mindig mutatnak egy irányba, s ennek megfelelően a nonprofit szervezetek is nagyon sokfélék, és sok különböző funkció betöltésére vállalkoznak. Egymás mellett működnek a civil társadalom szervezetei és a nagy állami alapítványok, az adománygyűjtők és az adományosztók, az érdekvédők és a szolgáltatók, a néhány ezer forintból gazdálkodó kicsi és a százmilliók fölött rendelkező óriás szervezetek. A tanulmány arra tesz kísérletet, hogy a szektort a maga komplexitásában, mint a helyzetből fakadó kihívásokra adott intézményes társadalmi választ tekintse át, szembesítse a statisztikai tényeket a szakmai közvéleményben élő hitekkel és tévhitekkel, s ezzel hozzájáruljon egy valóságbarát nonprofit szabályozás és támogatás-politika megalapozásához.
P39|The Second Economy and the Destabilizing Effect of Its Growth on the State Economy in the Soviet Union, 1965-1989|The authors suggest that the rapid growth of the illegal underground economy in 1970s and 1980s has destabilized the Soviet state economy and weakened the mechanism of central planning. This hypothesis is advanced on the basis of the examination of striking decline in income (legal) elasticities of demand for a number of consumer goods purchased in state retail trade in Russia and Ukraine. The growth of income from illegal sources and purchases of consumer goods in black markets explains this phenomenon.
P39|Why Did the Soviet Economic System Collapse: Two Schools of Thought|The paper examines two prevalent schools of thought explaining the deterioration of the economy and the ultimate collapse of the Soviet system. The first explanation places the blame on Gorbachev's poorly designed perestroika which destroyed the well functioning central planning system without creating a workable alternative. The second school of thought maintains that the Soviet variety of Marxian socialism has never been a viable system and carried its own seeds of destruction. According to this view the collapse of the Soviet Union would have happened sooner or later with or without Gorbachev because of the cumulative effect of allocative errors of the planning system.
P39|Mnohaletá Mezinárodní Diskuse O Socialismu A Trhu|This article was published in the leading Czech journal of economics named “Politicka Ekonomie” in 1967 that is during the process of Economic Reform intended to change the Soviet-type Command Economy in a sort of Market Socialism. It was curious that while the need to revive the market mechanism was accepted by the majority of economists and politicians, the famous “Socialist Controversy” that was just about this crucial problem was still virtually unknown in Czechoslovakia at that time. Our purpose was not only to provide the basic information about that controversy, but also to put it in the broader context of the evolution of the economic theory in the 19 th and 20 th century. Because of the previous domination of the orthodox Marxist economics, any developments of the non-Marxist economics after the classical contributions of Smith and Ricardo were regarded as the attempts of the “bourgeoisie” to falsify the “true” economics for the purpose of preserving Capitalism. We found it therefore necessary to start with the explanation of neoclassical concepts of marginal utility, imputation of value from final products to intermediate products and primary resources, as well as concepts of general equilibrium. After explaining these “roots” of the controversy the critical points of von Mises and Hayek are presented and the socialist responses of Maurice Dobb, Oskar Lange, Abba Lerner and others are discussed with a clear aim to show that without the market the socialist economy cannot be efficient.
