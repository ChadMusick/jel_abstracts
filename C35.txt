C35|“If You Were Me”: Proxy Respondents’ Biases in Population Health Surveys|Proxy respondents are widely used in population health surveys to maximize response rates. When surveys target frail elderly, the measurement error is expected to be smaller than selection or participation biases. However, in the literature on elderly needs for care, proxy use is most often considered with a dummy variable in which endogeneity with subjects’ health status is rarely scrutinised in a robust way. Pitfalls of this choice extend beyond methodological issues. Indeed, the mismeasurement of needs for care with daily activities might lead to irrelevant social policies or to private initiatives that try to address those needs. This paper proposes a comprehensive and tractable strategy supported by various robustness checks to cope with the suspected endogeneity of proxy use to the unobserved health status of subjects in reports of needs for care with activities of daily living. Proxy respondents’ subjectivity is found to inflate the needs of the elderly who are replaced or assisted in answering the questionnaire and to deflate the probability of unmet or undermet needs.
C35|The Dynamics and Determinants of Bullying Victimisation|We study the determinants and longitudinal evolution of nine types of adolescent (verbal, physical, indirect) bullying at school and domestically using the Understanding Society dataset during 2009-13. Family support is the most prominent protective factor against bullying. Applying joint maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for dynamic discrete responses, we investigate potential simultaneous determination of bullying and family support. The estimates indicate that bullying disclosure might be uncommon. The probability of escaping/suffering victimisation is inversely/positively related to previous bullying intensity, respectively. Family income increases domestic indirect aggression but, reduces direct aggression and non-domestic bullying as does living in a high income region.
C35|Telling schools apart: the role of preferences, constraints, and the ability to differentiate between schools in parents' choices|imitations in the ability of parents to compare schools have important implications for market oriented educational systems, which rely on parents choices to improve quality through competition. To empirically study these limitations, we develop and estimate a static model of elementary school choice that distinguishes between preferences for academic quality, the ability to differentiate between schools of different quality, and constraints in terms of the schools available to different households. Because school quality might be endogenous to parents' choices, we identify the key parameters related to preferences for quality using exogenous variation in schools' funding introduced by a policy that substantially increased the voucher amount for each enrolled socioeconomically vulnerable student. We estimate the model using a combination of administrative and survey data from Chile, which includes rich information on how parents compare the academic quality of schools. Using counterfactual simulations, we find the interaction between limitations to tell schools apart and differences in preferences across households plays an important role in decreasing the quality of schools attended by Chilean children, especially for children with less educated parents.
C35|Nuclear Power, Democracy, Development, and Nuclear Warheads: Determinants for Introducing Nuclear Power|This paper analyzes the nature of democratic development in a nation on the process of introducing nuclear power over the period 1960 - 2017 for an unbalanced panel of 171 countries. Given the involved political process of introducing nuclear power and its political importance, as well as the current tendency of about 30 countries to “go nuclear”, this question is both of historic and current interest. We apply a multinomial logistic regression approach that relates the likelihood of a country to introduce nuclear power to its level of democratic quality and nuclear warhead possession. The model results suggest that countries with lower levels of democratic development are more likely to introduce nuclear power. Our results moreover indicate that countries which possess at least one nuclear warhead are more likely to continue to use nuclear power instead of not using nuclear power at all. We discuss these results in the context of the public policy debate on nuclear power, yet beyond energy and environmental issues addressing international relations, conflict, and security issues connected to nuclear energy.
C35|Detecting turning points in global economic activity|We present non-linear models to capture the turning points in global economic activity as well as in advanced and emerging economies from 1980 to 2017. We first estimate Markov Switching models within a univariate framework. These models support the relevance of three business cycle regimes (recessions, low growth and high growth) for economic activity at the global level and in advanced and emerging economies. In a second part, we find that the regimes of the Markov Switching models can be well explained with activity, survey and commodity price variables within a discrete choice framework, specifically multinomial logit models, therefore reinforcing the economic interpretation of the regimes.

C35|Estimating Peer Effects on Career Choice: A Spatial Multinomial Logit Approach|Peers and friends are among the most influential social forces affecting adolescent behavior. In this paper we investigate peer effects on post-high school career decisions and on school choice. We define peers as students who are in the same classes and social clubs and measure peer effects as spatial dependence among them. Utilizing recent development in spatial econometrics, we formalize a spatial multinomial choice model in which individuals are spatially dependent in their preferences. We estimate the model with data from the Texas Higher Education Opportunity Project. We do find that individuals are positively correlated in their career and college preferences and examine how such dependencies impact decisions directly and indirectly as peer effects are allowed to reverberate through the social network in which students reside.
C35|A Nonlinear Dynamic Factor Model of Health and Medical Treatment|Quantitative assessments of the relationship between health and medical treatment are of great importance to policy makers. However, simply looking at the raw correlation between health and medical care is unlikely to give the right answer because of endogeneity problems. We overcome these problems by formulating and estimating a tractable dynamic factor model of health and medical treatment where individual observed health outcomes are driven by the individual's latent health stock. The dynamics of latent health reflects both exogenous health depreciation and endogenous health investments. Our model allows us to investigate the effect of medical treatment on current health, as well as on future medical treatment and health outcomes. We estimate the model by maximum simulated likelihood and minimum distance methods using a rich longitudinal data set from Italy obtained by merging a number of administrative archives. These data contain detailed information on medical drug use, hospitalization, and mortality for a representative sample of elderly hypertensive patients. Our findings show that medical care consumption is highly correlated over time, and this relationship depends on both permanent and time-varying observed and unobserved heterogeneity. They also show that medical drug use significantly maintains future health levels and prevents transitions to worse health. These results suggest that policies aimed at increasing the awareness and the compliance of hypertensive patients help reduces cardiovascular risks and consequent hospitalization and mortality.
C35|Country factors and the investment decision-making process of sovereign wealth funds|In this paper, we examine the complex decision-making processes that lead to sovereign wealth funds' (SWFs’) choice of investment location. Using a two-tiered dynamic Tobit panel model, we find that country-level factors do not have the same impacts on the investment decision and the amount to invest and that SWFs tend to invest more frequently and at higher amounts in countries in which they have already invested. More specifically, we find that SWFs prefer to invest in countries with higher political stability, whereas they are more prone to invest large amounts in countries that are less democratic and more financially open. Our results also lend support to the idea that SWFs are prudent in their choice of a target country with regard to their investment decision but behave as more opportunistic investors with regard to the amounts to be invested.
C35|Why do (or don't) people carpool for long distance trips? A discrete choice experiment in France|"Long-distance carpooling is an emerging mode in France and Europe, but little is known about monetary values of this mode attributes in transport economics. We conducted a discrete choice experiment to identify and measure the values of attributes of long-distance transport modes for a trip as a driver and as a passenger, with a special focus on carpooling. Around 1.700 French individuals have been surveyed. We use discrete mixed logit models to estimate the probability of mode choice. We find that the value of travel time for a driver who carpools is on average 13% higher than the value of travel time when driving alone in his/her car. The average value of travel time for a carpool trip as passenger is around 26 euros per hour, 60% higher than for a train trip and 20% higher than for a bus trip. Moreover, our study confirms a strong preference for driving solo over taking carpoolers in one's car. We also show that individuals traveling as carpool passenger incur a ""discomfort"" cost of on average 4.5 euros per extra passenger in the same vehicle. Finally, we identify robust socioeconomic effects affecting the probability of carpooling, especially gender effects. When they drive a car, females are less likely to carpool than male, but they prefer to carpool two passengers over only one passenger. JEL Codes: R41; C35"
C35|Using an Integrated Choice and Latent Variable Model to Understand the Impact of “Professional” Respondents in a Stated Preference Survey|"Internet panels are increasingly used for stated preference research, and members of such panels receive compensation for each completed survey. One concern is that over time this creates professional respondents who answer surveys to receive the monetary compensation. We identify professional respondents using data on panel tenure, survey response frequency, completion rates and total number of completed surveys. We find evidence of two types of professional respondents: ""hyperactives"" who answer surveys frequently and ""experienced"" who have long panel tenure and a large number of completed surveys. Using an integrated choice and latent variable model in a stated preference survey, we nd that ""hyperactive"" respondents are less likely to choose the 'status quo' and have a more stochastic choice process as seen from the econometrician's point of view, whereas ""experienced"" respondents have a relatively more deterministic choice process. Our results show that ""hyperactive"" respondents significantly impact estimated values."
C35|Household Saving, Health, and Healthcare Utilisation in Japan|The impact of health and healthcare utilisation on household savings and financial portfolios is explored using data from the Japanese Household Panel Survey (JHPS) and he Keio Household Panel Survey (KHPS). Whereas poor physical health is associated with higher savings and larger financial portfolios, poor mental health is found to have the opposite effects. Hospital visits, hospitalisation, and screening are associated with greater savings and larger financial portfolios. We also explore how the share of savings expressed as a proportion of total financial assets is affected by our health measures. We find that portfolio re-balancing effects associated with our health measures are outweighed by pure 'size' effects, in that our health measures affect the total value of a household's financial portfolio and its components (i.e., savings and securities), but not its overall composition.
C35|Does decentralization of governance promote urban diversity? Evidence from Spain|The worldwide trend to decentralize the responsibilities and budgets of governments impacts local firm dynamics in various ways. We use the example of Spain to test empirically whether the decentralization of governance has been conducive to increased diversification and a more even city-size distribution in the Spanish urban system during a period of continuous reductions in transport costs. To this end we develop a bivariate probit regression framework to assess the probability that cities diversify or specialize over time, using a sample of 69 urban areas in Spain during the period 1995-2007. We exploit unique firm-level and time-varying transport-cost data to control for the role of a city's market potential, city size, transport costs, labor-force skill composition, product standardization and historical patterns of specialization. We find a high probability that a city will diversify if it is the capital of a regional government or located in a relatively decentralized region, while the opposite is true for the probability that a city will specialize. Also, we find that a city's status as a regional capital reinforces the positive effect of a high (low) internal market potential on the probability of diversification (specialization). A high (low) external market potential only increases the probability that a city will become specialized (diversified) if it is a regional capital. We argue that the link between decentralization and specialization patterns in the urban system deserves more attention in the empirical literature on decentralization's impact on economic growth, income inequality and regional disparities.
C35|Labor Market Frictions and Moving Costs of the Employed and Unemployed|This paper examines the role of labor market frictions and moving costs in explaining the migration behavior of US workers by employment status. Using data on low-skilled workers from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), I estimate a dynamic model of individual labor supply and migration decisions. The model incorporates a reduced-form search model and allows for migration for non-market reasons. My estimates show that moving costs are substantial and that labor market frictions primarily inhibit migration of the employed. I use the model to study migration responses to local labor market shocks and to a moving subsidy. Workers' preferences for non-market amenities, coupled with substantial moving costs and employment frictions, grant market power to incumbent employers. Large moving costs also likely affect employers' recruiting behavior.
C35|The Impact of Bullying Victimisation on Mental Wellbeing|We investigate the impact of nine types of adolescent (verbal, physical, indirect) school/domestic bullying on life satisfaction, and two mental health outcomes (emotional symptoms and hyperactivity/inattention) using the Understanding Society dataset during 2009-13. Bullying significantly increases hyperactive, inattentive and emotional symptoms and reduces life satisfaction. Non-domestic bullying has a stronger adverse impact on all three mental wellbeing outcomes. Domestic sibling victimisation does not affect life satisfaction. Lower levels of family income increase adolescent hyperactive/inattentive symptoms and reduce life satisfaction. Females are more vulnerable to emotional symptoms while males report higher levels of life satisfaction. Initial conditions precondition hyperactive and inattentive symptoms.
C35|Quashing Demand Criminalizing Clients? Evidence from the UK|We discuss changes in the demand for paid sex accompanying the criminalization of prostitution in the United Kingdom, which moved from a relatively permissive regime under the Wolfenden Report of 1960, to a much harder line of aiming to crack down on prostitution with the Prostitution (Public Places) Scotland Act 2007 and the Policing and Crime Act of 2009 in England and Wales. We make use of two waves of a representative survey, the British National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal2, conducted in 2000-2001 and Natsal3, conducted in 2010-2012) to illustrate the changes in demand that have taken place across the two waves. We do not find demand decreasing in our sample and find a shift in the composition of demand towards more risky clients, which we discuss in the context of the current trends towards criminalization of prostitution.
C35|Income and wealth inequality in Malta: evidence from micro data|This paper studies the distribution of income and wealth in Malta over the period 2010-16, based on three waves of detailed micro-data from the Household Finance and Consumption Survey. This is the first paper that explores the evolution of income and wealth inequality jointly, and over time, using household-level data in Malta. In particular, the focus of the present paper is to examine how income and wealth are distributed over different socioeconomic characteristics, their joint distribution and its determinants, as well as factors that influence a household’s ability to obtain credit, using decomposition methods and binary response models. Our results suggest that households with tertiary education experienced strong increases in their incomes and wealth in the period examined. With reference to wealth, household main residence (HMR) is the most equalising factor of wealth inequality and self-employment wealth is the most disequalising factor. Regarding the determining factors of the position of a household in the wealth distribution, the financing structure of HMR is particularly important to explain the household’s position in the wealth distribution. Furthermore, the age and education level of the reference person of a household as well as increases in household’s income affect positively the probability of being in a higher wealth quintile. This finding also holds true for households who have received inheritance or gifts.
C35|An evaluation of early warning models for systemic banking crises: Does machine learning improve predictions?|This paper compares the out-of-sample predictive performance of different early warning models for systemic banking crises using a sample of advanced economies covering the past 45 years. We compare a benchmark logit approach to several machine learning approaches recently proposed in the literature. We find that while machine learning methods often attain a very high in-sample fit, they are outperformed by the logit approach in recursive out-of-sample evaluations. This result is robust to the choice of performance measure, crisis definition, preference parameter, and sample length, as well as to using different sets of variables and data transformations. Thus, our paper suggests that further enhancements to machine learning early warning models are needed before they are able to offer a substantial value-added for predicting systemic banking crises. Conventional logit models appear to use the available information already fairly efficiently, and would for instance have been able to predict the 2007/2008 financial crisis out-of-sample for many countries. In line with economic intuition, these models identify credit expansions, asset price booms and external imbalances as key predictors of systemic banking crises.
C35|Demand and Welfare Analysis in Discrete Choice Models with Social Interactions|Many real-life settings of consumer-choice involve social interactions, causing targeted policies to have spillover-effects. This paper develops novel empirical tools for analyzing demand and welfare-effects of policy-interventions in binary choice settings with social interactions. Examples include subsidies for healthproduct adoption and vouchers for attending a high-achieving school. We establish the connection between econometrics of large games and Brock-Durlauf-type interaction models, under both I.I.D. and spatially correlated unobservables. We develop new convergence results for associated beliefs and estimates of preference-parameters under increasing-domain spatial asymptotics. Next, we show that even with fully parametric specifications and unique equilibrium, choice data, that are sufficient for counterfactual demand - prediction under interactions, are insufficient for welfare-calculations. This is because distinct underlying mechanisms producing the same interaction coefficient can imply different welfare-effects and deadweightloss from a policy-intervention. Standard index-restrictions imply distribution-free bounds on welfare. We illustrate our results using experimental data on mosquito-net adoption in rural Kenya.
C35|Econometric Ways to Estimate the Age and Price of Abalone|Abalone is a rich nutritious food resource in the many parts of the world. The economic value of abalone is positively correlated with its age. However, determining the age of abalone is a cumbersome as well as expensive process which increases the cost and limits its popularity. This article proposes very simple ways to determine the age of abalones using econometric methods to reduce the costs of producers as well as consumers.
C35|Integer-valued stochastic volatility|We propose a novel class of count time series models, the mixed Poisson integer-valued stochastic volatility models. The proposed specification, which can be considered as an integer-valued analogue of the discrete-time stochastic volatility model, encompasses a wide range of conditional distributions of counts. We study its probabilistic structure and develop an easily adaptable Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, based on the Griddy-Gibbs approach that can accommodate any conditional distribution that belongs to that class. We demonstrate that by considering the cases of Poisson and negative binomial distributions. The methodology is applied to simulated and real data.
C35|Enhancing Managerial Decision-Making Through Multicriteria Modeling|The monograph constitutes a crowning of research led in the field of particular methodology of management science, in the field of enhancing managerial decision-making sub-discipline in frames of the practical stream of the management science discipline. The monograph is a development of the research project in which the elaboration of a scientific method for the enhancement of managerial decision-making processes through the Modular Multicriteria Managerial Decision-Making Model (MMUMADEMM) has been proposed.
C35|Counter sanctions and well-being population of Russia: econometric analyses|This article examines the impact of counter-sanctions on the welfare of Russia’s population. We build a multiple-choice model and calculate the probability of being in a particular group of well-being based on the price (cost) of consumed counter-sanctions goods. The next step is the construction of a structural demand-supply system for estimating similar domestic good’s production elasticities. By knowing elasticity estimates we determine the price response to particular import closure. According to our estimates Russia's counter-sanctions led to an increase in poverty by 2.64 %.
C35|Estimating Demand for Long-term Care Insurance in Thailand: Evidence from a Discrete Choice Experiment|At present, the Thai public health insurance schemes cover medical care. However, the financial risk associated with long-term care needs is unprotected. The increasing likelihood of Thai elderly living longer and living alone has raised great concern about their quality of life. In the wake of the declining informal support capacity, a public long-term care insurance (LTCI) system has been considered as a potential alternative. Because the public will have to contribute to the LTCI fund, this paper explores whether the Thai people are willing to pay for such a provision. The LTCI demand is estimated based on the stated preference survey data. Our results show that most respondents are willing to pay to insure against their risk associated with long-term care expenditure, but their preferences are very heterogeneous. Gains and losses for different policy scenarios, measured by consumer surplus, are discussed.
C35|The Impact of Bullying Victimisation on Mental Wellbeing|We investigate the impact of nine types of adolescent (verbal, physical, indirect) school/domestic bullying on life satisfaction, and two mental health outcomes (emotional symptoms and hyperactivity/inattention) using the Understanding Society dataset during 2009-13.

Non-domestic bullying has a stronger adverse impact on all three mental wellbeing outcomes. Domestic sibling victimisation does not affect life satisfaction. Lower levels of family income increase adolescent hyperactive/inattentive symptoms and reduce life satisfaction. Females are more vulnerable to emotional symptoms while males report higher levels of life satisfaction. Initial conditions precondition hyperactive and inattentive symptoms.

C35|Sovereign Credit Ratings under Fiscal Uncertainty|This paper studies the response of credit rating agencies to an increase in uncertainty about a government's fiscal position. To that end, a measure of the uncertainty around official forecasts of the public budget deficit is constructed that is comparable across time and a range of advanced economies. To estimate the effect of fiscal uncertainty on sovereign credit ratings, an empirical framework is developed that accounts for the high stability of ratings over time. Results suggest that fiscal uncertainty increases the predictive power of a model of rating changes and can explain why sovereign ratings are often changed more frequently during crises.
C35|The economics of participatory value evaluation|This paper develops a novel approach to the economic evaluation of public policies: participatory value evaluation (PVE). PVE involves citizens directly in decisions of the government, taking into account governmental and individual budget constraints. Citizens receive reliable information on social impacts and can choose the best portfolio of projects according to their social preferences. This paper develops the economic and econometric theoretical framework for fixed budget and flexible budget PVE experiments which allows us to directly measure the change in social welfare for investments in water infrastructure in The Netherlands.
C35|Heterogeneous effects of credit constraints on SMEs’ employment: Evidence from the European sovereign debt crisis|This paper takes advantage of access to detailed matched bank-firm data to investigate whether and how employment decisions of SMEs have been affected by credit constraints during the European sovereign debt crisis. Variability in banks’ financial health following the 2008 crisis is used as an exogenous determinant of firms’ access to credit. Findings, relative to the Belgian economy, clearly highlight that credit matters. They show that SMEs borrowing money from pre-crisis financially less healthy banks were significantly more likely to be affected by a credit constraint and, in turn, to adjust their labour input downwards than pre-crisis clients of more healthy banks. These results are robust across types of loan applications that were denied credit, i.e. applications to finance working capital, debt or new investments. Yet, estimates also show that credit constraints have been essentially detrimental for employment among SMEs experiencing a negative demand shock or facing strong product market competition. In terms of human resources management, credit constraints are not only found to foster employment adjustment at the extensive margin but also to increase the use of temporary layoff allowances for economic reasons. This outcome supports the hypothesis that short-time compensation programmes contribute to save jobs during recessions.
C35|R&D and market size: who benefits from orphan drug regulation?|Since the early 80s, orphan drug regulations have been introduced to stimulate R&D for rare diseases. We develop a theoretical model to study the heterogeneous impact on optimal R&D decisions of the incentives for diseases with different levels of prevalence. We show the mechanisms through which the type of incentives deployed by orphan drug regulations may stimulate R&D more for orphan diseases with comparatively high prevalence, thus increasing inequality within the class of orphan diseases. Using data from the Food and Drug Administration on the number of orphan designations, our empirical analysis shows that, while R&D has increased over time for all orphan diseases, the increase has been much greater for the less rare. According to our baseline specification, the difference between the predicted number of orphan designations for a disease belonging to the highest and the lowest class of prevalence is 5.6 times larger after 2008 than it was in 1983. Our findings support the idea that the type of incentives in place may be responsible for this increase in inequality within orphan diseases.
C35|Endogenous and Selective Service Choices After Airline Mergers|We estimate a model of service choice and price competition in airline markets, allowing for the carriers that provide nonstop service to be a selected subset of the carriers competing in the market. Our model can be estimated without an excessive computational burden and we use the estimated model to illustrate the effects of selection on equilibrium market structure and to show how accounting for selection can change predictions about post-merger market power and repositioning, in ways that are consistent with what has been observed after actual mergers, and possible merger remedies.
C35|Linear IV Regression Estimators for Structural Dynamic Discrete Choice Models|In structural dynamic discrete choice models, the presence of serially correlated unobserved states and state variables that are measured with error may lead to biased parameter estimates and misleading inference. In this paper, we show that instrumental variables can address these issues, as long as measurement problems involve state variables that evolve exogenously from the perspective of individual agents (i.e., market-level states). We define a class of linear instrumental variables estimators that rely on Euler equations expressed in terms of conditional choice probabilities (ECCP estimators). These estimators do not require observing or modeling the agent’s entire information set, nor solving or simulating a dynamic program. As such, they are simple to implement and computationally light. We provide constructive identification arguments to identify the model primitives, and establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator. A Monte Carlo study demonstrates the good finite-sample performance of the ECCP estimator in the context of a dynamic demand model for durable goods.
C35|The dynamics of finance-growth-inequality nexus: Theory and evidence for India|The paper critically inquires the ‘finance-growth-inequality’ nexus based on an econometric analysis of the IHDS Survey data for two rounds – 2005-06 and 2011-12. The study attempts to assess the co-evolution of finance-growth-inequality in an intertemporal framework. At the household level asset is still the most important determinant of bank loans inspite of several policy measures aimed at financial inclusion. However, the probability of receiving a bank loan increases if any member of the household is active participant of the local level government or caste association. The most important finding of the paper pertains to the econometric result that the household asset grows at the same rate independent of the source of loans - banks or informal moneylenders though the level effect (intercept) is higher if the loan is obtained from banks or lower if the household lives below poverty line. The same observation is also confirmed for per capita income of the households. The phenomenon is explained in a theoretical model of intertemporal choice of entrepreneur-investor to show that if there are both formal and informal sources of borrowing with a constraint on the formal sector borrowing and no constraint on the latter, then growth rates of asset and income are determined by the informal sector interest rate. This result can be generalised for any number of sources of borrowing. This questions the conventional wisdom regarding the policy aimed at financial inclusion. Inequality of income increases independent of the source of borrowing, though the households living below poverty line are worse off in general. If the major source of borrowing is bank for the business and industry then inequality increases more for the above poverty line households than if the major source is moneylenders or the households belong to the below poverty line category. Moneylenders as the source of borrowing is not as regressive as is believed. So the whole issue of financial inclusion needs a review in the light of the findings of the paper.
C35|SMEs’ financing: Divergence across Euro area countries?|This paper studies the divergence/convergence process of European countries as regard the financing behavior of small and medium sized enterprises. Using a firm level and country representative survey, we construct country-time indicators of SMEs’ use of three external financing sources: bank loans, credit line/overdraft and trade credit. These indicators account for composition effects and demand effects. We find substantial differences between countries in the SMEs’ use of the three financing sources. In particular, the cross-country differences related to SMEs’ use of bank loans have significantly increased over the period 2010-2014. This divergence is not related to a global increase in the volatility of this use between countries. Instead, it has been driven by a sharper increase (resp decrease) in the countries where SMEs’ use was initially higher (resp. lower). Finally, we investigate whether SMEs’ uses of financing sources are correlated at the country level with various macroeconomic and banking structure indicators. The results suggest that indicators about banking concentration are good candidates to explain the cross-country divergence of SMEs’ use of bank loans.
C35|Choosing the Production Function Model for an Optimal Measurement of the Restructuring Efficiency of the Polish Metallurgical Sector in Years 2000–2015|Between 2000 and 2015, the Polish metallurgical sector was subject to serious restructuring. Presented research aimed at providing a framework for possibly most accurate measurement of efficiency of this process. The study employed: (I) Quantitative research for elaboration of production function models: power regression Cobb-Douglas function with its developments; (II) Qualitative research: Analytic Hierarchy Process for assessment of relevance of efficiency evaluation criteria in reference to various production function models in metallurgy sector: (i) sectoral added value (net production); (ii) production sold; and, (iii) steel production volume. Criteria relevance has been assessed by scientists and practitioners with specialization in metallurgy. As a result the sectoral added value function has been chosen as the one that optimally reflects sector’s restructuring efficiency. This, in turn, constitutes a qualitative confirmation of previous research result, which has been verified with a quantitative method. Practical outcome is a more precise modelling of efficiency of restructuring processes in the metallurgical sector, both for scientific and business needs. The main research limitations originate from the sector itself—in order to make our tool more universal, further research should be led in parallel branches of industry.
C35|Mobile Phones and Financial Access: Evidence from the Finscope Surveys of Selected Asian Countries|This paper assesses the impact of mobile phones on the use of formal banking services in some Asian countries. Using the FinScope Surveys of Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, and Thailand conducted between 2012 and 2015, the paper applies a probit model to both cross-sectional and pooled data set. The results consistently suggest that having a mobile phone increases the probability of having access to financial services. The findings also highlight the importance of education which increases the likelihood of being formally banked, while distance or time to banking infrastructure is likely to remain a significant barrier for people to access to financial services for all countries. Other factors associated with the likelihood of changes in the levels of access to financial services vary widely from country to country.
C35|Sharp bounds on the MTE with sample selection|I propose a Generalized Roy Model with sample selection that can be used to analyze treatment effects in a variety of empirical problems. First, I decompose, under a monotonicity assumption on the sample selection indicator, the MTR function for the observed outcome when treated as a weighted average of (i) the MTR on the outcome of interest for the always-observed sub-population and (ii) the MTE on the observed outcome for the observed-only-when-treated sub-population, and show that such decomposition can provide point-wise sharp bounds on the MTE of interest. I, then, show how to point-identify these bounds when the support of the propensity score is continuous. After that, I show how to (partially) identify the MTE of interest when the support of the propensity score is discrete.
C35|Family Ties and Children Obesity in Italy|This paper estimates the influence of overweight family members on weight outcomes of Italian children aged 6 to 14 years. We use a new dataset matching the 2012 cross sections of the Italian Multipurpose Household Survey and the Household Budget Survey. Endogenous peer groups within the family are accounted for using a set of instrumental variables. We find evidence of a strong, positive effect of both overweight adults and peer children in the family on children weight outcomes. The impact of overweight peer children in the household is larger than the impact of adults. These findings can help identifying the main factors driving the rise in Italian children obesity in the past few decades.
C35|Criminalising clients: some evidence from the UK|We discuss the role of stigma in the sale of sexual services and the effect that policies increasing stigma have on sex markets and the welfare of the actors therein, presenting the different sides to the debate and the evidence in their support. We then examine changes in legislation in the United Kingdom, which ended the relatively permissive regime established with the Wolfenden Report of 1960, to a much harder line aiming to crack down on prostitution with the Prostitution (Public Places) Scotland Act 2007 and the Policing and Crime Act of 2009 in England and Wales. We make use of two waves of the British National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles, a representative sample of the British population (Natsal2, conducted in 2000-2001 and Natsal3, conducted in 2010-2012) to investigate changes in both the amount and composition of demand for paid sexual services between the two waves, and draw some implications on the likely welfare effects of considering prostitution a form of crime.
C35|Redistribution in Whose Favor? Preferences with Regard to Nationality and Type of Beneficiaries|In this paper, we elicit preferences for the allocation of income redistribution to different uses through a Discrete Choice Experiment performed with a representative sample of Swiss citizens. The total desired amount of income redistribution is estimated as a share of disposable income. Further, we estimate marginal willingness-to-pay values for recipients' nationalities (Swiss, citizens of western European countries, citizens of other countries) as well as their types (old-age pensioners, people with ill health, the unemployed, working poor, and families with children). Swiss citizens are found to have a positive willingness to pay for a reallocation of social expenditure in favor of themselves or Western European citizens to the detriment of citizens of other countries, who are perceived to be culturally distant.
C35|The dynamics of finance-growth-inequality nexus: Theory and Evidence for India|The paper critically inquires the â€˜finance-growth-inequalityâ€™ nexus based on an econometric analysis of the IHDS Survey data for two rounds â€“ 2005-06 and 2011-12. The study attempts to assess the co-evolution of finance-growth-inequality in an intertemporal framework. At the household level asset is still the most important determinant of bank loans inspite of several policy measures aimed at financial inclusion. However, the probability of receiving a bank loan increases if any member of the household is active participant of the local level government or caste association. The most important finding of the paper pertains to the econometric result that the household asset grows at the same rate independent of the source of loans - banks or informal moneylenders though the level effect (intercept) is higher if the loan is obtained from banks or lower if the household lives below poverty line. The same observation is also confirmed for per capita income of the households. The phenomenon is explained in a theoretical model of intertemporal choice of entrepreneur-investor to show that if there are both formal and informal sources of borrowing with a constraint on the formal sector borrowing and no constraint on the latter, then growth rates of asset and income are determined by the informal sector interest rate. This result can be generalised for any number of sources of borrowing. This questions the conventional wisdom regarding the policy aimed at financial inclusion. Inequality of income increases independent of the source of borrowing, though the households living below poverty line are worse off in general. If the major source of borrowing is bank for the business and industry then inequality increases more for the above poverty line households than if the major source is moneylenders or the households belong to the below poverty line category. Moneylenders as the source of borrowing is not as regressive as is believed. So the whole issue of financial inclusion needs a review in the light of the findings of the paper.
C35|Accounting for Non-Response Bias using Participation Incentives and Survey Design|Standard corrections for missing data rely on the strong and generally untestable assumption of missing at random. Heckman selection models relax this assumption, but have been criticized because in practice they typically require a selection variable which predicts non-response but not the outcome of interest, and can impose bivariate normality. Using a copula methodology which does not rely on this assumption, we implement the selection model approach in data on HIV testing at a demographic surveillance site in rural South Africa which are affected by non-response. Randomized incentives are the ideal selection variable, particularly when implemented ex ante to deal with potential missing data. However, elements of survey design may also provide a credible method of correcting for non-response bias ex post. For example, although not explicitly randomized, allocation of food gift vouchers during our survey was plausibly exogenous and substantially raised participation, as did effective survey interviewers. Based on models with receipt of a voucher and interviewer identity as selection variables, our results imply that 37% of women in the population are HIV positive, compared to imputation-based estimates of 28%. For men, confidence intervals are too wide to reject the absence of non-response bias. Consistent results obtained when comparing different selection variables and error structures strengthen these conclusions.
C35|Heterogeneous Effects of Credit Constraints on SMEs' Employment: Evidence from the Great Recession|This paper takes advantage of access to detailed matched bank-firm data to investigate whether and how employment decisions of SMEs have been affected by credit constraints in the wake of the Great Recession. Variability in banks' financial health following the 2008 crisis is used as an exogenous determinant of firms' access to credit. Findings, relative to the Belgian economy, clearly highlight that credit matters. They show that SMEs borrowing money from pre-crisis financially less healthy banks were significantly more likely to be affected by a credit constraint and, in turn, to adjust their labour input downwards than pre-crisis clients of more healthy banks. These results are robust across types of loan applications that were denied credit, i.e. applications to finance working capital, debt or new investments. Yet, estimates also show that credit constraints have been essentially detrimental for employment among SMEs experiencing a negative demand shock or facing strong product market competition. In terms of human resources management, credit constraints are not only found to foster employment adjustment at the extensive margin but also to increase the use of temporary layoff allowances for economic reasons. This outcome supports the hypothesis that short-time compensation programmes contribute to save jobs during recessions.
C35|Semiparametric Identification in Panel Data Discrete Response Models|This paper studies semiparametric identification in linear index discrete response panel data models with fixed effects. Departing from the classic binary response static panel data model, this paper examines identification in the binary response dynamic panel data model and the ordered response static panel data model. It is shown that under mild distributional assumptions on the fixed effect and the time-varying unobservables, point-identification fails but informative bounds on the regression coefficients can still be derived. Partial identification is achieved by eliminating the fixed effect and discovering features of the distribution of the unobservable time-varying components that do not depend on the unobserved heterogeneity. Numerical analyses illustrate how the identified set changes as the support of the explanatory variables varies.
C35|Sharp Bounds and Testability of a Roy Model of STEM Major Choices|We analyze the empirical content of the Roy model, stripped down to its essential features, namely sector specific unobserved heterogeneity and self-selection on the basis of potential outcomes. We characterize sharp bounds on the joint distribution of potential outcomes and testable implications of the Roy self-selection model under an instrumental constraint on the joint distribution of potential outcomes we call stochastically monotone instrumental variable (SMIV). We show that testing the Roy model selection is equivalent to testing stochastic monotonicity of observed outcomes relative to the instrument. We apply our sharp bounds to the derivation of a measure of departure from Roy self-selection to identify values of observable characteristics that induce the most costly misallocation of talent and sector and are therefore prime targets for intervention. Special emphasis is put on the case of binary outcomes, which has received little attention in the literature to date. For richer sets of outcomes, we emphasize the distinction between point-wise sharp bounds and functional sharp bounds, and its importance, when constructing sharp bounds on functional features, such as inequality measures. We analyze a Roy model of college major choice in Canada and Germany within this framework, and we take a new look at the under-representation of women in STEM.
C35|Impact of advertizing on brand’s market-shares in the automobile market:: a multi-channel attraction model with competition and carry-over effects|This article presents a new approach to measure the impact of multi-channel advertising investments on brands’ market shares in the main segment of the French automobile market. We propose a multi-channel attraction model with adstock, in order to take into account the advertising carryover effect and the competition. This model allows to distinguish between short term and long term effect of the advertising. As, from a mathematical point of view, a vector of market shares is a composition belonging to the simplex space, i.e. subject to positivity and summing up to one contraints, we take benefit from the compositional data analysis (CODA) literature to estimate properly this model. We show how to determine the carryover parameters for each channel (outdoor, press, radio and television) in a multivariate way. We consider several model specifications with more or less complexity (cross effects between brands), including Dirichlet models, and we compare them using goodness-of-fit and prediction accuracy measures. We explain how to built confidence and prediction ellipsoids in the space of market shares. The impact of each channel on market shares is measured in terms of direct and cross elasticities. We conclude that in this market, radio only has a contemporaneous impact whereas outdoor, press and television have a large decay effect. Moreover, the advertising elasticities vary across brands and channels, and can be negative. It also turns out that positive interactions do exist between certain brands for certain media.
C35|Les décisions des jeunes à l’entrée dans la vie adulte en France : la famille, un facteur primordial ?|L’entrée dans la vie adulte se caractérise par différentes étapes. Parmi elles, se trouve le choix d’étudier, de quitter le foyer parental ou de travailler. Ce papier examine les liens possibles existant entre l’environnement familial et ces choix effectués par les jeunes adultes en s’appuyant sur des données issues de l’Enquête ENRJ (2014). La méthodologie économétrique adoptée nous permet de prendre en compte la quasi-simultanéité de ces décisions. Outre, la structure familiale, les revenus, la situation géographique et la catégorie socio-professionnelle des parents, nous intégrons des indicateurs mesurant la qualité relationnelle des jeunes avec leurs parents. Nous montrons en particulier que la qualité des relations entretenues avec les parents influe tout autant sur les décisions du jeune que leur situation professionnelle.
C35|Regulation of Geo-blocking: does it address the problem of low intraEU iTrade?|The goal of the article is to critically verify and to discuss main areas necessary for increasing intraEU iTrade. To achieve this aim, the legal analysis of the regulation is confronted with the econometric approach identifying the main determinants of cross-border e-commerce. The model is based on data from a survey conducted among 6901 Polish business owners in 2017. Our hypotheses include the following issues: (1) the main barrier of intraEU iTrade is the low level of integration of digital technologies by SMEs; therefore (2) the character of the impact of legal means adopted in the regulation 2018/302 on the development of transnational service provision and entrepreneurship based on e-commerce is doubtful. We argue that the introduction of more and more advanced requirements by EC will only reduce their interest in developing business abroad through cross-border e-commerce and result in losing the opportunities linked to the development of digital economy.
C35|Hybrid choice models vs. endogeneity of indicator variables: a Monte Carlo investigation|We investigate the problem of endogeneity in the context of hybrid choice (integrated choice and latent variable) models. We first provide a thorough analysis of potential causes of endogeneity and propose a working taxonomy. We demonstrate that although it is widely believed that the hybrid choice framework is devoid of the endogeneity problem, there is no theoretical reason to expect that this is the case. We then demonstrate empirically that the problem exists in the hybrid choice framework too. By conducting a Monte Carlo experiment, we display the extent of the bias resulting from measurement and endogeneity biases. Finally, we propose two novel solutions to address the problem: by explicitly accounting for correlation between structural and discrete choice component error terms (or with random parameters in a utility function), or by introducing additional latent variables. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that these approaches work as expected, that is, they result in unbiased estimates of all model parameters.
C35|Periurban Agriculture: do the Current EU Agri-environmental Policy Programmes Fit with it?| In the European Union (EU) periurban agriculture is under the same agri-environmental policy regime designed for general agriculture. We argue that the specific needs of periurban agriculture may justify ad hoc agri-environmental policy measures. We present results from a Choice Experiment (CE) performed on a sample of 600 people living in the municipality of Milan, which was designed to assess the willingness to pay (WTP) for ecological benefits generated by four agri-environmental practices implementable in the periurban area and already included in the Rural Development Programmes of the Lombardy region. Results suggest that a large population share is willing to pay to support an increase in the use of the agricultural practices studied with an average WTP ranging between 5.6 to 16.3 euro/person/year, according to the type of practice. These results are in contrast with their current low level of adoption. The sub-optimal uptake rate is likely due to an insufficient per hectare compensating payment, which is too low to cover the income foregone consequent to the adoption of sustainable agriculture measures in this area. The mismatch between the low uptake rate and the high social benefits generated by the four agri-environmental agricultural practices sheds light on the need to design agri-environmental policy programmes specifically targeted to periurban areas, where the costs of compliance with AEMs are high and the social benefits of their adoption are large.
C35|How defense shapes the institutional organization of states|Abstract We analyze theoretically how the provision of military services explains the vertical and horizontal fragmentation of a state. The model innovates on the previous political economy literature which views such institutional arrangements arising only as a response to internal ”technological” forces, not to strategic interactions within the state and with neighboring states. The model explains how these interactions lead communities of individuals to choose among three alternative types of institutional arrangements: 1) a union, i.e., a setting wherein both the vertical and the horizontal fragmentation of a state is minimized; 2) an alliance, whereby a state becomes more vertically fragmented by creating an upper government tier devised to take advantage of economies of scale; 3) autonomy, where horizontal fragmentation is maximized, as no merging of communities occurs and no higher government tier is created. A series of simulations of the model define the conditions under which each alternative institutional arrangement emerges in equilibrium.
C35|Time Inconsistency and Delayed Retirement Decision: the French Pension Bonus|With the increase in life expectancy and demographic shocks, several public policies in the last decades aim to encourage individuals to postpone retirement. One of them, the pension bonus, gives an increased pension if individuals retire beyond their Full Retirement Age. Previous ex post analyses found that the responsiveness to this type of financial incentives, which encourage to postpone retirement, is heterogeneous among agents and that the global effect is rather limited. Deriving from previous research in Behavioural Economics, this article analyses the impact of time inconsistency in the decision to delay retirement to get the bonus. Using public national survey data, short-term and long-term impatience are measured with questions on retiring motivations. After controlling for the endogeneity of the bonus knowledge, econometric results show that time-inconsistent agents are less likely to retire with the bonus. JEL codes: C35, J26.
C35|A Model for Policy Interest Rates|This paper introduces a model that addresses the key worldwide features of modern monetary policy making: the discreteness of policy interest rates both in magnitude and in timing, the preponderance of status quo decisions, policy inertia and regime switching. We capture them by developing a new dynamic discrete-choice model with switching among three latent policy regimes (dovish, neutral and hawkish), estimated via the Gibbs sampler with data augmentation. The simulations and an application to federal funds rate target demonstrate that ignoring these features leads to biased estimates, worse in- and out-of-sample fit, and qualitatively different inference. Using all Federal Open Market Committee?s (FOMC) decisions made both at scheduled and unscheduled meetings as sample observations, we model the Federal Reserve?s response to real-time data available right before each meeting, and control for the endogeneity of monetary policy shocks. The new model, fitted for Greenspan?s tenure, correctly predicts the directions of about 90% of the next decisions on the target rate (hike, no change, or cut) out of sample during Bernanke?s term including the status quo decisions after reaching the zero lower bound, while the conventional linear model fails to adequately tackle the zero bound and wrongly predicts further cuts.
C35|On the estimation of treatment effects with endogenous misreporting|Participation in social programs is often misreported in survey data, complicating the estimation of treatment effects. We propose a model to estimate treatment effects under endogenous participation and endogenous misreporting. We present an expression for the asymptotic bias of both OLS and IV estimators and discuss the conditions under which sign reversal may occur. We provide a method for eliminating this bias when researchers have access to information regarding participation and misreporting. We establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of our proposed estimator and assess its small sample performance through Monte Carlo simulations. An empirical example illustrates the proposed method.
C35|Sharp Bounds And Testability Of A Roy Model Of Stem Major Choices|We analyze the empirical content of the Roy model, stripped down to its essential features, namely sector specific unobserved heterogeneity and self-selection on the basis of potential outcomes.

For richer sets of outcomes, we emphasize the distinction between point-wise sharp bounds and functional sharp bounds, and its importance, when constructing sharp bounds on functional features, such as inequality measures. We analyze a Roy model of college major choice in Canada and Germany within this framework, and we take a new look at the under-representation of women in STEM.
C35|Control Variables, Discrete Instruments, and Identification of Structural Functions|Control variables provide an important means of controlling for endogeneity in econometric models with nonseparable and/or multidimensional heterogeneity. We allow for discrete instruments, giving identification results under a variety of restrictions on the way the endogenous variable and the control variables affect the outcome. We consider many structural objects of interest, such as average or quantile treatment effects. We illustrate our results with an empirical application to Engel curve estimation.

C35|If not now, when? The timing of childbirth and labour market outcomes|We study the effect of childbirth and its timing on female labour market outcomes in italy. The impact on yearly labour earnings and participation is traced up to 21 years since school completion by estimating a factor analytic model with dynamic selection into treatments. We find that childbearing, especially the first delivery, negatively affects female labour supply. Women having their first child soon after school completion are able to catch up with childless women only after 12-15 years. The timing matters, with minimal negative consequences observed if the first child is delayed up to 7-9 years after exiting formal education
C35|Education, Intelligence and Diseases in Old Age|Several studies have found a positive association between education and health. Confounding factors that a ect both education choices and health, such as (ob- served) parental background and (unobserved) intelligence, may play an important role in shaping this association. In this paper we estimate the impact of education on diseases in old age, accounting for this endogeneity. Our estimates are based on administrative data on men born in 1944–1947, who were examined for military service in the Netherlands between 1961–1965, linked to national death and medication use records. We assume medication use identifies diseases. We estimate a structural model, consisting of (i) an ordered probit model for the educational attainment, (ii) a Gompertz mortality model for survival up to old age, (iii) a probit model for medication use in old age and, (iv) a measurement system using IQ tests to identify latent intelligence. Educational choices, surviving up to old age and medication use all depend on observed individual factors and on latent intelligence. Based on the estimation results, we derive the impact of education on diseases in old age. Our empirical results reveal a strong effect of education on physical diseases, but low or no effect of education on depression and anxiety.
C35|The Dynamics and Determinants of Bullying Victimisation|We study the determinants and longitudinal evolution of nine types of adolescent (verbal, physical, indirect) bullying at school and domestically using the Understanding Society dataset during 2009-13. Family support is the most prominent protective factor against bullying. Applying joint maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for dynamic discrete responses, we investigate potential simultaneous determination of bullying and family support. The estimates indicate that bullying disclosure might be uncommon. The probability of escaping/suffering victimisation is inversely/positively related to previous bullying intensity, respectively. Family income increases domestic indirect aggression but, reduces direct aggression and non-domestic bullying as does living in a high income region.
C35|Homeownership, Labour Market Transitions and Earnings|The paper investigates the links between homeownership, employment and earnings for which no consensus exists in the literature. Our analysis is cast within a dynamic setting and the endogeneity of each outcome is assessed through the estimation of a flexible panel multivariate model with random effects. The data we use are drawn from the French sample of the EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions for the years 2004Ð2013. The error terms are both correlated across equations and autocorrelated. Individual random effects are also correlated across equations. The model is estimated using a simulated maximum likelihood estimator and particular care is given to the initial conditions problem. Our results show that while homeowners have longer employment and unemployment spells, they must contend with lower earnings than tenants upon reemployment. They also stress the importance of unobserved heterogeneity in explaining the transitions on the labour and housing markets, and the relationship between earnings and the latter two. Failure to properly account for this is likely to yield biased parameter estimates.
C35|A Bivariate Fractional Probit Model|This paper develops a bivariate fractional probit model for fractional response variables, i.e., variables bounded between zero and one. The model can be applied when there are two seemingly unrelated fractional response variables. Since the model relies on a quite strong bivariate normality assumption, specification tests are discussed and the consequences of misspecification are investigated. It is shown that the model performs well when normal marginal distributions can be established (this can be tested), and does not perform worse when the joint distribution is not characterized by bivariate normality. Simulation evidence shows that the bivariate model generates more efficient estimates than two univariate models applied to each fractional response variable separately. An empirical application illustrates the usefulness of the proposed model in empirical practice.

C35|Understanding Discrimination against Same-Sex Couples in the United States: Evidence from an Email Correspondence Audit|As of 2017, no federal law protected Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ) individuals from housing discrimination. However, 22 U.S. states and over 200 municipalities have passed laws prohibiting housing discrimination based on sexual orientation. In this paper, I present the results of a randomized pair-email correspondence audit of 6,490 property owners in 94 U.S. cities. I provide a nationally-representative estimate of the level of discrimination same-sex couples experience when inquiring about rental housing. I find that same-sex male couples, especially Black same-sex male couples, are less likely to receive a response to inquiries about rental units. Same-sex female couples receive preferential treatment compared to heterosexual couples. I then examine how state and local anti-discrimination laws covary with rates of housing discrimination against same-sex couples. Compare to localities without any housing protections, I find that response rates covary positively with statelevel protections but negatively with local-level protections. I conclude by testing several hypotheses about the causes of this discrimination. This preliminary evidence suggests that property owners are willfully discriminating against same-sex male couples.
C35|Contagious exporting and foreign ownership: Evidence from firms in Shanghai using a Bayesian spatial bivariate probit model|Whether a firm is able to attract foreign capital and whether it may participate at the export market depends on whether the fixed costs associated with doing so are at least covered by the incremental operating profits. This paper provides evidence that success for some firms in attracting foreign investors and in exporting appears to reduce the associated fixed costs with exporting or foreign ownership in other firms. Using data on 8,959 firms located in Shanghai, we find that contagion and spillovers in exporting and in foreign ownership decisions within an area of 10 miles in the city of Shanghai amplify fixed-cost reductions for both exporting as well as foreign ownership of neighboring firms. Contagion among exporters and among foreign-owned firms, respectively, amplify shocks to the profitability of these activities to a large extent. These findings are established through the estimation of a spatial bivariate probit model.
C35|Incentivising Participation and Spatial Coordination in Payment for Ecosystem Service Schemes: Forest Disease Control Programs in Finland|This paper considers the problem of designing PES-type contracts to encourage participation and spatial coordination amongst private forest owners in Finland. The aim of the policy is to increase efforts to mitigate risks from invasive forest pests and diseases. Such control actions yield spill-over benefits to other landowners and to wider society, meaning that the level of privately-optimal disease control is likely to be less than the socially-optimal level. The policy designer may wish to encourage spatial coordination in the uptake of such PES-type contracts, as spatial coordination delivers an increase in the effectiveness of control measures on disease risks. We conducted a choice experiment with private forest owners in Finland in October 2016. The study elicited the preferences of woodland owners with respect to the design of forest disease control contracts, and gauged their willingness to cooperate with neighbouring forest owners within the framework of such programs.

C35|The effect of grants on university drop-out rates: evidence on the Italian case|In this paper we measure the impact of need-based grants on university dropout rates in the first year, using student-level data from all Italian universities in the period 2003-2013. In Italy, some of the students eligible for grants do not receive them due to a lack of funds. We exploit this phenomenon to identify the causal effect of financial assistance. We find that need-based aid prevents students belonging to low-income families from dropping out from higher education; the estimated effect is sizeable. This evidence is robust to a variety of specifications and sample selection criteria.
C35|Spatial Discrete Choice Models: A Review Focused on Specification, Estimation and Health Economics applications|Modeling individual choices is one of the main aim in microeconometrics. Discrete choice models have been widely used to describe economic agents' utility functions, and most of them play a paramount role in applied health economics. On the other hand, spatial econometrics collects a series of econometric tools which are particularly useful when we deal with spatially-distributed data sets. It has been demonstrated that accounting for spatial dependence can avoid inconsistency problems of the commonly used estimators. However, the complex structure of spatial dependence in most of the nonlinear models still precludes a large diffusion of these spatial techniques. The purpose of this paper is then twofold. The former is to review the main methodological problems and their different solutions in spatial discrete choice modeling as they have appeared in the econometric literature. The latter is to review their applications to health issues, especially in the last few years, by highlighting at least two main reasons why spatial discrete neighboring effects should be considered and then suggesting possible future lines of the development of this emerging field.
C35|The Dynamics of Finance-Growth-Inequality Nexus: Theory and Evidence for India|The purpose of this research study has been to expand our understanding of the finance-growth ‘nexus’ to finance-growth-inequality ‘nexus’ in the presence of both the formal and the informal sources of borrowing. Using empirical evidence of IHDS Survey data for two rounds the study attempts to assess the co-evolution of finance-growth-inequality in an intertemporal framework. The most important finding of the paper pertains to the econometric result that the household asset grows at the same rate independent of the source of loans - banks or moneylenders though the level effect (intercept) is higher if the loan is obtained from banks or lower if the household lives below poverty line. The same also holds for the rate of growth of per capita income. There is virtually no significant difference for the households living below poverty line (BPL) on the rate of growth of capital asset or income whether source of borrowing is bank or money lender. This is then formalized in a theoretical model of intertemporal choice of entrepreneur-investor to show that if there are both formal and informal sources of borrowing with a constraint on the formal sector borrowing and no constraint on the latter, then growth rates of asset and income are determined by the informal sector interest rate. The result can be generalised for any number of sources of borrowing. This questions the conventional wisdom regarding the policy aimed at financial inclusion. Inequality of income increases independent of the source of borrowing, though the BPL households are worse off in general.
C35|Estimation of Factor Structured Covariance Mixed Logit Models|Mixed logit models with normally distributed random coefficients are typically estimated under the extreme assumptions that either the random coefficients are completely independent or fully correlated. A factor structured covariance provides a middle ground between these two assumptions. However, because these models are more difficult to estimate, they are not frequently used to model preference heterogeneity. This paper develops a simple expectation maximization algorithm for estimating mixed logit models when preferences are generated from a factor structured covariance. The algorithm is easy to implement for both exploratory and confirmatory factor models. The estimator is applied to stated-preference survey data from residential energy customers (Train, 2007). Comparing the fit across five different models, which differed in their assumptions on the covariance of preferences, the results show that all three factor specifications produced a better fit of the data than the fully correlated model measured by BIC and two out of three performed better in terms of AIC.
C35|Market Structure and Competition in Airline Markets|We provide an econometric framework for estimating a game of simultaneous entry and pricing decisions in oligopolistic markets while allowing for correlations between unobserved fixed costs, marginal costs, and demand shocks. Firms' decisions to enter a market are based on whether they will realize positive profits from entry. We use our framework to quantitatively account for this selection problem in the pricing stage. We estimate this model using cross-sectional data from the US airline industry. We find that not accounting for endogenous entry leads to overestimation of demand elasticities. This, in turn, leads to biased markups, which has implications for the policy evaluation of market power. Our methodology allows us to study how firms optimally decide entry/exit decision in response to a change in policy. We simulate a merger between American and US Airways and we find that the post-merger market structure and prices depend crucially on how we model the characteristics of the post-merger firm as a function of the pre-merger firms' characteristics. Overall, the merged firm has a strong incentive to enter new markets; the merged firm faces a stronger threat of entry from rival legacy carriers, as opposed to low cost carriers; and, post-merger entry mitigates the adverse effects of increased concentration.
C35|Measurement Error in Discrete Health Facility Choice Models:an Example from Urban Senegal|A number of authors have utilized health facility choice models to determine how individuals in developing countries evaluate the tradeoff between the price, quality, and indirect costs of obtaining medical care. A common problem in this literature is that researchers only observe the type of facility that individuals report visiting (e.g., public or private hospital, health center or dispensary, or traditional healer) and, therefore, must assume individuals visit the nearest facility of the type they report. This matching procedure creates measurement error in the choice variable, which may introduce bias in parameter estimates. In this research, we use a data set from urban Senegal that allows for a precise individual-health facility match to estimate consumer preferences for health facility characteristics related to maternal health and family planning services. Using actual rather than imputed choices, we find that consumers prefer high quality health facilities that are nearby. Given the preference for quality, our findings indicate that in contrast to the typical assumption in the literature, individuals frequently bypass the facility nearest their home. When we estimate models using the mismeasured choice variable, the results show a significant bias in preference estimates; most notably, these models systematically overestimate distaste for travel. To highlight a potential consequence of biased preference estimates in this setting, we conclude by simulating the impact of an actual policy that took place in 2014; namely, the opening of a new facility in a previously underserved area of Dakar, Senegal.
C35|The effects of self-assessed health: Dealing with and understanding misclassification bias|Categories of self-assessed health (SAH) are often used as a measure of health status. However,the difficulties with measuring overall health mean that the same individual may select into different SAH categories even though their underlying health has not changed. Thus,their observed SAH may involve misclassification, and the chance of misclassification may differ across individuals. As shown in this paper,if neglected, misclassification can lead to substantial biases in not only the estimation of the effects of SAH on outcomes, but also on the effects of other variables of interest,such as education and income. This paper studies nonlinear regression models where SAH is a key explanatory variable, but where two potentially misclassified measures of SAH are available.In contrast to linear regression models, the standard approach of using one SAH measure as an instrumental variable for the other cannot produce consistent estimates. However, we show that the coefficients can be identified from the joint distribution of the outcome and the two misclassified measures without imposing additional structure on the misclassification, and we propose simple likelihood-based approaches to estimate all parameters consistently via a convenient EM algorithm. The estimator is applied to data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, where we exploit the natural experiment that in some waves individuals were asked the same question about their health status twice, and almost 30% of respondents change their SAH response. We use the estimator to (i) obtain the first reliable estimates of the relationship between SAH and long-term mortality and morbidity, and to (ii) document how demographic and socio-economic determinants shape patterns of misclassification of SAH.
C35|Uncontrolled diabetes and health care utilisation: a bivariate Latent Markov model approach|While uncontrolled diabetes (UD) or poor glycaemic control is a widespread condition with potentially life-threatening consequences, there is sparse evidence of its effects on health care utilisation. We model the propensities to consume health care and UD by employing an innovative bivariate Latent Markov model which allows for dynamic unobserved heterogeneity, movements between latent states and the endogeneity of UD. We estimate the effects of UD on primary and secondary health care consumption using a panel dataset of rich administrative records from Spain and measure UD using a biomarker. We find that UD does not have a statistically significant effect on health care use. Furthermore, individuals appear to move across latent classes and increase their propensities to poor glycaemic control and health care use over time. Our results suggest that by ignoring time-varying unobserved heterogeneity and the endogeneity of UD, the effects of UD on health care utilisation might be overestimated and this could lead to biased findings. Our approach reveals heterogeneity in behaviour beyond standard groupings of frequent versus infrequent users of health care services. We argue that this dynamic latent Markov approach could be used more widely to model the determinants of health care use.
C35|Reasons for unmet needs for health care: the role of social capital and social support in some Western EU countries|The paper focus on the patient-side factors that determine access to health care and analyzes the issues of unmet needs and reasons for unmet needs for health care in Western EU countries. The paper has two main objectives: ﬁrst, to study the determinants of unmet health care needs (UN) with a particular hub on social capital and social support; second, to analyze whether social capital and social support are predictors of the reasons for unmet needs (RUN). A probit model is estimated from the whole population sample accounting for the possibility of individual selection in unmet needs for health care (UN) (selection equation). Then expanded probit models (including inverse Mills ratio) are used on the reasons for unmet needs (RUN) with social capital and social support as determinants and using the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) dataset carried out in 2006. In UN equation, results indicate higher unmet health care needs for younger, people with tertiary education, low economic situation, unemployed and in poor health status. Moreover, the frequency of visiting relatives and friends and the ability to ask for help are correlated with a lower likelihood of declaring unmet needs, instead volunteering and participation in formal organizations present a higher probability of not visiting a doctor when needed. In RUN equations, findings show that female, large households, people with low economic situation and financial constraints, unemployed and in poor health status have a higher probability of declaring unmet needs due to economic costs. Additionally, people with tertiary education, high income and employed have a higher probability of not visiting a doctor when needed due to time availability. Furthermore, the frequency of contact with friends and the ability to ask for help are related with a lower probability of unmet needs due to economic costs, while the frequency of contact with relatives is related with a lower probability of unmet needs due to time availability and distance. However, the ability to ask for help is also correlated with a higher probability of not having medical care due to time availability and wait and see.
C35|Voter behavior and government performance: Empirical application in Ghana|Electoral competition is a democratic mechanism to guarantee high governmental performance. In reality, however, it often leads to policy failure due to Government Capture and Government Accountability. An understanding of both phenomena has to be based on voter theory and nowadays the probabilistic voter model is the workhorse model applied in voter studies. In this paper we first proceeded to derive a theoretical model to estimate voter behavior including three voting motives: non-policy oriented, policy oriented and retrospective oriented. Then, we derived government performance indicators to estimate Capture and Accountability based on marginal effects and relative importance of the three components. Subsequently, we tested our theory estimating a probabilistic voter model for Ghana using own election survey data. In particular, we calculated different mixed logit model specifications and, to allow heterogeneity, we followed the latent class approach. Using the results of the estimations, we were able to calculate marginal effects and relative importance of each voting motive and we found that the non-policy component is the most important whereas the retrospective component is the less relevant. Finally, the government performance indicators were estimated and they suggest that, although the political weights are unequally distributed in Ghana, the government is partially accountable towards the voter and elections provide an effective mechanism to promote democracy.
C35|Global recessions and booms: What do probit models tell us?|We present non-linear binary Probit models to capture the turning points in global economic activity as well as in advanced and emerging economies from 1980 to 2016. For that purpose, we use four different business cycle dating methods to identify the regimes (upswings, downswings). We find that especially activity-driven variables are important indicators for the turning points. Moreover, we identify similarities and differences between the different regions in this respect.
C35|Dissecting the financial cycle with dynamic factor models|The analysis of the financial cycle and its interaction with the macroeconomy has become a central issue for the design of macroprudential policy since the 2007-08 financial crisis. This paper proposes the construction of financial cycle measures for the US based on a large data set of macroeconomic and financial variables. More specifically, we estimate three synthetic financial cycle components that account for the majority of the variation in the data set using a dynamic factor model. We investigate whether these financial cycle components have significant predictive power for economic activity, inflation and short-term interest rates by means of Granger causality tests in a factor-augmented VAR set-up. Further, we analyze if the synthetic financial cycle components have significant forecasting power for the prediction of economic recessions using dynamic probit models. Our main findings indicate that all financial cycle measures improve the quality of recession forecasts significantly. In particular, the factor related to financial market participants' uncertainty and risk aversion - related to Rey's (2013) global financial cycle - seems to serve as an appropriate early warning indicator for policymakers.
C35|Modeling the effects of grade retention in high school|A dynamic discrete‐choice model is set up to estimate the effects of grade retention in high school, both in the short run (end‐of‐year evaluation) and in the long run (drop‐out and delay). In contrast to other evaluation approaches, this model captures essential treatment heterogeneity and controls for grade‐varying unobservable determinants. In addition, forced track downgrading is considered as an alternative remedial measure. Our results indicate that grade retention has a neutral effect on academic achievement in the short run. In the long run, grade retention, just like forced downgrading, has adverse effects on schooling outcomes and, more so, for less able pupils.
C35|Innovation and willingness to export: Is there an effect of conscious self-selection?|This paper presents an analysis of the crucial relationship between innovation, productivity, and export in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The primary aims of this study are to evaluate the role of innovation in the premium export and test the hypothesis of firm conscious self-selection on willingness to export. To this end, the authors used their database of SMEs, obtained from the survey conducted in the IDEIS project, which provides highly pertinent information on innovation and export areas. Based on the aforementioned database, the authors evaluate apparent premium of exportation and innovation. In addition, they demonstrate the effectiveness of the export premium for high exportation firms that implement process and organization innovations. Finally, the authors analyse the effect of conscious self-selection from the export process that transforms an intention to export into the capacity to export in short term. The conscious self-selection to export is revealed by simultaneously endogeneizing productivity and innovation output based on recursive non-linear model.
C35|Natural disasters and governmental aid: Is there a charity hazard?|"In the aftermath of natural disasters, governments frequently provide financial aid for affected households. This policy can have adverse effects if individuals anticipate it and forgo private precaution measures. While theoretical literature unequivocally suggests this so called ""charity hazard"", empirical studies yield ambiguous results. Drawing on rich survey data from German homeowners, we analyze charity hazard for different flood precaution strategies, namely insurance uptake and non-financial protection measures, and different flood risk areas. Our results indicate a substantial charity hazard in the insurance market for individuals residing in flood-prone areas. In contrast, we find a positive correlation between governmental aid and non-financial protection measures. Moreover, our results suggest that insurance and non-financial protection measures are rather complements than substitutes. Finally, we provide suggestive evidence that status-quo bias might play an important role for insurance uptake."

C35|Global impact of uncertainties in China’s gas market|This paper examines the uncertainties in Chinese gas markets, analyze the reasons and quantify their impact on the world gas market. A literature review found significant variability among the outlooks on China's gas sector. Further assessment found that uncertainties in economic growth, structural change in markets, environmental regulations, price and institutional changes contribute to the uncertainties. The analysis of China’s demand and supply uncertainties with a world gas-trading model found significant changes in global production, trade patterns and spot prices, with pipeline exporters being most affected. China's domestic production and pipeline imports from Central Asia are the major buffers that can offset much of the uncertainties. The study finds an asymmetric phenomenon. Pipeline imports are responding to China's uncertainties in both low and high demand scenarios while LNG imports are only responding to high demand scenario. The major reasons are higher TOP levels and the current practice of import only up to the minimum TOP levels for LNG, as well as a lack of liberalized gas markets. The study shows that it is necessary to create LNG markets that can respond to market dynamics, through either a reduction of TOP levels or change of pricing mechanisms to hub indexation.
C35|Sovereign credit rating determinants: A comparison before and after the European debt crisis|This paper compares the importance of different sovereign credit rating determinants over time, using a sample of 90 countries for the years 2002–2015. Applying the composite marginal likelihood approach, we estimate a multi-year ordered probit model for each of the three major credit rating agencies. After the start of the European debt crisis in 2009, the importance of the financial balance, the economic development and the external debt increased substantially and the effect of eurozone membership switched from positive to negative. In addition, GDP growth gained a lot of importance for highly indebted sovereigns and government debt became much more important for countries with a low GDP growth rate. These findings provide empirical evidence that the credit rating agencies changed their sovereign credit rating assessment after the start of the European debt crisis.
C35|Visual attention in multi-attributes choices: What can eye-tracking tell us?|Choice experiments (CE), involving multi-attribute choices, are increasingly used in economics to value non-marketed goods. Such choices require individuals to process large amounts of information, shown to trigger partial information strategies in participants. We develop a new framework in which information processing is treated as a latent (unobservable) process. Testing our approach by combining CE and visual attention (VA) data gathered from eye-tracking, we show that treating information processing as a latent process (LIP) outperforms models assuming full information processing (FIP) or binary information processing (BIP). Our modelling of VA results in a number of key findings. We show that the relationship between VA and individuals’ preferences depends on the type of product attribute. More specifically, preferences for “easier to process” attributes appear to be less influenced by changes in underlying level of VA than “harder to process” attributes. In turn this impacts on willingness-to-pay estimates, with the LIP model resulting in smaller values than those obtained with the FIP model. Our results have implications for CE designers. More time should be spent getting subjects to understand more complicated attributes of the CE. Our results are likely to extend beyond experimental choices (stated preferences) to actual choices (revealed preferences).
C35|Collateral-based in SME lending: The role of business collateral and personal collateral in less-developed countries|Using a database of banking credit approvals for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) operating in less-developed countries throughout Eastern Europe and Central Asia, this paper extends empirical evidence on the determinants of the incidence and the levels of business and personal collateral, reporting first-hand results regarding the impact of the recently reformed credit environment on collateral requirements. The findings endorse the importance of producing and sharing private information between lenders to reduce informational asymmetries and, consequently, the need to provide collateral to receive a loan. The results also suggest that market concentration increases “lazy” behavior on behalf of banks in the form of asking for collateral not to mitigate observable risk but rather to reduce screening efforts.
C35|Identification, data combination, and the risk of disclosure|It is commonplace that the data needed for econometric inference are not contained in a single source. In this paper we analyze the problem of parametric inference from combined individualâ€ level data when data combination is based on personal and demographic identifiers such as name, age, or address. Our main question is the identification of the econometric model based on the combined data when the data do not contain exact individual identifiers and no parametric assumptions are imposed on the joint distribution of information that is common across the combined data set. We demonstrate the conditions on the observable marginal distributions of data in individual data sets that can and cannot guarantee identification of the parameters of interest. We also note that the data combination procedure is essential in a semiparametric setting such as ours. Provided that the (nonparametric) data combination procedure can only be defined in finite samples, we introduce a new notion of identification based on the concept of limits of statistical experiments. Our results apply to the setting where the individual data used for inferences are sensitive and their combination may lead to a substantial increase in the data sensitivity or lead to a â€œdeâ€ anonymizationâ€ of the previously â€œanonymizedâ€ information. We demonstrate that the point identification of an econometric model from combined data is incompatible with restrictions on the risk of individual disclosure. If the data combination procedure guarantees a bound on the risk of individual disclosure, then the information available from the combined data set allows one to identify the parameter of interest only partially, and the size of the identification region is inversely related to the upper bound guarantee for the disclosure risk. This result is new in the context of data combination as we notice that the quality of links that need to be used in the combined data to assure point identification may be much higher than the average link quality in the entire data set, and thus point inference requires the use of the most sensitive subset of the data. Our results provide important insights into the ongoing discourse on the empirical analysis of merged administrative records as well as discussions on the â€œdisclosiveâ€ nature of policies implemented by the dataâ€ driven companies (such as internet services companies and medical companies using individual patient records for policy decisions).
C35|K-anonymity: A note on the trade-off between data utility and data security|Researchers often use data from multiple datasets to conduct credible econometric and statistical analysis. The most reliable way to link entries across such datasets is to exploit unique identifiers if those are available. Such linkage however may result in privacy violations revealing sensitive information about some individuals in a sample. Thus, a data curator with concerns for individual privacy may choose to remove certain individual information from the private dataset they plan on releasing to researchers. The extent of individual information the data curator keeps in the private dataset can still allow a researcher to link the datasets, most likely with some errors, and usually results in a researcher having several feasible combined datasets. One conceptual framework a data curator may rely on is k-anonymity, k>=2, which gained wide popularity in computer science and statistical community. To ensure k-anonymity, the data curator releases only the amount of identifying information in the private dataset that guarantees that every entry in it can be linked to at least k different entries in the publicly available datasets the researcher will use. In this paper, we look at the data combination task and the estimation task from both perspectives – from the perspective of the researcher estimating the model and from the perspective of a data curator who restricts identifying information in the private dataset to make sure that k-anonymity holds. We illustrate how to construct identifiers in practice and use them to combine some entries across two datasets. We also provide an empirical illustration on how a data curator can ensure k-anonymity and consequences it has on the estimation procedure. Naturally, the utility of the combined data gets smaller as k increases, which is also evident from our empirical illustration.
C35|Investment in Energy Efficiency, Adoption of Renewable Energy and Household Behavior: Evidence from OECD Countries|There are possible synergies between the decision to invest in energy efficiency measures and to adopt renewable energy, in the sense that the former reduces energy demand so that the latter can further cut future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and which has great potential in the residential sector. Much work has been done in the residential sector on demand for clean energy and on investment in energy efficiency, but to our knowledge there is no specific study that investigates the relationship between the two. This paper fills a gap in the literature, and first shows theoretically that there are relationships of substitution or complementarity between the two decisions depending on the threshold of the cross effect related to the environmental motivation of the consumer. Second, the paper empirically shows that the two decisions are positively interrelated due to unobserved characteristics that determine both decisions. Third, the paper provides differential impact of energy poverty, split incentive problem, dwelling characteristics, commitment and trust on the two decisions. Finally, the paper investigates household characteristics that significantly affect the joint adoption of energy efficient and renewable energy technologies. This contribution can serve to define incentive policies to advance the energy transition.

C35|Attitude towards Risk and Production Decision: An Empirical analysis on French private forest owners|This paper deals with the forest owner's attitude towards risk and the harvesting decision in several ways. First, we propose to characterize and quantify the forest owner's attitude towards risk. Second, we analyze the determinants of the forest owner's risk attitude. Finally, we determine the impact of the forest owner's risk attitude on the harvesting decision. The French forest owner's risk attitude is tackled by implementing a questionnaire, including a context-free measure borrowed from experimental economics. The determinants of the forest owner's risk attitude and harvesting decision are estimated through a recursive bivariate ordered probit model. We show that French forest owners are characterized by a relative risk aversion coefficient close to 1. In addition, we found that the forest owner's risk aversion is influenced positively and significantly by gender (female), age, and willingness to protect the environment, while the percentage of forest income in the total patrimony of the forest owner has a negative effect. Finally, we obtain that the forest owner's risk aversion positively and significantly impacts the harvesting decision.
C35|Do managerial skills matter? An analysis of the impact of managerial features on performance for the Italian football|This paper studies the impact of a set of managerial features on performance in the top division of the Italian football league during seasons 2000/01-2009/10. Our set of coach characteristics includes indicators of skill, experience, innate features as well as empathy with the team. We find that some managerial features matter even when we control by club power and past results. Indeed, performance is positively correlated with the fact that the manager has experience abroad or has been a previous player of the team but negatively correlated with lack of previous managerial experience. Other features affect only some particular aspects of performance. In particular, Italian managers play a more defensive game in home matches while old managers are more defensive in away games. Also, changing a coach within the season has a negative impact on the defensive skill of the team in away matches.
C35|The distance factor in Swedish bus contracts: how far are operators willing to go?|One of the factors differentiating operators the most in bus services is, arguably, the respective distances from their workplaces to the area of a procured contract. More dead running kilometers implies higher costs, and the same should affect operators’ probability to participate in tenders. As previous studies have discussed, this is a relevant competitive factor, but the transport literature lacks studies aiming to assess the size of this distance factor. This paper examines what impact operators’ distance to tendered bus contracts has on their probability to participate in the tender, and how this probability differs across operator types. To address this, an econometric analysis was undertaken using probit regressions with data on tendered Swedish bus contracts over the period 2007–2015 along with operator workplace data. The results show that operators’ distance from a contract has a significantly negative effect on their probability of placing a bid for the contract. While being located near the contract gives, on average, an over 90 percent probability of participating, being 10 kilometers away results in a 30 percent probability. The rival’s distance to the contract also has an effect, but only to a limited extent. Large operators are found to be less affected by their distance to a contract, and they are also more inclined to bid if the procuring authority offers a depot to use.
C35|An empirical model of dyadic link formation in a network with unobserved heterogeneity|I study a dyadic linking model in which agents form directed links that exhibit homophily and reciprocity. A ﬁxed eﬀect approach accounts for unobserved sources of degree heterogeneity. I consider inference with respect to homophily preferences and a reciprocity parameter, as well as a test of model speciﬁcation. The speciﬁcation test compares observed transitivity to the transitivity predicted by the dyadic linking model. My test statistics are robust to the incidental parameter problem (Neyman and Scott 1948). This is accomplished by using analytical formulas that approximate the eﬀect of the incidental parameter on the bias and the variance of the test statistics. The approximation is justiﬁed under dense large network asymptotics. In an application to favor networks in Indian villages, the model speciﬁcation test detects that the dyadic linking model underestimates the true transitivity of the network.
C35|‘Fair’ Welfare Comparisons with Heterogeneous Tastes: Subjective versus Revealed Preferences|Multidimensional welfare analysis has recently been revived by money-metric measures based on explicit fairness principles and the respect of individual preferences. To operationalize this approach, preference heterogeneity can be inferred from the observation of individual choices (revealed preferences) or from self-declared satisfaction following these choices (subjective well-being). We question whether using one or the other method makesa difference for welfare analysis based on income-leisure preferences. We estimate ordinal preferences that are either consistent with actual labor supply decisions or with income-leisure satisfaction. For different ethical priors regarding work preferences, we compare the welfare rankings obtained with both methods. The correlation in welfare ranks is high in general and very high for the 60% of the population whose actual choices coincide with subjective well-being maximization. For the rest, most of the discrepancies seem to be explained by labor market constraints among the low skilled and underemployment among low-educated single mothers. Importantly from a Rawlsian perspective, the identification of the worst off depends on ethical views regarding responsibility for work preferences and the extent to which actual choices are constrained on the labor market.
C35|I Can't Sleep! Relative Concerns and Sleep Behavior|We investigate the effect of relative concerns with respect to income on the quantity and quality of sleep using a long panel dataset on the sleep behavior of people in Germany. We find that relative income has a substantial negative effect on number of hours of sleep on weekdays and overall satisfaction with sleep, i.e., sleep quality, whereas absolute income has no particular effect on sleep behavior. The findings are robust to several specification checks, including measures of relative concerns, reference group, income inequality, and local price differences. The paper also investigates the importance of the potential channels including working hours, time-use activities, and physical and mental health to explain how relative concerns relate to sleep behavior. The results reveal that while all of these channels partially contribute to the effect, it appears to be mainly driven by physical and mental health and overall and financial well-being/stress. We also use a subjective well-being valuation approach to calculate the monetary value of sleep lost due to income comparisons. The total cost is as high as about 2.6 billion euro/year (1.8% of the overall monetary value of sleep and 1.3% of total health expenditures) among the working-age population in Germany.
C35|The relevance of personal characteristics and gender diversity for (eco)-innovation activities at the firm-level : Results from a linked employer-employee database in Germany|"""Up to now, the growing literature on the determinants of eco-innovation has not considered the influence of personal characteristics of the employees of a firm. The existing econometric analyses show much 'noise' explaining the driving forces of ecoinnovation. The paper tries to open the 'black box' of unexplained heterogeneity. In fact, latent variables such as the greenness of a firm may be explained by the personal characteristics (gender, family status, geographical origin, education etc.) of the staff and the decision makers in a firm. The linked employer-employee database of the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) in Germany allows such an analysis based on data for 2010 and 2012. The results of an econometric analysis show that a high share of high qualified women and a mixed gender composition of the management board are positively correlated to eco-innovation activities. Furthermore, the results confirm that export-oriented firms are more likely to innovate, firms characterized by an over-aging of the staff innovate less and a higher competition pressure leads to more innovations.""

C35|The Welfare Implications of Unobserved Heterogeneity|Conditions are derived for relating household well-being functions to household utility. In particular, an isomorphic relationship between the equivalent incomes stemming from subsistence-based utility functions and well-being functions is established. This allows estimates from standard models of well-being based on a CDF (eg. probit and logit models) to be given a formal welfare interpretation. New measures of the welfare distortion due to unobserved heterogeneity are also derived. An Australian household-level dataset is used as a case study for exploring the proposed measures of distortion. The results indicate that the failure to account for unobserved heterogeneity produces significant welfare distortions (primarily in the form of under-compensation). A unique welfare sensitivity curve is also estimated that indicates the presence of non-linearities that impair the typically monotonic relationship between household income, the householdâ€™s capacity to adjust its income and its marginal utility of consumption. The results are significant for better understanding the welfare implications of tax and transfer policies.
C35|An Econometric Model of Network Formation With Degree Heterogeneity| I introduce a model of undirected dyadic link formation which allows for assortative matching on observed agent characteristics (homophily) as well as unrestricted agent‐level heterogeneity in link surplus (degree heterogeneity). Like in fixed effects panel data analyses, the joint distribution of observed and unobserved agent‐level characteristics is left unrestricted. Two estimators for the (common) homophily parameter, β 0 , are developed and their properties studied under an asymptotic sequence involving a single network growing large. The first, tetrad logit (TL), estimator conditions on a sufficient statistic for the degree heterogeneity. The second, joint maximum likelihood (JML), estimator treats the degree heterogeneity {A i0 } i = 1 -super-N as additional (incidental) parameters to be estimated. The TL estimate is consistent under both sparse and dense graph sequences, whereas consistency of the JML estimate is shown only under dense graph sequences.

C35|Identification and Decompositions in Probit and Logit Models|Probit and logit models typically require a normalization on the error variance for model identification. This paper shows that in the context of sample mean probability decompositions, error variance normalizations preclude estimation of the effects of group differences in the latent variable model parameters. An empirical example is provided for a model in which the error variances are identified. This identification allows the effects of group differences in the latent variable model parameters to be estimated.
C35|Adoption of a New Payment System: Theory and Experimental Evidence|We model the introduction of a new payment method that competes with an existing payment method. Due to network adoption effects, there are two symmetric pure strategy equilibria in which only one of the two payment methods is used. The equilibrium where only the new payment method is used is socially optimal. In an experiment, we find that, depending on the fixed fee for acceptance of the new payment method and on the choices made by participants on both sides of the market, either equilibrium can be selected. An evolutionary learning model provides a good characterization of our experimental data.
C35|To ‘Vape’ or Smoke? A Discrete Choice Experiment Among U.S. Adult Smokers|A small but rapidly growing percentage of the U.S. population uses e-cigarettes. Policymakers, especially the FDA, are concerned about their public health impact and thus are contemplating regulations. We provide empirical evidence to inform such policy choices. Specifically, we examine how the demand for e-cigarettes would vary across policy-relevant attributes: 1) health impact, 2) effectiveness in helping smokers quit, 3) bans in public places, and 4) price. We conduct an online discrete choice experiment of 1,669 adult smokers who select among combustible cigarettes and two types of e-cigarettes as attributes are varied. Using a conditional logit model we estimate smokers’ preferences across attributes. Then, using a latent class model, we identify types of smokers and conduct policy simulations separately by these types and for the full sample. In general, smokers value the attributes in the predicted directions and the demand for e-cigarettes tends to be motivated more by smokers’ health concerns than by price or smoking bans. The latent class model identifies three types of smokers, those who prefer combustible cigarettes (‘smokers’), e-cigarettes (‘vapers’), and using both (‘dual users’). We conclude that varying these policy-relevant attributes will have small, significant impacts on average, but with substantial heterogeneity by smoker type.

C35|Pension Rules and Labour Market Mobility|This paper makes use of a natural experiment to examine effects of potential capital losses and general attractiveness of pension schemes on employees' propensity to change jobs. On January 1st 2004, the two largest pension funds in the Netherlands, for civil servants and for the health care sector, changed their pension scheme from a final salary to an average salary. This industry-leve change excludes the possibility that a negative correlation between having a job with an attractive pension scheme and the number of labour market transitions is driven by self-selection of workers into jobs with an attractive pension arrangement. Using individual data covering the entire Dutch population, we estimate discrete choice models for job-to-job transitions. The results show that the number of job transitions of civil servants significantly increased at the onset of the new pension rules. The changing pension rules affected the propensity to change jobs for individuals working in the health care sector only to a smaller extent.
C35|A Note on the Estimation of Job Amenities and Labor Productivity|This note introduces a maximum likelihood estimator of the value of job amenities and labor productivity in a single matching market based on the observation of equilibrium matches and wages. The estimation procedure simultaneously fits both the matching patterns and the wage curve. Our estimator is suited for applications to a wide range of assignment problems.
C35|'Fair' Welfare Comparisons with Heterogeneous Tastes: Subjective versus Revealed Preferences|Multidimensional welfare analysis has recently been revived by money-metric measures based on explicit fairness principles and the respect of individual preferences. To operationalize this approach, preference heterogeneity can be inferred from the observation of individual choices (revealed preferences) or from self-declared satisfaction following these choices (subjective well-being). We question whether using one or the other method makes a difference for welfare analysis based on income-leisure preferences. We estimate ordinal preferences that are either consistent with actual labor supply decisions or with income- leisure satisfaction. For different ethical priors regarding work preferences, we compare the welfare rankings obtained with both methods. The correlation in welfare ranks is high in general and very high for the 60% of the population whose actual choices coincide with subjective well-being maximization. For the rest, most of the discrepancies seem to be explained by labor market constraints among the low skilled and underemployment among low-educated single mothers. Importantly from a Rawlsian perspective, the identification of the worst o¤ depends on ethical views regarding responsibility for work preferences and the extent to which actual choices are constrained on the labor market.
C35|A Multinomial Probit Model with Latent Factors: Identification and Interpretation without a Measurement System|We develop a parametrization of the multinomial probit model that yields greater insight into the underlying decision-making process, by decomposing the error terms of the utilities into latent factors and noise. The latent factors are identified without a measurement system, and they can be meaningfully linked to an economic model. We provide sufficient conditions that make this structure identified and interpretable. For inference, we design a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler based on marginal data augmentation. A simulation exercise shows the good numerical performance of our sampler and reveals the practical importance of alternative identification restrictions. Our approach can generally be applied to any setting where researchers can specify an a priori structure on a few drivers of unobserved heterogeneity. One such example is the choice of combinations of two options, which we explore with real data on education and occupation pairs.
C35|Student Work, Educational Achievement, and Later Employment: A Dynamic Approach|This study examines the direct and indirect impact (via educational achievement) of student work during secondary education on later employment outcomes. To this end, we jointly model student work and later schooling and employment outcomes as a chain of discrete choices. To tackle their endogeneity, we correct for these outcomes' unobserved determinants. Using unique longitudinal Belgian data, we find that pupils who work during the summer holidays of secondary education are 15.3% more likely to have a job three months after leaving school. This premium to student work experience is higher when pupils also work during the academic year and diminishes for later employment outcomes. When decomposing this total effect, it turns out that the direct returns to student work overcompensate its non-positive indirect effect via tertiary education enrolment.
C35|An endogenous regime-switching model of ordered choice with an application to federal funds rate target|This paper introduces a class of ordered probit models with endogenous switching among N latent regimes and possibly endogenous explanatory variables. The paper contributes to and bridges two strands of microeconometric literature. First, it extends endogenous switching regressions to models of ordered choice with N unknown regimes. Second, it generalizes the existing zero-inflated ordered probit models to make them suitable for ordinal data that take on negative, zero and positive values and characterized by abundant and heterogeneous zero observations. From a macroeconomic perspective, it is the first attempt to implement regime switching and accommodate endogenous regressors in discrete-choice monetary policy rules. Recurring oscillating regime switches in the three regimes evolving endogenously in response to the state of economy are detected during a relatively stable policy period such as the Greenspan era. The Monte Carlo experiments and an application to the federal funds rate target demonstrate that ignoring endogeneity and regime-switching environment can lead to seriously distorted statistical inference. In the simulations, the new models perform well in small samples. In the application, they not only have better in-sample fit for the Greenspan era than the existing models but also forecast better out of sample for the entire Bernanke era, correctly predicting 91 percent of policy decisions.
C35|Quasi-Bayesian Inference for Latent Variable Models with External Information: Application to generalized linear mixed models for biased data|There is a vast literature proposing non-Bayesian methods for making inferences incorporating auxiliary information such as population-level marginal moments. However, it is not feasible to apply these methods directly to latent variable models because the data augmentation approach, in which latent variables are treated as incidental parameters and then generated, is not developed. In this paper, we propose a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm with data augmentation for latent variable models for cases in which we have both a sampled dataset and additional information such as population level moments. The resulting quasi-Bayesian inference with auxiliary information is very straightforwaed to implement, and consistency and asymptotic variance of the quasi- Bayesian posterior mean estimators from the MCMC outputs are shown in this paper. The proposed method is especially useful when the dataset is biased but we have an unbiased large sample for some variables or population marginal moments in which it is difficult to correctly specify the sample selection model. For illustrative purposes, we apply the proposed estimation method to generalized linear mixed models for biased data both in simulation studies and in real data analysis. The proposed method can be used to make inferences in non/semi-parametric latent variable models by incorporating the existing semi-parametric Bayesian algorithms such as the Blocked Gibbs sampler in the MCMC iteration.
C35|Polarization and Persistence in the Japanese Labor Market|This study analyzes the persistence of regular and non-regular employment status in Japan for workers that change jobs. In particular, we investigate two hypotheses behind this persistence. The first is the dependence of the employment status in the current job on that in the previous job. The second is the dependence of the employment status in the current job on that in the initial job, which is called first job effects. While both types of dependence are empirically verified, the former is shown to be quantitatively more substantial. Therefore, the serially dependent structure of employment status matters critically to the segmentation of the labor market in Japan.
C35|Social stratification, life chances and vulnerability to poverty in South Africa|The wave of upbeat stories on the developing world's emerging middle class has reinvigorated a debate on how social class in general and the middle class in particular ought to be defined and empirically measured. The contribution this paper makes to this literature is both conceptual and empirical. The conceptual contribution consists in proposing a schema of social stratification with particular relevance for the emerging and developing country context marked by high economic insecurity. Building on a recently developed framework that defines the middle class in relation to their (in)vulnerability to poverty, in this paper, we propose a multi-layered class model that differentiates five social classes: (i) the chronic poor, characterised by high poverty persistence, (ii) the transient poor, who have above average chances of escaping poverty, (iii) the non-poor but vulnerable, whose basic needs are currently being met but who face above average risks of slipping into poverty, (iv) the middle class, who are in a better position to maintain a non-poor standard of living even in the event of negative shocks, and (v) the elite, whose living standards situate them far above the average. The empirical contribution consists in the application of this conceptual innovation to the South African case using a model of poverty transitions that is fitted to four waves of panel data from the National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS) covering 2008 through to 2014/15. Given the classification derived in this paper, we find that only about 20 per cent of the South African population can be considered as stably middle class. Africans remain underrepresented in the middle class, and race is still one of the strongest predictors of poverty in South Africa. Members of larger, female headed, or rural households face a higher risk of poverty, and are less likely to enter the ranks of the middle class. Having access to stable labour market income, by contrast, is a key determinant for households to achieve economic stability in South Africa.
C35|Insiders vs outsiders in the hotel sector: is it worth entering an official classification system?|We investigate whether entering an official hotel classification system is as lucrative as suggested in the tourism management literature. Indeed, in countries in which the official hotel classification system is voluntary, a substantial fraction of hotels choose not to enter the system, and are outsiders. Considering that being classified (being insider) as a predictor of the rate structure may raise an endogeneity issue, we apply the recursive semi-ordered probit model to control for endogeneity and appropriately assess the effect of being classified on price rates. Using a sample of 357 hotels of Corsica, we show that, in contrast to previous research, classification does not provide any rate premium. We also fully derive conditional probabilities and partial effects on differences in conditional probabilities within the recursive semi-ordered probit model.
C35|Heterogeneous Effects of a Nonlinear Price Schedule for Outpatient Care|Nonlinear price schedules generally have heterogeneous effects on health‐care demand. We develop and apply a finite mixture bivariate probit model to analyze whether there are heterogeneous reactions to the introduction of a nonlinear price schedule in the German statutory health insurance system. In administrative insurance claims data from the largest German health insurance plan, we find that some individuals strongly react to the new price schedule while a second group of individuals does not react. Post‐estimation analyses reveal that the group of the individuals who do not react to the reform includes the relatively sick. These results are in line with forward‐looking behavior: Individuals who are already sick expect that they will hit the kink in the price schedule and thus are less sensitive to the co‐payment.

C35|A Note on the Estimation of Job Amenities and Labor Productivity|This note introduces a maximum likelihood estimator of the value of job amenities and labor productivity in a single matching market based on the observation of equilibrium matches and wages. The estimation procedure simultaneously fits both the matching patterns and the wage curve. Our estimator is suited for applications to a wide range of assignment problems.
C35|The employment consequences of SMEs’ credit constraints in the wake of the Great Recession|This article takes advantage of access to confidential matched bank-firm data relative to the Belgian economy to investigate how employment decisions of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have been affected by credit constraints in the wake of the Great Recession. Variability in banks’ financial health is used as an exogenous determinant of firms’ access to credit. Estimates suggest that SMEs borrowing money from pre-crisis less healthy banks were significantly more likely to be affected by a credit constraint and, in turn, to adjust their labour input downwards than pre-crisis clients of more healthy banks. Yet, findings also indicate that employment consequences of credit shortages have been essentially detrimental for SMEs experiencing a negative demand shock or facing severe product market competition. Finally, results show that credit-constrained SMEs adjusted their workforce significantly more at the extensive margin than their non-constrained counterparts, but also that they relied more intensively on temporary layoff schemes.

C35|Should Flavors be Banned in E-cigarettes? Evidence on Adult Smokers and Recent Quitters from a Discrete Choice Experiment|E-cigarettes are available in over 7,000 flavors, whereas all flavors but menthol are banned in combustible cigarettes. The FDA recently requested a ban on e-cigarette flavors, but was rejected. The FDA is again considering this ban and also a ban on menthol in combustible cigarettes, but there is little information on the impacts of alternative bans on the market for combustible and e-cigarettes. Our study provides these much-needed estimates. We conduct a discrete choice experiment on a nationally representative sample of 2,031 adult smokers and recent quitters that we collected. We estimate preferences for flavors and other attributes and use these preferences to predict the demand for each cigarette type and for “none of these.” We then predict the impact of alternative bans and compare results for the current treatment of flavors to results for the alternative bans. We find that the recently denied FDA ban would result in increased choice of combustible cigarettes, the most harmful alternative. However, a ban on menthol in combustibles would result in the greatest reduction in smoking of combustibles. Our results are timely and policy-relevant, suggesting which flavor bans are likely to be most effective in protecting public health.
C35|Uso de sensores electroquímicos de bajo costo para el monitoreo de la calidad del aire en el distrito de San Isidro - Lima - Perú|En este trabajo se muestran los resultados preliminares del monitoreo y de la estimación de contaminantes atmosféricos en un punto estratégico dentro del distrito de San Isidro, Lima - Perú. Se emplearon sensores electroquímicos de bajo costo, portátiles, inalámbricos y geolocalizables para la captura de los niveles de contaminación que permiten obtener en tiempo real valores confiables que podrían emplearse no sólo para cuantificar la exposición de contaminación atmosférica sino también para prevención y control, e incluso para fines legislativos. Para la previsión de los niveles de CO2 y de SO2 se aplicaron algoritmos de inteligencia computacional, específicamente redes neuronales.
C35|Individual heterogeneity in the association between social participation and self-rated health. A panel study on BHPS|In the last ten years interest in social capital as mechanism for understanding actual and perceived health has been increasing among economists. Although pathways by which social participation, as dimension of social capital, may have positive effect on health are well understood, empirical evidence on the relationship between social participation and self-rated health is mixed and it has never addressed the empirical problem of individual heterogeneity. This longitudinal study investigates the relationship between social participation (being member, active, and both member and active) in associations and self-rated health taking into account individual heterogeneity bias. The paper uses five waves of the British Household Panel Survey from 1991 to 1995 (unbalanced panel N=45,745). Three types of estimations are implemented. The first is an OLS with fixed effects on the original ordinal variable self-rated health (SOH). The second uses a dichotomization of the ordered variable self-rated (SOH2) and applies a logistic fixed effect estimation. The last estimator is the ordered logit with fixed effects implemented by Baetschmann et al. (2015). All the empirical estimations show a positive and weak significant relationship between active membership and self-rated health.
C35|Maximum likelihood estimation and inference for high dimensional nonlinear factor models with application to factor-augmented regressions|This paper reestablishes the main results in Bai (2003) and Bai and Ng (2006) for high dimensional nonlinear factor models, with slightly stronger conditions on the relative magnitude of N(number of subjects) and T(number of time periods). Factors and loadings are estimated by maximum likelihood. Convergence rates of the estimated factor space and loading space and asymptotic normality of the estimated factors and loadings are established under mild conditions that allow for linear models, Logit, Probit, Tobit, Poisson and some other nonlinear models. The density function is allowed to vary across subjects, thus mixed models are explicitly allowed for. For factor-augmented regressions, this paper establishes the limit distributions of the parameter estimates, the conditional mean as well as the forecast when factors estimated from nonlinear/mixed data are used as proxies for the true factors.
C35|Farmersâ€™ perception on climate change-driven rice production loss in drought-prone and groundwater-depleted areas of Bangladesh: An ordered probit analysis|The existing literature pays inadequate attention to any rigorous analysis of perceived severity of climate-driven crop losses, their determinants and implications. The present study fills this gap in three ways. It investigates farmersâ€™ perception about the severity of loss for three rice crops, identifies their determinants and explores policy implications. In doing so, it employs an ordered probit model to data from 1,800 farm households from districts typifying drought- prone and groundwater depleted areas of Bangladesh. Perceived severity of rice production losses was not uniform for all rice crops being higher for the rain-fed crops and appeared broadly consistent with available evidence. Severity of perceived crop loss was associated with geophysical factors, household characteristics, institutional and market accessibility, and household adaptation strategy. Household resource endowment had no perceptible effect on production loss. The impact of these factors was specific to the crop and severity of perceived loss. This study has several policy implications involving market, R & D and institutional support based options. Strengthening support systems for institutional and market accessibility, and science driven adaptation strategy including generation and wider dissemination of drought tolerant rice varieties, and enhancing farmersâ€™ capacity to change rice varieties on a regular basis constitute focal areas.
C35|Objectives’ alignment between members and agricultural cooperatives| Members’ commitment lessens when agricultural cooperatives grow larger. Their organization becomes more complex, and their membership more heterogeneous, which threatens their sustainability and leads them to implement specific mechanisms for collective decisions. We explore how the alignment of objectives between a multi-purpose cooperative and its members influences member commitment. We estimate a multinomial probit model on a cross-section sample of 3205 members from a large agricultural cooperative in France. We assess the determinants of member commitment through four factors: the offer of new agricultural practices, the availability of outlets and supplies to members, the farm distance to the cooperative headquarters and the farm governance. We show that the adoption of new agricultural practices has a small but significant effect. The availability of outlets and supplies has the strongest effect on the economic involvement of the farmers. Other determinants, such as farm governance or geographical distance to the cooperative headquarters, also reinforce member commitment.
C35|Effects of Insurance Incentives on Road Safety: Evidence from a Natural Experiment in China|We investigate the incentive effects of insurance experience rating on road safety by evaluating the claim frequency following a regulatory reform introduced in a pilot city of China. Our contribution to the growing literature on moral hazard is to offer a neat identification of a causal effect of experience rating on road safety by employing the differences-in-differences methodology in the framework of a natural experiment. The pre-treatment placebo test corroborates the assumption that the pilot city and the control city share the same pre-reform time trends in claims. We find that basing insurance pricing on traffic violations reduces claim frequency significantly. These results are robust to the inclusion of vehicle controls, alternative definitions of claim frequency, two placebo experiment tests, and several robustness checks. The effects of basing pricing on past claims are not significant.
C35|Illegal Behavior in the Public Administration|"This analysis addresses the corruption of Italian mayors, and it is carried out by analyzing the sentences of the Italian Supreme Court in the last decade. The research questions are as follows: Is corruption effectively prosecuted and punished in Italy? Are there signs of social stigma or reputational damage for corrupt politicians? To this aim, we focus on i) justice efficiency and ii) social tolerance of corruption. The results reported here reveal that the probability of re-election increases in small urban areas, when the mayor is a strong leader and when he colludes with entrepreneurs external to the council, thus reinforcing the hypotheses that people vote for corrupt leaders because they receive favors from those leaders or because they perceive that those leaders are efficient in delivering public goods. The judicial system works well against organized crime, probably because of the special proceedings against ""mafiosi""; however, it is more inefficient when a mayor colludes with his staff: evidently, higher efficiency may be pursued through the implementation of a stricter legal institutional framework."
C35|Marginal effects in multivariate probit models|Abstract Estimation of marginal or partial effects of covariates x on various conditional parameters or functionals is often a main target of applied microeconometric analysis. In the specific context of probit models, estimation of partial effects involving outcome probabilities will often be of interest. Such estimation is straightforward in univariate models, and results covering the case of quadrant probability marginal effects in bivariate probit models for jointly distributed outcomes y have previously been described in the literature. This paper’s goals are to extend Greene’s results to encompass the general $$M\ge 2$$ M ≥ 2 multivariate probit context for arbitrary orthant probabilities and to extended these results to models that condition on subvectors of y and to multivariate ordered probit data structures. It is suggested that such partial effects are broadly useful in situations, wherein multivariate outcomes are of concern.
C35|Analyzing the dependences of multi-category purchases on interactions of marketing variables|Abstract We extend the usual specification of the multivariate probit model frequently used to analyze multi-category purchase incidence data by introducing interaction effects between marketing variables. Models are estimated by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation method using 24,047 shopping visits made by a random sample of 1500 households in one specific grocery store over a one year period. Our data refer to a total of 25 food and non-food product categories and include socio-demographic household attributes in addition to purchases and marketing variables. Information criteria agree on the superiority of the extended specification. Estimation results demonstrate that many interaction effects are erroneously attributed to the main effects of marketing variables if one applies the usual specification instead. We derive managerial implications with respect to sales revenue by stochastic simulation. If managers base decisions on the usual specification in spite of its worse statistical performance, they run the risk to overestimate sales revenue increases due to sales promotion activities.
C35|Multi-category purchase incidences with marketing cross effects|Abstract We focus on cross effects of marketing variables and cross category dependences for multi-category decisions which households take during a shopping trip to a retail store. A cross effect is defined as the effect which a marketing variable used for a certain product category exerts on purchases of another category. Using Dirichlet process mixture models with multivariate probit components we analyze purchase incidences of 24,047 shopping visits of a random sample of 1500 households. Independent variables of these models encompass marketing variables for 25 product categories and household attributes. We discuss differences between the two best performing models, a full model which includes both cross effects and cross category dependences, and a related restricted model which ignores cross effects. We obtain several high and significant differences with respect to category constants and cross category dependences between these two models. We also present explanations for the larger (in absolute terms) cross effects of features or displays. We demonstrate that by ignoring cross effects management runs the risk to obtain in many product categories too optimistic forecasts of sales revenue changes due to promotions. In contrast to previous related work suggesting not to use promotions which are not tailored to individual households in any of the investigated categories, we obtain support for such promotions in at least 48 % of the 25 product categories. In addition, based on the full model we demonstrate that often different categories are appropriate for promotions which are targeted at household clusters.
C35|Personality and economic choices|There is substantial variation in individual preferences for public goods, yet much of that variation remains poorly understood. However, simple measures of personality can help to explain economic values and choices in a systematic way. In this paper, we examine the effects of personality on individual economic choices over public environmental goods. Based on three datasets from three separate stated preference studies, we use a hybrid choice econometric framework to examine the effects of personality on preferences for the status quo, changes in environmental quality, and costs of investing in environmental improvements. We find effects that are consistent across all datasets. Personality, a stable feature of an individual's character that is simple to measure, enriches explanations of why the demand for environmental goods varies across people, provides an indication of how different people are likely to react to the introduction of environmental policies, and explains substantial differences in Willingness to Pay.
C35|Pension Rules and Labour Market Mobility|This paper makes use of a natural experiment to examine effects of potential capital losses and general attractiveness of pension schemes on employees' propensity to change jobs. On January 1st 2004, the two largest pension funds in the Netherlands, for civil servants and for the health care sector, changed their pension scheme from a final salary to an average salary. This industry-level change excludes the possibility that a negative correlation between having a job with an attractive pension scheme and the number of labour market transitions is driven by self-selection of workers into jobs with an attractive pension arrangement. Using individual data covering the entire Dutch population, we estimate discrete choice models for job-to-job transitions. The results show that the number of job transitions of civil servants significantly increased at the onset of the new pension rules. The changing pension rules affected the propensity to change jobs for individuals working in the health care sector only to a smaller extent.
C35|Using compositional and Dirichlet models for market share regression| When the aim is to model market shares, the marketing literature proposes some regression models which can be qualified as attraction models. They are generally derived from an aggregated version of the multinomial logit model. But aggregated multinomial logit models (MNL) and the so-called generalized multiplicative competitive interaction models (GMCI) present some limitations: in their simpler version they do not specify brand-specific and cross effect parameters. In this paper, we consider alternative models: the Dirichlet model (DIR) and the compositional model (CODA). DIR allows to introduce brand-specific parameters and CODA allows additionally to consider cross effect parameters. We show that these two models can be written in a similar fashion, called attraction form, as the MNL and the GMCI models. As market share models are usually interpreted in terms of elasticities, we also use this notion to interpret the DIR and CODA models. We compare the properties of the models in order to explain why CODA and DIR models can outperform traditional market share models. An application to the automobile market is presented where we model brands market shares as a function of media investments, controlling for the brands price and scrapping incentive. We compare the quality of the models using measures adapted to shares.
C35|Interpreting the impact of explanatory variables in compositional models|Regression models have been developed for the case where the dependent variable is a vector of shares. Some of them, from the marketing literature, are easy to interpret but they are quite simple and can only be complexified at the expense of a very large number of parameters to estimate. Other models, from the mathematical literature, are called compositional regression models and are based on the simplicial geometry (a vector of shares is called a composition, shares are components, and a composition lies in the simplex). These models are transformation models: they use a log-ratio transformation of shares. They are very flexible in terms of explanatory variables and complexity (component-specific and cross-effect parameters), but their interpretation is not straightforward, due to the fact that shares add up to one. This paper combines both literatures in order to obtain a performing market-share model allowing to get relevant and appropriate interpretations, which can be used for decision making in practical cases. For example, we are interested in modeling the impact of media investments on automobile manufacturers sales. In order to take into account the competition, we model the brands market-shares as a function of (relative) media investments. We furthermore focus on compositional models where some explanatory variables are also compositional. Two specifications are possible: in Model A, a unique coefficient is associated to each compositional explanatory variable, whereas in Model B a compositional explanatory variable is associated to component-specific and cross-effect coefficients. Model A and Model B are estimated for our application in the B segment of the French automobile market, from 2003 to 2015. In order to enhance the interpretability of these models, we present different types of impact assessment measures (marginal effects, elasticities and odds ratios) and we show that elasticities are particularly useful to isolate the impact of an explanatory variable on a particular share. We show that elasticities can be equivalently computed from the transformed model and from the model in the simplex and that they are linked to directional C-derivatives of simplex-valued function of a simplex variable. Direct and cross effects of media investments are computed for both models. Model B shows interesting non-symmetric synergies between brands, and Renault seems to be the most elastic brand to its own media investments. In order to determine if component-specific and cross-effect parameters are needed to improve the quality of the model (Model B) or if a global parameter is reasonable (Model A), we compare the goodness-of-fit of the two models using (out-of-sample) quality measures adapted for share data.
C35|Equivalent representations of discrete-time two-state panel data models|There are two common approaches to analyzing discrete-time two-state panel data: one focuses on modeling the determinants of state occupancy, the other on modeling the determinants of transition between states. This note shows that there are one-to-one correspondences between the two representations, between the two probability distributions in an unrestricted context, and between low-order Markov models of state occupancy and semi-Markov models of transition between states with strictly limited duration dependence.
C35|Adoption of a New Payment Method: Theory and Experimental Evidence|We model the introduction of a new payment method, e.g., e-money, that competes with an existing payment method, e.g., cash. The new payment method involves relatively lower per-transaction costs for both buyers and sellers, but sellers must pay a fixed fee to accept the new payment method. As a result of the network effects, our model admits two symmetric pure strategy Nash equilibria. In one equilibrium, the new payment method is not adopted and all transactions continue to be carried out using the existing payment method. In the other equilibrium, the new payment method is adopted and completely replaces the existing payment method. The equilibrium involving only the new payment method is socially optimal as it minimizes total transaction costs. Using this model, we study the question of equilibrium selection by conducting a laboratory experiment. We find that, depending on the fixed fee charged for the adoption of the new payment method and on the choices made by participants on both sides of the market, either equilibrium can be selected. More precisely, a lower fixed fee for sellers favors very quick adoption of the new payment method by all participants, while for a sufficiently high fee, sellers gradually learn to refuse to accept the new payment method and transactions are largely conducted using the existing payment method. We also find that an evolutionary learning model captures the dynamics of the experimental data well.
C35|Adoption Costs of Financial Innovation: Evidence from Italian ATM Cards|The discrete choice to adopt a financial innovation affects a household’s exposure to inflation and transactions costs. We model this adoption decision as being subject to an unobserved cost. Estimating the cost requires a dynamic structural model, to which we apply a conditional choice simulation estimator. A novel feature of our method is that preference parameters are estimated separately, from the Euler equations of a shopping-time model, to aid statistical efficiency. We apply this method to study ATM card adoption in the Bank of Italy’s Survey of Household Income and Wealth. There, the implicit adoption cost is too large to be consistent with standard models of rational choice, even when sorted by age, cohort, education or region.
C35|A composite index of inflation tendencies in the euro area|Assessing underlying inflation developments is crucial for a correct calibration of the monetary policy stance. To monitor the adjustment in the path of euro area inflation towards the ECB’s definition of price stability, we select a number of indicators of price dynamics in the area. We then construct a composite index summarizing the information contained in those indicators by estimating several univariate probability models. The index, which provides a synthetic measure of inflationary pressures net of the most volatile components, can be interpreted as gauging the probability of inflation returning to 1.9 per cent or over within a given time horizon. Our findings, which are based on the information available in July 2017, signal that, despite the improvement in price dynamics since the beginning of the year, the adjustment of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2 per cent over the medium term is still limited and far from being sustained.
C35|Quasi-ML estimation, Marginal Effects and Asymptotics for Spatial Autoregressive Nonlinear Models|In this paper we propose a Partial-MLE for a general spatial nonlinear probit model, i.e. SARAR(1,1)-probit, defined through a SARAR(1,1) latent linear model. This model encompasses the SAE(1)-probit model, considered by Wang et al. (2013), and the more interesting SAR(1)-probit model. We perform a complete asymptotic analysis, and account for the possible finite sum approximation of the covariance matrix (Quasi-MLE) to speed the computation. Moreover, we address the issue of the choice of the groups (couples, in our case) by proposing an algorithm based on a minimum KL-divergence problem. Finally, we provide appropriate definitions of marginal effects for this setting. Finite sample properties of the estimator are studied through a simulation exercise and a real data application. In our simulations, we also consider both sparse and dense matrices for the specification of the true spatial models, and cases of model misspecifications due to different assumed weighting matrices.
C35|Resolving the Public Sector Wage Premium Puzzle by Indirect Inference|This paper investigates the public-sector wage premium in the UK using a microfounded economic model and indirect inference. To answer the question whether there is public-sector wage premium, we ask an equivalent question—whether a model assuming perfect competition can explain the data. The neoclassical labour economic model is tested and estimated without introducing any ad hoc gap between the theoretical and empirical models. Popular econometric models are used as auxiliary models to summarise the data features, based on which we evaluate the distance between the observed data and the model-simulated data. We show that it is not the non-market factors, but the total costs and benefits of working in different sectors and so simple market forces, that create the public-sector wage premium. In other words, there is no inefficiency or unfairness in the labour market to justify government intervention. In addition, selection bias test can be incorporated into the indirect inference procedures in a straightforward way, and we find no evidence for it in the data.
C35|Demand for sexual services in Britain: Does Sex Education Matter?|On survey data from 1999 to 2001 and 2010 to 2012, we estimate the demand for commercial sex among British men. We estimate a zero‐inflated count model, which takes into account the probability of not participating in the sex market and number of times with a prostitute. We find that sex education in school has a negative and significant role in the demand for paid sex. We also find that men with a typical middle‐class income are more likely to buy sex. Travelling abroad or living in London increases the likelihood of British men buying sex.
C35|Housing Environmental Risk in Urban Areas: Cross Country Comparison and Policy Implications|The main aim of this paper is to assess whether there is a statistically significant environmental impact of cities within European countries. Second, starting from the estimated environmental impact of cities within European countries, the paper investigates whether cross-country variation can be explained by macro-economic factors and government policies which can play a role in mitigating such an impact. We start from individual evidence (EU-SILC data) to obtain a measure of the environmental impact of cities within countries, and then correlate the latter with macro variables to explain European heterogeneity. These estimates confirm that the environmental risk for households is particularly perceived in more densely populated urban agglomerations, although the marginal effects are quite heterogeneous between countries. Macroeconomic factors such as inequality, wealth, taxation and public spending on the environment, and macroeconomic constraints such as the public finance disequilibrium produce a strong heterogeneity between countries in determining the marginal effects of urban metropolises on household environmental risk.
C35|Estimación de la probabilidad de incumplimiento para las firmas del sector económico industrial y comercial en una entidad financiera colombiana entre los años 2009 y 2014|En este artículo se estima la probabilidad de incumplimiento para las firmas que tienen obligaciones contractuales con una entidad financiera colombiana entre 2009 y 2014. A través de un modelo logístico ordinal generalizado se encontró que la probabilidad de incumplimiento está asociada a las variables financieras liquidez, endeudamiento, rentabilidad y eficiencia. También se incorporó una variable de comportamiento, dos dicotómicas asociadas al tamaño de las firmas y una para el crecimiento económico del país. Además, se verificó el supuesto de líneas paralelas. Los resultados son previsibles y acordes con la teoría económica de riesgo. ***** In this paper, we estimated the probability of non-compliance for enterprises that have contractual obligations with a Colombian financial company between 2009 and 2014. Using a generalized logistical ordinal model, we found that the probability of non-compliance is related to financial variables such as: liquidity, indebtedness, profitability, and efficacy. We also included a behavioural variable, two dichotomous variables associated with the size of the companies, and another variable for Colombia’s economic growth. We verify the premise of parallel lines. The results are predictable and correspond to the economic theory of risk.
C35|Retornos salariales para Colombia, un análisis cuantílico|Este artículo analiza los retornos salariales de los jóvenes y adultos, comparando la influencia de la educación y la experiencia. Se examina principalmente la teoría del capital humano y las críticas a esta, a través del estudio de la relación entre educación, experiencia y salarios. El análisis empírico se base en el modelo de Mincer, pero mediante las regresiones cuantílicas, para determinar, por 10 cuantiles en cada grupo, cómo se dan los retornos salariales. Se comprueba que para los jóvenes hay mayor impacto de adquirir experiencia que la educación sobre los retornos salariales, lo que afecta la inserción laboral y el obtener mayores ingresos laborales.
C35|Clap along if you know what happiness is to you! Wealth, Trust and Subjective Well-being|Social capital and especially trust are the foundation of most personal relationships and it is considered a key factor of many economic and social outcomes since Banfield (1958), Coleman (1990) and Putnam (2000). The purpose of this study is twofold. First, we investigate the role of wealth of countries in explaining trust and another proxy of social capital, the voluntary association membership. Secondly, we analyze the link between wealth, social capital and subjective well-being. This paper answer the following questions: Does living in a richer country enhance the willingness of people to trust each other? Does living in a richer country (regarding total wealth, intangible and social capital) enhance the subjective well-being? Do trust and happiness equations differ across countries, following their wealth structures? Our original empirical approach address simultaneously these three questions, using a recursive mixed-process model, with bootstrapped standard errors accounting for the sampling design. We support the idea that social capital may turn wealth into subjective happiness and can build resilience in time of crisis.
C35|Statistical Modelling of Second Round Qualification at FIFA World Cup Tournaments|In this paper, we model the predictors of second round qualification at FIFA World Cup tournaments. We utilize data covering the last four tournaments namely 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2014. We employ the methodology of Norton et al. (2004) to estimate the predictors. Also, we establish how the significance of these predictors differs across the participating continents. In addition, we determine the likelihood of single continent and continent pair dominance in the second round stage. We hope to revisit these findings as new rules unfold and notable changes that may alter the existing trend become evident.
C35|Semiparametric estimation of the random utility model with rank-ordered choice data|We propose semiparametric methods for estimating random utility models using rank-ordered choice data. Our primary method is the generalized maximum score (GMS) estimator. With partially rank-ordered data, the GMS estimator allows for arbitrary forms of interpersonal heteroskedasticity. With fully rank-ordered data, the GMS estimator becomes considerably more flexible, allowing for random coefficients and alternative-specific heteroskedasticity and correlations. The GMS estimator has a non-standard asymptotic distribution and a convergence rate of N−1∕3. We proceed to construct its smoothed version which is asymptotically normal with a faster convergence rate of N−d∕(2d+1), where d≥2 increases in the strength of smoothness assumptions.
C35|Optimizing Policymakers' Loss Functions in Crisis Prediction: Before, Within or After?|Early-warning models most commonly optimize signaling thresholds on crisis probabilities. The ex-post threshold optimization is based upon a loss function accounting for preferences between forecast errors, but comes with two crucial drawbacks: unstable thresholds in recursive estimations and an in-sample overfit at the expense of out-ofsample performance. We propose two alternatives for threshold setting: (i) including preferences in the estimation itself and (ii) setting thresholds ex-ante according to preferences only. We provide simulated and real-world evidence that this simplification results in stable thresholds and improves out-of-sample performance. Our solution is not restricted to binary-choice models, but directly transferable to the signaling approach and all probabilistic early-warning models.
C35|The employment consequences of SMEs’ credit constraints in the wake of the great recession|This article takes advantage of access to confidential matched bank-firm data relative to the Belgian economy to investigate whether and how employment decisions of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have been affected by credit constraints in the wake of the Great Recession. Variability in banks’ financial health following the Great Recession is used as an exogenous determinant of firms’ access to credit. Two-stage least squares and bivariate probit estimates suggest that SMEs borrowing money from pre-crisis less healthy banks were significantly more likely to be affected by a credit constraint and, in turn, to adjust their labour input downwards than pre-crisis clients of more healthy banks. More precisely, estimates show that credit-constrained SMEs were ceteris paribus between 40 and 65% more likely to reduce their workforce than their counterparts not facing such constraints. Yet, findings also indicate that employment consequences of credit shortages depend heavily on the environment in which SMEs operate. Results indeed indicate that credit constraints have been essentially detrimental for employment among SMEs experiencing a negative demand shock or facing severe product market competition. Finally, in terms of adjustment channels, results show that credit-constrained SMEs adjusted their workforce significantly more at the extensive margin (through individual layoffs, reduction of temporary employment and early retirement) than their non-constrained counterparts, but also that they relied more intensively on temporary layoff schemes (for economic reasons).
C35|Social interactions under incomplete information with heterogeneous expectations|We analyze social interactions where the conditional expectations about group members’ behaviors are heterogeneous with individual features as well as asymmetric private information, under the framework of a simultaneous move game with incomplete information. A functional contraction mapping is used to establish the existence of a unique Bayesian Nash equilibrium. The method of nested fixed point maximum likelihood estimation performs well for both linear and binary choice models. If heterogeneity is assumed away, estimates will be biased. For the 2011 National Youth Tobacco Survey data, significant peer effects on juvenile tobacco use are found.
C35|Willingness to pay for emissions reduction: Application of choice modeling under uncertainty and different management options|This paper presents the results of a choice modeling survey of households in Queensland, Australia to assess values for reductions in national greenhouse emissions by 2020. The study is novel in two main ways. First, labeled alternatives were used to assess whether the types of management options for reducing net emissions (green power, energy efficient technologies or carbon capture) are significant in understanding preferences for reducing emissions. Second, the importance of the level and type of uncertainty involved in reductions is tested. The types of uncertainty include (1) the uncertainty of achieving emissions reduction and (2) the uncertainty of international participation as the percentage of total global emissions covered by international agreements. The results of this survey identified how choice responses vary when the level of uncertainty associated with emissions reduction options is included within choice alternatives.
C35|The Specification of Dynamic Discrete-Time Two-State Panel Data Models|This paper compares two approaches to analyzing longitudinal discrete-time binary outcomes. Dynamic binary response models focus on state occupancy and typically specify low-order Markovian state dependence. Multi-spell duration models focus on transitions between states and typically allow for state-specific duration dependence. We show that the former implicitly impose strong and testable restrictions on the transition probabilities. In a case study of poverty transitions, we show that these restrictions are severely rejected against the more flexible multi-spell duration models.
C35|Spatial Competition in the French Supermarket Industry|This paper challenges the conventional wisdom of a competitive grocery retail sector in France. To measure the intensity of competition in this sector, I develop a structural model of spatial competition that accounts for (i) market geography on consumers' preferences, and (ii) differences in their shopping list. The demand estimates are used to recover stores' price-cost margin under alternative pricing strategies. I select the best pricing model by applying non-nested tests and show that retailers noticeably distort their offer in highly concentrated markets. Retail competition in the French supermarket industry appears to be highly localized in that margins are very sensitive to the presence of a competitor within a few kilometers. Finally, I perform counterfactual experiments to quantify the expected gain of an additional store on consumer welfare and retail prices,
C35|Nueva evidencia de la desigualdad de oportunidades en la demanda de educación superior en Colombia: 2000-2015|El objetivo de este documento es analizar la demanda de educación universitaria y sus determinantes en Colombia. Para ello, se utilizan modelos de elección discreta robustos que tienen en cuenta el sesgo de selección muestral, debido a que la heterogeneidad no observada de los estudiantes que terminan el bachillerato, que está correlacionada con la decisión de demandar educación universitaria. Los resultados muestran la corrección del sesgo de selección y que la probabilidad de demandar educación universitaria en Colombia está condicionada por características propias de algunos grupos sociales.
C35|Determinants of Land and Labour Market Participation Decisions in Rural Ethiopia|This paper attempts to determine the factors influencing farmers' land and labour market participation decisions in rural Ethiopia. A multivariate probit estimation technique is used to account for potential interdependencies between land and labour allocation strategies. Results suggest that households that are better endowed with farming resources such as oxen and farming skills are more likely to get access to more land and labour through factor markets, while households that are less endowed with these resources are more likely to rent out their land and participate in off-farm jobs. The complementary nature of land renting out and involvement in off-farm work suggests that policy makers should give due consideration to the development of rural off-farm jobs to reduce poverty in rural areas.
C35|Dynamic modeling of bundled tillage-crop choices: impact of soil erodibility on the interactions between continuous conservation tillage and crop rotations in Iowa| Recent agronomic and soil science research draws attention to the importance of continuous conservation tillage (CCT), as many environmental benefits of this conservation tillage are realized only when it is used continuously over a period of years. However, little is known about the dynamics of farmers’ tillage choices. To address the need for quantitative estimates of time patterns of tillage practices and the factors that affect the use of CCT, the paper to be presented develops and estimates a dynamic model of bundled tillage-crop choices for the state of Iowa. We develop a first-order, four-state Markov chain model of tillage-crop dynamics for corn and soybean production systems. We assume that matrixes of transition from one tillage-crop state to another could vary by county but remain stationary from 1992 to 1997, and use quadratic programming to estimate the transition matrix for each of the 99 counties in the state using county-average, year–and crop–specific tillage data from Conservation Technology Information Center for 1992-1997. Analysis of Variance of the estimated county-specific transition matrixes shows that CCT occurs more often on Highly Erodible Land (HEL) when compared to other cropland. Also, the county-average probabilities of rotational conservation tillage (RCT), i.e., the farming systems in which CT is rotated with conventional tillage systems, are higher in the counties that have higher proportion of HEL. In addition, we identified a significant effect of crop rotations on tillage dynamics: the cropland under corn monoculture is less likely to be in RCT when compared to land in corn-soybean rotation. The results of the study indicate that both natural conditions (soil erodibility) and other economic choices (crop rotations) affect farmers’ choices of CCT and RCT in Iowa.
C35|A Choice Experiment Study on the Farmers’ Attitudes toward Biogas and Waste Reuse in a Nitrates Vulnerable Zone| The present study aims at assessing dairy farmers’ preferences over different technological options related to the anaerobic digestion technology. A Choice Experiment study was conducted in Arborea, a NVZ dairy district located in Sardinia, Italy. The results show that profitability of the investment is a general driver of the choice. Heterogeneity of preferences is observed, especially as regards the options of investment on-farm or off-farm. Farmers who are especially interested in an investment on-farm are characterized by higher awareness of energy issues; while farmers with excess waste load would prefer an off-farm investment. Digestate treatment options have practically been ignored in our choice experiments: farmers do not seem aware of the opportunities offered by further processing of the digestate to improve management of the farm waste. New regulations associated with the Circular Economy EU package could increase the farmers’ perception of economic benefits associated with the adoption of anaerobic digestion technologies.
C35|State dependence and unobserved heterogeneity in a double hurdle model for remittances: evidence from immigrants to Germany|The empirical modelling of remitting behaviour has been the object of a considerable amount of micro-level literature. The increasing availability of panel datasets makes it possible to explore the persistence in transfer decisions as a result of intertemporal choices, that may be consistent with several motivations to remit. Building a dynamic model with panel data poses the additional problem of dealing properly with permanent unobserved heterogeneity; moreover, the specific censored nature of international transfers has to be accounted for as well. In this paper, we propose a dynamic, random-effects double hurdle model for remittances: we combine the Maximum Likelihood estimator of the traditional double hurdle model for cross-section data (Jones, 1989) with the approach put forward by Heckman (1981b) for dealing with state dependence and unobserved heterogeneity in a non-linear setting. Our empirical evidence based on the German SOEP dataset suggests that there is significant state dependence in remitting behaviour consistent with migrants. intertemporal allocation of savings; at the same time, transaction costs are likely to affect the steadiness of transfers over time.
C35|Los determinantes y la persistencia de la sobreeducación en el Perú|El presente estudio analiza los determinantes de la sobreeducación y su permanencia en el tiempo. Por un lado, con respecto al primer punto, se encuentra que el hecho de haber estudiado en una universidad de buena calidad reduce la probabilidad de experimentar el fenómeno de la sobreeducación en casi seis puntos porcentuales. Asimismo, haber estudiado en una universidad pública disminuye dicha posibilidad en más de ocho puntos porcentuales. Por otro lado, con respecto a la persistencia del problema, se encontró́ que en promedio 77% de trabajadores sobreeducados continúan en la misma situación de un año a otro. En general, la persistencia es alta pues más del 50% continúa sobreeducado incluso luego de siete años de permanencia en el mercado laboral.
C35|Specification tests for the propensity score|This paper proposes new nonparametric diagnostic tools to assess the asymptotic validity of different treatment effects estimators that rely on the correct specification of the propensity score. We derive a particular restriction relating the propensity score distribution of treated and control groups, and develop specification tests based upon it. The resulting tests do not suffer from the “curse of dimensionality” when the vector of covariates is high-dimensional, are fully data-driven, do not require tuning parameters such as bandwidths, and are able to detect a broad class of local alternatives converging to the null at the parametric rate n−1∕2, with n the sample size. We show that the use of an orthogonal projection on the tangent space of nuisance parameters facilitates the simulation of critical values by means of a multiplier bootstrap procedure, and can lead to power gains. The finite sample performance of the tests is examined by means of a Monte Carlo experiment and an empirical application. Open-source software is available for implementing the proposed tests.
C35|Assessing financial stability risks from the real estate market in Italy|We provide an analytical framework for assessing financial stability risks arising from the real estate sector in Italy. This framework consists of two blocks: three complementary early warning models (EWMs) and a broad set of indicators related to the real estate market, to credit and to households. We focus separately on households and on firms engaged in construction, management and investment services in the real estate sector. Since in Italy there have been no real estate-related systemic banking crises, as vulnerability indicator we consider a continuous indicator represented by the ratio between the annual flow of bad debts related to the real estate sector and banks’ capital and reserves. We contribute to the recent literature on EWMs by implementing a Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) based on linear regression models with a continuous dependent variable of vulnerability and an ordered logit model with a discrete dependent variable of vulnerability classes. Both models exhibit good predictive abilities. Based on the BMA projections for the period from the third quarter of 2015 to the second quarter of 2016, banking vulnerability related to the real estate sector is expected to gradually decline.
C35|Determinantes de la morosidad de la cartera de microcrédito en Colombia|El microcrédito es una modalidad de préstamos orientada a financiar microempresas, hogares y personas que tienen acceso limitado al mercado de crédito formal. Teniendo en cuenta que desde 2002 la cartera de microcrédito ha crecido en la mayoría del tiempo a un ritmo mayor que la cartera total del sistema financiero y que esta modalidad de préstamos presenta un deterioro en los indicadores de riesgo de crédito desde finales de 2011, el objetivo de este trabajo es identificar los principales determinantes de la morosidad de los deudores en el pago de los microcréditos. Con tal fin, se hace uso del concepto de Información Suave, que incluye variables socioeconómicas de los deudores y características de las microempresas para determinar su impacto sobre la probabilidad de mora. Usando las metodologías Probit y Logit multinomial se encuentra que entre 2002 y mediados de 2014, existe evidencia estadística a favor de la hipótesis de que variables tales como la edad del deudor, el género, el número de personas que tiene a su cargo, el tipo de vivienda en que vive, los años de experiencia en la actividad que desarrolla, entre otras, clasificadas dentro de la categoría de Información Suave, tienen una relación significativa con dicha morosidad.
C35|Bonanzas y crisis de la actividad petrolera y su efecto sobre la economía colombiana|Este documento describe la importancia del petróleo en la economía colombiana y cuantifica su impacto sobre la deuda del gobierno, la tasa de cambio real y la actividad económica en los últimos treinta años. El trabajo resulta útil por la importancia histórica del petróleo y por el impacto macroeconómico que ocasionó la caída reciente del precio internacional del crudo. Para el ejercicio empírico se utiliza una metodología de Vectores Autoregresivos con parámetros cambiantes en el tiempo, VAR-PCT, la cual supone que la relación entre los precios y/o la producción de petróleo con las variables macroeconómicas cambia dinámicamente. Los resultados confirman que hay diferentes patrones de volatilidad estocástica de las variables incluidas en el modelo. De acuerdo con las funciones impulso respuesta, los choques positivos al precio del petróleo no causaron efectos significativos sobre la tasa de cambio real, excepto en 2004, cuando se observó una apreciación real. No obstante, para enero de 2015, un choque negativo al precio del 10% generaría una depreciación real de aproximadamente 8%. Así mismo, un choque positivo al precio no afectaría la deuda del gobierno ni en junio de 1999 ni en enero de 2007. Sin embargo, un choque negativo al precio en enero de 2015 del 10% reflejaría un aumento de la deuda anual hasta de 8.9%.
C35|Nonparametric Models Of Financial Leverage Decisions| This paper investigates the properties of nonparametric decision tree models in the analysis of financial leverage decisions. This approach presents two appealing features: the relationship between leverage ratios and the explanatory variables is not predetermined but is derived according to information provided by the data, and the models respect the bounded and fractional nature of leverage ratios. The analysis shows that tree models suggest relationships between explanatory variables and the relative amount of issued debt that parametric models fail to capture. Furthermore, the significant relationships found by tree models are in most cases in accordance with the effects predicted by the pecking-order theory. The results also show that two-part tree models can accommodate better the distinct effects of explanatory variables on the decision to issue debt and on the amount of debt issued by firms that do resort to debt.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
C35|Private Versus Public Sector Wage Gap: Does Origin Matter?|The integration of immigrants and their children is a burning issue in France. Governments build a large part of their assimilation policies on the labor market. The public sector is reputed to better assimilate minorities because of its entrance exams and pay-scales. In this paper, a comparison of the public and private sectors shows that second-generation immigrants are not treated equally. However, the wage gap is determined by the number and gender of immigrant parents and not by the country of origin.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
C35|Opt Out or Top Up? Voluntary Health Care Insurance and the Public vs. Private Substitution|We investigate whether people enrolled into voluntary health insurance (VHI) substitute public consumption with private (opt out) or just enlarge their private consumption, without reducing reliance upon public provisions (top up). We study the case of Italy, where a mixed insurance system is in place. To this purpose, we specify a joint model for public and private specialist visits counts, and allow for different degrees of endogenous supplementary insurance coverage, looking at the insurance coverage as driven by a trinomial choice process. We disentangle the effect of income and wealth by going through two channels: the direct impact on the demand for healthcare and that due to selection into VHI. We find evidence of opting out: richer and wealthier individuals consume more private services and concomitantly reduce those services publicly provided through selection into for-profit VHI. These results imply that the market for VHI eases the redistribution from high income (doubly insured) individuals to low income (not doubly insured) ones operated by the Italian National Health Service (NHS). Accounting for VHI endogeneity in the joint model of the two counts is crucial to this conclusion.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
C35|Identification and estimation using heteroscedasticity without instruments: The binary endogenous regressor case|Lewbel (2012) provides an estimator for linear regression models containing an endogenous regressor, when no outside instruments or other such information is available. The method works by exploiting model heteroscedasticity to construct instruments using the available regressors. Some authors have considered the method in empirical applications where an endogenous regressor is binary (e.g., endogenous Diff-in-Diff or endogenous binary treatment models). The present paper shows that the assumptions required for Lewbel’s estimator can indeed be satisfied when an endogenous regressor is binary. Caveats regarding application of the estimator are discussed.
C35|The Impact of Education and Occupation on Temporary and Permanent Work Incapacity|This paper investigates whether education and working in a physically demanding job causally impact temporary work incapacity (TWI), i. e. sickness absence and permanent work incapacity (PWI), i. e. the inflow to disability via sickness absence. Our contribution is to allow for endogeneity of both education and occupation by estimating a quasi-maximum-likelihood discrete factor model. Data on sickness absence and disability spells for the population of older workers come from the Danish administrative registers for 1998–2002. We generally find causal effects of both education and occupation on TWI. Once we condition on temporary incapacity, we find again a causal effect of education on PWI, but no effect of occupation. Our results confirm that workers in physically demanding jobs are broken down by their work over time (women more than men) but only in terms of TWI.
C35|Analyse microéconométrique des accidents routiers en Tunisie|This paper proposes a microeconometric study of road accidents. We try to estimate a multinomial logit model to analyze the levels of severity of road accidents in Tunisia. Referring to the accidentology literature, the severity can depend on three components: the driver, the vehicle and its condition of use, and the infrastructure. These various components constitute the road traffic system and determine road safety. They interact at a given time and place to explain the occurrence and severity of an accident. Several quantitative and qualitative variables can be identified and measured to describe these components. The objective of this work is to show how and to which extent these variables affect the gravity of a road accident. We seek to estimate the probability that a driver with certain characteristics and leading in a given traffic environment, incurs an accident of a given severity level. The structure of the estimate is based on disaggregated data collected following the study of index cards investigation proposed by the National Observatory of Circulation (Tunisia). The released results show that all the variables are statistically and theoretically significant and explain severity of an accident to different degrees.

C35|Qual VAR revisited: Good forecast, bad story|Due to the recent financial crisis, the interest in econometric models that allow to incorporate binary variables (such as the occurrence of a crisis) experienced a huge surge. This paper evaluates the performance of the Qual VAR, originally proposed by Dueker (2005). The Qual VAR is a VAR model including a latent variable that governs the behavior of an observable binary variable. While we find that the Qual VAR performs reasonable well in forecasting (outperforming a probit benchmark), there are substantial identification problems even in a simple VAR specification. Typically, identification in economic applications is far more difficult than in our simple benchmark. Therefore, when the economic interpretation of the dynamic behavior of the latent variable and the chain of causality matter, use of the Qual VAR is inadvisable.
C35|Forecasting U.S. Recessions and Economic Activity|This paper proposes a framework to produce real time multi-horizon forecasts of business cycle turning points, average forecasts of economic activity as well as conditional forecasts that depend on whether the horizon of interest belongs to a recession episode or not. Our forecasting models take the form of an autoregression of order one that is augmented with either a probability of recession or an inverse Mills ratio. Our empirical results suggest that a static Probit model that uses only the Term Spread as regressor provides comparable fit to the data as more sophisticated non-static Probit models. We also find that the dynamic patterns of the Term Structure of recession probabilities are quite informative about business cycle turning points. Our most parsimonious augmented autoregressive model delivers better out-of-sample forecasts of GDP growth than the benchmark models considered. We construct several Term Structures of recession probabilities since the last official NBER turning point. The results suggest that there has been no harbinger of a recession for the US economy since 2010Q4 and that there is none to fear at least until 2018Q1. GDP growth is expected to rise steadily between 2016Q3 and 2018Q1 in the range [2.5%,3.5%].
C35|Soultion and Estimation of Dynamic Discrete Choice Structural Models Using Euler Equations|This paper extends the Euler Equation (EE) representation of dynamic decision problems to a general class of discrete choice models and shows that the advantages of this approach apply not only to the estimation of structural parameters but also to the computation of a solution and to the evaluation of counterfactual experiments. We use a choice probabilities representation of the discrete decision problem to derive marginal conditions of optimality with the same features as the standard EEs in continuous decision problems. These EEs imply a Â…fixed point mapping in the space of conditional choice values, that we denote the Euler equation-value (EE-value) operator. We show that, in contrast to Euler equation operators in continuous decision models, this operator is a contraction. We present numerical examples that illustrate how solving the model by iterating in the EE-value mapping implies substantial computational savings relative to iterating in the Bellman equation (that requires a much larger number of iterations) or in the policy function (that involves a costly valuation step). We deÂ…fine a sample version of the EE-value operator and use it to construct a sequence of consistent estimators of the structural parameters, and to evaluate counterfactual experiments. The computational cost of evaluating this sample-based EE-value operator increases linearly with sample size, and provides an unbiased (in fiÂ…nite samples) and consistent estimator the counterfactual. As such there is no curse of dimensionality in the consistent estimation of the model and in the evaluation of counterfactual experiments. We illustrate the computational gains of our methods using several Monte Carlo experiments.
C35|Afrocolombianos, discriminación y segregación espacial de la calidad del empleo para Cali|Este artículo analiza cómo la raza y posición geográfica inciden en la calidad del empleo de los caleños. Estimamos un modelo probit ordenado a partir de información de la Encuesta de Empleo y Calidad de Vida (EECV) para Cali, aplicada por el Ministerio de Trabajo y la Alcaldía de Santiago de Cali, durante noviembre de 2012 y enero de 2013. Nuestros resultados muestran evidencia de posible discriminación racial a la población afrocolombiana de Cali. Asimismo, se encuentra evidencia de posible segregación espacial de la calidad del empleo, porque aunque una persona esté en la misma ciudad, la calidad del empleo varía dependiendo de la zona de residencia. ****** This article analyzes how race and geographical location affect the quality of employment of Cali’s population. We estimate an ordered probit model based on information from the Survey of Employment and Quality of Life (SEQL) in Cali, implemented by the Ministry of Labour and the Municipality of Santiago de Cali, during November 2012 and January 2013. Our results show evidence of possible racial discrimination of the Afro-Colombian population in Cali. Likewise, there is evidence of possible spatial segregation of employment quality, because even in the same city, employment quality varies depending on the area of residence.
C35|Congruence of higher education: determinants and effects of the allocation process in the labor market, applied case to Colombia|Abstract: This paper provides new evidences to the literature of assignment in the labor market for the Colombian case. Specifically it focuses on the existing relationship between acquired human capital in higher education and its congruence in the labor market. Differing from previews studies, the misallocation analysis is not only based on the horizontal component and the educational mismatch, but it also includes the vertical mechanism (vertical mechanism is related to skills mismatch and horizontal mechanism is related to professional career mismatch). Another contribution is how we measure the abilities through an exploratory factor analysis. The data are taken from the Survey of Graduates of Higher Education Institutions 2014, provided by OLE. We employ a two-step treatment effect method proposed by Heckman (1974, 1979) and Lee (1978)), we found that generic abilities raise the probability of horizontal mismatch and diminish the probability of vertical mismatch. On the other hand, specific abilities lower the probability of both horizontal and vertical mismatch. In terms of wages, we found evidence that confirmed the results of the assignment models because it exists a wage penalty for the mismatched individuals (Sattinger, 1993).
C35|La Calidad del Empleo en la Población Afrodescendiente Colombiana: Una Aproximacion desde la Ubicacion Geografica de las Comunas|Este artículo construye un indicador compuesto sobre la calidad del empleo, al utilizar el método de componentes principales para la población afrocolombiana radicada en Cali, a partir de una encuesta representativa por comunas realizada por el Ministerio de Trabajo de Colombia. Cali, al ser la primera ciudad colombiana con mayor proporción de población afrodescendiente y la segunda de América Latina, después de Salvador Bahpia, Brasil, se constituye en un referente de la situación laboral de la población afrodescendiente colombiana. Los resultados muestran que los afrocolombianos que viven en la zona Oriente, compuesta por las comunas 7, 13, 14, 15, y 21, tienen una mayor probabilidad de tener empleos de baja calidad, por lo que existen localizaciones espaciales en torno a la calidad del empleo. La educación universitaria aumenta la probabilidad de encontrar un empleo de alta calidad.
C35|Score-driven dynamic patent count panel data models|In this paper, we propose the use of Dynamic Conditional Score (DCS) count panel data models. We compare the statistical performance of the static model with different dynamic models: finite distributed lag, exponential feedback and different DCS models. For DCS, we consider random walk or quasi-autoregressive dynamics. We use panel data for a large cross section of United States firms for period 1979–2000, and the Poisson quasi-maximum likelihood estimator with fixed effects. The empirical results suggest that DCS has the best statistical performance.
C35|An Analysis of the Romanian E-Commerce Trade Trends in European Perspective|The paper employs regression analysis of relevance to outline significant differences in the perception of Romanian urban customers regarding the evolution of e-commerce, as the most dynamic sales channel, against the background of the econometric analysis of trends in e-commerce across 29 EU countries, based on selected information society macroeconomic indicators. The conclusions of the macroeconomic analysis can be checked for the consumers by an empirical survey, examining the consumer attitudes and preferences about the use of electronic commerce in Romanian urban areas. The analyzed sample comprised 385 young urban consumers, stratified by gender, age, income, employment status and level of education, which were directly interviewed, the questionnaire containing 20 items. Based on the macroeconomic data analysis, the results showed that Romania is occupying one of the last places of the hierarchy of countries according to the number of computers users per 100 inhabitants, due to the lack of computers in the rural areas. The empirical analysis showed that the low usage rate of the e-commerce is due, in the opinion of users, to fear for fraud, the lack of trust in the payment safety on the internet, ineffective web-sites and also due to the low promotion of e-commerce. The main conclusions of the analysis pointed out that, in the near future, new selling technologies are thought to spread globally in each country, company and household.
C35|The Influence of Personality Traits on Private Retirement Savings in Germany|This paper analyzes private retirement savings, the amount for German individuals and how these savings are influenced by personality traits. With the 2002 to 2009 cross section of the Socio-Economic Panel for Germany (SOEP), it is investigated how the Big-Five and the Locus of Control influence the decision to have private retirement savings, and the estimated amount of these savings. Results indicate a positive effect for Extraversion and a negative effect for Agreeableness on the probability to have such savings. Extraversion also positively effects the size of retirement related savings as does having an more internal Locus of Control. Similar to the probability to have retirement savings Agreeableness also reduces the expected amount of such savings. Personality traits only seem to influence the retirement savings if the individual has scores further away from the average of the specific trait. Additionally regressions are implemented that include the personality measures as dummies to allow for non-linear effects. Furthermore, other types of wealth accumulation such as house related savings are investigated to study how the effects might differ for different types of wealth accumulation.
C35|Forecasting U.S. Recessions and Economic Activity|This paper proposes a framework to produce multi-horizon forecasts of business cycle turning points, average forecasts of economic activity as well as conditional forecasts that depend on whether the horizon of interest belongs to a recession episode or not. Our forecasting models take the form of an autoregression (AR) of order one that is augmented with either a probability of recession or an inverse Mills ratio. Our empirical results suggest that a static Probit model that uses only the TS as regressor provides comparable fit to the data as more sophisticated non-static Probit models. We also find that the dynamic patterns of the term structure of recession probabilities are quite informative about business cycle turning points. Our most parsimonious AAR model delivers better out-of-sample forecasts of GDP growth than the benchmark models considered. We construct term structures of recession probabilities since the last oficial NBER turning point. The results suggest that there has been no harbinger of a recession for the US economy since 2010Q4 and that there is none to fear at least until 2018Q1. GDP growth is expected to rise steadily between 2016Q3 and 2018Q1 in the range [2.5%,3.5%].
C35|Causes and hazards of the euro area sovereign debt crisis: Pure and fundamentals-based contagion|This paper tries to contribute to the understanding of sovereign debt crises' pattern by empirically investigating the determinants of the recent euro area crisis to assess if its transmission was due to “pure” or “fundamentals-based” contagion. Using sovereign bond yield spreads with respect to Germany for a sample of ten central and peripheral countries from January 1999 to December 2012, we firstly examine the dynamic evolution of Granger-causality within the 90 pairs of yield spreads in our sample to detect episodes of contagion (associated with episodes of significant intensification in causality). Secondly, we make use of a logit model to explore whether there is evidence of “pure contagion” or “fundamentals-based contagion”, by trying to determine which factors might have been behind the detected contagion episodes. Our results suggest that contagion episodes are concentrated just after the inception of the EMU and matching the Global Financial Crisis, yielding more accurate and sensible indicators than those obtained from DCC-GARCH models used in prior studies. Indeed, they preceded the outburst of the Global Financial Crisis (causality intensification is detected from March 2008), and reached a peak during January–May 2011. Furthermore, they underline the coexistence of “pure” and “fundamentals-based contagion” during the recent European debt crisis.
C35|Gender differences in preferences for taking risk in college applications|College admissions in Turkey are based entirely on nationwide standardized test scores and standardized high school GPAs. Using detailed administrative data from the centralized system, I study the impact of gender differences in preferences on the allocation of students to colleges. Controlling for test score, high school GPA, and high school attended, I find that females are more likely to apply to lower-ranking universities, whereas males set a higher bar, revealing a higher option value for retaking the test and applying again next year. These differences in willingness to be unassigned are also found to have implications for major choices.
C35|Partial copula methods for models with multiple discrete endogenous explanatory variables and sample selection|We present a flexible parametric approach for models with multiple discrete endogenous explanatory variables (EEV) with finite support. The joint distributions of each EEV and structural error are modeled by using copulae and their marginal distributions, but the ones among the EEV’s are left unspecified. Our partial copula approach can be applied in any models with discrete EEV’s. It can be also used for correcting selection bias and finding average treatment effects.
C35|Rural–urban differences in children’s dietary diversity in Ethiopia: A Poisson decomposition analysis|An emerging body of literature shows how low diversity in diets is associated with increased risk of chronic undernutrition and micro-nutrient deficiencies in young children. The latest available Demographic and Health Survey data for Ethiopia reveals unusually large differences in children’s dietary diversity between rural and urban areas. Applying recently developed non-linear decomposition methods, this large rural–urban gap in dietary diversity can almost entirely be explained by differences in household wealth, parental education, and access to health services between rural and urban areas.
C35|Inference for the correlation coefficient between potential outcomes in the Gaussian switching regime model|We propose estimators of sharp bounds on the correlation coefficient between potential outcomes in the Gaussian switching regime model and develop an asymptotically uniformly valid and non-conservative confidence set for the true correlation coefficient. A boundary-interior-category selection procedure is proposed to deal with discontinuity of the pointwise asymptotic distribution of estimators of the sharp bounds. Our confidence set is easy to implement: it takes the form of a closed interval and its critical values have closed-form expressions. Simulation study reveals the better finite sample performance of our confidence set than the naive confidence set ignoring the discontinuity issue.
C35|Is treatment “intensity” associated with healthier lifestyle choices? An application of the dose response function|Healthy lifestyle choices and doctor consultations can be substitutes or complements in the health production function. In this paper we consider the relation between the number of doctor consultations and the frequency of patient physical activity. We use a novel application of the Dose-Response Function model proposed by Hirano and Imbens (2004) to deal with treatment endogeneity under the no unmeasured confounding assumption. Our application takes account of unobserved heterogeneity and uses dynamic non-linear models for the treatment and outcome variables of interest. Using seven waves of the British Household Panel Survey, we find that higher treatment intensity and frequency of physical activity are inversely related. We show that accounting for both treatment selection and unobserved heterogeneity halves the size of this relationship. An additional doctor consultation is associated with a 0.5 percentage point reduction in the probability of undertaking vigorous physical activity. Our results hold for a sub-sample visiting the doctor for health check-ups, and are shown to be robust using instrumental variables.
C35|Consumer governance in electricity markets|This paper examines switching decisions by households in the MainPower distribution area of New Zealand. The paper measures the extent to which customers switch retailers following the release of information about directors' bonuses, marketing surrounding firm ownership, and work by the New Zealand Electricity Authority to promote transparency of the switching process. We document strong customer inertia, which, for some consumers, has reduced following the Electricity Authority's interventions. Customer movements following information releases and marketing campaigns are modest, suggesting that prices and inertia may be the most important drivers of customer migration.
C35|Modeling and forecasting multivariate electricity price spikes|We consider the problem of forecasting the occurrence of extreme prices in the Australian electricity markets from high frequency spot prices. In particular, we are interested in the simultaneous occurrence of such so-called spikes in two or more markets. Our approach is based on a novel dynamic model for multivariate binary outcomes, which allows the latent variables driving these observed outcomes to follow a vector autoregressive process. Furthermore the model is constructed using a copula representation for the joint distribution of the resulting innovations. This has several advantages over the standard multivariate probit model. First, it allows for nonlinear dependence between the error terms. Second, the distribution of the latent errors can be chosen freely. Third, the computational burden can be greatly reduced making estimation feasible in higher dimensions and for large samples. The model is applied to spikes in half-hourly electricity prices in four interconnected Australian markets. The multivariate model provides a superior fit compared to single-equation models and generates better forecasts for spike probabilities. Furthermore, evidence of spillover dynamics between the markets is revealed.
C35|State dependence in access to credit|This paper investigates whether firms’ access to credit is characterized by state dependence. We introduce a first-order Markov model of credit restriction with sample selection that makes it possible to identify state dependence in presence of unobserved heterogeneity. The results, based on a representative sample of Italian firms, show that state dependence in access to credit is a statistically and economically significant phenomenon and that this is more prominent among medium-large firms.
C35|Cesarean section and the manipulation of exact delivery time|Physicians are often alleged responsible for the manipulation of delivery timing. We investigate this issue in a setting that negates the influence of financial incentives on physician's behavior. Working on a sample of women admitted at the onset of labor in a big public hospital in Italy we estimate a model for the exact time of delivery as driven by individual Indication to Cesarean Section (ICS) and covariates. We find that ICS does not affect the day of delivery but leads to a circadian rhythm in the likelihood of delivery. The pattern is consistent with the postponement of high ICS deliveries in the late night\early morning shift. Our evidence hardly supports the manipulation of timing of births as driven by medical staff's “demand for leisure”. Physicians seem to manipulate the exact timing of delivery to reduce exposure to risk factors extant during off-peak periods.
C35|Gender and the effect of working hours on firm-sponsored training|Using employees’ longitudinal data, we study the effect of working hours on the propensity of firms to sponsor training of their employees. We show that, whereas male part-time workers are less likely to receive training than male full-timers, part-time working women are as likely to receive training as full-time working women. Although we cannot rule out gender-working time specific monopsony power, we speculate that the gender-specific effect of working hours on training has to do with gender-specific stereotyping. In the Netherlands, for women it is common to work part-time. More than half of the prime age female employees work part-time. Therefore, because of social norms, men working part-time could send a different signal to their employer than women working part-time. This might generate a different propensity of firms to sponsor training of male part-timers than female part-timers.
C35|Home tenure, stock market participation, and composition of the household portfolio|In this study, we empirically analyze the simultaneous decisions of households to participate in the stock market and/or own their home. A vast literature stream exists on decisions to buy or rent a home, and many contributions report the low participation rate of American households in the US stock market. Numerous authors have also provided evidence that home tenure (modeled as an exogenous variable) affects the share of household portfolios held as stocks. However, the present study is the first to allow decisions on homeownership and stockholding to be simultaneous and endogenous. We use a dynamic bivariate logistic panel data model on the Panel Study of Income Dynamics data from 1999 to 2007, controlling for sample selection bias and time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity. These estimates allow us to simulate the individual paths of homeownership and stockholding status over whole life cycles, according to household characteristics. Ceteris paribus, we show that households acquiring one asset (either home or stocks) acquire the other at an earlier stage in their life cycles, implying that some households become trapped in a no-stockholding, renting position.
C35|Toward more general hedonic estimation: Clarifying the roles of alternative experimental designs with an application to a housing attribute|Traditional hedonic estimation approaches are known to be biased when exogenous shocks affect multiple product attributes, the market for the product's complements and substitutes, and aggregate quantity produced. Our research develops a more general hedonic model to recover the marginal willingness to pay for an attribute in the presence of such known hazards to identification based on randomized experiments. Three experimental approaches are introduced on how to estimate attribute demand that address known biases, have transparent identification assumptions, and are feasible to implement. We apply one of the estimators developed to measure the marginal value placed by householders on subsidized carbon monoxide detectors.
C35|The impact of SEPA in credit transfer payments: Evidence from the euro area|This paper analyses the effect of the implementation process of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) project on credit transfer payments in euro area countries during the period between 2008 and 2013. Using both univariate and multivariate fractional regression models, we found that, when controlling for socio-demographic, economic, technological and institutional factors, the progress in the migration to SEPA formats had a relevant positive impact on the share of payments made with credit transfers. Our results provide for the first time empirical evidence of the direct effect of the implementation of SEPA on payment habits and set the basis for the discussion of some of the possible implications of payments digitalization from both economical and societal perspectives.
C35|Intra-household bargaining for school trip accompaniment of children: A group decision approach|This paper tests a group decision-making model to examine the school travel behavior of students 6–18years old in the Minneapolis-St. Paul Metropolitan area. The school trip information of 1737 two-parent families with a student is extracted from Travel Behavior Inventory data collected by the Metropolitan Council between the Fall 2010 and Spring 2012. The model has four distinct characteristics including: (1) considering the student explicitly in the model, (2) allowing for bargaining or negotiation within households, (3) quantifying the intra-household interaction among family members, and (4) determining the decision weight function for household members. This framework also covers a household with three members, namely, a father, a mother, and a student, and unlike other studies it is not limited to dual-worker families. To test the hypotheses we build two models, each with and without the group-decision approach. The models are separately built for different age groups, namely students 6–12 and 12–18years old. This study considers a wide range of variables such as work status of parents, age and gender of students, mode of travel, and distance to school. The findings of this study demonstrate that the elasticities of the two modeling approaches differ not only in the value, but in the sign in some cases. In 63% of the cases the unitary household model underestimates the results. More precisely, the elasticities of the unitary household model are as much as 2 times more than that of the group-decision model in 20% of cases. This is a direct consequence of model misspecification that misleads both long- and short-term policies where the intra-household bargaining and interaction is overlooked in travel behavior models.
C35|Testing the Pecking Order Theory of Capital Structure in FTSE 350 Food Producers Firms in United Kingdom between 2001 and 2005|This paper tests the Pecking Order Theory to see if it best explains the financing behaviour of FTSE 350 UK Food producer firms from the time period of 2001 to 2005. A multiple case study design was used. However, the study approach was retrospective in nature. The Pecking order model as proposed by Shyam-Sunder and Myers, Frank and Goyal; and Rajan and Zingales, was followed in this research. The empirical analysis of firm-year data was compared to a generalised view of the literature to enable an assessment of the commonalities and differences observed. The results suggest that although there is some form of Pecking order behaviour amongst FTSE 350 UK food producer firms, especially when it comes to managers’ preference for the different sources of finance, their financing behaviour is best explained by the trade-off theory of capital structure.
C35|Self‐employment among women: Do children matter more than we previously thought?|This paper presents an estimation approach that addresses the problems of sample selection and endogeneity of fertility decisions when estimating the effect of young children on women's self‐employment. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979, 1982–2006, we find that ignoring self‐selection and endogeneity leads to underestimating the effect of young children. Once both sources of biases are accounted for, the estimated effect of young children roughly triples when compared to uncorrected results. This finding is robust to several changes in the specification and to the use of a different dataset.
C35|Empirical welfare analysis: when preferences matter|Abstract The conditional equality and egalitarian equivalence criteria were proposed by Fleurbaey (Fairness, responsibility, and welfare, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2008) to provide better foundations to interpersonal comparisons in the context of heterogeneous preferences and multidimensional welfare. The first implementations of the egalitarian equivalence criterion follow an approach where the preferences are captured at the group level (based on socio-demographic variables) rather than at the individual level. Our contribution is to extend these models by using information on individual preferences, derived from the potential discrepancy between the group level optimal choice and the revealed choice of the individuals. We implement and compare the conditional equality and egalitarian equivalence criteria on a 2004 US microeconomic dataset and find that these criteria are relatively consistent in the identification of the worst-off. We also show that up to 18 % of the worst-off are no longer categorized as worst-off when the empirical approach accounts for individual preferences.
C35|Crises and exchange rate regimes: time to break down the bipolar view?| We revisit the link between crises and exchange rate regimes (ERR). Using a wide panel of 90 developed and developing countries over the period 1980–2009, we find that corner ERR are not more prone to crises compared to intermediate ERR. This finding holds for different types of crises (banking, currency and debt), and is robust to a wide set of alternative specifications. Consequently, we clearly break down the traditional bipolar view: countries that aim at preventing crisis episodes should focus less on the choice of the ERR, and instead implement sound structural macroeconomic policies.
