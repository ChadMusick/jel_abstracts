B12|Willingness Toupee|In this paper we tackle the hairy problem of male pattern baldness. We survey balding men and elicit their willingness to pay to move from their current situation to a more plentiful one. Then we comb‐over the results. What's the average willingness to pay to move from a glistening cue ball to a luscious mane? About $30,000. (JEL B12)
B12|Retrospectives: Lord Keynes and Mr. Say: A Proximity of Ideas|Since the publication of Keynes's General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, generations of economists have been led to believe that Say was Keynes's ultimate nemesis. By means of textual and contextual analysis, we show that Keynes and Say held similar views on several key issues, such as the possibility of aggregate-demand deficiency, the role of money in the economy, and government intervention. Our conclusion is that there are enough similarities to call into question the idea that Keynes's views were antithetical to Say's. The irony is that Keynes was not aware of these similarities. Our study sheds new light on the interpretation of Keynes's work and on his criticism of classical political economy. Moreover, it suggests that some policy implications of demand-side and supply-side frameworks overlap. Finally, the study underlines the importance of a thorough analysis of the primary sources to fully grasp the substance of Say's message.
B12|Modelling the Dynamic Effects of Elective Hospital Admissions on Emergency Levels in England|In England as elsewhere, policy makers are trying to reduce the pressure on costs due to rising hospital admissions by encouraging GPs to refer fewer patients to hospital specialists. This could have an impact on elective treatment levels, particularly procedures for conditions which are not life-threatening and can be delayed or perhaps withheld entirely. This study attempts to determine whether cost savings in one area of publicly funded health care may lead to cost increases in another and therefore have unintended consequences by offsetting the cost-saving benefits anticipated by policy makers. Using administrative data from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) in England we estimate dynamic fixed effects panel data models for emergency admissions at Primary Care Trust and Hospital Trust levels for the years 2004–13, controlling for a group of area-specific characteristics and other secondary care variables. We find a negative link between current levels of elective care and future levels of emergency treatment. This observation comes from a time of growing admissions and there is no guarantee that the link between emergency and elective activity will persist if policy is effective in reducing levels of elective treatment, but our results suggest that the cost-saving benefits to the NHS from reducing elective treatment are reduced by between 5.6 per cent and 15.5 per cent in aggregate as a consequence of increased emergency activity.
B12|A Classical View of the Business Cycle|"In the 1920s, Irving Fisher extended his previous work on the Quantity Theory to describe how, through an early version of the Phillips Curve, changes in the price level could affect both output and unemployment. At the same time, Holbrook Working designed a quantitative rule for achieving price stability through control of the money supply. This paper develops a structural vector autoregressive time series model that allows these ""classical"" channels of monetary transmission to operate alongside, or perhaps even instead of, the now-more-familiar interest rate channels of the canonical New Keynesian model. Even with Bayesian priors that intentionally favor the New Keynesian view, the United States data produce posterior distributions for the model's key parameters that are more consistent with the ideas of Fisher and Working. Changes in real money balances enter importantly into the model's aggregate demand relationship, while growth in Divisia M2 appears in the estimated monetary policy rule. Contractionary monetary policy shocks reveal themselves through persistent declines in nominal money growth instead of rising nominal interest rates. These results point to the need for new theoretical models that capture a wider range of channels through which monetary policy affects the economy and suggest that, even today, the monetary aggregates could play a useful role in the Federal Reserve's policymaking strategy."
B12|Theories of value and ultimate standards in Sraffa's notes of summer 1927|The group of manuscripts titled 'Notes/London, Summer 1927/Physical real costs, etc.' (D3/12/3) is recognized as extremely important for the reconstruction of the evolution of Sraffa's thought after the articles published in 1925 and 1926. The present paper is aimed at analysing some relevant passages and ideas expressed by Sraffa in those manuscripts. We shall focus, in particular, on Sraffa's arguments about the existence of two different theories of value, with different aims: one aimed at determining the value of large aggregates of commodities, such as the national product, the necessary consumption and the social surplus, and the other aimed at determining the price of a single commodity, separately from the others. In Sraffa's view, if the values of many commodities are to be determined simultaneously, then the theory cannot dispense with an ultimate standard of value. That idea led Sraffa toward the conception (or the rediscovery) of the physical real cost.
B12|Sraffa on Marshall's Theory of Value in the Cambridge Lectures: Achievements in an Unfinished Criticism|In his Cambridge lectures, Sraffa argues that classical political economy and marginalist economics present two alternative theoretical structures. This was a major achievement reached during the preparation of the lectures. The understanding of these two theoretical structures was however still unfinished: as known, he had already identified the need for simultaneous determination of prices and distribution - a result comprehensibly not made explicit in the lectures; but the critical implications of this result for the interpretation of Marshall's position were probably not yet evident to Sraffa. He in fact still accepted the Marshallian thesis that classical political economy and marginalist economics identified two single alternative “ultimate standards of value”. Sraffa’s failure to also overcome this limitation of the debate on the ultimate standard bears witness to his, albeit critical, initial adherence to the Marshallian theoretical framework. The road towards Production of Commodities was open but still unfinished.
B12|Criptovalute, Sovranismo e Sistema Monetario|La storia finanziaria dell’ultimo decennio ci offre diversi spunti di riflessione sullo stato e le prospettive dell’attuale sistema monetario. Le dinamiche sui mercati delle criptovalute e le trasformazioni politiche in atto sembrano sottoporre l’attuale assetto monetario a pressioni di segno opposto: mentre le prime promuovono – da una prospettiva liberale e sovranazionale – la riduzione della contiguità tra emissione monetaria e potere politico, le seconde – da una prospettiva populista e sovranista – premono per un suo deciso rafforzamento. Questo lavoro discute la natura e le implicazioni di queste due tensioni, attraverso le lenti della memoria storica del nostro continente, e del pensiero di A. Smith e F. Von Hayek.
B12|A missing touch of Adam Smith in Amartya Sen’s account of Public Reasoning: the Man Within for the Man Without|Sen claims that his 2009 theory of justice is based in part upon Smith’s idea of the “impartial spectator”. His claim has received criticism: some authors have responded that his interpretation of Smith’s concept is unfaithful to the original (e.g., Ege, Igersheim and Le Chapelain 2012); others, focusing on internal features of Sen’s analysis, critique his use of the Smithian impartial spectator, arguing that it is a weak point in his comparative theory of justice (e.g., Shapiro 2011). In this paper we address both sets of criticisms. While agreeing with commentators that Sen’s reading of Smith is somewhat unfaithful, we reiterate that his aim in The Idea of Justice is not to provide an exegesis of Smith but rather to build his own comparative theory of justice by “extending Adam Smith’s idea of the impartial spectator” (IJ: 134) to his own project. After clarifying their distinct approaches to the concept of the impartial spectator, we draw upon our account of these differences to evaluate Sen’s own use of the concept. Despite significant divergences, we show that Sen’s version of the impartial spectator is not inconsistent with Smith’s analysis. Though it does not correspond to Smith’s concept, i.e. to what the Scottish philosopher sometimes calls the “man within”, it is reminiscent of another figure from Smith’s moral philosophy: the “man without”. Beyond this analogy, there are further connections between Smith’s imaginary figure of the “man within” and Sen’s account of “common beliefs”—both notions are ways of representing our beliefs regarding what is moral or just. But whereas Smith’s moral philosophy offers an analysis of the process by which the “man without” influences the “man within”, nothing of that kind is to be found in Sen’s conception of public reasoning. And it is here that Smith’s famous concept of “sympathy” can supplement Sen’s theory, in a way which furnishes an answer to Shapiro’s (2011) criticism regarding the possibility of the spontaneous change of beliefs toward greater impartiality.
B12|The Smithian Market of Religions and its Legacy: Another Great Schism between Economics and Sociology?|Adam Smith (1776) is the first to introduce religions into a market. Our article studies Smith’s neglected contribution to secularization theories and sociological market of religions then distinguishes it from his contribution to the economic market of religions. The objective of this article is to show that sociology and economics of religion both rely on Smith. Our issue analyzes if the markets of religions in the two disciplines evolve contradictory or complementary. Our results show an interdisciplinary dissemination of Smith’s ideas between sociology and economics of religion, a (unknown/neglected) Smithian background for sociology of religion and a demand-side market of religions in sociology. We demonstrate that there is no opposition between the two disciplines, but a methodological difference between demand and supply mechanisms. Our historical work remarks a methodological schism in the markets of religion with the introduction of Becker’s rational choice into sociology. We trace a historical tree to distinguish the demand mechanism (Marx, Durkheim, Weber and traditional sociological market) from the supply mechanism (Tocqueville, Blau and Homans, Becker, and rational choice theory in sociology and economics of religion) in the evolution of Smith’s market.
B12|The difficult relationship between historical ordoliberalism and Adam Smith|"Ever since the global financial crisis of 2008, interpreted by some observers as a foreseeable failure of ""unfettered"" capitalism, the German intellectual tradition of ordoliberalism has been meeting with increased interest. Its emphasis on good government, appropriate rules and institutions makes it attractive. Welcome as this may be, however, that trend may impact the reception of the works of Adam Smith in a problematic way, since the key historical figures of ordoliberalism reject his theory vigorously, even though, from today's perspective, their concerns and policy recommendations look very parallel to his. Their common hope is human flourishing. Just like the Scot, the broad scope of their vision encompasses society as a whole, not just the market; they are concerned with ethics, not just economics. But what, then, can solve the puzzle of this implausible rejection, by which the ordoliberals contribute to a deep-rooted prejudice against Smith? In this paper, Karen Horn takes stock of their concrete criticisms, which turn out to be based on a narrow understanding of Smith's work. She suggests that it is religion that stands at the root of the explanation, though situational elements may also play a role. The essential contentious point seems to be what the ordoliberals take for the Scot's naïve belief in natural harmony, the sources of which they see in his stoicism and possible deism. The deeper problem for them with Smith is the pagan flavour and the systematic normative relativism of an essentially evolutionary approach to human values."
B12|Der spezifische Liberalismus von Hayek im Spektrum des Neoliberalismus|Friedrich August von Hayek hat der Nachwelt ein breites theoretisches Werk hinterlassen. Ein durchgängiger Wesenszug darin ist sein spezifischer Liberalismus, der durch einen negativen Begriff von Freiheit bestimmt ist. Damit verbunden ist Hayeks ausgeprägter methodologischer Individualismus. Doch Hayek polarisiert, und zwar nicht nur zwischen Anhängern und Gegnern, sondern auch innerhalb der Vertreter des neoliberalen Spektrums. Der Beitrag geht der Frage nach, in welchem Grade Hayek selbst die Verantwortung dafür trägt, indem Inkonsistenzen in seinem Denken aufgezeigt werden. Eine Konsequenz davon ist, dass Hayek zwar für verschiedene Varianten des Neoliberalismus als Bezugspunkt dient, aber die Heterogenität des modernen Neoliberalismus noch vertieft hat. Ob Hayek ein Ordoliberaler oder ein Marktradikaler ist, bleibt eine Frage, die bestenfalls tendenziell zu beantworten ist Ein einheitliches Denkkollektiv im Anschluss an Hayek existiert jedenfalls nicht, ebenso wenig wie ein homogener Neoliberalismus.
B12|The population question in a neoclassical growth model: A brief theory of production per capita|"This work seeks to answer the ""population question,"" i.e. the effect of population growth on production per capita. This question has lingered in economic thought for centuries and to this day two general lines of thought can be identified, which might be marked as the ""optimist"" and the ""pessimist"" view. While the optimists claim that an increase in population will - chiefly owed to concomitant specialization and technological progress - raise average production per capita, the pessimists maintain that the latter would decline as a result of resources becoming relatively more scarce. Integrating both approaches and using a neoclassical framework, this work intends to show that sustainably increasing productivity is predominantly the result of reducing too high fertility toward a lower level such that diminishing returns are outweighed by the benefits from labor division. The paper argues that the historical reduction of fertility can almost completely explain long-run development."
B12|A VAR evaluation of classical growth theory|Over the past two decades, there have been numerous attempts in economic theory to model the historical regime of a Malthusian trap as well as the transition to growth in one coherent framework, or in other words, a unified growth theory. However, in most of these models, an important effect suggested by Malthus has been frequently omitted. By including what he had called ?the great preventive check? in the traditional Malthusian model which is based on the principle of population, the principle of diminishing returns and the principle of labour division, the transition can be modelled in a very simple dynamic macroeconomic framework. The aim of this paper is to first construct and calibrate the suggested classical model and to eventually employ a conventional VAR-Method to provide evidence of the above principles using country-specific annual historical data on crude birth rate, crude death rate and GDP per capita growth rate. As a result, it is argued that emerging economies follow a universal macroeconomic pattern of development. A decreasing death rate is succeeded by a decreasing birth rate which at the same time induces GDP per capita to rise sustainably. The correspondingly advanced microeconomic theory suggests that increasing life expectancy tends to create a demographic structure that is much less prone to overpopulation.
B12|The principle of population vs. the Malthusian trap: A classical retrospective and resuscitation|In spite of two centuries of extensive debate, a consistent framework of the classical theory of population on which economists can universally agree has not been established. This means that either the theory lacks consistency or it has been misunderstood in important ways. This paper attempts to settle this issue by arguing that the latter was the case, revealing prevailing misconceptions. Since a large amount of these misconceptions most probably arose from the lack of a consistent nomenclature, the paper intends to clarify the classical theory of population by employing unambiguous definitions of the principle of population, the Malthusian trap, positive checks and preventive checks to population. The classical theory of population can then be applied to analyze the transition from economic stagnation to economic growth. As a result, numerous current theories trying to explain the transition to growth that are based on an increase of production will prove secondary when compared to the great preventive check.
B12|Steuart, Smith, and the ‘system of commerce’: international trade and monetary theory in late-18th century british political economy|Though contemporaries, Adam Smith and Sir James Steuart are commonly portrayed as men belonging to different eras. Whereas Smith went down in history both as founder of Classical Political Economy and patron of economic liberalism, Steuart became known as the last, outdated advocate of mercantilist policies in Britain. Smith himself was responsible for popularizing the notion of the ‘system of commerce’ as an approach to political economy that dominated British thought during the early modern period. As it evolved into a historiographical concept, the mercantile system came to be seen as an international trade theory grounded upon the fallacious doctrine of the favorable balance of trade. In the Wealth of Nations, however, Smith puts limited emphasis on international trade as a theoretical concern. His analysis of the subject, moreover, was marred by lack of analytical clarity, which caused him to be chastised by some among his followers who adhered more enthusiastically to the free trade cause. Given Smith’s doubtful credentials as a free trade theorist, in this paper we try to analyze the reasons that led him and Steuart to be historically placed on opposite sides of the mercantilist divide. To do so, we analyze the works of both authors in depth, showing that their disagreements in matters of economic policy have chiefly to do with different views about the role of money in the economy. Additionally, we explore how early-19th century writers helped forge the intellectual profiles of both Steuart and Smith.
B12|La conjetura de Shaikh. Un modelo clásico de la tasa de cambio real Colombia - Estados Unidos|"En este trabajo se presenta lo que hemos denominado la “Conjetura de Shaikh”. (i) explicamos la concepción clásica de la competencia real en el modo de producción capitalista, definida como una guerra continua por la sobrevivencia, cuyas armas son el cambio técnico, la inversión en capital y los ajustes de precios que permiten golpear duramente a los capitales adversarios para concentrar y centralizar el poder en el mercado. (ii) introducimos la teoría de la desventaja absoluta que determina la especialización y la división internacional del trabajo, que explica los procesos de causación circular acumulativa de los superávits comerciales y de acumulación de obligaciones externas entre países desarrollados y en desarrollo (iii) explicamos porque la interpretación monetaria de la tasa de interés impide que las ventajas absolutas se transformen en desventajas comparativas en libre comercio. Por último, se presenta el modelo de determinación de la tasa de cambio real entre dos países (USA y Colombia), que se deriva de la teoría clásica del sistema de precios de producción. ****** In this paper, we present what we have called the ""Shaikh Conjecture"". (i) We explain the classical conception of real competition in the capitalist mode of production, defined as a continuous war for survival, whose weapons are technical change, investment in capital and price adjustments that allow capital to hit hard adversaries to concentrate and centralize power in the market. (ii) We introduce the theory of absolute disadvantage that determines the specialization and international division of labour, which explains the cumulative circular causation processes of trade surpluses and accumulation of external obligations between developed and developing countries. (iii) We explain why the monetary interpretation of the interest rate prevents absolute advantages from becoming comparative disadvantages in free trade. Finally, we present the model for determining the real exchange rate between two countries (USA and Colombia), which is derived from the classical theory of the production price system."
B12|Problems, solutions and new problems with the third wave of technological unemployment|The aim of this paper is to discuss possible solutions to the “third wave” of technological unemployment and their main drawbacks. The process has just started and will only be fully realized in the future, but its main novelty is already well known and concerns robots (and artificial intelligence) entering the production process. Robots do not simply increase labor productivity, in cooperation with humans, but can totally substitute labor, making it possible to produce commodities without the use of human input. This in turn generates technological unemployment. Past “compensation” theories have argued that technological unemployment could be reabsorbed thanks to wage reduction and demand (and production) increase. But these theories have ignored robots. If robots are more productive and less expensive than humans, wage reduction may be insufficient due to the minimum wage subsistence boundary; and, in any case, an increase in demand would only determine an increase in the production of goods by robots alone, without any impact on human employment. Meanwhile, the resulting mass unemployment will require redistributive policies. The paper discusses the most relevant among these policies, emphasizing their drawbacks and their unwanted implications, and proposes an alternative rooted in Tietenberg’s tradable permits approach.
B12|Labour Shares and Income Inequality: Insights from Italian Economic History, 1895-2015|This paper develops theoretical and practical motivations for studying the functional distribution of income in the past. Italy is adopted as a case study, by reason of the availability of long-run estimates on personal income inequality. The historical importance of self-employment and the recent increase in labour’s share make the Italian historical experience of further general interest. New estimates from 1895 show Italian workers accruing a low share of national income until 1945. By the end of the 1950s and the economic miracle, shares had rapidly converged to the European average. Italian history shows that studying the functional distribution of income deepens our understanding of long run distributional trends, as well as of key distributive episodes, and makes a compelling case for approaching income inequality by combining diverse sources and methodologies.
B12|Inter-Industry Wage Inequality: Persistent differences and turbulent equalization|Persistent inter-industry wage differentials are an enduring puzzle for neoclassical economics. This paper applies the classical theory of ‘real competition’ to inter-industry wage differentials. Theoretically, we argue that competitive wage determination can be decomposed into equalizing, dispersing and turbulently equalizing factors. Empirically, we show graphically and econometrically for 31 U.S. industries in 1987-2016 that wage differentials, like regulating profit rates, are governed by turbulent equalization. Furthermore, we apply a fixed effects OLS as well as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model and find that the link between regulating profit rates and wage differentials is positive, significant and robust.
B12|The Rise and Fall of Unproductive Activities in the US Economy 1964-2015: Facts, Theory and Empirical Evidence|The general idea about unproductive labour and the associated with it activities is that they tend to expand and by expanding reduce the investible product and the growth potential of the economy, however little is known about the determinants of their movement. In this study, we take a closer look at the US unproductive labour and activities in general during the long enough 1964-2015 period. As possible determinants of the movement of unproductive activities we consider the economy-wide average rate of profit, the real interest rate and the degree of capacity utilization. The Toda Yamamoto causality tests, as well as the ARDL econometric model, lend support to the view that the unproductive expenditures and activities are determined rather than determine the above variables. Furthermore, the error correction term indicates that a long-run equilibrium relationship exists and it is attainable after the passage of not too long time.
B12|Ricardo’s Theory of Value is Still Alive and Well in Contemporary Capitalism|The purpose of this article is, on the one hand, to shed light on some significant aspects of Ricardo's theory of value and on the other hand to show that Ricardo's insights about the explanatory power of the relative labour times on the movement of relative prices were in the right direction. For this purpose, Ricardo's theory of value is cast rigorously and in modern terms such that by using detailed intertemporal data from input-output tables of two major economies to show that Ricardo's insights are absolutely consistent with the facts.
B12|Hisbah Pemikiran Ekonomi Islam Umar Bin Khattab<BR>[Islamic Economic Islamic Thought Of Umar Bin Khattab]|This article writes about the thoughts of Islamic economic figure Umar Bin Khattab during his caliphate as the 2nd khalifah of the Rashidin Khulafah. The method used is the historical approach of Islamic economic thought through a historical method that reveals the thought of the Islamic economic figure Umar Bin Khattab in the field of Islamic economics. From the results of the analysis it can be concluded that Umar Bin Khattab during his reign, gave many brilliant ideas and ideas and established practical, technical, and operational policies for a country. In the reign of Umar Bin Khattab, the basic practices and concepts of al-Hisbah were formed even he him self became his muhtasib. Economic system that prevailed in the Umar Bin Khattab is the forerunner of the growth of Islamic economy. The economy aims to prosper and prosper society to prevent poverty.
B12|Stigler on Ricardo|The paper scrutinises George Stigler’s interpretation of Ricardo's theory. Like many marginalists, he assesses Ricardo’s contribution in terms of marginalist theory. This confirms Piero Sraffa’s observation that by the end of the nineteenth century the analytical structure, content and genuine significance of the classical theory had been “submerged and forgotten”. However, Stigler's textual acuteness makes him see important elements of Ricardo’s analysis that resist the marginalist interpretation. His irritation can only have been increased by Sraffa’s exposition of Ricardo’s sur-plus-based theory of profits in volume I of the Ricardo edition. This contradicted mar-ginal productivity theory of profits. Stigler praises Sraffa’s edition beyond all measure, refrains however from discussing his interpretation. Things do not change after Sraffa in 1960 publishes a logically consistent formulation of the classical theory of value and distribution. Sraffa's interpretation challenged Stigler's ideological position, which, however, he did not feel the need, or possibility, to defend.
B12|Sraffa’s Silenced Revival of the Classical Economists and of Marx|The standpoint of the old classical economists as well as of Marx “has been submerged and forgotten since the advent of the ‘marginal’ method” – to borrow Sraffa’s own words. The neoclassical (or ‘marginal’) paradigm, in fact, triumphantly dominated over the twentieth century (and is still dominating even now). A serious step towards the rehabilitation of the paradigm of the old classical economists was made by Sraffa (1951) with his remarkable ‘Introduction’ to Ricardo’s Principles, his seminal 1960 book Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities (PCMC) followed a few years later, as a logical completion of his long-standing work. The paper here proposed argues that Sraffa’s 1960 contribution has so far been mainly interpreted and used as a highly powered tool for destroying the foundations of neoclassical theory from a logical point of view, with the confident belief that attacking the logical side of the theory would have been sufficient to bring about its definite dismissal, which, instead, did not happen. As a consequence of all this, the revival of the classical economists and of Marx – which is one of the most characterizing feature of Sraffa’s 1960 contribution – was automatically silenced and this very fact precluded Sraffa’s theoretical framework from being used in a constructive way as a real alternative ‘vision’ to that proposed by the neoclassical market-centered paradigm. The aim of the paper is to underscore the crucial importance of Sraffa’s revival referred to above, by emphasizing its usefulness in providing a genuine alternative perspective and a radically different representation of the economy, compared with that provided by neoclassical theory. An attempt will be made to show the main features of the Sraffian framework in providing such an alternative ‘vision’ which, it will be argued, is now much needed, not least for suggesting far more sensible alternative economic policies than those so far pursued in the ceaseless turmoil of present day world economies.

B12|The Composition of Capital and Technological Unemployment: Marx's (and Ricardo's) Intellectual Debt to John Barton and George Ramsay|This brief note contends that Marx's (and Ricardo's) views on fixed (constant) and circulating (variable) capital,the impact of machinery on the working class,and their conception of how the accumulation of capital gives rise to a relative diminution in the demand for labor were strongly influenced by the works of English economists John Barton and George Ramsay. With a few notable exceptions, Marx's (and Ricardo's)intellectual debt to these classical economists has been practically neglected in the extant literature. Second, the note delves into Marx's theory of technological unemployment (surplus labor) and its main components. Again, the textual evidence strongly suggests that Marx was influenced by the writings of Barton, Ricardo, and Ramsay. The latter seems to have also influenced Marx's conception of one of the three major components of the surplus population, viz. the latent component.
B12|The Next World and the New World: Relief, Migration, and the Great Irish Famine|Ireland on the eve of the Great Famine was a poor and backward economy. The Great Irish Famine of the 1840s is accordingly often considered the classic example of Malthusian population economics in action. However, unlike most historical famines, the Great Famine was not the product of a harvest shortfall, but of a major ecological disaster. Because there could be no return to the status quo ante, textbook famine relief in the form of public works or food aid was not enough. Fortunately, in an era of open borders mass emigration helped contain excess mortality, subject to the limitation that the very poorest could not afford to leave. In general, the authorities did not countenance publicly assisted migration. This paper discusses the lessons to be learned from two exceptional schemes for assisting destitute emigrants during and in the wake of the Famine.
B12|Classifications of innovations: Survey and future directions|The purpose of this paper is to focus on similarity and/or heterogeneity of taxonomies of innovation present in the economic fields to show as the economic literature uses different names to indicate the same type of technical change and innovation, and the same name for different types of innovation. This ambiguity of classification makes it impossible to compare the various studies; moreover the numerous typologies existing in the economics of innovation, technometrics, economics of technical change, management of technology, etc., have hindered the development of knowledge in these fields. The research presents also new directions on the classification of innovation that try to overcome these problems.
B12|Assessing the Fiscal Sustainability of the Czech Republic|We present a model of public finance for the Czech Republic that addresses the main sources of risks to long-term fiscal sustainability: ageing-related expenditures and revenues, and the corresponding evolution of government debt. The baseline model is based on recent demographic projections issued by the Czech Statistical Office that forecast a shrinking share of the working-age population. Along with regulations and microeconomic incentives embedded in the tax and expenditure systems, demographic developments will affect economic growth and government expenditure and revenues in the long run. Population ageing is found to have a significant impact on future government expenditure via spending on old-age pensions and health care, where the cost profiles are modelled to reflect technological progress in the treatment of ageing-related illnesses. The analysis shows that under the current policy settings, a compound demographic effect will cause the primary government balance to turn negative at the beginning of the 2030s. The growing primary deficits, along with interest payments, which react to debt dynamics, will lead to a rapid escalation of government debt. While the outcome of the model is dependent on the specific settings of macroeconomic trends and policy variables, our wide range of sensitivity analyses show that without a policy response, even the most optimistic population scenario delivers an unsustainable path for public finances.
B12|Political Economics and Possibilism: Towards an Open Notion of Development|Hirschman was both a pioneer and a dissenter of development economics. He shares with the high theory the virtues and misfortunes of committing to modernize the underdeveloped world, but his exposure to the politics of development in Latin America gave new life to his early insights. Revealing the political dimensions of his concepts on economic development, Hirschman provides some mini-building blocks for a political economics consistent with an open notion of development. This inquiry, however, should not be seen exclusively through a methodological lens; it is grounded on his possibilism, a claim about modernity and the possibility of change. This article reconsiders the legacy of Hirschman’s thought for current debates on development and calls for recuperating his commitment to open societies.
B12|50 años de economía de la cultura. Explorando sus raíces en la historia del pensamiento económico|El artículo tiene por objetivo rastrear elementos clave desde el pensamiento económico que en principio limitaron y posteriormente permitieron el acercamiento de la economía al análisis de los bienes y servicios culturales. La contribución del artículo es doble. Por un lado, se sintetiza cómo se incorporó la modelización del consumo de bienes culturales al análisis económico, a partir de una selectiva revisión de la literatura de prestigiosos economistas en la historia del pensamiento económico. Por otro lado, se describen los elementos que configuran la economía de la cultura como un área dinámica de especialización, perfectamente situada y con prestigio intelectual en la economía. ***** The objective of this paper is to rediscover key elements of economic thought, which first limited and then paved the way for an economic analysis of cultural goods and services. This paper contributes in two ways. Firstly, we show how modelling the consumption of cultural goods was undertaken by economic analysis. In order to do so, we have selectively used the relevant literature written by prestigious economists on the economic thought history. Secondly, we describe the elements that form the basis of cultural economics. These can be understood as a dynamic area of specialization, they are perfectly situated and are intellectually prestige within the economy.
B12|Central Bank Digital Currency and the Future of Monetary Policy|We consider how a central bank digital currency (CBDC) could transform all aspects of the monetary system and facilitate the systematic and transparent conduct of monetary policy. In particular, we find that CBDC can serve as a practically costless medium of exchange, secure store of value, and stable unit of account. To achieve these criteria, CBDC would be account-based and interest-bearing, and the monetary policy framework would foster true price stability.
B12|The Neoclassicals' Conundrum: If Adam Smith Is the Father of Economics, It Is a Bastard Child|Neoclassical economists of the current era frequently pay lip service to Adam Smith's theories to certify the validity of natural-laws-based, laissez-faire policies. However, neoclassical theories are fundamentally disconnected from Adam Smith's notion of value, his understanding of the economic individual and their interactions in society, his methodology, and the field of study he afforded to political economy. Instead, early neoclassical economists parted ways with the theories of Adam Smith in an effort to construct economic laws that would validate the existing capitalist order as universal, natural, and harmonious.
B12|Central Bank Digital Currency And The Future Of Monetary Policy|We consider how a central bank digital currency (CBDC) can transform all aspects of the monetary system and facilitate the systematic and transparent conduct of monetary policy. Drawing on a very long strand of literature in monetary economics, we find a compelling rationale for establishing a CBDC that serves as a stable unit of account, a practically costless medium of exchange, and a secure store of value. In particular, the CBDC should be universally accessible and interest-bearing, and the central bank should adjust its interest rate to foster true price stability.
B12|Regularities in Prices of Production and the Concentration of Compositions of Capitals|Recent developments in price of production models have proposed a hypothesis on the structure of the input coefficient matrices to explain the empirical near-linearity and monotonicity found in prices as a function of income distribution - the tendency towards zero of subdominant eigenvalues. The objective of this paper is twofold: First, based on the behavior of observed eigenvalues, the paper shows that they cannot explain by their own the regularities found in prices of production. Second, it is shown theoretically and empirically the existence and relevance of an additional force acting on the input matrix and the labor coefficient vector: the concentration of industries' vertically integrated compositions of capital around their average. It is argued that the combined effect of these two factors produces the empirical regularities in relative prices. The tendency of the vertically integrated labor to means of production proportions to cluster around their average reveals the existence of an economic force acting on the structure of technology of observable economies and calls for an explanation. The paper relies on the US 1987- 2007 Input-Output accounts, at the highest disaggregation level (between 370-466 sectors), for the empirical evidence in this paper.
B12|The Political Economy of Real Exchange Rate Behavior: Theory and Empirical Evidence for Developed and Developing Countries, 1960-2010|Empirical results of the PPP hypothesis have constantly shown that relative prices do not converge to the same level, neither in the short nor the long run. Therefore the PPP explanation of the determination of the real exchange rate is not operative to get a reasonable measure of competitiveness at the international level. In this paper, we put forth a different approach based on the works of Ricardo, Marx, Harrod, and Shaikh, which argues that the real relative unit labor cost is the main force that explains the long-run behavior of the real exchange rate. In the second section of the paper we explain the theoretical underpinnings of our proposed approach. In the third section we analyze the role of the real interest rate differential in explaining real exchange rate misalignments. In the fourth section, we present a graphical analysis of the interrelation among the real effective exchange rate, the real unit labor cost ratio, the short-run real interest rate differential, and the trade balance for sixteen OECD countries, Taiwan, and three developing countries for the period 1960-2010. In the fifth section we investigate the long-run relationship between the latter three indexes through cointegrating and error correction models using the ARDLECM framework. The last section provides our conclusions.
B12|Gravitation of market prices towards normal prices: some new results|The gravitation process of market prices towards production prices is here presented by means of an analytical framework where the classical capital mobility principle is coupled with a determination of the deviation of market from normal (natural) prices which closely follows the description provided by Adam Smith: each period the level of the market price of a commodity will be higher (lower) than its production price if the quantity brought to the market falls short (exceeds) the level of effectual demand. This approach also simplifies the results with respect to those obtained in cross-dual literature. At the same time, anchoring market prices to effectual demands and quantities brought to the markets requires a careful study of the dynamics of the ‘dimensions’ along with that of the 'proportions' of the system. Three different versions of the model are thus proposed, to study the gravitation process: i) assuming a given level of aggregate employment; ii) assuming a sort of Say's law; iii) and on the basis of an explicit adjustment of actual outputs to effectual demands. All these cases describe dynamics in which market prices can converge asymptotically towards production prices.
B12|XV. ve XIX. Yüzyıllar Arasında Osmanlı Para Vakıfları ve Modern Finans Kurumlarının Karşılaştırılması<BR>[A Comparison between Ottoman Cash Waqfs and Modern Financial Institutions between 15th and 19th Centuries]|Most of the services provided by modern states to their citizens today were provided by the waqfs during the Ottoman period. The fact that the influence of Islamic religion on the social life was high was one of the most important factors driving people to establish the waqfs. The waqfs founded by philanthropists financed such social needs as religious services, education and infrastructure. The cash waqfs (CWs) were one of the waqf types that financed the needs of the society. The CWs whose capital was cash money provided financial sources to entrepreneurs who were in need of cash according to Islamic methods. The CWs continued to function until the last period of the Ottomans. That the Ottomans used CWs to carry out the functions of the modern financial institutions of Europe is important to understand the Ottoman economic and financial mentality. By using the primary sources, this study aims to analyze the Ottoman economic mentality through studying CWs. In addition, the financial institutions operating in Europe in the same Günümüzde modern devletler tarafından vatandaşlara sağlanan çoğu hizmetler, Osmanlı döneminde vakıflar tarafından sağlanıyordu. İslâm dininin toplumsal hayat üzerindeki etkisinin yüksek olması insanları vakıf kurmaya iten önemli etkenlerin başında geliyordu. Hayırseverler tarafından kurulan vakıflar, dini hizmetler, eğitim, altyapı vb. toplumsal ihtiyaçları finanse etmekteydi. Para vakıfları, toplumun ihtiyaçlarını finanse eden vakıf türlerinden birisidir. Sermayesi nakit paradan oluşan bu vakıflar ihtiyacı olan girişimcilere İslâmî usullere göre finansman sağlamıştır. Para vakıfları Osmanlıların son dönemlerine kadar işleyişini devam ettiren kurumlar olmuştur. Osmanlıların, aynı dönemde Avrupa’daki modern finansal kurumların gelişmesine karşı para vakıfları ile bu kurumların işlevlerini yerine getirmesi, Osmanlı iktisadi ve finansal zihniyetini anlamak açısından önemlidir. Bu çalışmanın amacı birincil kaynaklarından incelenen para vakıfları ile Osmanlı iktisadi zihniyetini analiz etmektir. Ayrıca aynı dönemde faaliyet gösteren ve para vakıfları ile çağdaş olarak Avrupa’da faaliyet gösteren finansal kurumlar da incelenecek ve iktisadi zihniyetler arasında karşılaştırma yapılmaya çalışılacaktır.

B12|Is Marx’S Absolute Rent Due To A Monopoly Price?|Absolute rent, in Marx’s view, has an upper limit represented by the difference between the value and the price of production of agricultural commodities. The actual relevance of this limit was questioned by Bortkiewicz and other scholars because of the difficulties concerning the argument which Marx based it on. The lack of this upper limit prompted a number of scholars to claim that there is no difference between absolute rent and a rent paid by a monopoly price. Referring to the classical/Marxian theory of monopoly price, we shall argue that is still possible— notwithstanding the missing upper limit—to distinguish absolute rent from a rent actually due to a monopoly price. In particular, the difference between the two rests on the removability (in the case of absolute rent) or the persistency (in the case of monopoly rent) of the obstacle to the expansion of agricultural production.
B12|Marx and Ricardo on machinery: a critical note| This article critically discusses the important and relevant—not to mention controversial— views of Ricardo and Marx on the impact of machinery on labor productivity, the organization of production and the wages and employment prospects of the working class during the capitalism of their day. First, the article turns to Ricardo’s assessment of the introduction of machinery and its likely effects on the laborer and the rate of profit and accumulation—one which went through a substantial revision (and reversal) between the first and third editions of his Principles of Political Economy and Taxation. Then, we discuss Marx’s own critical analysis of the historical development of machinery and its impact on the labor process, the so-called “compensation principle,” and how the rising organic composition of capital ostensibly generates a “redundant or surplus-population” during the course of capitalist development. We highlight Marx’s intellectual debt to Ricardo, John Barton (and George Ramsay) insofar as his theory of technological unemployment is concerned. Lastly, the article summarizes the views of Ricardo and Marx and offers some concluding remarks.
B12|Fission, forking and fine tuning|Perhaps because we live in the age of the Internet and social networks, everyone seems agreed that innovation is all about recombination. Although not fully dissenting from this consensus, and perhaps in the end affirming it in an important way, I want to draw attention to some apparently different mechanisms of innovation, both suggested by Adam Smith: subdivision (or differentiation) and fine-tuning. On the surface at least, these – especially the second – do not appear to be processes of recombination. I will attempt to elucidate what I mean by these concepts and try to think about how they fit together with recombination in a full Smithian account of innovation. Whether innovation proceeds from the top down or the bottom up depends crucially on the structure of complementary stages in the process of production. Especially if it takes place in a non-modular way, recombination may require unified decision rights, implying the vertical integration of complementary stages of production, in order to overcome the dynamic transaction costs of change. But the processes of subdivision and differentiation may also require changes in decision rights in order to overcome dynamic transaction costs. I illustrate these points with a case study of three generations of an American family of inventor-entrepreneurs in electricity and electronics.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
B12|J.S. Mill And The Universality Of The “Desire Of Wealth”|This paper deals with a debate about the universality of the “desire of wealth” in John Stuart Mill’s thought. The debate occurred in the literature about fifteen years ago, when Samuel Hollander and Sandra Peart published in 1999 a criticism of Abraham Hirsch and Neil De Marchi’s interpretation of Mill’s methodology. This article constitutes an attempt to solve the debate by providing a rationale for the disagreement between both sets of scholars. In particular, we show that the divergence between them comes from the fact that they ground their respective arguments using different texts, while neglecting that Mill gradually changed his mind in his writings subsequent to the 1836 essay entitled “On the Definition of Political Economy...”. First, in accordance with the development of his ethology, Mill deprived the maximizing behavior of its universal validity; then, Mill focused more and more on “competition” as economics’ basic axiom in order to stress its historical relevance; and finally Mill strengthened the relativity of the behavioral axiom with the introduction of the concept of “custom”.
B12|Bofinger and Ries versus Borio and Disyatat: macroeconomics after endogenous money. A brief note|A paper by Peter Bofinger and Mathias Ries (2017a/b) strays from the recent rethinking in monetary analysis to criticise Summers’ “saving glut” explanation of the prevalence of low real interest rates. A similar critical perspective is held by Borio and Disyatat (e.g. 2011a/b, 2015), who are criticised, however, by Bofinger and Reis for their Wicksellian background. In this note, we compare and assess these two different views. Both Bofinger and Reis (B&R) and Borio and Disyatat (B&D) reject traditional “loanable fund theory” in favour of an endogenous money view of credit, but while B&R regard conventional marginalist (real) theory as inconsistent with the endogenous money view, B&D, following Wicksell, regard it as consistent. We sympathize with B&R’s criticism of conventional theory, especially their Keynesian view of the interest rate as a purely monetary phenomenon. Interestingly, B&R refer to the problems of marginalist capital theory as undermining the natural interest rate concept
B12|Ricardo's Numerical Example Versus Ricardian Trade Model: a Comparison of Two Distinct Notions of Comparative Advantage|The so-called Ricardian trade model of contemporary economic textbooks is not a rational reconstruction of Ricardo's famous numerical example in chapter seven of the Principles. It differs from the latter in terms of the definition of the four numbers, relevant cost comparison, rule for specialisation, assumptions and theoretical implications. Thus, the widespread critique regarding the unrealistic assumptions of the textbook trade model does not apply to Ricardo's original proof of comparative advantage.
B12|"""Gefangene der Bilder in unseren Köpfen"": Die Macht abstrakten ökonomischen Denkens"|Wie selbstverständlich geht die heutige ökonomische Standardlehre davon aus, dass sie Studierenden eine feste und unveränderliche Sicht auf die Welt vermitteln kann. Doch woher kommt diese Annahme? Walter Lippmann, einer der Begründer des Neoliberalismus, gibt hierauf einen ersten Hinweis: Wirtschaftswissenschaft soll in der Lage sein, Bilder in Köpfen von Menschen zu verankern, die allem Denken und Handeln unbewusst zugrunde liegen, selbst aber nicht schöpferisch veränderbar sind. Anhand dreier Stationen - ausgesuchten Textpassagen von Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill und Léon Walras - zeigt der Beitrag, wie die Wirtschaftswissenschaft hierfür das Denken umformen musste: hin zu einem rein erfahrungsunabhängigen Denken, das seine Inspiration nicht aus der Begegnung mit der Wirklichkeit, sondern allein aus der reinen Mathematik und Mechanik übernimmt. Zugleich zeigt die philosophische Auseinandersetzung mit der Geschichte dieser Wissenschaft, dass diese Umformung selbst weder zwangsläufig noch alternativlos ist. Auch in der Ökonomie lässt sich die schöpferische Kraft des Denkens zurückgewinnen.
B12|Imaginative Grundlagen bei Adam Smith: Aspekte von Bildlichkeit und ihrem Verlust in der Geschichte der Ökonomie|"Adam Smith, der Begründer der Nationalökonomie, hat in der ""Theory of Moral Sentiments"" - basierend auf Ideen von David Hume - das Bild einer moralischen Person entworfen. Diese gewinnt ihre Moralität dadurch, dass sie andauernd Imaginationen über andere und über sich selbst unternimmt. Dieses Menschenbild weist viele Implikationen für die Wirtschaftstheorie auf. Es geriet in der Folgezeit in der Ökonomie rasch in Vergessenheit. Von Smith ausgehend kann die Geschichte der ökonomischen Theorien als Verlust von Bildlichkeit und der Bedeutung von Imaginationen für wirtschaftliches Handeln verstanden werden. Dies wird in einem knappen Überblick über einige Aspekte der Theoriegeschichte geschildert."
B12|Vom Tätig-Sein und Güter-Haben|Geldökonomien vermitteln nicht einfach Wirtschaftssubjekte; sie führen zu einer charakteristischen Trennung zwischen Arbeitenden und Konsumenten. Während die klassische Ökonomie die Arbeit in den Mittelpunkt rückte, sollen nach neoklassischer Lehre die Konsumenten durch ihre Präferenzen die gesamte Ökonomie über die Preise steuern. Diese Denkfigur wird nachfolgend in ihrer ideologischen Funktion dechiffriert. Die Reduktion der meisten Menschen auf die Rolle passiver Konsumenten, die andererseits beim Gelderwerb dem Diktat des Eigentums als Arbeitskraft subsumiert sind, prägt sowohl die Struktur der modernen kapitalistischen Gesellschaften wie die Psyche der Menschen. Die Dualität von Tätig-Sein und Güter-Haben entpuppt sich als spezifische Herrschaftsform.
B12|Démographie, économie, culture|Relations between demography and economics are complex. Studied from the beginning by economists (Petty, Malthus), demography has not evolved as a branch of economics. During the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century demography has been deeply influenced by biology and culture. Nevertheless by the mid-20th century, demography returned to the social sciences thereby facilitating the analysis of its links with economics (Sauvy, Fourasti?, Becker). Today, demographic studies lean on cultural anthropology and economics as shown in this article through several cases. Finally these two disciplines appear to be complementary, the first one being focused on the long term and the other one on the short term, in particular as regards financial aspects.

B12|On the Possibility of Justice in Commercial Society according to Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Adam Smith|Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Adam Smith stand on opposite sides regarding their appraisal of commercial society. The citizen of Geneva is known as one of its most harsh critiques, whereas the Scottish philosopher is considered as one of its main advocates. However, both authors coincide on one aspect: justice is the main pillar of any society. In this text, I explore this point in order to advance our understanding about the contrast between these two major figures.
B12|Fifty years of Cultural Economics. Exploring the roots in the history of economic thought|The objective of this paper is to backtrack key elements from the economic thought which limited and then allowed the approach of the economy to the analysis of cultural goods and services. The contribution of this paper is double. On the one hand, we synthesize how the modeling of consume of cultural goods was embodied to economic analysis, with this aim we use a selective revision of the literature of prestigious economists on the economic thought history. On the other hand, we describe the elements which form the basis of cultural economics as a dynamic area of specialization, which be perfectly identified and with an intellectual prestige on the economy.
B12|The Converging and Diverging Views of Wilhelm von Humboldt and John Stuart Mill on the Subjects of Self-development and the Role of the State|This article shows that a number of the key points expressed by Mill in On Liberty (1859) were very similar to many ideas that Humboldt presented in The Limits of State Action (1792). In fact, it was by Humboldt that Mill gained an appreciation for the concept of self-development. The primary goal of his paper, however, is to find significant differences in their respective ideas on the role of the state as a way to facilitate the development of individuality. It also claims that these differences can be mainly attributed to Mill having had the opportunity to directly observe the negative impacts of industrial capitalism, which led him to defend a positive state role in counteracting them.
B12|La philosophie sociale est-elle un no man's land ? Réflexions sur l'idée d'émancipation de l'économie politique|Le domaine de la philosophie sociale peut être vu, en suivant Hayek, comme un no man's land engendré par le processus d'autonomisation de la science économique et en particulier son émancipation de la politique. Cet article montre au contraire que, d'une part, ce processus ne répond pas à un souci de spécialisation mais se présente comme une réponse politique particulière visant à soumettre l'action politique à des impératifs économiques, et, d'autre part, qu'il existe une autre conception de l'économie politique qui, dans le prolongement de Hume et de Smith, lie étroitement économie et philosophie. Il en résulte que, dans un cas comme dans l'autre, l'idée hayékienne selon laquelle la philosophie sociale serait un no man's land s'évanouit.
B12|Two different sources of inequalities: profits and rents in advanced market economies|The starting point of our research is Piketty (2014) who follows Marx by asserting that rents are merely one of the forms of profits, therefore they do not require separate conceptual analysis and statistical separation. Speaking of the generation of rents (as a distinctly different mechanism from profit maximising business activity), we use a broader notion of rent than it was customary in the past 50 years. We return to the Ricardian tradition and define the institution of rent as payments for goods, services or for work in employment that exceed the competitive price. Our rent concept includes – inter alia - the income of those whose jobs are protected by unions or professional associations, with the same holding for top-managers or celebrities of the entertainment industry. We also show that state-generated oligopolies are not necessarily evil, as they are often justified by other social objectives than equity. To conclude, three main propositions are presented: (i) rents are not anomalies of the advanced market economies, they are indispensable building blocks of it; (ii) rents are not the privilege of large companies and their owners; (iii) rents, rather than profits are the main driving force of the increase of wealth inequalities since the 1970s
B12|The Development of Development Economics|This paper discusses the historical roots of development economics and how it has changed over the last half century. We first identify the most important changes in orientation within development economics and discuss whether there are important areas that have been side-lined. Then we look at current work in development economics and discuss where the field should go in the future.
B12|The transformations of utility theory: a behavioral perspective|Abstract The aim of this paper is threefold. First, it reappraises the major transformations which the utilitarian approach to human behavior has undergone in economics in search for a representation by utility functions and later by preference orders. Second, in the light of today’s behavioral and human sciences, an attempt is made to restore some elements of early utilitarianism that were abandoned in these transformations. Third, in line with the interest of the early utilitarians in both explaining behavior and elaborating on its moral assessment, the present paper also discusses some normative implications of the suggested restoration of utilitarian theory.

B12|Financial Stability and Secure Currency in a Modern Context|"Against the background of modern-day monetary proposals, ranging from a return to the gold standard to the wholesale abolition of currency, this paper seeks to draw implications from David Ricardo's ""Proposals for an Economical and Secure Currency"" for plans to reform the operation of central banks and extraordinary monetary policy. Although 200 years old, the ""Ingot plan,"" proposed during a period in which gold convertibility was suspended, appears to be applicable to modern monetary conditions and suggests possible avenues of reform."

B12|Rent as a share of product and Sraffa’s price equations|The classical economists usually regarded rent in their analyses as a share of the gross product obtained from the use of land or a mine, which was indeed the way rent was treated in bargaining between landowner and tenant. The article revives this view of rent, proceeding from its historical basis through Smith’s analysis to arrive at Sraffa’s equations, and also examines the case of the introduction of a tax conceived as a tithe, to which Sraffa referred very briefly (Sraffa, 1960, p 55).
B12|Ricardo on Machinery: A Textual Analysis|"Modern production theory (Kurz and Salvadori, 1995) is utilized to provide a textual analysis of the famous chapter ""On Machinery"" added by Ricardo in the third edition of his Principles and to reconstruct the examples that are reported there. Two sets of assumptions that rationalize the basic example presented by Ricardo are identified: a) the innovation concerns a non-basic commodity; b) the innovation concerns an agricultural commodity and it does not change the technology applied on the marginal land, which is still marginal after the innovation. Ricardo was aware of these two facts and he seems to have used the latter of the two in his initial example. In effect, the example holds perfectly well if it is assumed that the new machine is specific to a quality of land that is marginal neither in the pre-innovation nor in the post-innovation economy. When the innovation is introduced in the production of an industrial commodity (cloth) that is used by the workers, as in the second example discussed by Ricardo, the rate of profits, and therefore the rate of growth, cannot be the same in the pre-innovation and in the post-innovation economy, unless the innovation is introduced in a switch-point between the technique employed prior to the innovation and that used after the innovation. This is too strong an assumption and can be of some interest only if it provides information about events that occur in the vicinity of a switch point. This “continuity” assumption is what Ricardo seems to have used as the basis for discussion in his second example."
B12|Sraffa on the Degeneration of the Notion of Cost|The paper reconstructs the history of what Sraffa called the ‘degeneration of cost’ as emerges from his manuscripts of the late 1920s. In particular, Sraffa regards the Physiocrats as having the correct idea of cost as being the commodities that allow workers to subsist. The classical economists measured this bundle of commodi-ties in terms of labour, which they also ambiguously viewed as ‘toil and trouble’. Then, the idea of labour as ‘toil and trouble’ was indicated by neoclassical authors as an anticipation of their conception of cost as a sacrifice. Conferring also upon abstinence from consumption the nature of sacrifice, the neoclassical-marginalist theory understood wages and interest as compensation for the disutility of working and saving. Then, cost was ultimately seen as what induces workers and capitalists to produce. This completed the degeneration of cost from the objective-physical conception of the Physiocrats to the subjective-psychological view of the neoclassical school.

B12|Absolute Advantage and International Trade|The purpose of this paper is to give empirical content to the approach of international trade based on the principle of absolute advantage and to show that differences in productivity may give rise to transfers of value towards the units of capital with an absolute advantage in production. Our approach is based on the classical/Marxian theories of value and competition and it is operationalized using input-output data for the years 1995, 2000, and 2005 of four euro-zone countries (Greece, Spain, Finland, and the Netherlands). The derived results are consistent with the view that productivity differences persist over the years, which is equivalent to saying that the absolute advantage in production does not change into comparative advantage.
B12|O poszukiwaniu przyczyn bogactwa i nędzy narodów w teorii Darona Acemoglu i Jamesa A. Robinsona|Celem artykułu jest analiza głównych koncepcji, jakie wysuwano w ciągu dwu stuleci rozwoju nauk ekonomicznych, próbując odpowiedzieć na fundamentalne dla ekonomii pytanie badawcze, a mianowicie: jakie czynniki warunkują rozwój gospodarczy poszczególnych krajów i społeczeństw? Przegląd i uporządkowanie istniejących stanowisk umożliwia uzyskanie niezbędnego punktu odniesienia dla oceny jednej z najnowszych koncepcji autorstwa Darona Acemoglu i Jamesa A. Robinsona spopularyzowanej w bestsellerowej monografii Why Nations Fail? The Origins of Power, Prosperity and Poverty [2012; wyd. polskie 2014]. Metodę badawczą pozwalającą na realizację powyższego celu stanowią pogłębione studia literaturowe. Najistotniejsze wnioski z przeprowadzonej analizy można sprowadzić do stwierdzenia, że: (1) gros autorów wskazuje wiele elementów istotnych dla rozwoju gospodarczego (teorie jednoczynnikowe zdarzają się sporadycznie), (2) ogół istniejących teorii można umieścić w ramach spektrum rozciągającego się od koncepcji, w których nadrzędna rola jest przypisana różnorakim komponentom środowiska naturalnego (co prowadzi do wysuwania różnych odmian hipotezy geograficznej), po wyjaśnienia, w których na pierwszym planie postawione są czynniki zależne od aktywności człowieka (co owocuje wariantami hipotezy instytucjonalnej). Koncepcja Acemoglu i Robinsona plasuje się zdecydowanie bliżej instytucjonalnego krańca wskazanego spektrum, choć wprowadzenie przez tych badaczy trudnego do akceptacji i obrony na gruncie ich własnych rozważań rozgraniczenia pomiędzy hipotezami: instytucjonalną i kulturową niesłusznie sugeruje, że instytucje można rozpatrywać niezależnie od ich kontekstu kulturowego oraz prowadzi do osłabienia wymowy ich skądinąd wartościowej teorii.
B12|J.S.Mill and Ireland's 'Land Question': An illustration of his views on social institutions|It is argued that J.S.Mill’s position in the debate over the ‘Land Question’ in Ireland can be best understood from the viewpoint of his theory of institutions. He thought that, to be adequate, institutions should promote progress – that is, human improvement, a rise of economic productivity and the increase of social justice – without endangering social order. The prevalent form of land occupation in Ireland – the cottier system – did not fulfil any of these requisites, and was an important obstacle to amelioration. It was at the root of Ireland’s low state of moral and economic development and of the social and political tensions that endangered the social order. Thus, in Mill’s evaluation, it should be eliminated. The alternative of transposing to Ireland the ‘English model’ of capitalist agriculture was, notwithstanding, rejected. This institution could eventually solve the economic problem, but involved the unjust eviction of tenants (aggravating social and political tensions) and would not contribute to the desired regeneration of the Irish character. Given the historical, cultural and political particularities of Ireland, Mill endorsed peasant property as the most suitable form of land appropriation. Its introduction would, at once, improve the character of the people, enhance productivity and increase the degree of social justice of the system. It would also mitigate social and political conflicts that jeopardized social order
B12|Which Economics? Which Economies?|Abstract It is argued that the problems affecting our societies at present are not so much the result of a mysterious disappearance of inventiveness and imagination, as Phelps deplores. It is rather the dramatic change of the socio-economic order propelled by the neoliberal ideology that captured the minds of many people and politicians. This led to a de-regulation of financial markets and a policy of austerity, which triggered the “Great Recession” and stifled innovation. There is also the problem of a mismatch between our measurement devices and what is to be measured in a world of bits and bytes. With the firm establishment and growth of R&D&I in all Western economies the talk about a declining innovativeness ought to be received with suspicion. New materials and rare earths, biotechnology, further advances in ICT and what is called the fourth industrial revolution based on cyber-physical systems can be expected to have an important impact on economic performance.

A Caution for Deviation from Natural Economy|Abstract The fundamental problem issue of this paper is that a fundamental cause of economic crises, such as the dot-com bubble, the Lehman crash, or PIIGS, from which the current capitalist economy is suffering, lies in a large deviation from a natural economy. Any large deviation from the natural economy entails high risk. Akimoto (Int J Econ Sci III(4):1–37, 2014) proved this proposition. This leads to a question of whether a mechanism,in which a natural economy operates to begin with, exists in the macroeconomy. First, we adopt the definition by Pasinetti (Structural change and economic growth; a theoretical essay on the dynamics of the wealth of nation. Cambridge University Press, 1981) from a macroeconomic viewpoint, because it depends on the structure of the production process. However, there is no guarantee that the natural economy defined by Pasinetti (Structural change and economic growth; a theoretical essay on the dynamics of the wealth of nation. Cambridge University Press, 1981) operates in the macroeconomy. If Akimoto’s (Int J Econ Sci III(4):1–37, 2014) analysis is correct, we need to prove that a mechanism through which the natural economy operates does in fact exist in the macroeconomy. We construct a macroeconomic game with capitalists and workers as players. The macroeconomy involves circulating players’ savings to investments via capital markets. This process constructs Kaldor’s fundamental equation. We prove that a Nash equilibrium exists, which carries out a natural economy and balanced economic growth. In addition, the theoretical analysis demonstrates that Kaldor’s fundamental equation, which is Keynesian, becomes an identity, i.e., 1 $$=$$ = 1. This implies that the Keynesian equation brings about a classical result.
B12|"""Drop the dead donkey"": a response to Steven Kates on the subject of Mill's fourth proposition on capital"|Steven Kates has recently (2015a) attempted to explain and justify J S Millâ€™s paradoxical â€œfourth proposition on capitalâ€ , which states that â€œdemand for commodities is not demand for labourâ€ , a proposition which notoriously â€“ over generations â€“ has baffled many eminent commentators. Kates intends to resolve the puzzle by offering â€œa proper understanding of Sayâ€™s Law as it was understood by Mill and his contemporaries.â€ We conclude that Kates does indeed reveal the logic of Millâ€™s proposition, making it clear that from Millâ€™s lost â€œsupply-sideâ€ perspective, it is in no way puzzling or paradoxical. However, at the same time it becomes evident that Millâ€™s whole position is undermined by his acceptance of the untenable belief that â€œdemand is constituted by supplyâ€ , which leaves us with the clear understanding that his fourth proposition, despite Katesâ€™s rationalisation and defence thereof, as well as certainly being paradoxical, is simply untrue.
B12|"Adam Smith and the labour theory of value: an unconvincing ""reconsideration"""|In a recent paper Terry Peach argues that Adam Smith found no reason to limit application of the labour-embodied theory of value to the case of the â€œearly and rude stateâ€ of society. In fact, not only that: according to Peach, Smith found a problem in employing the labour-commanded measure of value with reference to the contemporary â€œcommercialâ€ economy and, in order to resolve the issue, he (somewhat surreptitiously) abandoned labour-commanded and adopted instead labour-embodied as a generally valid theory of exchange value. However, we find Peachâ€™s revolutionary â€œReconsiderationâ€ to be fatally flawed - for the reason that it derives from Peachâ€™s evident misunderstanding of what is implied by the labour-commanded measure of value.
B12|Why German historicists were wrong to put John Stuart through the Mill|Many German historical economists have denounced classical political economy’s pretension to establish abstract universal laws. This paper seeks to defend John Stuart Mill against this criticism. It argues that, contrary to what these authors alleged, they have a great deal more in common with Mill on this topic than they were willing to realise. In fact, from a methodological as well as a political perspective, their views on relativity regarding both economic laws and the laissez-faire principle are very similar to those of Mill’s..
B12|The modern revival of the Classical surplus approach: implications for the analysis of growth and crises|The paper reviews the main elements of Modern Classical Theory in view of the analysis of contemporary societies and in particular: the recovery of the Classical and Marxist “surplus approach” as a solid foundation for the analysis of social conflict; a demand-led theory of the level and growth of output based on the rejection of Say’s Law and the recovery of the notion of “external markets” put forward by Rosa Luxembourg and Kalecki, as the framework for the investigation of growth and crises in different historical phases of capitalism; the dismantling of the analytical core of Marginalism and of its laissez-faire policy prescriptions; and finally, the rejection of methodological individualism and of subjectivism in economic analysis and the preservation of the analytical methods of the Classical economists and Marx. In this regard, the paper underlines some differences with other heterodox schools, but also convergence with endogenous money theory and with systemic views of technical change.
B12|Foucault's contributions for understanding power relations in British classical political economy|This paper analyzes the strategic role played by British classical political economy in constructing new technologies of power. Michel Foucault drew attention to a change that political economists promoted concerning the role of the state, which has been overlooked by historians of economic thought. This paper explores the main arguments provided by the most important British political economists of the 18th and 19th centuries on what concerns population management, State's role and economic dynamics in order to examine Foucault's considerations. Although British classical political economy consolidated the mechanism of markets and economic individuality, thus creating a system of truth that changed economic norms and practices, its discourse also established a political conduct that was responsible for creating mechanisms of control that disseminated new forms of power relations..
B12|Invoice currency: Puzzling evidence and new questions from Brazil|This article for the first time uses Brazilian trade data to draw conclusions about the invoice currency choice — both in general and as it pertains to the Brazilian real (BRL). We find that the Brazil-Argentina policy of providing payment orders associated to an exchange transaction between their currencies has had a significant impact on the currency chosen for invoicing, establishing a link between the availability of financial instruments and the invoice currency choice. Moreover, the evidence does not confirm some previous international results. We identify that in Brazil there is no coincidence regarding the use of BRL for invoicing and its use for making payments. Yet we find that the main exports denominated in BRL are homogenous goods — sugar and tobacco — suggesting that some bargaining power might remain even if goods are traded in international markets. From the BRL-specific perspective, we categorically move away from the idea that the BRL is not used in Brazilian international trade. Although it is used at a limited absolute volume, an exceptional ninefold growth between 2007 and 2011 is observed. New intriguing questions about Brazilian currency usage can therefore be proposed.Classification-JEL: A12; B12

B12|Una revisión analítica sobre el papel de la tierra en la teoría económica de David Ricardo|Resumen Este artículo tiene como objetivo central analizar el papel del recurso tierra en la teoría económica de David Ricardo como primer acercamiento al análisis económico de los recursos naturales. Esto se realiza mediante una revisión bibliográfica analítica de la obra de Ricardo y de otros autores en torno a la misma. En este sentido, se examina el concepto de renta de la tierra, así como los planteamientos en torno a la llamada ley de los rendimientos decrecientes. Asimismo, se establecen algunas reflexiones críticas con relación al enfoque de la renta de la tierra. Un resultado importante del trabajo es que en el análisis de la renta de Ricardo está ausente el concepto de costo de oportunidad, lo cual implica una reconsideración del concepto de renta para abordar el análisis económico de recursos naturales.
B12|The issue of value in economic thought — Part 1: the evolution of views from the 5th century BC to the mid-19th century|This paper is devoted to the evolution of views on the category of value, which for more than two thousand years has been recognized as one of the most important economic concepts. It appeared in the literature thanks to Herodotus in the 5th century BC. Aristotle distinguished use value and exchange value, and demanded the exchange of goods of equal value. St. Thomas Aquinas argued that prices of traded commodities should be of equal value, and that this value is determined by the amount of labour, production costs, needs and income of buyers, as well as the amount of goods offered for sale. W. Petty found that the amount of labour determines the value of goods. The views of the aforementioned thinkers were developed by J. Locke, J. Steuart Denham and R. Cantillon, the last of whom pointed out that market prices oscillate around the proper value of affected goods. For A.R.J. de Turgot, the purchasing power and needs determine the value set by contractors. However, G.F. Le Trosne acknowledged that proper value is determined by use value, production costs and the abundance of things. These views on the objectively existing value of exchanged products were taken over and developed by A. Smith and D. Ricardo, who made value the foundation of the scientific system of economics. This role of the theory of value in economics was not undermined even by the critics of the classical school, including K. Marx, A.H. Müller, and H.Ch. Carey, although for K. Marx, as for D. Ricardo, the theory of value was an element that integrates the whole theoretical system. In turn, the precursors of the subjective-marginal movement, among others, F. Galiani, E.B. de Condillac, A.A. Cournot, and J.M. Hoene-Wronski made the value of goods dependent on the subjective feelings of individuals satisfying their needs or performing work.
B12|Governance and long-term operating performance of family and non-family firms in Australia|Purpose - – The purpose of this study is to conduct a comparative analysis of the long-term operating performance of family and non-family firms from the agency theoretic perspective. The analysis is focused on investigating the impact of family ownership on principal–agent conflicts of interest. Design/methodology/approach - – This paper examines the relationship between firm operating performance and family ownership for a large sample of 677 Australian-listed companies. The paper uses the Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) estimator model developed by Arellano and Bond (1991) and used by other studies in finance (Baltagi, 2012; Bond, 2002; Mohamed Findings - – The empirical results show that firms with ownership concentration has a better operating performance due to the alignment of owner-management interests. This study also finds that family-listed companies have higher survival rates and perform better than non-family companies. Findings support the hypothesis that agency costs arise as a result of privileged access of information and self-interest behaviour of managers (outsiders) in firms with dispersed ownership structures. Originality/value - – Earlier studies have only focused on short-term perspectives, particularly investigating small and medium types of Australian family businesses from narrow aspects, such as productivity, business behaviour, capital structure and leverage. Therefore, this paper has conducted a comparative examination of family and non-family firms listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) to identify the impact of agency costs on their financial performance.
B12|L'apport de Pellegrino Rossi à la théorie de l'offre et de la demande : une tentative d'interprétation|Cet article réexamine l'apport de Pellegrino Rossi à la loi de l'offre et de la demande par rapport aux contributions de Say, Ricardo ou Smith. Il montre que Rossi développe une théorie de la valeur originale qui emprunte à la fois à la pensée classique anglaise et à la pensée continentale française et fonde sa conception de l'offre et de la demande. L'article met en évidence les mécanismes novateurs que Rossi retient pour expliquer la loi de l'offre et de la demande pour diverses formes de concurrence par rapport à ceux que Say ou Ricardo envisagent pour la seule libre concurrence. On montre que Rossi peut être considéré comme un précurseur du concept de prix de réservation développé par Jules Dupuit et de plusieurs formes de raisonnements à la marge qui l'amènent à proposer une analyse de la loi de l'offre et de la demande originale.
B12|The Classical Bargaining Model for Organized Labor|Classical economists believed that economic value, which is the basis for all discussions pertaining to markets and prices, was determined by the costs of the factors needed to produce the good in question. Economic expansion would require capitalists to pay higher wages to workers because of diminishing productivity in agricultural production, and, as wages rose, capitalist profits would necessarily fall. According to Ricardo, over time this process would lead society to an undesirable stationary state. John Stuart Mill’s extension of the classical labor theory of value provides for a theory of distribution that is separate from the fixed laws of production. Once the theories of production and distribution became disentangled, economists were able to envision ways to influence distributional outcomes that could alleviate the suffering of the majority of the population. We explore the classical labor theory of value and the implications it produces for a theory of distribution. In particular, we discuss Mill’s unique contribution to classical value theory and argue that Mill, through his economic argument in favor of organized labor, actually foresaw the modern literature on uncertainty and information. We illustrate this contribution by way of an example that captures the distributional gains that workers enjoy from repeated negotiations between unions and employers.

B12|Further towards a theory of the emergence of property|This article explores the emergence of property as a moral convention. To understand this process I make use of several laboratory experiments on property in its nascence. These experiments illustrate how a rule of property arises from our knowledge of what is morally right, and not vice versa. I also argue that while the ultimate end of property is our interest in using things, the proximate end of property is not losing them, i.e., the end of a rule of property is to secure from morally unfounded harm.

B12|The economic thought of the first Colombian economists|This paper offers an approximation to the economic thought of the Colombian economists of the middle of the 19th century. It takes some of the most influential economists as a reference: Florentino González, Salvador Camacho Roldán, Aníbal Galindo and Miguel Samper. The way in which the free trade doctrine was incorporated in the thought of the Colombian statesmen is analyzed, mainly with regard to the conception of State. The methodology used is a study of the texts and the rhetoric therein. The conclusion is that the political prescriptions of the economic liberalism, which include the promotion of free trade, the theory of comparative advantage in international trade, the rejection of monopolies and the suspicion on the action of government, exerted a partial influence in the foundation of the liberal nineteenth-century project.
B12|Corps Intermédiaires, Civil Society, and the Art of Association|This paper traces the shifts in treatments of intermediate groups among some liberal and democratic political theorists in the 18th and 19th centuries. The decades of the late 18th and early 19th centuries are traditionally understood to encompass the emergence of fully liberal political and social theory, and an early version of liberal political practice, in France, the UK, and the US; they have lately been identified by North, Wallis, and Weingast as the decades when those three societies substantially made the transition to “open access” political, economic, and legal orders. This transition consists in part in the democratization of organizational tools that had previously been open only to members of the elite, such as the shift from specially chartered monopolistic corporations to general incorporation laws, and that from parliamentary oligopolistic party competition to modern parties competing in wide-suffrage elections. Although the early liberal theorists did not fully perceive the changes happening around them, their analyses and reactions can help us see things about the shift to open-access orders that might not be fully visible in retrospect. To varying degrees they looked forward to the possibility of a pluralism without privilege, but they also had doubts about its possibility. They offered some reasons to prefer pluralism with privilege to the absence of both. They worried that centralization, democratic or otherwise, might be the preeminent fact of modern state consolidation, and that purely voluntary, equal, associational pluralism might not be powerful enough to check it. The kinds of pluralism grounded in ancient regime privilege and status, in entrenched jurisdictional pluralism within the constitutional order, or in pre-political cultural and customary ties might be needed to motivate the oppositional political action that could protect pluralism and freedom.
B12|Smith, Malthus and Recent Evidence in Global Population Dynamics|In conventional economic theories, population is determined outside of the economic system. However, classical political economists such as Adam Smith and Thomas Malthus have long argued for the endogenous determination of population, hence establishing a connection between economics and demography. Foley (2000) used empirically established global per capita output-fertility schedule based on the 1960-1992 Extended Penn World Tables to project the population stabilizing level of world per capita output and population. In this paper we intend to update this line of research using more recent empirical evidences. We find that the world production still exhibits strong pattern of Smithian increasing returns to scale, and most countries' population have been stabilizing along a convex path in the income-fertility schedule. Our projection suggests that the world population will stabilize at per capita income around $ 13,550 in 2005 PPP, and by the year of 2011, the world per capita output was still about $2,824 short. The world population will stabilize around 10 billion assuming the absence of any exogenous shocks to the empirically established global income-fertility relation.
B12|Which Human Qualities Can Economic Liberalism Be Based on?|"The article asks which human qualities can serve as the base for a liberal economic policy. The author is looking for an answer to this question in the classical works of economic liberalism — in the books by F. Bastiat, L. von Mises, F. von Hayek, W. Eucken, and M. Friedman. The two main qualities can be summarized as follows: the relatively high rank of freedom among human values and rational utilitarian calculus. It is assumed that in those countries where the both human prerequisites are present the liberal policy (for instance, liberal reforms) can be self-supportive and may have good results. On the contrary, if the first prerequisite is missing and a liberal policy can be based only on rational calculus, the ""paternalistic"" liberalism prevails and chances for success are much smaller."

The extent of this phenomenon can be easily noticed in an era of speed and technology in which the social, economic and cultural transformations have a great impact on individuals’ reactions. The changes of the business environment, accompanied by the changes that occur in all areas affecting the life of the individual have been studied over time by authors that wished to understand them as singular phenomena and to notice their effects on some other phenomena as well. Migration as a phenomenon with multiple causes is one of the topics far from being exhausted easily.

En este texto pretendo reconstruir esa propuesta, mostrando sus tensiones y contradicciones y la manera como Rojas intentó conciliarse recurriendo a la religión.
B12|The Course of the Profit Rate|In discussions on the rate of profit and its tendency to fall and its role in Marxist theory, a number of phrases are often employed without clarifying what these might really mean. Primary among these are such phrases as ‘the rate of profit must ultimately fall’ and ‘the counter-acting factors cannot possibly offset the tendency in the long run’. As a result of this ambiguity, and as a result of a legacy of confusion concerning Marx’s own ideas on the profit rate beginning with the Western reception of Okishio’s (1961) famous theorem, research on the actual mathematical conditions for the profit rate to rise or fall, especially in the long term, has all but ceased. However there is very strong evidence that the rate of profit has, in fact, been falling in most industrialised economies for some considerable time, and there is good reason to suppose this has at least some bearing on the origins of the present prolonged phase of stagnation in these economies. The time is therefore ripe to return to a rigorous study of the general mathematical conditions that might govern the long-term movement of the profit rate. In particular, I will attempt to give mathematical meaning to the two concepts above

Two mathematical appendices are also provided. The first one shows step by step the construction of the Standard Commodity, which is a consistent solution to the transformation of labour values into prices of production. In Appendix II there is a general numerical example of a price system with two industries which makes the understanding of the distribution of income between wages and profits easier. Using a software spreadsheet, for example, it is possible to make numerical simulations and make comparisons between the results obtained from the Sraffa price system with that obtained from Marx's. This is revised version of the original paper written few years ago.

B12|Capital In the 21st Century: A Review|This paper reviews Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century. Piketty's Capital seeks to bring the issue of inequality back to the centre of social analysis and to encourage discussion about the evolution of wealth and inequality with a view to inform policy. The book uses data stretching as far back as the 1700's. The main thesis of the book is that capitalism automatically generates inequality and wealth concentration since the rate of return on capital always exceeds the growth rate of income. To resolve this problem, the book proposes a progressive tax on wealth and income. I show that Piketty's book is based on a misunderstanding of classical political economy, particularly Marx. Piketty's view of the development and phases of capitalism is inadequate. His tax proposals, though progressive, will not resolve the inequality problem. Lastly, his conclusion that modern economic growth made it possible to avoid the Marxist apocalypse is not borne out by his data.
B12|From endogenous growth to stationary state: The world economy in the mathematical formulation of the Ricardian system| We analyse international trade in a Pasinetti–Ricardo growth model in the world economy scenario in which several small trading countries coexist and international commodity prices are determined by the interplay of supply and demand amongst them. We demonstrate that all the trading countries eventually reach the stationary state, though this process is not monotonic and the dynamics of capital and population may actually push some countries towards the stationary state and others away from it. We also use our model to assess an argument which Malthus employed in the second edition of An Essay on the Principle of Population (1803) to support a policy of agricultural protectionism.
B12|Homo Economicus and Homo Stramineus|The model of Homo economicus has often been criticized as unrealistic. In particular, it has been found lacking for allegedly assuming that people are selfish, an assumption which is contradicted by both introspection and empirical evidence. The aim of this paper is to show that never in the history of the economic discipline has selfishness constituted the core of the Homo economicus model. In fact, the standard economic model of behaviour which has been used by economists for more than a hundred years is reticent about the motives of behaviour. Critics thus do not criticize Homo economicus but a straw man - Homo stramineus. Three possible reasons for confusing Homo economicus with Homo stramineus are identified: malicious intent, ignorance and an attempt to avoid the tautological model of behaviour.
B12|Trade Openness, Size of Economy and the Savingâ€“Investment Relationship: A Dynamic Analysis for Pakistan|The main objective of this study is to examine the savingâ€“investment relationship with the size of economy and trade openness in Pakistan during the period 1960â€“2011. For this purpose, the study employed vector auto-regression (VAR) to check simultaneity among trade openness, economic growth and savingâ€“investment. Findings of the study confirm a significant positive relationship among trade openness, economic growth, saving and investment of Pakistan in the long run, but these do not establish a significant short-run relationship among trade openness, economic growth, savings and investment. In light of empirical results, the present study suggests that external sector development should be given due importance. For this purpose, the availability of credit should be enhanced properly. This will not only increase the saving rate in the country but also enhance domestic investment. JEL Classification: A11, B12, C13, D14
B12|Agronomists and accounting. The beginnings of capitalist rationalisation on the farm (1800-1850)|At the dawn of the nineteenth century numerous debates took place on the development of capita-list agriculture and the ways of making as much profit as possible from farm land. Until now this subject has hardly been examined and is unique in that it pertains to the economic history of agriculture, the history of agronomy and the history of managerial thinking. This article aims to highlight the usage of double-entry accounting for agronomic experiments in the first half of the nineteenth century, as well as the significance of the results and the way these were debated. Our aim is to present the authors’ reasons and the role played by bookkeeping in the construction of economically rational knowledge and reasoning. Thus we will bring to light two mechanisms which are common to this accounting quantification drive: data tabulation and the inclusion of data in balance sheets, making it possible to compare inputs and outputs in production processes.
B12|Conduct in narrativized trust games|We “narrativize” a basic extensive form trust game by placing participants in a story that contextualizes the interaction with an unforeseeable future. In our narrative experiment, participants consider each decision as a character, advancing the story with their choices for salient payoffs. Our interest is in understanding how participants apply Adam Smith's rules of beneficent and just conduct in our narrativized games with epistemic conditions of an unknown future, conditions which aren't possible in extensive form. We invite our readers to participate in the story of the results, making meaning as participants in a narrative that unfolds with their choices.
B12|An Overarching Model For The Micro And Macro Psychological And Social Sciences|This paper introduces the methodology to create a unified theory of the philosophical and social sciences in the behavioral-political-economic-demographic sequence. The two major ideological political-economic philosophies (Hume-Smith and Marx-Engels) are systematized into competing integrated three dimensional behavioral-political-economic models. The paper argues that Hume-Smith?s empathy-sympathy behavioral assumptions are a sufficient starting point to create the integrated causal model sought by Tooby and Cosmides. The author then shows that the prerequisite advances in psychology and demographic studies now exist to generate the universal economic theory sought by von Neumann-Morgenstern and the integrated behavioral-economic method of Gintis?a psychological (i.e., behavioral) socio-economic model. By updating Hume-Smith?s work with a modern understanding of psychology, as presented by Fromm and others, a new integrated societal model as postulated by Harsanyi can be created that intertwines the social and psychological sciences. The author argues that this fundamentally psychology-based model also can serve as a baseline equation for all social sciences as desired by Kant and Mach, as well as the ahistorical (psychological) philosophic model noted by Husserl, Heidegger, Tillich, and Strauss. The author concludes with a discussion of the necessary next steps to generating a detailed model that fuses these disciplines.

B12|The Rhetorical Structure of Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations (and the importance of acknowledging it)|"Analyzing the rhetorical structure of The Wealth of Nations (Smith WN) and its context, we make the case for the central importance of its Book V, ""Of the Revenue of the Sovereign or Commonwealth”, which tends to be neglected in most accounts of Smith’s oeuvre (even, most recently, in the outstanding Phillipson 2010) but which in our reading is, rather than a general treatise on optimal taxation and spending, a book focused on the future of an empire being threatened by a Mercantilist system. The Empire in question was, of course, the British one. Book V follows Book IV, in which Smith -- after having documented the slow and unnatural progress of opulence in, among others, England and Scotland in Book III – had undertaken a “very violent attack” (Smith EPS p. 208; Smith Corr. p. 251) on those responsible for the low growth rates (“opulence”) in Scotland and, even more, England: manufacturers and merchants and those politicians who propagated Mercantilist philosophies and practices of the commercial class. Aware that those he targeted would not take kindly to the attack, Smith made his case against the Mercantilist system as well as its colonial policy by marshaling his earlier insights into rhetorical theory and practice. We explain why and how he organized his attack."

We argue that Schumpeter’s assessment resulted from his failure to appreciate the rhetorical structure of Smith’s masterpiece, a failure largely due to Schumpeter not having access to student notes of Smith’s lectures on rhetoric that surfaced only after Schumpeter’s death.

La atención se ha concentrado en la construcción de comunidades morales y sociales y el proceso de identificación y reconocimiento. Un aspecto menos estudiado de las características que Smith adjudica a su mecanismo de identificación intersubjetiva también puede llevar a explorar la posibilidad de la exclusión de algunos miembros de la comunidad. La asimetría de la simpatía explica tanto la emulación de los más afortunados y la exclusión de los más miserables. A través de una representación formal, buscamos ilustrar los fenómenos de inclusión y exclusión presentes en las relaciones intersubjetivas y en la construcción de una comunidad.

Mistaken information about this issue was repeated many times in the literature of the late 1800s and 1900s. It is presumed that they met in France, during Smith’s journey there, chez Sophie de Grouchy. I will attempt to show that the meeting between the two authors was not in fact arranged by Sophie de Grouchy, Condorcet’s wife, even though she was very interested in Smithian theories, especially about the category of “sympathy”, as confirmed by her French translation of the Theory of Moral Sentiments. My purpose is to demonstrate that Madame de Condorcet did never meet Smith and, as a result, she could not have introduced Condorcet to Smith. A greater degree of probability can be attributed to the version that indicates Turgot as the intermediary between Condorcet and Smith. In my opinion, not even this hypothesis is totally convincing, because neither Smith nor Condorcet ever talk about their meeting. Moreover, there is no evidence of correspondence between them.
B12|Some considerations on the influence of economic liberalism in the May Revolution of 1810 in Buenos Aires, Argentina|The revolutionary process of May 1810 in Buenos Aires, capital of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, occurred within the context of the French Revolution, the United States’ struggle for independence and various changes in the European countries’ economies. Liberal ideas played an essential role, and the opinions of Belgrano, Vieytes and Moreno, among others, are the key to understanding the economic perspectives of the revolutionary men. Late mercantilists, physiocrats and classical economists marked these men’s economic thought. The purpose of this paper is to review these intellectual influences on the leaders of the May Revolution.
B12|Goethe und das Papiergeld|"Goethes Faust II, genauer das erste Kapitel wurde vielfach als eine Geld- und Inflationstheorie gelesen. Obgleich darin viele Motive anklingen, die in der Erklärung des Geldes eine Rolle spielen, so ist es doch ein Missgriff, Goethe als ökonomische Autorität zu lesen. Allerdings stand er allerdings in regem Austausch mit zeitgenössischen Ökonomen, deren Erkenntnisse weitgehend vergessen wurden. Gerade darin finden sich viele Elemente für eine Theorie und Philosophie des Geldes. Im Text werden zahlreiche dieser Einsichten vorgestellt und im Kontext der Faust-Dichtung vertieft. Die Figur des Mephistopheles als des ""neuen"" Narren erweist sich dabei als wichtige Leitfigur für das Verständnis monetärer Prozesse jenseits der Vorurteile einer traditionellen Quantitätstheorie."
B12|Ökonomie und Moral: Eine kurze Theoriegeschichte|Die ökonomische Theorie hat mit Moral wenig oder gar nichts zu tun. In den gängigen Lehrbüchern der Mikroökonomie findet sich in den Stichwortverzeichnissen kein Eintrag zu Moral oder Ethik. Die Studierenden lernen über die Wirtschaft nachzudenken, aber sie lernen dabei nicht, systematisch über ethische Fragen zu reflektieren. Nach der neoklassischen Lehre, wie sie in den Lehrbüchern präsentiert wird, weist wirtschaftliches Handeln nicht grundsätzlich moralische Aspekte auf. Ein solcher Tatbestand ist erstaunlich. Er widerspricht (phänomenologisch) unseren ökonomischen Alltagserfahrungen und (theoriegeschichtlich) einer jahrhundertelangen Tradition, die vor gut zwei Jahrhunderten schrittweise aufgegeben und im 20. Jahrhundert durch dezidiert morallose Standpunkte ersetzt worden ist.
B12|Contending Conceptions of Competition and the Role of Regulating Capital|This article discusses two major conceptions of competition, the classical and the neoclassical. In the classical conception, competition is viewed as a dynamic rivalrous process of firms struggling with one another over the expansion of their market shares at the expense of their competitors. This dynamic view of competition characterizes mainly the works of Smith, Ricardo, J. S. Mill and Marx; a similar view can be also found in the writings of Austrian economists and the business literature. By contrast, the neoclassical conception of competition is derived from the requirements of a theory geared towards static equilibrium and not from any historical observation of the way in which firms actually organize and compete with one another.
B12|Reconciling Ricardo's Comparative Advantage with Smith's Productivity Theory|There are three main claims in the paper: first, there is sufficient evidence for affirming that Ricardo adhered to Smith's productivity theory; second, Ricardo's original demonstration of the comparative- advantage proposition is indeed compatible and complementary with respect to the latter; and third, Ricardo agreed with Smith's multifactorial explanation of the pattern of trade, which includes increasing returns and economies of scale. These results suggest that the level of compatibility between the international trade theories of Smith and Ricardo is significantly higher than it is currently reflected in the economic literature. They also add a new perspective to the ongoing process of reassessment of Smith's contributions to international trade theory, further strengthening the view that he was indeed an outstanding international trade theorist.
B12|Necessary prices and necessary income distribution in classical political economy. A bridge with the notions ‘just’ prices and ‘just’ wage|Production prices are those exchange-values which, if adopted, put each industry in the conditions to repeat its production process. In this sense they appear as necessary prices. This notion is here compared with that of ‘just’ price, studied by the older moral philosophers (more so than by economists). Production prices appear thus as that concept that comes closer to the notion of just price. On similar grounds, some recent results, which have emerged within the classical and post-Keynesian approaches, have been employed here to envisage the elements that characterize a ‘necessary’ income distribution configuration and a ‘necessary’ level of the rate of interest.
B12|Orthodoxer Mainstream und Heterodoxe Alternativen: Eine Analyse der ökonomischen Wissenschaftslandschaft|Die moderne Volkswirtschaftslehre als wissenschaftliche Disziplin ist einerseits durch große Uneinheitlichkeit geprägt, die andererseits selbst in Zeiten der Krise der Theorie anscheinend nicht nachhaltig in ein öffentliches Bewusstsein vordringen konnte. Nach wie vor wird die Ökonomik unterstellt und auf diese Weise werden Unterschiede ökonomischer Denkweisen entweder nivelliert oder für irrelevant erachtet, wenn es um die Erklärung der großen Zusammenhänge geht. Doch neben dem orthodox-neoklassischen Mainstream, der seit langem den institutionalisierten akademischen Forschungs- und Lehrbetrieb dominiert, existieren vielfältige alternative Ansätze. Diese Tatsache an sich könnte der Ökonomik insgesamt den Schein eines monolithischen Theoriengebäudes eigentlich nehmen und stattdessen ihre Pluralität belegen. Als Phänomen ist Ökonomik zwar durchaus im Plural denkbar, aber die Existenzweise von Pluralität ist kümmerlich und bestenfalls durch hegemonialen Diskurs geprägt. Warum es nach wie vor schwierig ist, die Emanzipation vom Streamlining der Wirtschaftswissenschaften konsequent und erfolgreich zu betreiben, wird aus verschiedenen Perspektiven beleuchtet. Jenseits vertrauter Standarderklärungen unterstützen ideengeschichtliche, wissenschaftstheoretische und wissenschaftspolitische Argumente das Plädoyer für eine kritisch-pluralistische Ökonomik als Bestandteil eines funktionierenden modernen Wissenschaftsgebäudes.
B12|Agricultura Familiar, seu Interesse Acadêmico, sua Lógica Constitutiva e sua Resiliência no Brasil| The article aims to present particular views on family farm in economic and social thought, suggesting that this subject has been attracting growing interest in the research communities of these areas in Brazil, at different times. The trajectory seeks to highlight the way in which many authors emphasized, in their analysis, the nature, characteristics and fundaments of family farming. The research methodology is bibliographic and guided by economics and sociology comparative analysis, aiming a contextualized historical reconstruction, concerning theoretical and empirical approaches on family farming. This methodological procedure brought as a hypothesis that Chayanov’s theory was seminal for countless approaches, with repercussions into different schools of thought, interested in family farming research. In addition, the research method also permits to conjecture about family farm specificities, to constitute, organize and survive throughout history. The text aims to bring some contribution to the current debate on the role and the importance of family farming in the Brazilian countryside, particularly on its resilience in a scenario of productive concentration and rural depopulation. It also suggests that the quality of this discussion depends on: 1) advances in the conceptual area, 2) more empirical research and 3) new looks on sectorial and regional diversity in Brazil and its influence on family farming varieties and arrangements.
B12|Why did Wicksell change his mind about the machinery question?|The article investigates Wicksell's change of mind about the machinery question between 1890 and 1900/1901. Wicksell at first sided with the so-called “compensation theory” that workers are not harmed by the introduction of machinery. In his lecture notes of April 1900, made available here for the first time, Wicksell deployed marginal productivity theory to discuss the effects of labour-saving technical progress, with inconclusive results. Finally, in his published 1901 Lectures and in his 1900 article about marginal productivity, Wicksell claimed that the introduction of machinery increases output and reduces wages. His analysis was based on the demonstration that free competition maximizes output, but not total utility. It is argued that Wicksell's change of mind and his mature formulation of the machinery question result from his critical assessment of the then new concept of Pareto optimality, together with his reinterpretation and rejection of Ricardo's (1821) contention that the introduction of machinery may diminish output and employment.
B12|Economia Clássica entre o Laissez-Faire e o Socialismo|O artigo examina as posições dos economistas clássicos no tocante à concorrência e às propostas socialistas da época. Após breve relato da evolução do ideário socialista na Inglaterra e França, apresentam-se as observações de Smith, Bentham, James Mill e Ricardo sobre a condição dos trabalhadores e a propriedade privada. A seguir, reconstitui-se o debate entre o jovem Stuart Mill e William Thompson na sociedade owenita. Por fim, cobrem-se outras influências sobre o pensamento social de Stuart Mill em sua fase adulta. Ao final, sintetiza-se a postura dos autores clássicos sobre a viabilidade de uma reforma radical do capitalismo.
B12|Adam Smith on Monopoly Theory. Making good a lacuna|" type=""main"" xml:id=""sjpe12040-abs-0001""> This article analyses Adam Smith's views on monopoly by focusing on Book IV and V of The Wealth of Nations. It argues that the majority of scholars have assessed Smith's analysis of monopoly starting from premises different from those, actually though implicitly, used by Smith. We show that Smith makes use of the word ‘monopoly’ to refer to a heterogeneous collection of market outcomes, besides that of a single seller market, and that Smith's account of monopolists' behaviour is richer than that provided by later theorists. We also show that Smith was aware of the growth-retarding effect of monopoly and urged State regulation."
B12|De la critique des corporations à la libération des forces productives : l'économie politique de Jean-Baptiste Say|In the Traité d’Economie Politique and in the Cours Complet d’Economie Politique, Jean-Baptiste Say develops a criticism of corporations and other industrial regulations. According to him, these regulations are barriers to the entrepreneurial freedom and to the progress of arts. They are almost always tools of individual and collective oppression and at the origin of various economic, social and political ills. In this paper, we detail Say’s argumentation against corporations and show that it is part of more general framework based on the influence of institutions on the economy and of machines on commerce. His critical analysis leads us to present his conception of a necessary liberation of the forces of production, which requires the creation of a general framework favorable to the freedom to undertake and a blossoming of the forces of production (machines). These elements also constitute the foundations of his political economy. JEL Codes : A11, B12, B30, K11, N01, P14, P16
B12|Jean-Baptiste Say et les compétences entrepreneuriales pour l'industrialisation|In Jean-Baptiste Say’s economic thought, a productive fund of industrial capabilities generates the emergence of entrepreneurs, workers and scholars. However, success only ensues from the exercise of entrepreneurial capabilities. This article analyzes several classifications of capabilities formulated by J.-B. Say. Our first result highlights the fact that these capabilities go beyond the scope of the enterprise and concern the development of nations. Within the enterprise, there is a clear distinction between management and administration in J.-B. Say’s analysis – the former is connected to the capacity of reasoning, whereas the latter demands qualities connected to control and supervision. Therefore, the entrepreneurial functions relative to uncertainty, innovation or inefficiency are linked to success but are not necessary conditions for the productive activity. We conclude that J-B. Say does not share the idea of an economic convergence between nations in a spontaneous way. A policy of economic development based on industrial education and the reinforcement of entrepreneurial capabilities is a necessary condition. JEL Codes : A11, B12, L126, O1, I125
B12|Jean-Baptiste Say et l'entrepreneur : la question de la filiation avec Cantillon et Turgot|Since Schumpeter, there has been a tradition in the history of the economic thought that has placed Say’s entrepreneur in a filiation Cantillon-Turgot. The aim of this article is to show that this filiation does not exist, even if certain themes such as risk, knowledge or organization of production appear in the works of these three authors. More precisely, it is possible to find a double break between Say and his predecessors. The first one lies in the analysis of the production and the division of labor, which shows that the entrepreneur in Say’s writings has not the same role as in Turgot’s ones. The second one concerns their conceptions of uncertainty and profit, which shows that the place of the entrepreneur in the distribution of income in the writings of Say is not the same that in Cantillon or Turgot’s ones. The implications of this double break are specified in the conclusion. JEL Codes : B12, B13, L26
B12|De l'Angleterre et des Anglais : l'expertise de Jean-Baptiste Say de l'industrie anglaise|It should be remembered, first of all, that under his training as a young merchant, Jean-Baptiste Say spent two years with his younger brother Horace, near London in Croydon. In 1786, he moved to Britain to learn the practice of English commercial business. This happened in the midst of the development of manufacturing in the UK when the introduction of mechanical looms gave a great boost to the whole industrial activity. It is clear that this first experiment in an expanding industrial environment, which lasted two years, deeply influenced the young J.-B. Say who was gifted with an inquisitive mind and a talent of observation. Another element that makes J.-B. Say a competent expert to analyze the economic situation in England and identify the strengths and lessons for France lies in his experience as an entrepreneur in the creation of the spinning company in Auchy (France) in 1805.

B12|L'empreinte historique de la théorie de l'entrepreneur. Enseignements tirés des analyses de Jean-Baptiste Say et de Joseph Aloïs Schumpeter|Jean-Baptiste Say and Joseph Aloïs Schumpeter are two key-economists in the theory of the entrepreneur. Both assigned to the entrepreneur the role of an economic engine, moved by innovation. Moreover, both lived in periods characterized by a flow of economic and political new ideas (Say : the French Revolution, the Empire of Napoléon, the Bourbon Restoration, the first industrial revolution ; Schumpeter : the two World Wars, the Bolshevik Revolution, the 1929 crisis, the second industrial revolution). Their theories, embedded in troubled times ; define an individual who constantly avoids being locked in (economic, social, political and technical) routines. Nevertheless, an important point distinguishes their approaches : Say describes a real entrepreneur, while Schumpeter reduces him to an ideal type. JEL Codes : B12, L26
B12|Innovations monétaires, financières et bancaires : les signes représentatifs de la monnaie|In his writings devoted to monetary questions, Say studies in details monetary, financial and bank innovations which he designates by the expression “representative signs of money”. Say’s analysis on money and its representation signs is very important since it takes place in a context of major change in the monetary field. The aim of this paper is to show how, in Says’ analysis, these representative signs of money are innovations of major importance. The paper begins with an analysis of the position of the representative signs of money compared to money itself. Then it studies promissory notes, bills of exchange and banknotes. Finally, the consequences of their circulation in the economy are presented, especially on the activity of producers. JEL Codes : B12, E4, E5
B12|Notes sur Jean-Baptiste Say. Conception de l'économie en général et position face à l'esclavage en particulier|This article proposes a critical analysis of Jean-Baptiste Say’s thought on the economy in general and more specifically, on slavery. The first part deals with his general ideas on the economy, and studies how he defines value, capital and equilibrium of supply and demand on the markets (Say’s law). The second part concentrates on a less known issue, that of the points of view he adopted on slavery (and on colonies), in order to examine their strengths as well as their limitations. Say’s liberal followers often remember the famous « Say’s law » and the glorification of capital but discard the anti-slavery theses, which nevertheless constitute an advocacy for the liberation of the forces of production to the benefit of a triumphant capitalism.

B12|Espoirs et dangers du « régime industriel et commercial » de l'humanité selon Léon Walras|In this study, we examine how Léon Walras considered the economic evolution towards the most advanced stage of the history of mankind, the so-called “industrial and commercial regime”. This enables us to present his ideas concerning the “modern industry” and also to examine the way in which he conceived the industrial revolution, the role of mechanization and the relationship between science and industry. The first part presents the Walrasian theory of the various stages of evolution of the mankind. The second part deals with the characteristics of the “industrial and commercial regime” and the future prospects considered by Léon Walras. JEL Codes : B12
B12|Notes biographiques sur Jean-Baptiste Say|This brief biography of J.-B Say puts in its context the thought of an author who was twenty-three years old in 1789. His social background is that of the Protestant Geneva. In the first part of his life, he founded a newspaper La Décade. His political action took the form of comments, reviews of articles and political statements published in La Décade. The originality of this action lies in the fact that he sought to invest the field of ideas in all its dimensions : the one of institutions, of elites and of the places of scientific research. J.-B. Say continues the tradition of the ideologists, through teaching activities. The Great Revolution demonstrates the power of people and of ideas on the course of events. The elaboration of the Traité d’Economie Politique and of the Cours Complet, cannot be understood without taking into account the various influences that contributed to shape the thought of Jean-Baptiste Say.

B12|Aspects pratiques et théoriques de l'entrepreneur dans la vie et l'œuvre de Jean-Baptiste Say|In the history of economic thought, Jean-Baptiste Say distinguishes himself in being a theoretician and practitioner of the enterprise. Moreover, he also taught the entrepreneurial spirit in the last years of his life. We may therefore find in his writings a theory of production and exchanges and a modern theory of the enterprise. This places him at the forefront of the economists who focused on the entrepreneur. This paper presents two faces of Jean-Baptiste Say : Jean-Baptiste Say as an entrepreneur and Jean-Baptiste Say as a theoretician of the entrepreneur. JEL Codes : B12, B13, L26
B12|Droit de propriété et économie politique dans l'analyse saint-simonienne|From 1825 to 1832 the Saint-Simonians advocated an evolution of the economic and social order which resulted from their analysis of property right and its effects on the functioning of a society in which the property owners exploit the labourers. Improving the lot of labourers and economic progress require measures which make it possible to lower the revenues of idle owners, to ensure a better allocation of capital to the labourers and to alter the conditions of access to ownership. Setting up a banking system combining centralization and specialization enables lowering the interest rate, reducing the exploitation of the labourers and fostering economic activity. A reform of inheritance law can also put an end to social reproduction. Classification JEL : B12, B14, K11, Z13
B12|Les capitalistes et les législateurs. À propos du système de la liberté naturelle selon Adam Smith|This paper shows that exists a continuity between the Mercantile System (Smith’s adversary) and the System of Natural Liberty advocated for in the Wealth of Nations. This continuity is founded on the distance between legislators and merchants. When this distance is too short, legislators are partial for they confuse merchant’s interest with general interest. When this distance is too long, the consequence may be anarchy and civil war. So between the two it exists an optimal distance which may characterize the System of Natural Liberty, which is necessary for impartial legislators. Classification JEL : B12, N41, N43
B12|Vertus et justice du marché chez Adam Smith|The paper aims at showing the neglected moral aspect of the market in Smith’s work. The first part provides a new interpretation of the natural price as a just price. In the second part it is claimed that free competition is an institutional framework best suited for fostering the virtues of industry, frugality, probity, fairness and prudence. The last part justifies Smith’s plea for a legally enforced maximal rate of interest by means of concepts taken from his moral philosophy such as the desire of social recognition, excessive self-esteem and self-deceit. The conclusion underlines the close link between politics, ethics and economics in Smith’s thought. Classification JEL : B12, B31.
B12|Similarity and Clustering of Banks: Application to the Credit Exposures of the Czech Banking Sector|After the recent events in the global financial system there has been significant progress in the literature focusing on the sources of systemic importance of financial institutions. However, the concept of systemic importance is in practice often simplified to the problem of size and contagion due to interbank market interconnectedness. Against this backdrop, we explore additional features of systemic importance stemming from similarities between bank asset portfolios and investigate whether they can contribute to the build-up of systemic risks. We propose a set of descriptive methods to address this aspect empirically in the context of the Czech banking system. Our main findings suggest that the overall measure of the portfolio similarity of individual banks is relatively stable over time and is driven mainly by large and well-established banks. However, we identified several clusters of very similar banks whose market share is small individually but which could become systemically important when considered as a group. After taking into account the credit risk characteristics of portfolios we conclude that the importance of these clusters is even higher.
B12|El pensamiento económico de los primeros economistas colombianos|RESUMEN: Este trabajo ofrece una aproximación al pensamiento económico de los economistas colombianos de mediados del siglo XIX. Se toman como referencia algunos de los más influyentes: Florentino González, Salvador Camacho Roldán, Aníbal Galindo y Miguel Samper, y se analiza la forma en la que la doctrina del libre cambio se fue incorporando en el pensamiento de los estadistas colombianos, principalmente con respecto a la concepción del Estado. La metodología usada es el estudio de los textos y su retórica. Se concluye que las prescripciones políticas del liberalismo económico, que incluyen la promoción del libre cambio, la teoría de la ventaja comparativa en el comercio internacional, el rechazo de los monopolios y la sospecha sobre la acción del gobierno ejercieron una influencia parcial en la cimentación del proyecto liberal decimonónico.
B12|Génesis, desarrollo e impacto de la eficiencia marginal del capital en teorías ecónómicas no keynesianas|Esta propuesta de ensayo contempla la posibilidad de contrastar la posición keynesiana sobre ciclos económicos con algunos contrapesos históricos. Particularmente se busca comprobar la aceptación, o no, del concepto de Eficiencia Marginal del Capital por parte de algunos pares teóricos de Keynes. Para ello se hará una revisión literaria que advierta la mayor cantidad de conexiones – ya sea a favor o en contra – entre la teoría keynesiana y otras escuelas económicas. La breve revisión histórica toma elementos de la economía clásica; luego se revisan otras posiciones teóricas contemporáneas a Keynes para terminar con algunos aportes neoclásicos. En ese orden de ideas, se podrán presentar algunos aportes de autores como Marshall, Mitchell, Hicks y Lucas. Se concluirá que no existe consenso, ni mucho menos beneplácito, sobre la teoría sobre ciclos de Keynes en las escuelas de pensamiento económico más modernas. Particularmente, se reconocerá y expondrá las diferencias entre unas teorías sobre ciclos donde prima la inestabilidad – caso de Keynes –, por otras donde se asegura la trayectoria hacia un equilibrio de parte del sistema económico.
B12|La recepción de Bentham en la Nueva Granada|Tomando como punto de referencia central la disputa entre los diarios El Constitucional de Popayán y El Constitucional de Cundinamarca (1835-1836), el presente artículo intenta comprender las dificultades de la recepción neogranadina de las doctrinas utilitaristas de Jeremías Bentham. La principal de ellas residiría en la inconmensurabilidad entre los presupuestos lógicos sustancialistas subyacentes en los receptores —no importa si partidarios o impugnadores del utilitarismo—, y la lógica funcionalista que presuponen los planteamientos de Bentham. Los conceptos de substancia y de función se explican recurriendo a un reconocido trabajo de Ernst Cassirer. En su conjunto, las élites criollas, forzadas heterónomamente a la Independencia, estarían básicamente satisfechas con la lógica sustancialista. Solo en virtud de las exigencias derivadas del intercambio con unos interlocutores europeos nuevos, parte de ellas se habría interesado en aprender los códigos utilitaristas, no obstante sin ahondar hasta sus supuestos lógicos funcionalistas.
B12|Jean-baptiste say et la question de la population|The population matter in Jean-Baptiste Say’s work is not a subject traditionally covered by secondary literature. The limited existing works, which consist of general studies on the question, only refer to some theoretical elements of Say’s theory. No approach actually examines how Say’s theory of population is related to the main elements of his economic theory. Studying this link is fundamental in order to understand the differences between Say’s theory of population and Thomas Robert Malthus’s referential theory on the topic.
B12|Is There Room for 'Fear' as a Human Passion in the Work by Adam Smith?|The sciences tell us that fears are physical feelings and mental emotions that play a key role in any society. Not many issues related to fear are explored by economists today. The aim of this paper is to go backwards through the history of economic thought, and examine if and how Adam Smith considered fear in his work: in effect, he devoted a great deal of attention to the concept of fear. This paper does not intend to cover the whole of the topic at hand as it would also be useful to investigate the connections between fear and all the other feelings that pervade Smith's thought.
B12|The Ricardian rent theory two centuries after|We propose to re-read Ricardo's theory of rent and its modern versions. Ricardo's dynamic approach follows the transformations of a long-term equilibrium with demand. Sraffa adopted the same framework while substituting a value criterion for a physical criterion to determine the incoming marginal method, but he did not state the law of succession of methods explicitly. This prevented him to realize that his critique opens the door to all complications of capital the ory, with the consequence that the Ricardian dynamics fail when a divergence appears between profitability and productivity. Contemporary studies have cast doubts on the validity of some of Ricardo's and Sraffa's over-optimistic conclusions, but the abandonment of the dynamic approach does not allow them to explain the ultimate reason of the phenomena they have pointed at. Ricardo's method has been recently rediscovered by mathematicians.
B12|'Right Back Where We Started From': From 'The Classics' To Keynes, And Back Again| The purpose of this paper is to highlight the curiously circular course followed by mainstream macroeconomic thinking in recent times. Having broken from classical orthodoxy in the late 1930s via Keynesâ€™s General Theory, over the last three or four decades the mainstream conventional wisdom, regressing rather than progressing, has now come to embrace a conception of the working of the macroeconomy which is again of a classical, essentially pre-Keynesian, character. At the core of the analysis presented in the typical contemporary macro textbook is the (neo)classical model of the labour market, which represents employment as determined (given conditions of productivity) by the terms of labour supply. While it is allowed that changes in aggregate demand may temporarily affect output and employment, the contention is that in due course employment will automatically return to its â€˜naturalâ€™ (full employment) level. Unemployment is therefore identified as a merely frictional or voluntary phenomenon: involuntary unemployment - in other words persisting demand-deficient unemployment - is entirely absent from the picture. Variations in aggregate demand are understood to have a lasting impact only on the price level, not on output and employment. This in effect amounts to a return to a Pigouvian conception such as targeted by Keynes in the General Theory. We take the view that this reversion to ideas which should by now be obsolete reflects not the discovery of logical or empirical deficiencies in the Keynes analysis, but results rather from doctrinaire blindness and failure of scholarship on account of which essential features of the Keynes theory have been overlooked or misrepresented. There is an urgent need for a critical appraisal of the current conventional macroeconomic wisdom.
B12|XVe Colloque de l’Association Charles Gide pour l’étude de la pensée économique| Say has shown that there is no amount of capital which may not be employed in a country. Such a proposal does not involve the absence of unemployment and crisis. The markets may be glutted. In his first writings, Say advanced that whenever there is a superabundance of several sorts of merchandise, it is because other articles are not produced. People have bought less, because they have made less profit. Disequilibrium in some markets may limit the global demand for goods. Later, he will explain the commercial crises by the abuses of the banks of circulation who, to discount the bills of their customers, issue excessive quantities of notes. The value of the money decreased; the individuals who held notes asked for the payment in species and banks noticing the decrease of their reserves restricted their credits so provoking a crisis.
B12|Piketty’s Elasticity of Substitution: A Critique|This note examines Thomas Piketty's (2014) explanation and prediction of simultaneously rising capital income ratio and profit share by an elasticity of substitution, sigma, greater than one between labor and capital in an aggregate production function. I review Piketty's elasticity argument, which relies on a non-standard capital definition. In light of the theory of land rent, I discuss why the non-standard capital definition is problematic for estimating elasticities. For lack of existing results, I make a simple estimate of sigma in the class of constant elasticity of substitution functions for Piketty's data as well as for a subset of his capital measure that comes closer to the standard capital definition. The estimation results cast doubt on Piketty's hypothesis of a sigma greater than one.
B12|Economic theory and social classes|The marginalist economic theory believes that the effectiveness of the collective action exerted by a social class as a whole conflicts with the hypothesis of competition (perfect competition). A question of method is at the root of this view: the marginalist theory only takes into consideration the individual maximizing behaviour of workers, capitalists and entrepreneurs. In this way it excludes from the analysis the study of social links, which, as a matter of fact, are the conditions for collective action. In the classical approach, economic relations are instead affected by the institutions and social conventions that characterize each particular historical moment. As a consequence, the classical notion of competition (free competition) does not exclude a role for the social links that can justify collective action and, at the same time, make it effective. This characteristic of the classical approach is particularly considerable as concerns the theory of income distribution. A re-proposal of the classical theory of wages which takes into consideration the development and complexity of the institutions that, these days, condition the conflict for the distribution of income, cannot actually disregard the role of collective action.
B12|The Political Economy of the Poor: The Rise and Fall of the Workhouse System|The aim of this article is to describe the rise and fall of the workhouse system in connection with the developments that took place in economic thought, in the transition from Mercantilism to pre-classical and classical tradition. By examining the economic arguments emerging from the debate around the workhouse system, we shall focus on how ideas concerning wages, efficiency, labour market, workers' mobility, unemployment and human nature of the poor evolved throughout the period under scrutiny, trying to evaluate to what extent these views influenced the shaping of a new policy approach aimed at improving the effectiveness of the delivery of poor relief.
B12|Adam Smith and modern economics|In his Wealth of Nations (1776) Adam Smith created an agenda for the study of the economy that is reflected in the structure of modern economics. This paper describes Smith’s contributions to four central areas of economic theory: The theory of price formation, the relationship between market outcomes and the public interest, the role of the state in the economy, and the sources of economic growth. In each case, an attempt is made to relate Smith’s contribution to the state of contemporary economics, showing both the similarities and contrasts between the respective approaches.
B12|Do economists need virtues?|In many works Deirdre McCloskey criticizes professional economics for ignoring virtues. Even though I disagree with details of her analysis I concur with her general conclusions. In the paper I sketch my own perspective on how economists could profit from the virtue discourse as developed by Adam Smith. My argument is intended for economists who believe economics is about implications of individual choice. I distinguish behaviorist and mentalist interpretation and criticize the former. We all should be mentalists and admit the existence of the problem of interpretation. I briefly discuss neuroeconomics and evolutionary psychology as theories of interpretation and show that moral psychology can be viewed as one in morally relevant situations. I read Adam Smith’s Theory of Moral Sentiments as an important contribution to the moral psychology. I outline the Smithian system and show what economists can learn from it. They can improve their interpretive skills but also cultivate their general outlook of the world by understanding how knowledge of the market process shapes interpretation of the choice problem. Their general outlook can do better provided that it is balanced with the complete array of virtues. If not it may provide a distorted picture of reality.

Az interpretációk skálája rendkívül széles: mértékadó közgazdászok szerint ez a közgazdaságtan alapeszméje, míg mások Smith ironikus tréfájának vélik. A tanulmány áttekinti a láthatatlan kéz Smith előtti használatát teológiai, politikai és irodalmi szövegekben és a hozzájuk kapcsolódó interpretációkat. Ezt követően bemutatja, hogyan alkalmazta Smith a nevezetes kifejezést a merkantilista politika ironikus és paradox kritikájaként, és miként került a 19. század végétől e metafora a Smith-olvasatokban központi helyre, majd miként vált kérdésessé ez a felfogás a 2008-as válság nyomán.

B12|Adam Smith und die Bankenregulierung Ein Widerspruch zu einer sonst liberalen Wirtschaftspolitik?|Proponents of liberal economic policies in the financial market often refer to the moral and economic authority of Adam Smith, the founder of economics as a science, to add weight to their recommendations. They think, they can do so, because Adam Smith is in these circles considered a prominent representative of an economically unbridled laissez-faire liberalism. The fact that Adam Smith also advocated several measures of economic policies for the regulation of banking, like a limit for interest rates of 5 %, the prohibition of paper money under a nominal value of £ 5 and the use of option clauses on banknotes, is little known to the recipients. For this reason, this paper wants to give an answer to the question, whether Adam Smith’s advocacy of banking regulation is a contradiction to his otherwise liberal economic policy or not.
B12|"Adam Smith's ""Tolerable Administration of Justice"" and the Wealth of Nations"|"In the Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith argues that a country's national income depends on its labor productivity, which in turn hinges on the division of labor. But why are some countries able to take advantage of the division of labor and become rich, while others fail to do so and remain poor? Smith's answer, in an important but neglected theme of his work, is the security of property rights that enable individuals to ""secure the fruits of their own labor"" and allow the division of labor to occur. Countries that can establish a ""tolerable administration of justice"" to secure property rights and allow investment and exchange to take place will see economic progress take place. Smith's emphasis on a country's ""institutions"" in determining its relative income has been supported by recent empirical work on economic development."
B12|Perspectives of the Macroeconomic Reproduction Theory|Prospects for the development of an alternative macroeconomic theory are associated with the provisions that the dynamics of the economy is determined by the change of generations of capital and that there is a problem of coordination between different generations of capital. The circulation and reproduction of capital are analyzed. We consider the so-called shifting mode of reproduction. The mathematic model has shown that coordinated growth is possible if social and economic interests between capital and labor are agreed, and monetary policy stimulates this growth.
B12|Robert Torrens e a teoria clássica do lucro [Robert Torrens and the classical theoyr of profits]|This paper reconstructs the evolution of Colonel Robert Torrens' theory of profits based on its critique of the Ricardian theory of value. Initially, it describes the attack conducted by him on the idea of the amount of labor being the sole factor to regulate mercantile exchanges. After that, McCulloch's and Ricardo's arguments in defense of this principle are presented. It continues by examining the origins of Torren's systemic approach to profits, based on the reciprocal interdependence of the productive sectors. Next, the applications of such theory carried out by the Colonel are considered, especially the support for free trade. Finally, it highlights the pioneer character of his approach to profits within the overall setting of classical economics.
B12|The Classical-Keynesian Paradigm: Policy Debate in Contemporary Era|For almost a century, the famous C-K paradigm (formally known as Classics – Keynesian Paradigm) has been the apex of economic debate and research. The paradigm represents two schools of thoughts which, somehow, have prevailed till now. Economists who believe in either of the two schools have been at loggerheads, and they still are, to prove one theory better than the other. Numerous economic scholars of present era believe that with the changes that have occurred in the economic system, the world is turning back to classical model. But, there are others who believe that Keynes theory is still alive and valid. In this paper, we have tried to draw a brief comparison that highlights the major differences between the two theories with specific reference to the economic, political and social environment prevailing at time when these theories were generated. Paper also discusses the relevance of unending policy debate about these theories in the current era with special emphasis on policy implications with a view to draw pertinent lessons for the present and future.
B12|Ricardo's and Malthus's common error in their conflicting theories of the value of labour|ABSTRACT The controversies between Ricardo and Malthus reached a new peak when Malthus published his pamphlet The Measure of Value Stated and Illustrated and Ricardo responded by his critical Notes on Malthus’s ‘Measure of Value’ (1823 [1992]) and by a further round of correspondence with Malthus (Works, IX). The new (and final) stage of these controversies was concerned with the two authors’ conflicting theories of value and, within these theories, with the excruciating issue of the invariable measure of value. Starting from some insights provided by Malthus and Ricardo in their major or final contributions, this paper deals with a rather neglected component of their controversies, i.e. with the theory of the value of labour as distinct from the value of its products. This will be done by highlighting two sets of ambiguities which affect both Ricardo’s and Malthus’s arguments. One of these hinges on the ambiguity conveyed by the word labour in so far as this reflects the three different concepts of labour power, living labour and dead labour. The other set hinges on the different ambiguity conveyed by the word value especially when it comes to the value of labour. For this word was used in those controversies (as well as in other parts of classical theory) to convey not only the two elementary concepts of use-value and exchangeable-value but also, within the former concept, the two further concepts of the (positive) use-value of labour from the standpoint of its employer, and of the (negative) use-value (disutility) of labour from the standpoint of the labourer. The latter is the sense in which Smith’s ambiguous notion of the “value of labour to the labourer” and his related corollary of the constant “price” of labour (WN, I,V,7-8) must be understood if his system of thought (including its crucial notion of value as labour command) is to stand against Malthus’s misleading attempt to protect it from Ricardo’s criticisms. In this sense, Malthus’s attempt and Ricardo’s criticisms may be jointly regarded as a result of their common error of understanding the value of labour exclusively in the sense of its exchangeable value (which is rightly regarded by Ricardo as –normally- varying and wrongly assumed in Malthus’s Measure of Value as –strangely- constant).
B12|Towards an integrated theory of value, capital and money|This is an analysis of the present state of the theory of capital. The paper contains a proposal to reformulate this theory in an ‘late-Marxian’ up-to-dated perspective. The central problem discussed is the integration of the theories of value and capital with those of money and finance. An augmented cost-of-production theory of value is advocated. Special attention is focused on the role of Marx’s ‘monetary expression of labour value’ (MEV), rediscovered and unduly modified by neo-Marxists with the purpose to make it compatible with Marx’s labour theory of value. JEL Codes: B12, D46, E11.
B12|A Critical Marxist Simple Approach to Capital Theory|This essay provides a simple, non-technical reformulation of Marx’s theoretical treatment of value and capital. It implies the abandonment of the ‘pure’ labour theory of value and of the ‘new value’ equality between the net product of the economy and the living labour employed in production of gross output, and a development of the different theoretical perspective outlined by the mature Marx. A correct method for converting quantities of labour-time in terms of money, which accounts for both explicit and implicit costs, is proposed.
B12|Schumpeter y la Historia del Pensamiento Económico<BR>[Schumpeter and the History of Economic Thought]|The History Schumpeter´s of Economic Analysis, is a tour de forcé of scholarship. The display of erudition is 'truly unbelievable. How could one man have acquired and then digested so much knowledge? Not only does the History offer two thousand years of economics, from Aristotle to Paul Samuelson, but also it ranges most expertly over all the other social sciences, history and belles lettres as well. For more than 1,100 pages the prose flows on in a way that one has come to expect from Schumpeterthe fluent style, the vivid analogy, the striking metaphor, the arresting aside. Our goal is to present the central ideas of Schumpeter on the complex relationships between Economic History and Epistemology of Science. This design has three aspects that interest us: (a) its amplitude to conceive the economy as part of the overall development of scientific knowledge; (b) its relevance applied and the examples used by the author; (c) its currently facing tremendous methodological problems facing the economy with the other sciences.
B12|Sraffa’s price equations in light of Garegnani and Pasinetti - The ‘core’ of surplus theories and the ‘natural’ relations of an economic system|Within the rich literature that has flowed from Sraffa’s framework of Production of Commodities by means of Commodities a prominent position is occupied by the research programmes carried out independently by two authoritative exponents of this school: Pierangelo Garegnani and Luigi Pasinetti. Certain specific features of their approaches might lead one to perceive them as alternative to one another. Yet, when analysed through a constructive perspective, one discovers not only a common origin and methodology, but also strict complementarity in analysing the main characteristics of industrial systems.
B12|Utilitarianism According to John Stuart Mill|The article discusses utilitarianism in the form elaborated by John Stuart Mill. Although utilitarianism has been variously employed by philosophers and economists, Mill is the fi gure most closely associated with this theory. His ideas deeply infl uenced economists of the 20th century and continue to shape the postulates of contemporary economics and other social sciences. We demonstrate how seminal utilitarianism was to Mill’s work, explore what infl uenced his thoughts on it, and place our analysis in the socioeconomic context of the time Mill was writing. We argue that utilitarianism has eclipsed Mill’s other contributions to economics, yet is often oversimplifi ed and has unjustly served as a platform for a more general critique of homo economicus.
B12|Sviluppo economico e classi sociali in Italia|"The author investigates the long-term development of social stratification in Italy, comparing it with the economic and industrial development in the country during the 1880s-1960s period. The growth the middle class impresses as a trend in stark contrast to Karl Marx's laws of development of capitalism, though a precise economic definition of such ""quasi-class"" is very problematic."
B12|Crecimiento, desigualdad y pobreza: estado de la cuestión|En las últimas décadas ha aumentado la bibliografía sobre la relación entre el crecimiento económico y su impacto social. Los sucesivos fracasos en la lucha contra la pobreza han dado lugar a nuevas estrategias para combatirla, como el “crecimiento pro-pobre”. Este artículo hace una crítica teórica y metodológica de dichas estrategias y plantea la necesidad de un enfoque estructural e institucional para mejorar sus resultados.
B12|Institucionalismo y teoría económica: del “neoclasicismo” a la teoría clásica|Este artículo busca explicar por qué el institucionalismo no se convirtió en el punto de referencia en teoría económica, y mostrar que la teoría clásica de Smith y Ricardo puede incorporar muchas de sus contribuciones, a diferencia de la teoría neoclásica. Presenta un ejemplo de esta capacidad y del papel esencial de los factores sociales e institucionales en la teoría de Smith y Ricardo con respecto al mercado de trabajo.
B12|The Ricardian rent theory: an overview|We propose to re-read Ricardo's theory of rent to which, we claim, the post-Sraffian literature is methodologically unfaithful. Ricardo's dynamic approach follows the transformations of a long-term equilibrium with demand. Sraffa adopted the same framework while substituting a value criterion for a physical criterion to determine the incoming marginal method, but he did not state the law of succession of methods explicitly. This prevented him to realize that his critique to Ricardo opens the door to all complications of capital theory, with the consequence that the Ricardian dynamics fail when a divergence appears between profitability and productivity. Contemporary studies have cast doubts on the validity of some of Ricardo's and Sraffa's over-optimistic conclusions, but the abandonment of the dynamic approach does not allow them to explain the ultimate reason of the phenomena they have pointed at Ricardo's method has been recently rediscovered by mathematicians.
B12|Особенности И Проблемы Моделирования Переключающегося Воспроизводства<BR>[Features and problems of modeling the shifting mode of reproduction]|В статье авторы продолжают разработку новой версии теории воспроизводства капитала. По сравнению с предыдущими работами проанализирована более реальная ситуация: экономика делится на сектор B, создающий потребительские блага, и инвестиционный сектор A, воспроизводящий основной капитал секторов A и B. Соответственно, выделяются наборы разновозрастных мезоэкономических подсистем, образующих сектора A и B, и строится модифицированная модель переключающегося воспроизводства. Экспериментальные расчеты показывают, что принципиальные особенности макроуровня сохраняются на мезоуровне экономики. Подтверждаются некоторые хорошо известные феномены циклического развития секторов A и B.
B12|Formation et phylogénie des concepts de « marché » dans l’économie politique au xviiie siècle|Comment les économistes du xviiie siècle ont-ils intégré le mot « marché » dans leurs énoncés ? Alors qu’il ne relève que des pratiques courantes jusqu’au début du xviiie siècle, le marché devient par la suite un concept économique dans les énoncés de plusieurs auteurs. Pour comprendre ce changement, une phylogénie des concepts du marché est nécessaire, car les études limitées à un ou deux auteurs ne sont pas en mesure d’en suivre le processus de formation, nécessairement polygénique. À travers les dictionnaires, les usages courants du marché laissent apparaître deux conceptions (sérielle et centrée), qui peuvent être reliées à deux formes savantes du marché : une forme simple (Cantillon, Turgot et Morellet) et une forme développée (Smith et Condillac). Ces liens doivent être combinés avec les conceptions de la valeur antérieures, afin de proposer un maillage phylogénique non linéaire. Il permet de conclure que les concepts métaphysiques relatifs à la providence n’ont pas participé au processus de formation des concepts savants du marché.
B12|Over-accumulation, Rising Costs and â€˜Unproductiveâ€™ Labor|The current crisis takes place within a long downturn and new debates on the future of growth are emerging. This paper argues that some theoretical insights made by classical economists about the end of economic expansion are relevant for the discussion on the prospects for growth in rich countries. We focus on three key mechanisms related to contemporary radical economic analysis: over-accumulation, rising costs of accumulation, and the balance between productive and unproductive labor and consumption.
B12|On Marxâ€™s Law of the Falling Rate of Profit: Disentangling Some Entangled Variables|This paper argues that Marxâ€™s law of the falling rate of profit applies to the problematic of choice of technique in the context of accumulation of capital, and not to the problematic of choice of technique in the context of technological change or new innovation as such. In this context, Marxâ€™s â€œthe law itselfâ€ is correct. It is, however, true that Marx does confuse the two contexts at times; but here he seems to be following in the footsteps of Ricardo, who had also made an identical mistake.
B12|Классическая политическая экономия и современность . Classical economics and modern times |Обсуждается научная программа и парадигма классической политической экономии. Показано, что в научной и учебной литературе существуют различные трактовки периодизации и формулировки отличительных черт и принципов, лежащих в основе классической политической экономии. Рассмотрены критерии отнесения отдельных исследований к различным экономическим теориям. Показаны принципиальные отличия классической политической экономии и неоклассики. Разделительным барьером является отказ неоклассики от понятия объективных экономических законов и принятие критерия минимизации числа исходных гипотез при конструировании экономической теории. Выявлены элементы преемственности парадигмы классической политической экономии и некоторых направлений институционализма. Главные отличия методологии институционализма и классической политической экономии заключаются в том, что институционализм опирается на позитивизм, в то время как политэкономии свойственна нормативная модель экономики. Но во взглядах на классовую природу общества, разделение явления и сущности и взаимосвязи экономического и социального, наблюдается высокая степень преемственности. A scientific program and paradigm of classical economics is in focus of the paper. The different versions of the periodization and wording of the distinctive features and principles which make a basis of classical economics can be observed in the research literature and study materials. The paper considers the criteria according to which any research could be referred to a certain economic theory and basic distinction between classical economics and neo-classical one which mainly lies in fact that neo-classical economics refused from an objective character of economic laws and adopted a criteria of the minimal number of initial hypothesis as a major principle of building an economic theory. The elements of continuity of paradigm can be noted in classical economics and certain institutionalism concepts. The difference in methodology of institutionalism and classical economics mostly lies in fact that institutionalism is based on positivism whereas classical economics assumes a standard model of economy. However, the continuity of views of both of them ban be observed in a class nature of society and differentiation between a phenomenon and its essence as well as in interdependence between economic and social life.
B12|David Hume on Banking and Hoarding|David Hume opposes banks and favors hoarding. The only bank he reluctantly approves of is a public, 100% reserve bank. Other banks increase money supply and prices, hindering exports and economic growth. For Hume, a 100% reserve public bank would lead to “the destruction of paper-credit” ([1752] 1985, p. 285), fostering economic growth instead by preventing inflation. Additionally, a 100% reserve bank hoards a large quantity of gold and silver, which is available in case of national emergency.
B12|Remembering Rousseau?S Discourse On Political Economy As A Counter-Enlightenment Manifestation|The French philosopher Jean Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778) has expressed strident criticism of what he perceived to be the Enlightenment contractualism in Lockean sense and offered his own alternative of republican political theory against it. Moreover, he has very plainly rejected the enlightened confidence in technological progress as a necessary condition in the formation of modern civilization. These two aspects of his political theory have been rightly considered as the preliminary examples of Europe-wide Counter-Enlightenment thought. However, Rousseau?s views on political economy have not much been evaluated for a clear understanding of his Counter-Enlightenment position. This paper will first concentrate on possible reasons for why Rousseau?s work has not become a source of discussion within the nexus of Enlightenment and Counter-Enlightenment. At the second level, the paper will discuss that the lack of references to the mechanisms of commercial society and Enlightenment notions of political economy in his work actually makes it a Counter-Enlightenment tract. In this sense, this paper optimistically suggests that the anatomizing of Rousseau?s views on political economy will be an attempt not only to fill an important gap in Rousseau?s Counter-Enlightenment thought but also it will offer a new insight for the general framework of Counter-Enlightenment political economy.
B12|â€˜Right Back Where We Started Fromâ€™: from â€˜the Classicsâ€™ to Keynes, and back again|The purpose of this paper is to highlight the curiously circular course followed by mainstream macroeconomic thinking in recent times. Having broken from classical orthodoxy in the late 1930s via Keynesâ€™s General Theory, over the last three or four decades the mainstream conventional wisdom, regressing rather than progressing, has now come to embrace a conception of the working of the macroeconomy which is again of a classical, essentially pre-Keynesian, character. At the core of the analysis presented in the typical contemporary macro textbook is the (neo)classical model of the labour market, which represents employment as determined (given conditions of productivity) by the terms of labour supply. While it is allowed that changes in aggregate demand may temporarily affect output and employment, the contention is that in due course employment will automatically return to its â€˜naturalâ€™ (full employment) level. Unemployment is therefore identified as a merely frictional or voluntary phenomenon: involuntary unemployment - in other words persisting demand-deficient unemployment - is entirely absent from the picture. Variations in aggregate demand are understood to have a lasting impact only on the price level, not on output and employment. This in effect amounts to a return to a Pigouvian conception such as targeted by Keynes in the General Theory. We take the view that this reversion to ideas which should by now be obsolete reflects not the discovery of logical or empirical deficiencies in the Keynes analysis, but results rather from doctrinaire blindness and failure of scholarship on account of which essential features of the Keynes theory have been overlooked or misrepresented. There is an urgent need for a critical appraisal of the current conventional macroeconomic wisdom.
B12|On Ricardo and Cambridge|David Ricardo’s key place in the history of economic thought is well established. However, both the understanding of his Principles of Political Economy and Taxation and its role in the development of economic analysis is much more controversial. Cambridge economists have contributed significantly to both of these issues. They have played an important part in two extremely divergent interpretations of Ricardo’s place in the development of economic thought. Understanding how Ricardo has been viewed in Cambridge does not result in homogeneity, but in a spectrum of interpretations. In this paper, we focus on the role of Ricardo’s Principles in the development of economics as seen by Cambridge economists.
B12|Teorias Essencialistas e o Problema da Transformação de Valor em Preços: Os Casos de Marx e Menger|A tradição de pensamento marxiana e o legado de Carl Menger, o pai da chamada Escola Austríaca de Economia, raramente são conjuntamente analisados à guisa de comparação entre seus sistemas de ideias. Neste ensaio, propõe-se um critério de avaliação que, sem negar drásticas diferenças entre eles, aproxima-os. O aspecto que os unifica recai no fato de que se trata de teorias econômicas “essencialistas”. Então o estudo comparativo começa por estabelecer a visão do processo econômico em cada qual; parte, em seguida, para a comparação entre as duas teorias do valor. Mostra depois que, não obstante suas enormes diferenças, ambas as teorias deparam-se com o problema da transformação de valores em preços; de forma que muitos de seus respectivos seguidores foram compelidos a enfrentar o problema de aplicar o constructo subjacente em cada qual na explicação de preços de mercado; o que se afigura fonte de dificuldade inerente a modelos essencialistas em economia.
B12|Quand le luxe devient une question économique : retour sur la querelle du luxe du 18e siècle|Condemnation or glorification of luxury is a classic and recurrent question in the history of political ideas. Today, it continues to generate a set of conflicting emotions. In order to understand this debate, we chose to immerse ourselves in the history of economic thought, and, more specifically, in the quarrel of luxury that occurred during the Enlightenment. If luxury is immoral, it is not necessarily obnoxious, it participates in the circulation of wealth, maintains a certain industry and stimulates trade. The different positions of philosophers (Mandeville, Condillac, Montesquieu, Hume, Rousseau) and economists (Melon, Quesnay, Smith, Say) seem to reflect more a change in the systems of values (the interest and the useful versus the moral) than a real challenge of luxury consumption.

B12|Luxe, innovations et crise : les enseignements des économistes classiques|The aim of this article is to demonstrate that the Classical economists’ analysis can serve as a theoretical framework to explain the economic role of luxury. In the 18th century this school of thought was based on the political implications of trade and luxury, conceived as a kind of social innovation explaining the wealth of nations. During the first half of the 19th century, the Classical economic approach was formed around the links between luxury, technical innovation and economic crisis. JEL Codes: B11, B12, O30
B12|Mill et la crise de 1825|This article studies the crisis which, in 1825, affected the English economy and the works that John Stuart Mill, Thomas Tooke and John Ramsay McCulloch dedicated to its analysis. McCulloch and Tooke maintain that the organization of the English banking system played, if not in the origin at least in the development of the crisis, a remarkable role. Mill, on the contrary, thinks that the crisis is the effect of over-trading and that it would have developed as well in a system where the currency would have consisted in species. This crisis is for him a credit crisis. This analysis which seems the best to give a full account of this crisis is, besides, the most innovative. The article clarifies its implications for the monetary theory and for the analysis of business cycles.
B12|Some Marxian and Smithian Ideas On Labor and Prices|The propositions advanced by Marx and Smith on the relation between labor and prices are examined, with particular emphasis on income distribution, within a non-Walrasian setting including joint production and heterogeneous labor. Among its contributions, the paper introduces the concept of indirect joint production and an alternative definition of industrial branches. ***** Se estudian algunas proposiciones comunes a Marx y a Smith sobre la relación entre el trabajo y los precios, con especial interés en las implicaciones de las mismas respecto a la distribución del ingreso. El marco de referencia es un modelo no-walrasiano que incluye producción conjunta y trabajo heterogéneo. Además, el artículo introduce el concepto de producción conjunta indirecta y también una definición alternativa de la rama industrial. ***** L’article examine quelques propositions communes à Marx et à Smith sur le rapport entre le travail et les prix. Un intérêt particulier est porté sur les implications de cette relation sur la distribution du revenu. Le cadre de référence est un modèle non-walrasien incluant production jointe et qualité hétérogène du travail salarié. En outre, l’article introduit le concept de production jointe indirecte, ainsi qu’une définition alternative de « branche d’activité industrielle »
B12|Una Revisión Moderna de las Teorías de Precios de Ricardo y Jevons|Este artículo revisa las teorías de precios de Ricardo y Jevons. El argumentoprincipal es que la diferencia entre estas teorías proviene de motivaciones y nalidades teóricas diferentes. Mientras Ricardo tenía interés en encontrarun estándar de valor que sirviera para homogeneizar la heterogeniedad debienes y servicios que compone el producto o excedente de una naciónen una medida común, y cómo ese producto homogeneizado se distribuyeentre terratenientes, trabajadores y capitalistas, Jevons pretendía explicarel consumo de la riqueza en una economía que proviene de la maximizacióndel placer o utilidad a través del intercambio que determina el valor de losbienes en el mercado, tomando como dada la producción de la economía.Argumento que esta diferencia de enfoque surgen debido a la diferencia enlo que cada uno de ne como el objeto de la Economía Política. Sin embargo,muestro que ambas teorías se pueden racionalizar dentro de un modelo deequilibrio competitivo walrasiano.
B12|Pobreza en el capitalismo ¿Por qué persiste en la actualidad?|El objetivo de este artículo es brindar elementos para una crítica a como se conceptualiza a la pobreza en la actualidad y de las causas que se mencionan la provocan. Argumentamos que un marco de referencia clásico-neoclásico no puede explicar la persistencia o los aumentos de la pobreza en los países desarrollados en la actualidad. Por medio de un método histórico-descriptivo y teórico-lógico Marxista proponemos se puede entender mejor a la pobreza en el capitalismo y su actual evolución.
B12|Protection of competition in the contemporary global economy as a challenge for the competition theory|Although the phenomenon of competition is fundamental of the economic theory and policy, the scientists have not yet achieved the consensus concerning the kind of competition which should be protected. Contemporary researchers striving to find the answer to this question rely on their predecessors achievements and the recognition that all elements of the classical structure-conduct-performance paradigm are influencing each other. Thus, the current research on competition is conducted within the confines of the theory of economy and management and the protection of competition in the contemporary global economy constitutes a challenge for the competition theory in all three areas mentioned in the paradigm. Given the above, there are several issues of vital importance. Firstly, the development of MNs in the direction of diversified networks which are interconnected with different contractual and ownership multidimensional ties, secondly, the need to take into account the relations between the competitors on other geographical and product markets in the analysis of competition on the local market, and thirdly, the need to widen the traditional perception of the protection of competition to other areas, which have not been covered by antitrust policy so far.
B12|Sismondi’s Conversion|This article examines the diverse aspects of the “conversion” of J. C. L. Simonde of Sismondi, in 1817 with the Political Economy. The moment and the contents of the conversion of Sismondi present two kinds of difficulties of interpretation. The first one concerns the role which plays the historical study in the intellectual progress of Sismondi and, in succession, in its conversion. The second kind of difficulties concerns the status, lauded by Sismondi, of the political economy as the science of the legislator, as well as the evolution of its economic theories.
B12|Destutt de Tracy on labor and value|Destutt de Tracy’s value theory is examined here in its relations to labor. This theory is original in that it has two concepts of value, one being natural, the other, conventional. Both are linked to labor, deemed to be any productive activity and the sole origin of any production, but in two quite different ways. This twovalue theory leads to contradictions, is but one example of a general proposition of ideology, that social conventions have their origin in the inner constitution of man.
B12|Lecciones olvidadas de tres economistas difuntos|En este trabajo el autor se lamenta de la importancia cada vez menor que se otorga a la historia del pensamiento económico en la comunidad académica mundial, defiende que esta recesión está dando lugar a visiones unidimensionales de la obra de los principales autores en economía y afirma que, si lo analizamos de cerca, podemos sorprendernos de la simplicidad de las concepciones más corrientes. Como triple ilustración, básicamente citando algunas partes omitidas de sus trabajos, el autor hace hincapié en los casos de Adam Smith, Francis Ysidro Edgeworth y John Maynard Keynes, que imparten lecciones cruciales ignoradas por la mayoría de la generación actual de economistas.
B12|Salaire, concurrence et surtravail: Une contribution classique à l’explication du profit|This paper proposes a reconstruction of one of Torrens little unknown piece of work on the making and the distribution of income among the social classes. The framework assumes a single-good economy with fixed production coefficients. It differs from the contemporary Ricardo theory (that is,Sraffa’s) in three ways: 1) real wage are pictured as the economic outcome of competition in the labour market, 2) the allocation of the net product between wages and profits is determined with no obligation to fix exogenous variables of distribution, 3) the model suggests an innovative concept of surplus labour to define the profit apart from the labor theory of value. Finally, the Torrens’s approach lays the foundations of an original conception of profit explained by a specific transaction of capitalism economy.
B12|Getting Rid Of Rent?|In order to extend the theory of value and the trade-off property to economic systems with lands, Ricardo reduced their study to that of productive systems without lands by considering the marginal agricultural methods. Sraffa generalised the analysis to prices of production and rejected the notion of order of cultivation. The strategy works sometimes for extensive cultivation, fails in most cases of intensive cultivation, and always when the net product of agriculture is increased by making use of corn saving methods in industry.
B12|Nearer to Straffa than Marx: Adam Smith on productive and unproductive labour|We investigate Adam SmithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s analysis of the properties of what he called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œproductiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â - as against ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œunproductiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â - labour, a concept which commentators have frequently found problematic. Puzzles have been noted and inconsistency alleged. A question arises ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ did Smith confuse two different concepts of productive labour? We believe that, despite the apparent problems, a coherent reading of SmithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s account of productive and unproductive labour is in fact possible: if ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œproductive labourÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â is understood to refer comprehensively to labour which not only maintains but, through producing a net surplus, adds to the communityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s stock of wealth ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ as regards either the financial or the real resources which make possible economic growth ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the difficulties with SmithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s treatment largely disappear.
B12|Did Keynes in the General Theory significantly misrepresent J S Mill?|It has been alleged that J M Keynes, quoting in the General Theory a passage from J S Millâ€™s Principles, misunderstood the passage in question and was therefore wrong to cite Mill as an upholder of the â€˜classicalâ€™ proposition that â€˜supply creates its own demandâ€™. We believe that, although Keynes was admittedly in error with respect to, so-to-say, the â€˜letterâ€™ of Millâ€™s exposition, he did not mislead readers as to the â€˜substanceâ€™ of Millâ€™s conception. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that J S Mill did indeed stand for a â€˜classicalâ€™ position, vulnerable to Keynesâ€™s critique as developed in the General Theory.

B12|Economic cosmology and the evolutionary challenge|The intellectual histories of economics and evolutionary biology are closely intertwined because both subjects deal with living, complex, evolving systems. Because the subject matter is similar, contemporary evolutionary thought has much to offer to economics. In recent decades theoretical biology has progressed faster than economics in understanding phenomena like hierarchical processes, cooperative behavior, and selection processes in evolutionary change. This paper discusses three very old “cosmologies” in Western thought, how these play out in economic theory, and how evolutionary biology can help evaluate their validity and policy relevance. These cosmologies are: (1) “natural man” as a rational, self-sufficient, egotistical individual, (2) competition among individuals can lead to a well-functioning society, and (3) there exists an ideal optimal state of nature. These correspond to Colander et al. (2004) “holy trinity of orthodox economics”, rationality, greed, and equilibrium. It is argued below that current breakthroughs in evolutionary biology and neuroscience can help economics go beyond these simple cosmologies.
B12|Marshall and Walras, disequilibrium trades and the dynamics of equilibration in the continuous double auction market|Prices and quantities converge to the theoretical competitive equilibria in continuous, double auction markets. The double auction is not a tatonnement mechanism. Disequilibrium trades take place. The absence of any influence of disequilibrium trades, which have the capacity to change the theoretical equilibrium, appears to be due to a property found in the Marshallian model of single market adjustments. The Marshallian model incorporates a principle of self-organizing, coordination that mysteriously determines the sequence in which specific pairs of agents trade in an environment in which market identities and agent preferences are not public. Disequilibrium trades along the Marshallian path of trades do not change the theoretical equilibrium. The substance of this paper is to demonstrate that the Marshallian principle captures a natural tendency of the adjustment in single, continuous, double auction markets and to suggest how it takes place. The Marshallian model of quantity adjustment and the Walrasian model of market price adjustment can be seen as companion theories that explain the allocation and price processes of a market. The Marshallian model explains the evolution of the allocation, who will meet and trade, and the Walrasian excess demand explains the evolution of prices when they do.
B12|Disentangling motivational and experiential aspects of “utility” – A neuroeconomics perspective|Although decision makers are often reported to have difficulties in making comparisons between multidimensional decision outcomes, economic theory assumes a unidimensional utility measure. This paper reviews evidence from behavioral and brain sciences to assess whether, and for what reasons, this assumption may be warranted. It is claimed that the decision makers’ difficulties can be explained once the motivational aspects of utility (“wanting”) are disentangled from the experiential ones (“liking”) and the features of the different brain processes involved are recognized.
B12|Uncertainty in exhaustible natural resource economics: The irreversible sunk costs of Hotelling|According to Pindyck (2007) there are three important aspects of uncertainly in environmental economics: (1) the benefits and costs of environmental policy tend to be highly non-linear, (2) environmental policy tends to involve important irreversibilities, where investment in pollution abatement can impose an irreversible, sunk cost on society, and where certain pollutants can stay in the environment forever and build up to cause even more future harm in which case investment in abatement can cause an irreversible, sunk benefit to society, and (3) environmental policy involves long time horizons and yet the discount rate society should use is uncertain for determining the net present value of costs and benefits of pollution abatement. These same uncertainties also affect non-renewable, exhaustible, natural resource economics and in particular the use of the Hotelling rule: (1) the costs, benefits and transversality conditions of using the Hotelling rule can be highly non-linear, (2) the Hotelling rule involves important sunk cost irreversibilities, which will be explained here, and (3) the Hotelling rule can involve long time horizons with uncertain discount rates. All three of these problem make it extremely difficult for a market to use in any way the Hotelling rule, yet by the sheer number of articles in non-renewable natural resource economics, one would believe that it is the basis of all resource markets. In this article, we concentrate on the sunk cost irreversibilities of using the Hotelling rule. The idea of the Hotelling rule is to optimally store a non-renewable resource, but the optimization is highly dependent on the actual reserves that are available to extract. However, reserves of underground exhaustible resources are often unobservable at the beginning stages of extraction which makes using the Hotelling Rule difficult.
B12|The Max U Approach: Prudence Only, or Not Even Prudence? A Smithian Perspective|In many works Deirdre McCloskey criticizes professional economics for too readily representing man as a maximizing agent—Mr. Maximum Utility, or Max U. McCloskey says that economic activities are not the machinations of robots or mathematical functions, but rather affairs among human beings. She prefers to approach the human being as a complex of virtues (or lack thereof). In all this, I basically concur. But McCloskey says that the Max U approach represents man in terms of one virtue: prudence. She calls the Max U approach “Prudence Only.” My concern is that associating Max U with prudence does not do justice to prudence. In treating of prudence, I draw exclusively from Adam Smith’s Theory of Moral Sentiments. Smith makes many statements about prudence. It is by no means clear that they add up to a well defined notion of prudence, but it is clear that most of Smith’s important statements about prudence do not fit the Max U approach. My paper aims to correct and avoid any notion that Smithian prudence may be thought of as maximization or optimization.
B12|Principles of capitalistic commodity production: a rejoinder|Reich (2013) recapitulates my model (Helmedag 2012a) incorrectly. Above all, he mixes up exogenous with endogenous variables. Moreover, Reich's interpretation of the system's dynamics is on the one hand formally insufficient; on the other hand, matters are presented in a more complicated way than necessary.
B12|Who is the Narrator of the Fable of the Individuality in Political Economy: Mandeville or Smith?|In this study, the historical roots of individuality will be examined. According to the view of economic individuality, pursuit of self-interest is the fundamental motivation for all of human beings. When we look into the eighteenth century, the main argument was whether the rise of the commercial society erosions the moral values or not. This argument was especially discussed by the philosophers of the Scottish Enlightenment. This subject was most throughly discussed by Adam Smith who finds a solution which is very important and also debatable to date. This solution actually created a problem which is called the Adam Smith problem. Smith, thanks to his approaches to this subject, became the creator of the individual of political economy. And this creates a situation in which his two important books namely Wealth of Nations and Theory of Moral Sentiments are not considered totally. In this context Theory of Moral Sentiments has been ignored and Smith’s individual is narrowed to an individual prototype which economics needs. In this study the adventure of the creation of the prototype, which has mentioned above, and the contributions of Adam Smith and Bernard Mandeville will be evaluated both with their agreements and contradictions.
B12|Free Labour, Free Women. Re-appraising Harriet Taylor’s Feminist Economics|Harriet Taylor has been long forgotten as an economist and political philosopher, while merely remembered as John Stuart Mill’s friend and belatedly wife. Never was fate more unjust: we only need to recall that Taylor - whose liberal background soon led her to be fascinated by socialist theories and the evolution of labour movements - wrote chapter VII of the fourth book of the Principles of Political Economy, the well-known On the Probable Futurity of the Labouring Classes. Not to mention, moreover, her reflections on social mobility, women’s rights and female participation to the labour market, delivered in brilliant essays like Enfranchisement of Women. Detaching from mainstream Taylor’s scholarship, this paper tries to confer autonomy to her economic thought (compared to Mill’s) by suggesting that its original feature lies in the correspondence she established amid the liberation of the working classes and women’s enfranchisement, in order to place Taylor’s ideas in a more accurate intellectual perspective.
B12|The Relevance of the Theory of Fiscal Illusion. The Case of the Italian Tax System|This work analyses the phenomenon of fiscal illusion (Puviani, 1903) in the context of the Italian tax system. Financial (or fiscal) illusion refers to mechanisms which cause a cognitive alteration on the part of the taxpayer regarding the evaluation of the costs and benefits of public policies. Puviani (1903) was the first to classify the different types of financial illusions. He highlighted the main strategies used to hide the real costs of financing public goods and services through taxes (illusions on revenue) or to overestimate their usefulness (illusions on expenditure). The main conclusions of the work are that: (i) from a methodological point of view, there is a connection between Puviani’s theory of fiscal illusion and some of the assumptions of the behavioral approach and (ii) from an operational point of view, it is a useful tool to understand the motives that could have inspired several recent taxes and legislative measures within the Italian tax system. These results support the relevance of Puviani’s theory to the contemporary theory and practice of public finance.
B12|Public Debt and J.S. Mill’s Conjecture: A Note|Classical economists - mainly Smith, Ricardo and J.S. Mill - abhorred public debts because of their interference with capital accumulation. J.S. Mill in particular envisaged that a rising public debt leads to higher interest rates and falling real wages, a combination which may be consistent with a mildly increasing trend in the profit rate.
B12|Lectures on John Maynard Keynes’ General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1): Chapter One, Background and Historical Setting|"This paper puts John Maynard Keynes’ ""The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money"" into its historical context, both in terms of economic history and in terms of the history of economics. It discusses the post-World War I period as background to the General Theory, looks at the influence of other economists of the period on the evolution of Keynes’ thought and considers the parallels between the post-World War period and the post-Napoleonic War period, when Ricardo and Malthus were debating issues very similar to the ones with which Keynes was wrestling."
B12|Lectures on John Maynard Keynes’ General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (2): Chapter 2, “The Postulates of the Classical Economics”|Chapter 2 is one of the most important chapters in the General Theory. Not only does it set out Keynes’ disagreements with key elements of the classical model, it lays out his own model of the working of the labour market, which underlies the analysis in the remainder of the General Theory. The issue of how labour’s response to a change in its real wage differs depending on whether the change is driven by a change in the nominal wage or in the price of consumer goods plays a key part in the way Keynes’ theoretical model is developed here. This chapter introduces Keynes’ concept of involuntary unemployment and sets out his argument about the causal relation between the real wage and the level of unemployment, and about the consequent cyclicality of the real wage. Chapter 2 also includes Keynes’ discussion of Say’s Law.
B12|Lectures on John Maynard Keynes’ General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (3): Chapter 3, “The Principle of Effective Demand”|In Chapter 3 of the General Theory, Keynes sketches out what he calls the essence of the General Theory of Employment. He introduces the Keynesian expenditure-based model, his aggregate demand function and also his aggregate supply function, a concept which spawned much debate among Post-Keynesian economists but which was, for a long time, virtually ignored in mainstream macroeconomics. He sets out the Savings = Investment version of Say’s Law and outlines how an economy can settle into an equilibrium at less than full employment.
B12|"Lectures on John Maynard Keynes’ General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (4): Chapter 4, ""The Choice of Units""; Chapter 5, ""Expectations as Determining Output and Employment"""|In Chapter 4 of the General Theory, Keynes discusses the units of measurement he will be using in the remainder of the book, in particular his reason for measuring in nominal rather than real terms, objection to aggregate measures of real output and physical capital stock, and his concept of wage units, which is a source of difficulty in following bits of the later exposition. Chapter 5 introduces expectations and discusses the role of short run expectations in determining the behavior of firms and of economic aggregates.
B12|Lectures on John Maynard Keynes’ General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (5): Chapter 6, The Definition of Income, Saving and Investment; Appendix to Chapter 6, Appendix on User Cost; Chapter 7, The Meaning of Saving and Investment Further Considered|Chapter Six and its Appendix deal in some detail with the way Keynes is defining income, savings and investment in the General Theory while the appendix to Chapter 6 goes into detail on user cost. His concept of user cost at one point sparked a certain amount of controversy among Keynesians but has since virtually been forgotten. It is of interest to us because user cost is the place where Keynes sees firms taking account of the future consequences of their current production decisions. The General Theory is a theory of the short run, but firms’ cost curves, which are key to many short run decisions, contain a forward looking element. Chapter 7 returns to the concepts of saving and investment, relates Keynes’ definitions to those used by others (including his own from the Treatise) and relates aggregate investment, which refers to additions to physical capital stock, to the way the term is often used at the micro level, in the sense of investment in financial assets.
