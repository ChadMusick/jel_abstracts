N27|Growth Enhancement Support Scheme (GESS) and Farmers’ Fertilizer Use in Rural Nigeria|Fertilizer use in Nigeria is estimated at 13 kg/ha, which is far below the 200 kg/ha recommended by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). The objective of this investigation was to identify the determinant factors of farmers’ participation in the Nigeria’s growth enhancement support scheme (GESS). In addition, we determined the impact of the GESS on fertilizer use in rural areas. One thousand, two hundred rural farmers were sampled across the six geopolitical zones of Nigeria. Results from the use of recursive bivariate probit model indicated that GESS significantly impacted on the access and usage of fertilizer among the rural farmers; and that contact with extension agents, ownership of mobile phones, power for charging phone batteries, value output, mobile network coverage, ability to read and write were positive determinants of rural farmers participation in the GESS; whereas increased distance to registration and collection centers, and cultural constraints to married women reduced farmers’ tendency to participate in the GESS. The findings suggest that farmers’ participation in the GESS is a critical factor for raising fertilizer use in Nigeria. This implies that food security in sub-Saharan Africa can be achieved by increasing the participation of rural farmers in the growth enhancement support scheme.
N27|Impact of Formal Climate Risk Transfer Mechanisms on Risk-Aversion: Empirical Evidence from Rural Ethiopia|This study examines the effect of smallholder farmers’ access to a formal climate risk transfer mechanism on their risk preferences. Survey and experimental data were collected from smallholder farmers that have access to weather index-based crop insurance (WICI) in Ethiopia. We use an endogenous switching (ESP) model to address self-selection and simultaneity bias. Results from the ESP model show that farmers who purchased WICI are less likely to be risk-averse compared with non-purchaser farmers. Similarly, non-purchasers would have attained a significant reduction in their risk-aversion if they had taken up the insurance product. We also find that WICI has a positive and statistically significant effect on farmers’ real-life risk-taking behavior as exemplified by mineral fertilizer use. The implication of our findings is that formal climate risk transfer mechanisms can positively influence households’ economic decisions and outcomes, through reducing risk aversion. Therefore, they can possibly contribute to poverty alleviation and economic development within agrarian economies that are exposed to recurrent and severe climate shocks.
N27|Lies, damned lies, and RCT : une expérience de J-PAL sur le microcrédit rural au Maroc|"Comment expliquer le succès académique d’une étude randomisée dont la validité, tant interne qu’externe, est pourtant très problématique ? Prenant l’exemple d’une étude menée par le laboratoire J-PAL sur le microcrédit rural marocain, cet article mobilise les outils analytiques de la statistique, de l’économie politique et de la sociologie des sciences pour répondre à cette question. Il décrit l’ensemble de la chaîne de production de l’étude, depuis l’échantillonnage jusqu’à la publication et la dissémination des résultats, en passant par la collecte de données, la saisie et le recodage, les estimations et les interprétations. Il met en évidence une stratégie particulièrement offensive qui permet aux chercheurs de J-PAL de faire table rase du passé, y compris en s’affranchissant d’une « culture de la donnée », de refuser la critique et de contourner les règles de base de l’exercice scientifique tout au long du processus de recherche. Bien au-delà de J-PAL, nos analyses questionnent la supposée supériorité des méthodes randomisées tout en reflétant un malaise grandissant au sein du champ académique, qui parvient de moins en moins à faire respecter les règles de base de l’éthique et de la déontologie scientifique._______english_______How can we explain the academic success of a randomized study whose validity, both internal and external, is very problematic? Drawing on a study conducted on Moroccan rural microcredit by J-PAL, this article uses analytical tools from statistics, political economy and sociology of science to answer this question. It describes the entire study production chain, from sampling, data collection, data entry and recoding, estimates and interpretations to publication and dissemination of results. It highlights a particularly aggressive strategy carried out throughout the study process and in the field of research. This allows J-PAL researchers to put the past behind them, including by freeing themselves from a ""data culture"", rejecting criticism and bypassing the basic rules of scientific exercise throughout the research process. Well beyond J-PAL, our analyses question the supposed superiority of randomized methods while reflecting a growing unease within the academic field, which is less and less successful in enforcing the basic rules of ethics and scientific deontology."

N27|An Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade: The Effects of an Import Ban on Cape Colony Slaveholders|Few could have foreseen the consequences when the British Parliament, in 1807, passed the Slave Trade Act that sought to abolish slave imports into the British Empire. From population decreases in the British Caribbean to increased prices in the Cape Colony, historical evidence suggests that the eﬀects of the Act were felt far and wide even though commercialization of slaves was still possible within colonial territories. Using newly digitized historical datasets covering more than 40 years in two diﬀerent districts of the British Cape Colony, this paper measures changes in slave ownership and acquisition patterns from a longitudinal perspective. This approach allows me to tease out the eﬀects of the Act on farmers with diﬀerent types of agricultural outputs, most notably crop and livestock farming, agricultural types with very diﬀerent labor demands. The results show that livestock farmers, surprisingly, were more inelastic to the import ban in comparison to crop farmers. These results suggest that slaveholders could extract rents from the enslaved in a multitude of ways beyond agriculture production and calls for a broader theory of slavery as capital investment.
N27|Serving God and Mammon: The ‘Minerals-Railway Complex’ and its effects on colonial public finances in the British Cape Colony, 1810-1910|The resource curse literature underscores the fact that extractive economies face challenges in diversifying their economies. What is less explored are the public finance challenges encountered in these economies when the extractive industries are completely privatized. Using a recently compiled dataset on public revenues, expenditures and debt, this paper explores the nexus between the privatized extractive sector operations and public finance policies of the Cape Colony between 1810 and 1910. The paper finds that despite the natural resource endowment, the Cape Colony became heavily indebted and had huge budget deficits by the time it joined the Union of South Africa in 1910. After the discovery of diamonds, competition for resource-rents caused a slowdown and in some instances reversed the progress made in consolidating state institutions. The drive towards a national program of development inherent in self-governing colonies was overpowered when the competition for resource-rents culminated in rent-seeking led by the interests in the monopolized extractive sector. Rather than being the main source of government revenues and a basis for inclusive economic progress, as expected in a selfgoverning settler colony, diamonds became a trap through the operations of what I call a ‘Minerals-Railway complex’. The insights from the study have important implications for our understanding of both settler colonialism in Sub-Sahara Africa as well as the management of natural resources in developing economies.
N27|Mining, Paternalism And The Spread Of Education In The Congo Since 1920|This study adds the case of a Belgian colony to a literature that has mainly focused on differences in school enrollment between French and British African territories. While most studies emphasize the supply- side, especially the constraints on missionary activity, we highlight the role of demand from the colonial mining industry. We use various primary sources to assess quantitatively and qualitatively the development of school enrollment in the Congo since 1920. We show that the regional inequality in education that crystallized in colonial times persisted decades after independence. The provincial disparities are used as a point of departure to explain how the mining industry worked as a catalyst for the expansion of primary school enrolment. The paternalistic policy of “stabilization”, i.e. of permanent settlement of workers and their families near the work sites, introduced by the Union Minière du Haut Katanga as well as by most concessionary companies in the Belgian Congo in the mid-1920s, went hand in hand with high investments in primary schooling. The aim of the industry was to save expenses on recruitment and European labour, and to make investments in miners’ and their children’s education profitable.
N27|Stock Market Volatility Analysis using GARCH Family Models: Evidence from Zimbabwe Stock Exchange|Understanding the pattern of stock market volatility is important to investors as well as for investment policy. Volatility is directly associated with risks and returns, higher the volatility the more financial market is unstable. The volatility of the Zimbabwean stock market is modeled using monthly return series consisting of 109 observations from January 2010 to January 2019. ARCH effects test confirmed the use of GARCH family models. Symmetric and asymmetric models were used namely: GARCH(1,1), GARCH-M(1,1), IGARCH(1,1) and EGARCH(1,1). Post-estimation test for further ARCH effects were done for each model to confirm its efficiency for policy. EGARCH(1,1) turned to be the best model using both the AIC and SIC criterions; with the presence of asymmetry found to be significant. The study concludes that positive and negative shocks have different effects on the stock market returns series. Bad and good news will increase volatility of stock market returns in different magnitude. This simply imply that investors on the Zimbabwean stock exchange react differently to information depending be it positive or negative in making investment decisions.
N27|Measuring Macroeconomic Uncertainty in Zimbabwe|What matters to economic decision-making is whether the economy has become more or less predictable. People and businesses use information around them to form judgements about what might happen in the future. The rise in uncertainty might be associated with increased concern about extreme events, skewed towards worries about bad or disastrous events. The study seeks to measure macroeconomic uncertainty in Zimbabwe, using stock market indices - industrial index and mining index - for the period 2010M1 to 2019M3. Prevalence of macroeconomic uncertainty has been traced from the stock market index trend and stock market returns volatility. The squared residuals of the GARCH(1,1) regression model proxied macroeconomic uncertainty levels. The prevalence of significant macroeconomic uncertainty has been observed, with some periods highly uncertain. The study linked periods of uncertainty to some known political, social and economic events to derive meaning. The study found that some political, social and economic events have a contributing effect on the level of macroeconomic uncertainty. Good events and policies are accompanied by low levels of uncertainty while bad events and controversial policies match with high levels of uncertainty. The study recommends that to create a good economic climate, to attract investment and boost confidence in the economy, policymakers should dwell on reducing macroeconomic uncertainty. Reducing macroeconomic uncertainty require policy consistency, policy consultations, less frequent policy changes, avoiding numerous policies, avoiding policy reversals, among other measures. The observed macroeconomic uncertainty affects proper economic decision-making and is not conducive for high levels of investment for local and international investors; companies may struggle to hire labor, and employees and corporates may delay spending and saving pattern distorted.
N27|A History of Australian Equities|This paper presents stylised facts about the historical Australian equity market, drawn from a new hand-collected unit record dataset on listed companies from 1917 to 1979. Among other things, I show that: i) dividends for the early 20th century were lower than previously believed; ii) the realised returns on equities has averaged about 4 percentage points above that on government bonds since 1917, somewhat lower than previous estimates; iii) the share of profits paid out as dividends increased substantially after the introduction of franking credits in the 1980s; iv) the current industry composition of the stock exchange is atypical relative to history, despite it being dominated by essentially the same companies for the past century; and v) price-to-earnings ratios are currently almost exactly at their very long-run average, in contrast with the experience of some of other countries.
N27|Tax Compliance under Indirect Rule in British Africa|How states acquire the ability to raise taxes is a central question in the study of institutions and economic development in economic history. This paper uses new data on ‘Native Authorities’, or African local governments, to investigate tax compliance under indirect rule in British Africa. In theory, Native Authorities represented the integration of indigenous institutions into colonial rule. However, the relationships of African states with the colonial government varied, and African communities experienced considerable political and economic change during the colonial period. The paper investigates the relationship between tax compliance, the autonomy of African states within the colonial system, local levels of income and education, and Native Authority institutions. Understanding the dynamics of Native Authority tax collection helps address wider questions about African processes of state-building, the emergence of an ‘uneven topography’ of sub-national institutions during the colonial period, and the ways in which Africans shaped colonial rule.
N27|Tax Stabilisation, Trade and Political Transitions in Francophone West Africa over 120 Years|Contemporary African fiscal systems are usually portrayed as being subject to significant instability, which has negative consequences for public spending and development. However, this paper documents significant long-term fiscal stabilisation in Benin, Côte d'Ivoire, Niger and Senegal as measured by reductions in tax revenue instability and the responsiveness of tax revenue to trade over a 120-year period. This historical process of long-term fiscal stabilisation in francophone West Africa has not been properly acknowledged in the contemporary fiscal policy literature that tends to focus on recent decades. Moreover, it is shown qualitatively and econometrically that this fiscal stabilisation has been accompanied with a longterm reduction in the volatility of trade, a change in tax composition away from trade taxes to indirect domestic taxes, and major shifts in development policy paradigms. This points to the value of studying African fiscal systems over long periods of time to identify relationships not apparent from a short-term perspective and understand the intricate mechanisms and dynamics that characterize the development process.
N27|Was Slavery a Flexible Form of Labour? Division of Labour and Location Specific Skills on the Eastern Cape Frontier|The flexibility of slave labour as an economic institution has often been assumed as a given. In general, some capital investment is necessary to retrain novice slaves but essentially they could be substituted for any other form of labour. This paper refutes the claim of the flexibility of slave labour through employing a longitudinal study for the Graaff-Reinet region of the Cape colony. We calculate Hicksian elasticity of complementarity coefficients for each year of a 21-year combination of cross-sectional tax datasets (1805-28) in order to test whether slave labour was substitutable with other forms of labour. We find that khoe, family and slave labour are not substitutable over the period of the study. This lends credence to the finding that slave and settler family labour were two different inputs in the agricultural production process. Indigenous Khoe and slave labour also remain complements throughout the period of study even when Khoe labour becomes scarce after the frontier conflicts, confirming the notion that slave labour at Graaff-Reinet was not a flexible labour source. We argue that the lack of substitutability of slave labour was due to the need of the settlers to acquire labour with location-specific skills such as the indigenous Khoe.
N27|Stock Market Volatility Clustering and Asymmetry in Africa: A Post Global Financial Crisis Evidence|This paper evaluates the nature of stock market volatility in Africa after the global financial crisis. Specifically, the paper examines volatility clustering and volatility asymmetry in aftermath of the global financial crisis for Botswana, Régionale des Valeurs Mobilières (BRVM), Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mauritius, Morocco, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tunisia, Uganda, and Zambia. The paper employs autoregressive asymmetric generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (AR(i)-GJR-GARCH(1,1)) model. The major findings are as follows: (i) there is evidence of volatility clustering in Africa stock markets returns after the global financial crisis, although with varying degrees; (ii) there is existence of volatility persistence in the African stock market returns after the global financial crisis except for few countries, which are not very persistent; (iii) after the global financial crisis, Africa stock markets returns are asymmetric, with negative shocks producing higher volatility in the immediate future than positive shocks of the same magnitude in some countries, and positive shocks producing higher volatility in other countries. The findings provide comparative basis for assessing market patterns, predicting market risk, and gauging market sentiment in Africa stock markets, as well as provide foreign portfolio managers required evidence for harvesting volatility through portfolio rebalancing for optimal performance.
N27|The effects of revenue diversification and cross border banking on risk and return of banks in Africa|The paper analyses the implications of revenue diversification and cross-border banking for risk and return. We sample 320 banks across 29 African countries and employ System GMM estimator as a methodological approach to shed further light on the diversification-stability nexus by examining the complex interaction between three key variables: cross-border banking, diversification and bank stability. The results suggest that exploration risk reduces diversification as the level of capital increases when banks cross border to diversify across revenue generating activities. Our analyses further show that, banks in Africa derive absolute benefits from diversification if they cross border and diversify their revenue base concurrently. These results are robust to a range of controls including alternative variable specifications, regulatory environment that bank operate and methodology.
N27|Social mobility among Christian Africans: evidence from Anglican marriage registers in Uganda, 1895–2011|This article uses Anglican marriage registers from colonial and post‐colonial Uganda to investigate long‐term trends and determinants of intergenerational social mobility and colonial elite formation among Christian African men. It shows that the colonial era opened up new labour opportunities for these African converts, enabling them to take large steps up the social ladder regardless of their social origin. Contrary to the widespread belief that British indirect rule perpetuated the power of African political elites (chiefs), this article shows that a remarkably fluid colonial labour economy actually undermined their social advantages. Sons of chiefs gradually lost their high social‐status monopoly to a new, commercially orientated, and well‐educated class of Anglican Ugandans, who mostly came from non‐elite and sometimes even lower‐class backgrounds. The study also documents that the colonial administration and the Anglican mission functioned as key steps on the ladder to upward mobility. Mission education helped provide the skills and social reference needed to climb the ladder in exchange for compliance with the laws of the Anglican Church. These social mobility patterns persisted throughout the post‐colonial era, despite rising levels of informal labour during Idi Amin's dictatorship.
N27|African Socialism; or the Search for an Indigenous Model of Economic Development|Ralph Austen in African Economic History (1987) noted how few African countries explicitly choose capitalism on independence, and for those who did it was a default model or a residual pattern. ‘African socialism’ was popular in the early decades of independence and pursued by several countries, including Ghana, Guinea, Senegal and Tanzania, the cases considered in this paper. The term had multiple meanings, and its advocates were quick to stress that they were not communist, and some said they were not even Marxist. This paper explores the argument that African socialism was a search for an indigenous model of economic development for a generation that was justifiably ambivalent about capitalism, but wary of being put in the communist camp in the Cold War era. Importantly, advocates of African socialism often proposed bold and transformative visions for their countries. These visions might be worth revisiting, devoid of the paradigm of socialism.
N27|Russia’s Informal Economic Growth: 1960–1990|This paper studies the historical GDP of Russia from perspective informal economy. We re-estimate nominal and real informal GDP in the period 1960–1990, using the expenditure approach and declassified archival materials of household budget surveys. The main findings are as follows. First, previously estimated values of Russia’s nominal GDP were underestimated, on average, by about 12.6% for 1960–1990, due to ignoring informal GDP. Second, after including informal GDP, we find that economic growth is 15–39 percentage points lower during this period, which corresponds to differences in the annual growth rate in the range of 0.24–0.38 percentage points.
N27|Do Pan-African banks have the best of both worlds?|There has been a large expansion of foreign banks in Africa over the last two decades, with Pan-African banks playing a key role in this phenomenon. This paper questions if this development is beneficial for bank efficiency in African countries by investigating if Pan-African banks are more efficient than other types of foreign and domestic banks. We analyse the relation between ownership type and bank efficiency on a large sample of African banks covering 39 African countries over the period 2002–2015. We find that Pan-African banks are the most efficient banks in the African banking industries. We explain this finding with the fact that these banks combine the best of both worlds: they have the global advantages of foreign banks and the home field advantages of domestic banks. They are therefore able to be more efficient than both foreign banks from developed countries and domestic banks. This suggests that favouring the entry of Pan-African banks would be beneficial to bank efficiency in Africa.
N27|Decentralized Despotism? Indirect Colonial Rule Undermines Contemporary Democratic Attitudes|This paper identifies indirect and direct colonial rule as causal factors in shaping support for democracy by exploiting a within-country natural experiment in Namibia. Throughout the colonial era, northern Namibia was indirectly ruled through a system of appointed indigenous traditional elites whereas colonial authorities directly ruled southern Namibia. This variation originally stems from where the progressive extension of direct German control was stopped after a rinderpest epidemic in the 1890s, and thus constitutes plausibly exogenous within-country variation in the form of colonial rule. Using this spatial discontinuity, we find that individuals in indirectly ruled areas are less likely to support democracy and turnout at elections. We explore potential mechanisms and find suggestive evidence that the greater influence of traditional leaders in indirectly ruled areas has socialized individuals to accept non-electoral bases of political authority.
N27|Efficient Market Hypothesis: Evidence from the JSE equity and bond markets|This study investigates weak form efficiency for 4 stock and 7 bond market return under the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) using monthly data spanning from 2002 to 2016. Our empirical strategy consists of using both individual and panel based unit root testing procedures. Moreover, we split our empirical data into two sub-samples corresponding to periods before and periods subsequent to the global financial crisis. Our empirical results point to an overwhelming evidence of weak form efficiency as the integration test fail to produce convincing evidence of unit root behaviour amongst the observed time series. The study thus confirms the efficiency of equities and debt markets in South Africa in light of the global financial crisis.
N27|The Origins of Financial Development: How the African Slave Trade Continues to Influence Modern Finance|We assess how the African slave trade—which had enduring effects on social cohesion—continues to influence financial systems. After showing that the intensity with which people were enslaved and exported from Africa during the 1400 – 1900 period helps account for overall financial development, household access to credit, and firm access to finance, we evaluate three potential mechanisms linking the slave trade to modern finance—information sharing institutions, trust in financial institutions, and the quality of legal institutions. We discover that the slave trade is strongly, negatively related to the information sharing and trust mechanisms but not to the legal mechanism.
N27|The Link Between Bank Credit And Private Sector Investment In Nigeria From 1980-2014|TThis study attempts to investigate the link between bank credit and private sector investment in Nigeria from 1980 to 2014 using Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression procedure. The study also employs other preliminary investigations which include, unit root, cointegration and Granger causality test procedures. The OLS result indicates that the coefficients of the variables which include, banks credit to the private sector (CRPRIVAT), trade openness (OPEN), exchange rate (EXCHR) and total bank saving (BSAVING) exhibit positive signs to the dependent variable, private investment (INVEST) during the period under review, while the coefficients of two other variables, capital expenditure (CAP) and interest rate (INTR) indicate negative signs to the dependent variable. The stationarity test result shows that all the variables under consideration are stationary and integrated of order one at 5% significance level. Also, the cointegration test result indicates at most five cointegrating equations at 5% level of significance. The Granger causality test result shows that a bi-directional causality exists between banks credit and private investment and also between private investment and capital expenditure, while a uni-directional causality exists from exchange rate to private investment.Statistically, the descriptive statistics result indicates that all the variables have a positive mean values which ranges from 18.05390 to 2427052 with 34 observations.The correlation test result obtained shows that four variables, CRPRIVAT, OPEN, EXCHR and BSAVING have positive relationships with the dependent variable INVEST. The t-statistic result shows that five of the variables which includes, CRPRIVAT, OPEN, CAP, INTR and EXCHR are statistically significant at 5% significance level. The study recommends that there is a need for increased Federal government support to banks in terms of policies that would encourage lending to the private sector in Nigeria.
N27|Efficient market hypothesis: Evidence from the JSE equity and bond markets|This study investigates weak form efficiency for 4 stock and 6 bond market return under the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) using monthly data spanning from 2002 to 2016.

Moreover, we split our empirical data into two sub-samples corresponding to periods before and periods subsequent to the global financial crisis. Our empirical results point to an overwhelming evidence of weak form efficiency as the integration test fail to produce convincing evidence of unit root behaviour amongst the observed time series. The study thus confirms the efficiency of equities and debt markets in South Africa in light of the global financial crisis.
N27|Decentralized Despotism?

Using this spatial discontinuity, we ﬁnd that individuals in indirectly ruled areas are less likely to support democracy and turnout at elections.
N27|From coercion to comppensation: Institutional responses to labour scarcity in teh Central African copperbelt|There is a tight historical connection between endemic labour scarcity and the rise of coercive labour market institutions in former African colonies. This paper explores how mining companies in the Belgian Congo and Northern Rhodesia secured scarce supplies of African labour, by combining coercive labour recruitment practices with considerable investments in living standard improvements. By reconstructing internationally comparable real wages we show that copper mine workers lived at barebones subsistence in the 1910s-1920s, but experienced rapid welfare gains from the mid-1920s onwards, to become among the best paid manual labourers in Sub-Saharan Africa from the 1940s onwards. We investigate how labour stabilization programs raised welfare conditions of mining worker families (e.g. medical care, education, housing quality) in the Congo, and why these welfare programs were more hesitantly adopted in Northern Rhodesia. By showing how solutions to labour scarcity varied across space and time we stress the need for dynamic conceptualizations of colonial institutions, as a counterweight to their oft supposed persistence in the historical economics literature.
N27|Capitalism in pre-colonial Africa|To what extent did capitalism come into being in Africa before 1850? If by capitalism we mean the production of goods for exchange by capitalists who combine their own capital and land with labor bought from free workers without land, then the accumulative historical evidence tells us that only to a limited extent had capitalism emerged before 1850, and it was most certainly not the dominant system of production in Africa (Iliffe 1983). This does not mean that there was no production for the market. Nor does it imply that there was no wage labor, or that exchanges of capital did not take place. Finally it does not mean that there was no economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa before 1850. As will be analyzed here, markets did exist, there were some wage labor and there were means of exchange that facilitated some economic growth, though growth mostly occurred on the extensive margin.
N27|The development of settler agriculture in British Africa revisisted: Estimating the role of tenant labour in Southern Rhodesia, c. 1900-1960|In this paper I use primary and secondary sources to quantify the role of tenant labour on settler farms in colonial Africa, using Southern Rhodesia as a case in point. My findings show that the rise of wage labour did not mark the end of labour tenancy, as has been assumed in previous literature. On the contrary, the two forms of labour co-existed. The results find support in the theoretical literature on agrarian labour contracts as well as from studies on farm labour on large farms in pre-industrial Europe and America. This literature has been surprisingly neglected in studies of rural labour relations in colonial Africa. Based on my estimates I revise the fundamental question of the role of access to and control of indigenous labour in the growth of European settler agriculture in Africa. In contrast to previous research, I argue that the rise of wage labour was a response to settler farmers’ limited capacity to control tenant labour rather than a sign of the superiority of agrarian capitalist relations of production.
N27|Commodities, Prices and Risk: The changing market for non-slave products in pre-abolition West Africa|In this chapter, we have examined the changing market for African commodities in the decades before the British abolished their transatlantic slave trade. By constructing a new time series of the quantities and prices of goods imported from Africa in the customs ledgers we have shown that there was a far more substantial increase in the trade than the previous data suggested. Furthermore, we suggest that this was driven by slave traders and was primarily a phenomena of the Eastern and more specifically Biafran/Cameroonian region of the West African coast which was a significant reversal of the pattern of commodity trading until the 1770s. These traders also seem to have bought relatively fewer slaves while purchasing greater quantities of non-slave products. We hypothesise that this trend was driven by a number of different factors. Firstly, commodity prices were rising in Europe, while prices on the coast remained relatively stable, in marked contrast to slaves. In addition, the period saw increasing levels of risk and parliamentary legislation to reduce crowding on ships which may have further encouraged captains to purchase more commodities as a risk reduction, profit enhancing strategy.
N27|Autosimilarité et mémoire longue : Les rendements des indices boursiers tunisiens sont-ils chaotiques ?|La Finance fractale est venue au secours des modèles classiques incapables d’expliquer les anomalies boursières et des modèles linéaires inadéquats pour caractériser les processus complexes. La caractérisation des séries financières est toujours d’actualité. Le calcul de l’exposant de Hurst, de la dimension fractale, de l’exposant de Lyapunov, de la fenêtre de Theiler et la réalisation du test de déterminisme, nous ont permis de mieux appréhender la dynamique des rentabilités des indices cotés sur la Bourse de Tunis. Les résultats montrent que les rentabilités ne sont pas linéaires, suivent des lois alpha stables, présentent une mémoire longue mais ne sont toutefois pas chaotiques. L’hypothèse d’un mouvement fractal brownien est privilégiée.
N27|‘Despotic Democrats’ Versus Good Governance: Challenges Of Administration Of Nigeria’S Fourth Republic|The role of the constitution, as a legal framework in the governance of any polity, cannot be overemphasized, as the document remains a reference point in ensuring good governance. Nigeria’s ‘democrats’ on getting to power did act contrary to the constitution and turn themselves to despots, whom everybody must worship. These leaders in their antics subdued other arms of government and promoted ‘Personal Rule’, an administrative system where ‘all powers’ are concentrated in President’s hands. These leaders could not differentiate between private and public organisation; hence run the nation like personal businesses. Thus, the study examined the leadership styles of Nigeria’s political leaders and how their styles’ have made or marred the nation’s quest for good governance and peaceful co-existence. The study relied heavily on secondary sources of data. The study covered Nigeria’s Fourth Republic which commenced from 1999 when the nation returned to civil rule. By this, the nation has already witnessed uninterrupted democratic governance for the period of sixteen years. In addition, the nation has equally recorded four successful and smooth transitions from one civilian administration to the other, including a successful transition from the ruling party to an opposition party, thus sixteen years is more than enough for any ideal government to experiment, apply and put in place a kind of governance that is proper and appropriate for the citizenry. The study adopted Machiavelli’s political theory as its theoretical framework in analysing leadership styles of Nigeria’s ‘democrats’. The study revealed that ‘the democrats’, especially the Presidents of Nigeria’s Fourth Republic toed the path of dictatorship; subdued perceived oppositions and attempted altering the constitution to stay glued to power. The study further revealed that ‘the democrats’ broke laws with impunity; have no respect for democratic norms; abused human rights; interfered unduly in the affairs of Legislature; clamped down on the judiciary, and other allied institutions. ‘The democrats’ tenure were marred with corruption, they shared state’s wealth with their supporters, and political clique; poverty was rampant and there was no social justice; the politics of recycling became the order of the day as the same set of ‘democrats’ and their military allies continue to dominate the nation’s political scene. The implications of bad governance were conflicts, insecurity and poverty, unless good governance is practised; the rule of law is upheld, and immunity clause covering ‘the democrats’ over criminal matters is removed; the nation may not witness any meaningful development.
N27|The persistence of profits of banks in Africa|Abstract This paper analyses the profit persistence of African banking sector, focusing on the role of the level of competition and banks earnings management. We apply Markov chain to analyse the extent and mobility of profit persistence, dynamic auto regressive model to assess the speed of convergence and the quantile regression technique to examine the determinants of profit persistence of banks in Africa. The results show a high level of profit persistence and relatively low speed of convergence. There is also evidence that regulation and banks earnings management affect both the level and persistence of banks profitability. We also find that competition as well as 2007/2008 financial crisis reduce the level and the speed of profit persistence.

Economic history is full of evidence about what held African economies back for years. Some obstacles are of domestic origin such as excessive consumption and luxury masqueraded as public investment. Other obstacles were imposed from outside such as the destruction and weakening of traditional African religions and religious leadership as well as other wide ranging institutions. The combined effects can be summed up in one word: de-institutionalization. De-institutionalization devalued local knowledge (technology) thereby reducing performance. It is not possible to turn the clock back, but current policy is better-off bringing these obstacles into discussion as they stand a good chance of lowering the socalled “Africa dummy” variable common to growth regressions. Future research would also benefit if it sought to adjust conventional economic theory to allow space for the special features of African economies. Market theory is misleading in treating private use rights as antithetical to private ownership rights. For example, the suggestion that land tenure in Africa is anti-growth is inconsistent with the spectacular growth China has experienced even without private property rights.
N27|Prospects for Africa's economic growth|On the African continent for a decade is observed economic growth, combined with the demographic explosion. In the XXI century countries which have been given the nickname of the Third World have a chance to offset the distance of the level of socio-economic development with the rest of the world, and at the same time become the next, after Asia, center of dynamic economic growth. Based on the theory of convergence, the analysis of economic ties between African countries and the developed economies such as the United States, European Union, Australia, Japan, and the fast developing as China and Brazil a decade ago was conducted. The analysis made it possible to shift the dynamics of growth in GDP per capita in the years 1960-1995 in developed countries to six African countries, including Algeria, Angola, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, and South Africa. On this basis, we obtained the forecast of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in these countries till 2030.
N27|Financial and Corporate Structure in South Africa|Concentration in the South African financial sector has its origins in three main influences that are all historical (i) the legacy of domination by a small number of large imperial banks, (ii) the struggle between English and Afrikaner capital and (iii) the statutory legislation that framed the operation of banks. In this paper we describe the part played by these three historical influences in the formation and development of the corporate sector in South Africa. One recurrent theme throughout the history is the relative position of the foreign bank and domestic bank in the local market place. We take up this theme and argue that the scale and extent of foreign bank operations in South Africa is far greater than estimates provided by the local authorities. We have found that the main vehicle in deepening the concentration of the sector has been the merger. In later sections of the paper we lay out how the amalgamation by absorption approach to expansion that has been a constant feature of the country’s business life comes together with a merger frenzy in the late 1980’s and 1990s that succeeds in further deepening concentration within banking, finance and industry. Last, we end with an analysis of industry structure by Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) capitalisation between 1994 and 2011.
N27|Why local context matters: de jure and de facto property rights in colonial South Africa|For economic transactions, including debt transactions, to occur in a market system, property rights are essential. The literature has focussed on finding empirical proof of the effect of property right regimes, noting differences between de jure and de facto property rights. Yet most of these studies focus on macroeconomic outcomes, like economic growth and public expenditure. We propose, instead, to use individual debt transactions and property ownership available in probate inventories from early colonial South Africa to investigate the effects of property right regimes on economic outcomes at the individual level. At the Cape, de jure property rights between freehold and loan farms differed. Historians, however, suggest that de facto property rights between these two property types were the same. We exploit the random variation of birth order, specifically being the oldest son, to estimate whether the type of farm, and therefore the type of property rights, matter for economic activity, in our case, debt transactions. Our results suggest that historians were correct: loan farms were as secure in their de facto property rights, despite differences in de jure property rights. Our results confirm that the local context in which property right regimes are embedded are at least as important as the property right regime itself.
N27|Social Mobility among Christian Africans: Evidence from Ugandan Marriage Registers 1895-2011|We use marriage registers from colonial and post-colonial Uganda to investigate long-term trends in social mobility among Christian Africans, finding a stark contrast to the pessimistic view that colonialism retarded Africa. Colonial influences in Uganda brought much greater and more equal opportunities for social advancement than in pre-colonial times. The colonial labour market was the main ladder for upward mobility, and the mission society helped provide the education and social reference needed to climb it. We find no “buffer zone” preventing sons of blue-collar descent from entering into white-collar work. The patterns continued throughout the post-colonial era despite political turmoil.
N27|Economy And Environment. Points Of View And Actions|The current situation of the environment is a direct consequence of history, especially of economic history. The article analyzes the relationship between economy and environment, in order to determine the main causes that led to the ecological crisis. The article argues that despite the close relationship between environment and economy, the economy did not take into account the environmental protection, until there appeared serious environmental impacts. Including the environment in economic thinking led, first, to the application of conventional techniques to economy to try to solve problems. The article also examines some priorities for improving the relationship between economy and environment conducive to move towards a model of sustainable development. The conclusion is that sustainable development is the goal to be achieved. In search of sustainability, companies should play an important role, as in all phases of the life cycle of their products, there are environmental risks and, therefore, they are a major source of environmental degradation of the planet.
N27|The curious incident of the franc in the Gambia: exchange rate instability and imperial monetary systems in the 1920s|In 1922, British colonial Gambia demonetized the French 5-franc coin, which had been legal tender at a fixed rate in the colony since 1843. Until World War I, this rate was close to the international rate under the gold standard. When the franc began to depreciate in 1918, however, a gap emerged between the Gambian rate and the international rate, prompting a rapid influx of the coins. The demonetization cost the colonial administration over a year's revenue, affecting the later development of the colony. The 1920s have long been a fruitful period for the study of monetary history owing to the instability of exchange rates during and after the war. This article extends the study of this period to examine the impact of these changes on dependent colonies in West Africa, highlighting the importance of local compromises and particularities in colonial monetary systems.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N27|La Théorie de la Modernisation : un Examen Empirique en Afrique|This paper empirically tests the theory of modernization based on a sample of developing countries in Africa. It provides, for the first time, an empirical validation of four determinants of democracy according to the modernization theory (education, wealth, urbanization and industrialization). We use three estimation techniques (pooled OLS, LSDVC and GMM) and find reliable results which suggest that the modernization theory does not explain the negative dynamic of democracy in Africa.
N27|Earnings management, funding and diversification strategies of banks in Africa|Purpose - – This paper aims to investigate the implications of earnings management for funding and diversification strategy within the context of developing and emerging economies. Design/methodology/approach - – The authors raise two issues pertinent to bank earnings management: first, whether there is evidence of earnings management of banks in the selected African countries; and second, what must have accounted for the banks to engage in such practices? Findings - – The results show that almost all the 330 banks in the 29 African countries sampled are found to have engaged in some management of their earnings during the period 2002-2009. The authors also find evidence that bank activity mix and funding modes explain bank earnings quality. Overall results indicate that the sensitivity of earnings management to revenue diversification across interest income decreases, as bank market shares increases. Originality/value - – The authors investigate how earnings management is affected by banks intermediation strategies.
N27|Financing The African Colonial State: The Revenue Imperative And Forced Labour|Recent studies on colonial public finance have pointed to the severe constraints to fiscal capacity building Sub-Saharan Africa, and to the inclination of colonial governments to avoid direct taxes when revenue from trade became sufficiently available. Although fiscal revenue was indeed a central pillar of the colonial state formation process, contributions from a widely used but implied source of government ‘income’ – that of forced labor (or ‘labor taxes’) – have so far been left out of the picture. Exploiting data on labor corvée schemes in French Africa between 1913-1937 (the prestations), this is the first paper to provide estimates of how much this in-kind form of revenue may have enhanced colonial budgets. I show that in most places labor taxes constituted the most important component of early colonial state income. My results imply that studies on historical fiscal capacity building efforts need to make a greater effort to estimate and integrate this significant source of state income into their analysis.
N27|Colonial Origins Of The Threefold Reality Of Mocambique: Fiscal Capacity And Labour Systems|The question whether institutions in Africa were shaped by the metropolitan identity of the colonizer or by local conditions is lively debated in the African economic history literature. In this paper we contribute to this debate by revealing regional differences in tax capacity in the Portuguese colony of Mozambique. Samir Amin (1972) divided the African continent into three different “macro-regions of colonial influence”: Africa of the colonial trade or peasant economy, Africa of the concession-owning companies and Africa of the labour reserves. Interestingly, we argue that Mozambique encompassed all three different “macro-regions” in one sole colony. In regression analysis we find differences in “tax capacity” along this threefold categorization. We use a newly compiled dataset that includes government revenue (direct/indirect taxes) raised on a district level between 1930 and the 1973, derived from the statistical yearbooks and national accounts of Mozambique. Focussing on one country has the advantage over cross country comparisons that one can keep the metropolitan identity constant. We conclude that the tax system developed as a response to the local conditions. and the differences between the three regions were exacerbated during colonial times.
N27|Fiscal Capacity And State Formation In Francophone West Africa 1850-2010|This study contributes to African state and fiscal history by presenting a detailed comparison of the evolution of fiscal capacity in four countries in francophone West Africa – Benin, Côte d'Ivoire, Niger and Senegal - over both the colonial and independent periods. While common patterns and persistence can be observed it is instead the unique fiscal pathways of the individual countries that stand out. These pathways can only be understood by analyzing how the underlying economic and political factors of each country develop over time. The importance of the colonial heritage in the development of fiscal capacity for individual countries should therefore not be overemphasized.
N27|The Road to Competitive Advantage must be Paved with a Respectful Attitude towards the Environment|The role of economic entities in society has changed as a result of the emergence of environmental concerns among people. Currently economic entities are facing a new challenge, that of introducing environment variable in its activities. The paper deals with new environmental assessment of the effects on competitiveness and how we can transform the environment into a competitive advantage. The current concern, social and institutional environment protection has led to pressure on economic entities to adopt a much more respectful of the natural environment. This is a challenge for managers entity. However, it is clear that regulations and legislation are not enough to stabilize the situation. Change must take place in the business. In conclusion, we must be aware that the road to competitive advantage is difficult, full of obstacles, and be paved with a respectful attitude towards the environment, but at the other end sees business sustainability.
N27|Determinants of Bank Profitability and Basel Capital Regulation: Empirical Evidence from Nigeria|This study, empirically, investigates the determinants of bank profitability. After including the regulatory variable into the model, I find no significant difference in bank profitability during pre-and post-capital regulation regime. Second, after employing NIM and ROA profitability metrics, I find that the determinants of bank profitability, and its significance, depends on the profitability metric employed. Third, I find that asset quality is a strong determinant of bank interest margin, relative to return on asset. Also, I observe that economies of scale and scope enables larger banks to be profitable (ROA) relative to smaller banks. Overall, the insignificant effect of Basel capital regime on bank profitability seems to suggest that such regulation might not be aimed at decreasing bank profits.
N27|Determinants of Bank Profitability and Basel Capital Regulation: Empirical Evidence from Nigeria|This study, empirically, investigates the determinants of bank profitability. Overall, I find that the Basel capital regime had no significant effect on bank profitability. This result is significant because it lends support to the view that modified Basel accord in different countries might be aimed to meet other prudential objectives other than the intended objective - to reduce excessive bank risk-taking. Second, after employing NIM and ROA profitability metrics, I find that the determinants of bank profitability, and its significance, depends on the profitability metric employed. Third, I find that loan quality significantly influences bank interest margin while bank size and cost efficiency significantly influences return on asset. Finally, bank capital adequacy is observed to be a significant determinants of bank profitability.
N27|The Cape of Perfect Storms: Colonial Africaâ€™s first financial crash, 1788-1793|This paper investigates the causes and consequences of colonial Africaâ€™s first financial crash, which happened in South Africaâ€™s Dutch Cape Colony. The 1788â€“1793 crisis followed a common sequence of events: trade and fiscal deficits were monetized by printing money, credit extension accelerated, the exchange rate fell sharply and inflation spiked. The domestic conditions were compounded by a deterioration of international conditions and political uncertainty. The final straw was the collapse of the Capeâ€™s own Lehman Brothers â€“ an unregulated merchant house, run by a prominent Cape family, which had been indiscriminately issuing the equivalent of promissory notes. The policy response during the crisis included fiscal austerity, an attempted reorganization of domestic financial intermediation and continued monetary easing, which depreciated the exchange rate and triggered inflation. A new domestic bank was created. Yet the Cape economy would not recover quickly; the effects of the Capeâ€™s first financial crash would be felt deep into the nineteenth century.
N27|The Curious Incident of the Franc in the Gambia: Floating Exchange Rates and the British Imperial Monetary System in the 1920s|In 1922, the British colonial administration in the Gambia demonetized the French five franc coin, which had been legal tender since 1843. The cost of the demonetization was equal to a year’s revenue, and undermined the stable fiscal position built up over previous decades. The floating exchange rates of the 1920s have long been a fruitful topic of research in European monetary history. Less attention has been paid to the impact of floating on colonial territories in the periphery. This paper uses the rather curious case of a British colonial administration paying to support the local value of the franc to illustrate that the 1920s are an equally useful period in the study of colonial monetary systems. A key aim of imperial governments was to ensure convertibility between colony and metropole, but local conditions in individual colonies often required compromises which went unnoticed until exchange rates became unstable.
N27|Predicting Bank Credit Risk: Does Board Structure Matter?|The study investigates the predictors of credit risk in the universal banking industry with panel data from universal banks in Ghana and finds that leverage, assets (size), loan loss provision, board size, board independence, and the number of executive directors on the board of a bank are the predictors of its credit risk. Based on these results, the study concludes that board structure matters in credit risk management of universal banks in Ghana. The recommendation is that banks could improve their credit risk management by formulating policies around these factors.
N27|Bank efficiency in Africa|This study examines the efficiency of the financial sector in African countries. It aims to investigate if ìThe financial institutions are capable of distributing the economic resources efficiently. Empirical evidence supports a sound intermediation process and efficiency in the banking system (Vittas, 1991; Howard & Haynes, 2001). In this paper, the cost function is estimated with the use of a single-output and multi-input approach for the analysis. The output consists of loans, other earning assets and non-interest revenue which are used individually for the estimation. The input is deemed to be made up of capital, deposits and labour (overhead). The analysis is further extended by calculating the x-inefficiency which is found to be within the range of 24 - 26%. The study made postulations in respect of the causes for the inefficiency and the possible remedies. The study comprises of Commercial banks from about forty seven African countries for a period of ten years.
N27|Giordano Dell'Amore for Africa: the FINAFRICA Project|The paper reflects and develops the testimony delivered by the author in participating to a round table, together with Tancredi Bianchi, chairman, Alberto Cova, Roberto Mazzotta and Paolo Mottura. It was during a one day conference devoted by Bocconi University to a prominent scholar and banker, Professor Giordano Dell'Amore, its former Rector, and held in Milan on October 2nd, 2013. Minutes of the conference have been recorded and published in a book: T. Bianchi & M. A. Romani, Giordano Dell'Amore, Università Bocconi Editore, Milan, 2013. The ceremony in honour and memory of Giordano Dell'Amore (1902-1981) was attended by municipal and academic authorities, members of the faculty as well as scholars from other Italian universities, his pupils, Bocconi alumni and students. The paper deals with the multiyear activity of Professor Dell'Amore, the author's mentor, in favour of Africa. It particularly focuses on the crucial role played by Giordano Dell'Amore, while serving as Chairman of the Board of Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie Lombarde (Cariplo), the savings bank of Lombardy, at that time the largest in the world, in drawing up and implementing the project of Finafrica Foundation, a project fully consistent with the aims of this bank. The papers also highlights the guidance and financial support provided by him to Finafrica, the remarkable institution set up in Milan, mainly during its take-off stage and early development. Professor Dell'Amore, as scholar, had made valuable scientific contributions in understanding the role of financial sector in economic development particularly in underlining the need of strategies to enhance the mobilization of household savings and to supply adequate financial services to rural areas of less developed countries. In his views, Finafrica, within an appropriate cooperation policy framework, by means of providing research, technical assistance and training, could help to improve African banking systems and rural financial markets.
N27|Inclusive Financial System Reforms in Uganda: Unveiling Ambiguity|This paper examines the financial system reforms in the context of financial sector deepening, and strategy for financial sector development and inclusion in Uganda. Results suggest that the indicators of financial sector development are largely as they were in 1996 and that the actual gains from financial inclusion strategies are small. Evidence suggests a weak link between financial deepening and financial usage by firms and households. It finds the acclaimed success (by policy makers and stakeholders) in achieving financial inclusion somewhat exaggerated because their assessment relies in large part on the number of financial and mobile money accounts. The paper concludes that measurement of financial inclusion needs to go beyond looking at account numbers to understanding what is done with those account. It also recommends the subordination of financial inclusion policy to the needs of firms and households (—the type that is modelled to fit the local context) and more consideration of behavioural constraints in financial inclusion programmes.
N27|Financial Sector Development and Economic Growth in Africa - Sviluppo finanziario e crescita economica in Africa|This paper tests the proposition that financial development promotes economic growth and the extent, focusing exclusively on Africa. Twenty countries spread over the different regions of the continent constituted the sample. Dynamic panel data analyses were conducted under an arrangement recognizing the distinction between the outcome of with and without fixed effects models. The monetary variables in the models posted clear superior performance. However, both the monetary and the financial factors appeared to be more important to growth with the less advanced countries in the sample. Generally, there was evidence supporting monetarism in the growth dynamics of the sample. - Questo studio esamina l’assunto secondo il quale lo sviluppo finanziario promuove la crescita economica, e in che misura, attraverso l’analisi del caso africano. Il campione considerato è di venti paesi di regioni differenti. Le analisi dinamiche di dati panel sono state effettuate in modo da distinguere i risultati ottenuti da modelli con e senza effetti fissi. Le variabili monetarie hanno avuto una performance chiaramente migliore nei modelli. In ogni caso sia i fattori monetari che quelli finanziari sembrano essere più importanti per la crescita nei paesi meno avanzati del campione. In generale sono emerse evidenze a sostegno del monetarismo nelle dinamiche di crescita del campione.
N27|SAVINGS and economic growth: a historical analysis of the relationship between savings and economic growth in the CAPE Colony economy, 1850-1909|Abstract The sub-optimal savings propensity in South Africa the past three decades causes concern for the ability of the country to support its economic development. An historical analysis of the development of the savings’ trends in South Africa may assist in understanding the historical roots of the phenomenon. Apart from general descriptions of the nature of economic activity in the Cape Colony very little is known about the role financial sector development and savings played in the growing colonial economy. This paper explores the performance of the economy of the Cape Colony between 1850 and 1909, through the business cycles, financial sector stability, the nature and extent of economic activity and seeks to explain the relationship between savings and economic growth. The question is whether the general view that ‘financial development is robustly growth promoting’ can be substantiated in the last half of the nineteenth century Cape Colony? It contributes to the economic history literature on the colonial past of South Africa by using newly compiled data on the GDP of the Cape Colony during the last half of the nineteenth century. The paper finds that despite the expectations in the literature that financial deepening contributes to economic growth; the Cape Colony did not display such causal relationship between savings and economic growth in the period under review. The paper shows the different forms of savings in the colony and the trend of savings behavior in the period amidst the development of a relatively robust financial sector.
N27|What Influences Banks Lending in Sub-Saharan Africa?|This article analyses the broad determinants of bank lending in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) using both micro-bank and macro-country level data of 264 banks across 24 SSA countries. The core finding is that the structure of banking markets influences credit delivery in SSA in an environment where the financial sector is reformed and banks are allowed to operate freely. Also, there is an evidence to suggest a link between bank credit and the financial strength of the banks. The overall results suggest that regulatory initiative, which restricts banking activities, imposes severe entry requirements and requires high regulatory capital, influences banksâ€™ decisions to supply loans.JEL Classification: E52, G21, G28, N27

A Contribution to Sustainable Development|The economic transactions made in an causes interactions with the environment, in some cases occurring adverse environmental effects. Progressive degradation of the natural environment and increasing social concern before this event, converted protect the environment in one of the most important strategic actions amendment requiring entities to include consideration of environmental issues. The general objective of this study is to analyze business practices related to environmental issues, both in its accounting treatment and environmental management strategies to entities that perform activities of environmental degradation.
N27|A preliminary examination of the effects of credit instruments on de facto and de jure political power: lien laws in the postbellum United States South and nineteenth century New South Wales, Australia|This paper offers some preliminary insights into the impact of a particular type of credit instrument, the lien, on the distribution of de facto and de jure political power in the postbellum US South and the Australian colony of New South Wales. De facto political power arises when wealth increases and, once acquired, it can be used to challenge the prevailing distribution of de jure political power. The design and operation of lien laws in these two locations resulted in very different outcomes for the allocation of de facto and de jure political power and this had implications for long run growth outcomes. In the postbellum South the operation of liens evolved to favour landlord elites over competing claimants thereby supporting the continued unequal distribution of de facto and de jure political power. This skewed distribution of political power is likely to have resulted in lower growth rates in the long run for many Southern economies. In New South Wales the pastoral elites themselves were credit constrained and therefore, relied on another colonial group, merchants, to provide credit via liens. This led to greater de facto political power of merchants which, over time, allowed this group to mount an effective challenge to the prevailing de jure political power of pastoralists. In turn, this contributed to a shift toward a more equal allocation of property rights as well as liberalisation of the political sector including universal franchise and the secret ballot. The move towards greater equality in NSW would have led to higher long run growth rates than may otherwise have prevailed.
N27|A History of Australian Corporate Bonds|This paper examines the development of Australian corporate bond issuance since the early 20th century, based on a new unit-record dataset that we have compiled. Issuance trends have changed significantly over the past century as bond markets have become more diverse, sophisticated and globally integrated. A number of changes over the past century are discussed: (i) today, issuance is largely by private entities whereas it was dominated by government-owned corporations historically; (ii) the issuer base has shifted from being mostly non-financial corporations towards banks; (iii) a wide range of entities are now able to tap the bond market; (iv) Australian corporations now raise a large share of funds offshore; and (v) the investor base has shifted away from direct holdings by households towards indirect holdings through superannuation/managed funds and holdings by non-residents. These developments have largely been due to: the evolution of the structure of the Australian economy; privatisations; and changes in the regulatory landscape, particularly the deregulation of the banking system in the 1980s, and the floating of the exchange rate and abolition of capital controls in 1983.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N27|Political centralization in pre-colonial Africa|In this paper we investigate the empirical correlates of political centralization using data from the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample. We specifically investigate the explanatory power of the standard models of Eurasian state formation which emphasize the importance of high population density, inter-state warfare and trade as factors leading to political centralization. We find that while in the whole world sample these factors are indeed positively correlated with political centralization, this is not so in the African sub-sample. Indeed, none of the variables are statistically related to political centralization. We also provide evidence that political centralization, where it took place, was indeed associated with better public goods and development outcomes. We conclude that the evidence is quite consistent with the intellectual tradition initiated in social anthropology by Evans-Pritchard and Fortes in the 1940s which denied the utility of Eurasian models in explaining patterns of political centralization in Africa.
N27|Usage of Financial Services in South Africa: Perceptions Matter|This study investigates the access to and usage of financial services in South Africa. Financial services are categorised in three types namely; general accounts and services, investment/savings and insurance/assurance. Taking into account the interactions between usage of different types of financial services, we use multivariate simultaneous probit specification to examine the effect of financial perception. Our results suggests that after controlling for endogeneity of choices and a range of control variables, financial perceptions are robust determinant of access to financial services. The impact of financial perception however reduces and gradually disappears as one moves up the financial access ladder towards more advanced financial products and services. In a policy context, targeting demand-side factors to increase access to and use of financial services is advisable. This targeting however can only be successful if it is tuned to specific basic financial services and products.
N27|Chiefs: Elite Control of Civil Society and Economic Development in Sierra Leone|"The lowest level of government in sub-Saharan Africa is often a cadre of chiefs who raise taxes, control the judicial system and allocate the most important scarce resource - land. Chiefs, empowered by colonial indirect rule, are often accused of using their power despotically and inhibiting rural development. Yet others view them as traditional representatives of rural people, and survey evidence suggests that they maintain widespread support. We use the colonial history of Sierra Leone to investigate the relationships between chiefs' power on economic development, peoples' attitudes and social capital. There, a chief must come from one of the ruling families recognized by British colonial authorities. Chiefs face less competition and fewer political constraints in chiefdoms with fewer ruling families. We show that places with fewer ruling families have significantly worse development outcomes today - in particular, lower rates of educational attainment, child health, and non-agricultural employment. But the institutions of chiefs' authority are also highly respected among villagers, and their chiefdoms have higher levels of ""social capital,"" for example, greater popular participation in a variety of ""civil society"" organizations and forums that might be used to hold chiefs accountable. We argue that these results are difficult to reconcile with the standard principle-agent approach to politics and instead reflect the capture of civil society organizations by chiefs. Rather than acting as a vehicle for disciplining chiefs, these organizations have been structured by chiefs to control society."
N27|Micro Small-sized Enterprises and Bank Credit|Micro small-sized enterprises play a vital role in poverty reduction and development of many developing countries. Yet the issue of credit availability to small firms continues to be a major problem which impedes the growth of micro-small enterprises. This article examines the factors influencing the extension of bank credit to micro small-sized enterprises based on a sample of 572 in Ghana and Nigeria. The results indicate that size of the firm, age of the firm, ownership type and relationship banking have a positive bearing on a decision to extend credit to small firms in West Africa.

N27|Agrarian income distribution, land ownership systems, and economic performance: Settler economies during the first globalization|The aim of this paper is to explain the impact of the establishment of the system of landownership on the income distribution and economic growth of settler economies (Argentina, Australia, New Zealand and Uruguay) during the First Globalization. We consider a conceptual framework based on the New Institutional Economic Theory to describe the process of the distribution of the land property rights in historical perspective and to analyze the characteristics of the land tenure system in a comparative perspective. Our results identify two models of distribution of property rights within the “club”. One of them corresponds to Australasia and, the other, to the River Plate countries, and they represented different consequences in terms of productive expansion and inequality. The land rents absorb a much larger part of total output in River Plate than in Australasia and, as result, it represents a negative incentive to productivity growth that contributes to explain the relative failure of Argentina and Uruguay compared to Australia and New Zealand.
N27|The evolution of inequality in Australasia and the River Plate, 1870-1914|In the last ten years, economic historians have become increasingly interested in the effects of the first globalisation (1870 – 1914) on income distribution. It is thought that in regions of European settlement, with abundant land and a scarcity of workers, inequality increased over the period. However, countries like Argentina, Australia, New Zealand and Uruguay not only received immigrants from Europe but also expanded their national frontiers. These countries underwent changing endowments of these factors (population and land) during the first globalization, and this calls for an analysis of the evolution of inequality considering the specific impacts of these contradictory trends. The aim of this article is to present evidence about the evolution of the wage/rental ratio in four provinces in Argentina (Buenos Aires, Córdoba, Entre Ríos and Santa Fé) and four states in Australia (Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia) during the first globalisation of capitalism. We compare these trends with those in two small countries, New Zealand and Uruguay. We also analyse the processes of frontier expansion in each case with a focus on the institutions that regulated the distribution of land ownership rights. The evidence from this approach, which is centred on frontier expansion and domestic institutions, indicates that increasing inequality was the dominant trend in some cases but not all. We also found that, in the context of the first globalisation, domestic institutions contributed to the formation of income distribution patterns that were different in Australasia to those in the River Plate countries.
N27|Husbands and Wives. The powers and perils of participation in a microfinance cooperative for female entrepreneurs|This study on female entrepreneurs in Western Uganda provides empirical evidence on the socio-economic effects of participation in a microfinance cooperative of both the female entrepreneur and her husband. Participation by female entrepreneurs in a microfinance cooperative is not an unconditional blessing: even though it does deliver higher household incomes, it might also deteriorate the femaleâ€™s household decision-making power when her husband participates in the same self-help group of the microfinance cooperative. This offers new insights for development policy and for entrepreneurship scholars to study the bright and dark sides of microfinance.
N27|Trade and Geography in the Origins and Spread of Islam|In this study we explore the historical determinants of contemporary Muslim representation. Motivated by a plethora of case studies and historical accounts among Islamicists stressing the role of trade for the adoption of Islam, we construct detailed data on pre-Islamic trade routes, harbors, and ports to determine the empirical regularity of this argument. Our analysis—conducted across countries and across ethnic groups within countries—establishes that proximity to the pre-600 CE trade network is a robust predictor of today's Muslim adherence in the Old World. We also show that Islam spread successfully in regions that are ecologically similar to the birthplace of the religion, the Arabian Peninsula. Namely, territories characterized by a large share of arid and semi- arid regions dotted with few pockets of fertile land are more likely to host Muslim communities. We discuss the various mechanisms that may give rise to the observed pattern.
N27|An analysis of intraday market behaviour before takeover announcements|The objective of this study was to analyse the changes in the intraday market microstructure behaviour before a takeover announcement for a sample of target, bidder and control (non-target) companies. Under the hypothesis that agents with asymmetric information were operating in the market, the Autoregressive Conditional Duration (ACD) model was used to estimate the joint impact of duration and microstructure variables on the returns volatility in the months before the event. The analysis was conducted on tick-by-tick data over a period of six to four months, and then three months before an announcement date. Our results suggested that the effect of information on the returns volatility, as measured by several economic and intraday microstructure observable variables, was different between target, bidder and non-target companies leading up to the takeover announcement. These variables were durations between trades, the surprise in durations, spreads and trading volumes. It was concluded that the intraday trading behaviour for takeover targets was affected by traders who held private information (especially the bidders) at least three months before the official announcement of the offer. The selected stocks were traded on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) and were sourced between 2004 and 2008 from a wide range of industries and with different levels of liquidity.
N27|The contrasting effects of board composition and structure on IPO firm underpricing in a developing context|This study investigates the impact of board governance features and the presence of foreign, indigenous high society executives and board diversity on levels of IPO underpricing in a unique sample of 62 Initial Primary Offerings (IPOs) from across Sub Saharan African (SSA), excluding South Africa. I find evidence that greater numbers of foreign executives increase underpricing while higher numbers of indigenous high society directors have an opposing effect. Increasing board ethnic and nationality diversity together with the establishment of nominally independent board monitoring and oversight committees are associated with higher underpricing implying that standard international governance best practice is inappropriate in a developing region dominated by narrow political economies underscored by underdeveloped formal institutions with minimal investor protection.
N27|Moving Forward in African Economic History. Bridging the Gap Between Methods and Sources|The field of African economic history is in resurgence. This paper reviews recent and on-going research contributions and notes strengths in their wide methodological, conceptual and topical variety. In these strengths there is also a challenge: different methodological approaches may also result in divisions, particularly on the quantitative versus qualitative axis. The African Economic History Network has recently been formed to bridge the gap between methods and sources and to facilitate intellectual exchanges among the widest possible range of scholars working on Sub-Saharan economic history. This paper outlines current research projects and calls for future research as well as suggesting promising lines of enquiry in the discipline.
N27|Future challenges in measuring Africa’s past: Lessons from estimating GDP for the Gold Coast, 1891-1954|There has been a recent surge in research on long term African development. For this research agenda to be fruitful and its theories, it is crucial to have consistent estimates of economic change. This paper contributes with a new GDP time series for Ghana, 1891-1954. The series implies a sustained period of economic expansion from the late 19th century into the 1960s. This suggests a revision of some prevalent truths about the history of economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa. The paper discusses the potential of creating historical national accounts for other African economies across the colonial and post-colonial period.
N27|Slavery, Statehood and Economic Development in Sub-Saharan Africa|This paper addresses the long-term impact of Sub-Saharan Africa’s indigenous systems of slavery on its political and economic development, based on an analytical survey of the literature and data collected from anthropological records. We develop a theory to account for this based on the framework proposed by North et al. (2009), where indigenous slavery may have impeded the transition from a ‘limited access state’ centred around personal relations to an ‘open access state’ based on impersonal rule of law and widely shared access to public and private organisations. In a quantitative analysis we find that indigenous slavery is robustly and negatively associated with the quality of governance and with current income levels.

N27|Financial Development and Economic Growth in Africa: Lessons and Prospects|This paper examines financial institutions within Africa if they are well positioned to assist the continent out of poverty with their growth prone capability. The study uses dynamic panel with variables as described by King & Levine (1993) and observed bi-directional relationship between finance and growth. Proxy for trade was not significant while evidences point to poor credit allocation to the private sector. The research also supports non-inclusion of money outside bank coffers in the King & Levine (1993) paper. The study covers 1970 to 2005 for about thirty-one African countries.
N27|Trade and Geography in the Origins and Spread of Islam|This research examines the economic origins and spread of Islam in the Old World and uncovers two empirical regularities. First, Muslim countries and ethnic groups exhibit highly unequal regional agricultural endowments. Second, Muslim adherence is systematically higher along the pre-Islamic trade routes. We discuss the possible mechanisms that may give rise to the observed pattern and provide a simple theoretical argument that highlights the interplay between an unequal geography and proximity to lucrative trade routes. We argue that these elements exacerbated inequalities across diverse tribal societies producing a conflictual environment that had the potential to disrupt trade flows. Any credible movement attempting to centralize these heterogeneous populations had to offer moral and economic rules addressing the underlying economic inequalities. Islam was such a movement. In line with this conjecture, we utilize anthropological information on precolonial traits of African ethnicities and show that Muslim groups have distinct economic, political, and societal arrangements featuring a subsistence pattern skewed towards animal husbandry, more equitable inheritance rules, and more politically centralized societies with a strong belief in a moralizing God.

N27|Financial Liberalisation and Financial Market Development: The Case of Tunisia|Financial systems in developing countries are generally characterized by under-developed financial markets; they are dominated by commercial banks. This was the case of Tunisia, which, by adopting financial reforms, sought to make a dynamic financial market in order to insure a transition from credit to market economy. In this context, it appears useful to evaluate and quantify the impact of the adopted reforms on the development of Tunisian financial market. Studies that have tried to explore this subject are generally rare. They have all resorted to compare some indicators of financial market development before and after the introduction of reforms. Within the framework of this paper, we suggest using intervention models in order to quantify (measure) the importance and the nature (transitory or permanent) of the effects of each adopted reform.

N27|A nationalization of a bank of issue carried out in a soft way: the case of the establishment of the Bank of Ethiopia|The Bank of Abyssinia, a private financial institution established in 1905 in Cairo under Egyptian Law, was given a 50-years concession for carrying out banking activity in Ethiopia by the Emperor Menelek II. This institution was engaged in issuing notes as well as in any kind of commercial banking business. The Emperor Haile Sellassie, after acceding to the throne in 1930, could not accept that the only country’s issuing bank was a foreign-owned share company and decided for nationalization. The institutional change was implemented, however, in a soft way, providing an adequate compensation to shareholders, and in agreement with the main foreign shareholder, the National Bank of Egypt. The Bank of Abyssinia went, therefore, into liquidation and a new institution, the Bank of Ethiopia, was established in 1931. The new bank, although under full Government control, retained management, staff, premises, clients and activity of the ceased financial institution. Italian occupation of the country, in 1936, brought the liquidation of the Bank of Ethiopia.
N27|Comovements and Causality of Sector Price Indices: Evidence from the Egyptian Stock Exchange|Contributing to the meagre published literature on interrelationships amongst stock market sectors of an economy, the present study sets out to examine both the long-run and short-run aspects of the inter-sectoral linkages in the Egyptian stock market. The data correspond to daily closing prices for twelve sectoral indices of the Egyptian stock market, covering the period between January 3, 2007 and January 18, 2010. The multivariate cointegration analysis reports evidence in support of existence of only a single cointegrating vector within the sectoral indices. Moreover, the results of Granger’s causality analysis show that the short-run causal relationships between the sectoral indices are considerably limited and, where they exist, virtually unidirectional. In general, these results lead to the conclusion that there is still room to derive benefits from portfolio diversification in the short run. However, investors with long-term horizon may not benefit from diversifying investments into the different sectors of the Egyptian stock market.
N27|Slaves as capital investment in the Dutch Cape Colony, 1652-1795|The Cape Colony of the eighteenth century was one of the most prosperous regions in the world. This paper shows that Cape farmers prospered, on average, because of the economies of scale and scope achieved through slavery. Slaves allowed farmers to specialise in agricultural products that were in high demand from the passing ships – notably, wheat, wine and meat – and the by-products from these products, such as tallow, skins, soap and candles. In exchange, farmers could import cheap manufactured products from Europe and the East. Secondly, the paper investigates why the relative affluence of the early settlers did not evolve into a high growth trajectory. The use of slaves as a substitute for wage labour or other capital investments allowed farmers to prosper, but it also resulted in severe inequality. It was this high inequality that drove the growth-debilitating institutions posited by Engerman and Sokoloff (2000). The immigration of Europeans was discouraged after 1717, and again during the middle of the century, while education was limited to the wealthy. Factor endowments interacted with institutions to create a highly unequal early South African society, with long-term development consequences.
N27|From Great Depression to Great Credit Crisis: similarities, differences and lessons|" ""The Great Depression of the 1930s and the Great Credit Crisis of the 2000s had similar causes but elicited strikingly different policy responses. While it remains too early to assess the effectiveness of current policy, it is possible to analyse monetary and fiscal responses in the 1930s as a natural experiment or counterfactual capable of shedding light on the impact of current policies. We employ vector autoregressions, instrumental variables, and qualitative evidence for 27 countries in the period 1925-39. The results suggest that monetary and fiscal stimulus was effective -- that where it did not make a difference it was not tried. They shed light on the debate over fiscal multipliers in episodes of financial crisis. They are consistent with multipliers at the higher end of those estimated in the recent literature, and with the argument that the impact of fiscal stimulus will be greater when banking systems are dysfunctional and monetary policy is constrained by the zero bound.""

N27|The Equity Premium And Risk‐Free Rate Puzzles In A Turbulent Economy: Evidence From 105 Years Of Data From South Africa|This paper presents a detailed empirical examination of the South African equity premium, and a quantitative theoretic exercise to test the canonical inter‐temporal consumption‐based asset‐pricing model under power utility. Over the long run, the South African stock market produced average returns six to eight percentage points above bonds and cash, and at the 20‐year horizon, an investor would not have experienced a single negative realised equity premium over the entire 105‐year period we examine. Yet the maximum equity premium rationalised by the consumption‐based model is 0.4%. The canonical macro‐financial model closely matches the average risk‐free rate, using realistic parameters for the coefficient of risk aversion and a positive rate of time preference.
N27|Banking in the Portuguese Colonial Empire (1864-1975)|This paper provides a general view of the evolution of banking in the Portuguese Colonial Empire between the founding of the first Portuguese colonial bank in 1864 and the independence of most Portuguese colonies in 1975. The text summarizes the legal background, presents the banks existing during that period, examines their businesses and discusses their contribution to the economic evolution of the territories under consideration. As the paper’s main conclusions, it may be said that: (i) Portuguese colonial banking followed the continental model of government initiative and tight control, not the British model of private initiative without much government control; (ii) the development of Portuguese colonial banking was always mainly a matter of profiting from the opportunities afforded by economic evolution rather than a matter of autonomously fostering the economic development of the territories.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N27|Monetary developments and decolonization in Ethiopia|The article analyses the reorganization process of the monetary setting in Ethiopia started in 1941 along with decolonization, when the Italian colonial rule came to an end. The country regained independence and the former Ethiopian empire was restored. The monetary reform in Ethiopia after liberation during World War II was a necessary measure to be adopted. Different paths however could have been followed at that moment by the Ethiopian government. The crucial choice made in money matter was to re-establish a national monetary unit instead of keeping the country inside the East African shilling area, as it was envisaged in British designs for the post-war setting of the Horn of Africa. The Ethiopian project unpredictably prevailed at the end of a weary negotiation, thanks chiefly to American support in the framework of a new role gained by the United States in this area. The Ethiopian Authorities were, as a consequence, enabled to free themselves from dependence on Great Britain and this event marked a crucial step in the advancement of the decolonisation proce
N27|Private equity and venture capital in South Africa: A comparison of project financing decisions|This paper investigates the manner in which private equity and venture capital firms in South Africa assess investment opportunities. The analysis was facilitated using a survey containing both Likert-scale and open-ended questions. The key findings show that both private equity and venture capital firms rate the entrepreneur or management team more highly above any other criterion or consideration. Private equity firms, however, also place emphasis on financial criteria more than venture capitalists. There is also an observable shift in the investment activities away from start-up funding and towards later-stage deals. Risk appetite has also declined post the financial crisis.
N27|Subjective Well-Being of China’s Off-Farm Migrants|Existing research applying the Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI) in China is restricted to urban and rural samples. There are no studies for Chinese off-farm migrants. The specific aims of this study are (a) ascertain whether Chinese off-farm are satisfied with their lives; (b) investigate the equivalence of the PWI in terms of its psychometric properties; and (c) examine whether the responses to the PWI from participants falls within the narrow range predicted by the 'Theory of Subjective Wellbeing Homeostasis???. The PWI demonstrated good psychometric performance in terms of its reliability, validity and sensibility and was consistent with previous studies for Western and non-Western samples. The data revealed a moderate level of subjective well-being (PWI score = 62.6). While Chinese off-farm migrants lead hard lives, the PWI was within the normative range predicted for Chinese societies by the 'Theory of Subjective Wellbeing Homeostasis'. A likely explanation for this finding rests with the circular nature of migration in China. When China's offfarm migrants find it too difficult to cope in the cities, most have the fallback position that they can return to their homes in the countryside. This option provides an external buffer to minimize the inherent challenges of life which would otherwise impinge on the life satisfaction of China's off-farm migrants.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

The PWI demonstrated good psychometric properties and was consistent with previous studies for Western and non-Western samples. The data revealed a moderate level of subjective well-being (PWI score = 61.1). While Beijing taxi drivers work long hours for low wages, the PWI was nonetheless within the normative range predicted for Chinese societies by the ???Theory of Subjective Wellbeing Homeostasis???. The results suggest that the homeostatic mechanism is fairly resilient, even when the individual leads a hard life based on objective indicators. For Beijing taxi drivers, it may be that personal relationships and feeling part of the community acts as an important buffer for the homeostatic system.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

The data indicated a moderate level of personal well-being (PWI score = 67.1). The PWI demonstrated good psychometric performance in terms of its reliability, validity and sensitivity, consistent with previous published studies. The PWI was within the normative range for non-Western countries and was within the narrow band predicted by the ???Theory of Subjective Wellbeing Homeostasis???.

N27|Management Of Stock Price And Its Effect On Economic Growth: Case Study Of West African Financial Markets|This paper investigates the statistical properties of stock returns in the West African regional stock market and the link between the West African regional stock market and economic growth. To examine the nature of the distribution of West African regional stock returns, the daily closing prices of the two stock index of West African regional stock market, and eighteen of it subâ€“indices were utilized. Nine years data from 1998 to 2007 interval were employed. The analysis of our study shows that the distribution of the West African regional stock market returns is nonâ€“normal and nonâ€“i.i.d (independent, identically and normally distributed). The linear and nonâ€“linear dependencies in the returns appeared to be the main reasons for the data being nonâ€“i.i.d. The study also demonstrates the presence of the dayâ€“ofâ€“theâ€“week effect in West African regional stock market.
N27|Human Capital In Africa: Technical Change, Efficiency And Productivity|The aim of this paper is to analyze the importance of human capital on productivity growth for 26 African countries over the period 1976-1996. To estimate productivity change, the Malmquist total factor productivity (TFP) growth index is computed. This index is then decomposed into technical change and efficiency change. In general, human capital is found to exert a positive effect on technical change and productivity change while efficiency change is left unaffected. Additionally, higher technical inefficiency tends to lead to lower the rate of innovation.
N27|Excess co-movement in asset prices: The case of South Africa|The paper investigates excess co-movement in asset prices in South Africa between 1995 and 2005 using the definition of excess comovement as correlation between two asset prices beyond what could be explained by key economic fundamentals. The results of the study suggest that there is excess co-movement between returns on equities and bonds in South Africa. The findings suggest that there are considerable noise traders on the financial market in South Africa. The result of this behaviour would be the tendency for the equity and bond prices to move together more than would be predicted by their shared fundamentals. These results are consistent with the possibility that a fad or crowd psychology plays a role in the volatility on the market for the two asset classes.
N27|Early-stage venture capital in South Africa: Challenges and prospects|The aim of this paper is to assess which factors impact the development of early-stage venture capital in South Africa. Factors identified for other markets and countries are explored and their relative importance in South Africa determined from the perspective of market participants. These include venture capital and private equity fund managers, government institutions, intermediaries and university research coordinators. The study used both an online survey, to capture a broad representation of opinion, and interviews, for in-depth responses. There was broad consensus among respondents with regards to the key factors requiring attention, which include the lack of funds targeted at early-stage investments, the lack of specialised fund managers, and the low entrepreneurial skillsets in the country. Through a detailed analysis of the responses, certain measures are proposed that can enhance the development of early-stage venture capital in South Africa such as engaging more with angel investors and improving the cooperation between the different market players in the sector.
N27|Promoting Financial Inclusion in Africa: The Two Ambiguities|This paper reviews the African experience in fostering financial inclusion. It examines two aspects of financial inclusion—access by enterprises and households to affordable and appropriate formal financial services and the actual usage of financial services and products, how this has been helped with financial deepening. Empirical evidence does not point to a clear, definite relationship between financial deepening and access to affordable financial services or usage of financial services. This underscores the importance of paying attention to all dimensions of financial inclusions and innovations that meet the firms and households’ needs. Financial inclusion is part of the solution to the serious problem of financial access/usage gaps that exist in many African countries, but not of itself a panacea.
N27|Bank Branch Location: a Count Analysis| Abstract This study undertakes an analysis of the association between socio-economic variables and the spatial distribution of bank branches in South Africa. To analyse retail bank branch location, parametric Poisson, negative binomial, Poisson-hurdle, and finite-mixture count models that accommodate unobserved heterogeneity have been estimated with a data set of bank branches in municipalities in South Africa. The key finding is that aggregate income in a municipal area is a statistically significant determinant of the number of bank branches. The results also suggest that the four core banks tend to cluster their branches in the same areas—suggesting the possibility of oligopolistic collusion. A more recent entrant locates its urban branches slightly away from the cluster and in some areas where the core banks have no presence. In addition, several socio-economic variables, some of which are unique to South Africa, do not appear to affect branch location. Situation des filiales de banques: une analyse à comptage RÉSUMÉ La présente étude entreprend une analyse de l'association entre des variables socio-économiques et la répartition de filiales de banques en République Sud Africaine. Pour analyser l'emplacement des filiales du secteur de la banque de détail, on a évalué des modèles de comptage de Poisson, de probabilités binomiales négatives, au taux étalon de Poisson, et aux mélanges finis, qui tiennent compte de l'hétérogénéité non observée au moyen d'un ensemble de données de filiales de banques dans des municipalités en Afrique du Sud. La principale conclusion est que le revenu total dans une zone municipale est un déterminant significatif statistiquement du nombre de filiales de banques. Les résultats semblent également indiquer que les quatre principales banques ont tendance à grouper leurs filiales dans les mêmes régions, ce qui semblerait indiquer la possibilité d'une collusion oligopolistique. Une banque arrivée plus récemment a réparti ses filiales légèrement hors de ce groupement, où les principales banques ne sont pas représentées. En outre, plusieurs variables socio-économiques, certaines desquelles sont particulières à l'Afrique du Sud, ne semblent pas affecter l'emplacement des filiales. Ubicación de sucursales bancarias: un análisis de recuento RÉSUMÉN Este estudio realiza un análisis de la asociación entre las variables socioeconómicas y la distribución espacial de sucursales bancarias en Sudáfrica. Para analizar la ubicación de sucursales de bancos minoristas, se han estimado modelos de recuento como el paramétrico de Poisson, binomial negativo, Poisson-hurdle (modelo en dos partes) y mezcla finita, que conllevan una heterogeneidad inadvertida, con un conjunto de datos de sucursales bancarias de municipalidades de Sudáfrica. El descubrimiento clave consiste en que los ingresos agregados en un área municipal representan un determinante estadísticamente significativo del número de sucursales bancarias. Los resultados también sugieren que los cuatro bancos principales tienden a agrupar sus sucursales en las mismas áreas, indicando la posibilidad de una colusión oligopolística. Un participante más reciente sitúa sus sucursales urbanas algo más alejadas del grupo, y en algunas áreas donde los bancos principales no están presentes. Asimismo, ciertas variables socioeconómicas, algunas de las cuales son exclusivas de Sudáfrica, no parecen afectar a la ubicación de la sucursal.
N27|Consumer Credit In Australia During The 20th Century|This article surveys the growth of consumer credit in Australia during the 20th century, particularly after World War II. Until the 1970s, the regulation of Australia’s financial market caused formal consumer credit to be provided mainly by finance companies under hire-purchase contracts, largely for the purchase of cars and household durables. Deregulation of the financial market since the 1960s allowed banks to gain a dominant share in the market for personal loans. Quantification of long-term trends is difficult, but broad estimates suggest sustained growth in per capita indebtedness during 1945-2007.

N27|The re-establishment of the Ethiopia’s monetary and banking systems|The study is concerned with a crucial period of the banking history of Ethiopia, almost untouched so far by the specializing literature, in which the banking industry was affected by important changes. The paper describes and analyses the reconstruction process of the banking system and the reorganization of the monetary setting in Ethiopia started in 1941, when the Italian colonial rule came to an end and the country regained independence, during World War II. The terminal date of the study is the beginning of 1964, when a one-tier banking system, based on a state-owned financial institution, the State Bank of Ethiopia, gave way to a two-tiers banking system. The monetary banking reform in Ethiopia after liberation in 1941 was an event logical, inevitable and predictable. Different paths, however could had be followed at that moment. The choice in money matter was to establish a national monetary unit, the Ethiopian dollar, instead of keeping the country inside the East African shilling area. On the other hand, as far as concerns banking, it was opted for establishing a state-owned financial institution enjoying a monopolistic position in the credit market rather than for setting up a system of private banks, possibly expatriate.
N27|Factors influencing venture capitalists' project financing decisions in South Africa|This study explores and identifies the investment criteria used by South African venture capitalists in their venture screening and evaluation processes. Using a Likert scale type of questionnaire, South African venture capitalists (VCs)were asked to rate the investment criteria identified in similar studies abroad and to report any additional criteria of their own. By evaluating the mean ratings, it was found that South African VCs consider the entrepreneur’s honesty and integrity; a good expected market acceptance; and a high internal rate of return (IRR), to be the three most important criteria. The South African VCs, just like their overseas counterparts, regard management considerations to be the most important criteria group in the evaluation of new investment projects. The results of this study are deemed useful to both venture capitalists in their decision-making process and to entrepreneurs in their venture capital applications to maximise their success rate.

N27|L’East African Currency Board e la genesi dell’attività bancaria nell’Africa Orientale Britannica|THE CURRENCY BOARD AND THE RISE OF BANKING IN EAST AFRICA. The East Africa region consists today of three independent countries, Kenya, Tanzania (formerly Tanganyika) and Uganda, which, from the early 1920’s to the achievement of independence, formed an administrative unit under British rule: the British East Africa. The paper presents an historical synthesis of the basic problems and developments of the monetary and banking system in British East Africa. The research covers the period included between the beginning of European colonisation and the attainment of independence by the three above mentioned countries and focuses on the experience with a currency board arrangement in this context. A survey on commercial banking in the region, reveals that this industry, since its rise, carried the imprinting of the British banking tradition. In the first stage of monetary evolution, owing to the influence of Indian trade and settlement in East Africa, the currency most in use was undoubtedly the Indian rupee. In that period banking industry landed in East Africa, brought in by European colonial powers. The second stage in monetary evolution began when a currency board was established, in 1919, in the British colonial possessions of East Africa, just after the acquisition, as loot, of Tanganyika, a colony previously under German rule. Originally the area of Board’s operations, i. e. the East African shilling monetary area, consisted of the three mentioned territories. Zanzibar was added in 1936. During World War II were included, temporarily, in the area also Aden and British Somaliland and eventually the former Italian colonies of Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia. The start of activity by the E. A. Currency Board was not easy. In 1925, when the conversion of circulating rupees was completed, because of overvaluation of silver coins in the exchange rate adopted, the EA Currency Board suffered substantial losses and the reserve ratio was 43. 6 per cent. Yet the situation worsened with the crisis of the colonial economy during the depression of the 30’s, which caused a sharp decline in money supply in East Africa because of heavy redemption of local currency. In 1932 the lowest point was reached with the reserve ratio at only 9. 9 per cent. Circulation of EA shillings increased rapidly after 1940 because of war economy and of a favourable balance of payments of the colonies. In addition, a great enlargement of the original currency area was achieved following British military conquests in the Horn of Africa. In 1950 the circulation was fully covered by reserves, but during the previous decades the colonial currency was mainly based on government credit. However, it was not until 1956, that the fiduciary issue was officially introduced and, by this event, reasonable opportunities for monetary policy were offered. This innovation was introduced to free part of the external reserves held in London. Prior to that act the role of the Currency Board was just passive because the automatic exchange of currency did not allow any kind of money management. It represented a simple and inexpensive mechanism directed to issue currency. A long period of British rule came to an end when the colonial territories of East Africa obtained political independence and this dramatic change marked the epilogue of the story of the colonial monetary institution. The new emerging states would not accept to renounce monetary sovereignty. Therefore the liquidation of East African Currency Board was decided and the establishment of three national central banks was officially announced simultaneously in June 1965 by the governments of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. The East African Currency Board ceased operations one year later.
N27|The efficient market hypothesis: Evidence from ten African stock markets|The paper investigates the weak-form efficiency of ten African stock markets using the runs test methodology for serial dependency. Returns are calculated using the adjusted trade-to-trade approach. Serious thin-trading was observed on all markets, and more so for Namibia and Botswana, the two markets with significant dual-listed stocks on the JSE. In many of the markets studied, a significant number of stocks rejected the random walk. Only three markets, Namibia, Kenya and Zimbabwe, were found to be relatively weak form efficient. The result for Namibia is attributed to its correlation with the JSE. Kenya and Zimbabwe are much older than most of the other markets studied. All the stocks in the Mauritian sample rejected the random walk at the 1% level of significance using the runs test and is thus said to be weak form inefficient. The same conclusion is reached for Ghana, the BRVM, Egypt and Botswana. Thus the possibility of profiting by trading on historical prices could not be entirely ruled out.
N27|Quinze ans de restructuration bancaire dans la CEMAC : qu’avons-nous appris ?|[fre] Les pays de la Communauté économique et monétaire de l’Afrique centrale (CEMAC) ont connu, à partir du début des années 1980, une grave crise économique. Les conséquences de celle-ci se sont traduites, sur le secteur bancaire, par une dégradation rapide et brutale du portefeuille des banques. En réponse à cette crise, les autorités monétaires, avec l’appui de la communauté financière internationale ont engagé une politique de restructuration bancaire. Cette politique avait pour objectif d’assurer un retour à la stabilité bancaire en améliorant les circuits de financement. L’objectif de cet article est de montrer, après avoir présenté les différentes réformes qui ont été mises en oeuvre, que les restructurations bancaires, au lieu d’assurer le financement de l’économie, ont plutôt conduit à des paradoxes dont trois sont particulièrement développés. Il s’agit de : la surliquidité et le rationnement du crédit ; la concentration bancaire et le développement de la microfinance et enfin l’internationalisation bancaire sans développement des innovations financières. . Classification JEL : G21, G34, N27 [eng] Fifteen years of banking restructuring in CEMAC : what have we learnt ? . Member countries of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) experienced a severe economic crisis since the 80’ s. As a consequence of this prolonged crisis, the portfolio of commercial banks dramatically deteriorated, therefore pushing monetary authorities and international community to envisage a restructuring strategy for the banking sector. The aim of this strategy was to stabilize the banking sector by improving financing channels and mechanisms. In this paper we show that the reforms implemented to restructure the banking sector, far from having improved financing mechanisms, have led to the emergence of three paradoxes : excessive liquidity of the system coupled with credit rationing, banking concentration and contemporaneous development of microfinance structures and foreign penetration in the banking sector without development of financial innovations. .

N27|Management disclosure bias and audit services|This paper considers the level of bias observed in management disclosures of earnings forecasts and historic earnings data in Australian prospectuses. Management forecasts and naïve forecasts derived from managements’ normalised historic data are analysed. A key focus is upon the possible association between such forecast bias and differential audit services performed upon the data. Audit firm size and level of engagement are modelled against bias. The full sample revealed no overestimation bias for any of the forecast models, but underestimation was observed for elements of the management and random walk naïve forecasts. Cross-sectionally, a significant association was observed between forecast bias and audit firm size across all three forecast models. Specifically, the audit firm size variable (Non Big-5/Big-5) was inversely associated with the extent to which forecasted and normalised historic earnings data were upwardly biased. On the other hand, the level of engagement was not a significant discriminator for forecast bias. These outcomes are contrasted against others reported elsewhere in the literature and suggest a risk in generalising across contexts. The findings imply a level of ‘disclosure management’ regarding company IPO forecasts and normalised historic accounting data, with forecast overestimation and error size more extreme when the monitoring expertise and/or reputation of auditors is lower (JEL D80, G14, M41, N27).

N27|Historical Development of Money and Banking in Eritrea from the Axumite Kingdom to the Present|The development of money is an abstract of the history of civilization. Financial institutions encourage saving habit among the people by receiving deposits from the public in various forms. The Axumite kings were the first to mint coins in the African Continent. The aim of this paper is to explore the lessons learned from the different historical developments in the country and the region. The paper discusses the origin of banking system in Eritrea. It highlights the historical evolution and growth of money and banking in Eritrea during the Axumite, Italian, and the British, Ethiopian periods. It also provides the chronological development of money and banking from historical times to the post-independent Eritrea. It also deals with the existing banking institutions in the country. The paper makes an extensive use of related literature in enlightening the money and banking system in Eritrea during the historical period. It ends with summary and concluding remarks.
N27|Access to credit by the poor in South Africa: Evidence from Household Survey Data 1995 and 2000|This study specifically investigated the factors that influenced access by the poor and Blacks to credit in the segmented financial sector in South Africa, using income and expenditure survey data from 1995 and 2000. The study sheds light on the extent of financial sector deepening through household participation especially among the poor and Blacks, in the context of the fight against poverty. In this study, three types of credit were identified. Formal credit was defined to include debts from commercial banks (including mortgage finance and car loans), semi-formal credit included consumption credit (for household assets such as furniture and open accounts in retail stores), and informal credit specifically referred to debts from relatives and friends.Multinomial logit models and Heckman probit models with sample selection were used for analytical work. The results suggest that the poor and Blacks have limited access to the formal and semi-formal financial sectors. At the national level, access to bank credit is positively and significantly influenced by age, being male, household size, education level, household per capita expenditure and race (being Coloured, Indian or White). Being poor has a negative and significant effect on formal credit access. Semi-formal credit access is positively and significantly influenced by household size, per capita expenditure, provincial location (Eastern Cape, Northern Cape, Free State and North West) and being Coloured. The negative and significant factors in determining access to semi-formal credit include being male, rural location, being poor and being White. Informal credit access is negatively and significantly influenced by education level and race (being Coloured or White). Among the poor, access to bank credit is positively and significantly influenced by being male, provincial location (Western Cape, Gauteng and Mpumalanga) and being Coloured. Access to semi-formal credit is positively and significantly determined by household per capita expenditure, provincial location (Western Cape, Northern Cape, North West and Gauteng) and being Indian. Access to informal credit by the poor is positively and significantly influenced by provincial location (Kwazulu Natal and Gauteng). Within the black population, access to bank credit is positively and significantly influenced by age, being male, household per capita expenditure and education level. Semi-formal credit access by Blacks is positively and significantly influenced by household size, household per capita expenditure, education level and provincial location (Eastern Cape, Northern Cape, Free State and North West). However being male, poor and located in a rural area negatively affected access to semi-formal credit by Blacks. Informal credit access by Blacks is negatively influenced by education level, but positively influenced by being located in the Western and Eastern Cape. These findings confirm that improving access to organized credit markets (i.e formal and semi-formal credit markets) by the poor and Blacks, remains important in the fight against poverty.
N27|The Evolution of Enterprise Reform in Africa: From State-owned Enterprises to Private Participation in Infrastructure — and Back?|Many African state-owned enterprises (SOEs), particularly those in infrastructure, have a long history of poor performance. From the outset, SOE financial and economic performance generally failed to meet the expectations of their creators and funders. By the late 1970s, the situation was alarming, and by early 1980s, critical. The poor financial performance of SOEs became so burdensome to government budgets that it attracted the attention of the international financial institutions, or IFIs. In response, in the 1980s, the World Bank approved SOE reforms that could be summed up in the term “commercialization”. By the mid-1990s, however, the idea of making SOEs function efficiently and effectively under government management was largely abandoned by the IFIs and privatization and private participation in infrastructure, or PPI became the order of the day. Once more, however, the results were disappointing. PPI has not been as widely adopted as anticipated, nor has it generated the massive resources and changes hoped for, nor has it been widely accepted as beneficial by the African public. The findings of recent studies in Africa suggest that PPI should not be jettisoned, and that the more productive path is to recognize the limitations of the approach, and to work harder at creating the conditions needed to make it function effectively. This will entail, as many have recognized, an end to the view that public and private infrastructure provision is a dichotomy – a case of either-or, one or the other – and a better appreciation of the extent to which the performance of each is dependent on the competence of the other. In other words, for the private sector to perform well, public sector capacity must be enhanced. Moreover, proposed tactics of reform should fit more closely with the expectations and sentiments of the affected government, consumer base, and general population. This broader approach implies, probably, a reduction in the scope and, certainly, a reduction in the planned speed of operations. Improving infrastructure performance is a long-term matter.
N27|Privatization in Africa: What has happened? What is to be done?|Sub-Saharan African states urgently need expanded and more dynamic private sectors, more efficient and effective infrastructure/utility provision, and increased investment from both domestic and foreign sources. Privatization is one way to address these problems. But African states have generally been slow and reluctant privatizers; a good percentage of industrial/manufacturing and most infrastructure still remains in state hands. Given prevailing public hostility towards privatization, and widespread institutional weaknesses, such caution is defensible, but nonetheless very costly. The long-run and difficult solution is the creation and reinforcement of the institutions that underpin and guide proper market operations. In the interim, African governments and donors have little choice but to continue to experiment with the use of externally supplied substitutes for gaps in local regulatory and legal systems.
N27|African Monetary Unions - Dominated by the North? On the Relevance of Rational Economic Reasoning Under African Conditions|ABSTRACT & RÉSUMÉ: - Monetary coordination is high on the agenda of different regional organizations in Africa. Economic benefits of a common currency, like lower transaction cost, increased macroeconomic stability, or the shielding of central banks against political pressure from nationalist elites and their inclination for excessive spending are undoubtedly expected. But the most important underlying aim of monetary integration in Africa is derived from its history, particularly the legacy of the slave trade and colonialism, and the subsequent strive for pan-African ideals, which has become manifest in the promotion of African unity in a crisis prone continent. However, whether it is feasible to achieve this ambitious political aim with economic means of regional economic and monetary cooperation, is open to question. Experts and the international donor community periodically caution about diverting attention from the most pressing needs of African countries by pursuing over-ambitious monetary policies. African governments should get the priorities right, i.e. they ought to implement first sustainable solutions to the problems of crisis resolution and prevention, the fight against corruption and rent-seeking elites, in order to promote good governance, transparency and accountability. The realities of African economies suggest that the grand new projects of monetary unions are unlikely to succeed. In addition, it is questionable whether economic, result-orientated reasoning and the discussion of monetary concepts (e.g. that of the Optimum Currency Area or of the Original Sin), which might be duly applied to Western or Latin American societies, have the same relevance in the African context.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- RÉSUMé: [Les unions monétaires - dominé par le Nord? La zone CFA et l'AMC - Sur la pertinence du raisonnement économique rationnel dans des conditions africaines] - La coordination monétaire est élevé sur l'ordre du jour des différentes organisations régionales en Afrique. Les avantages économiques d'une monnaie commune, comme un moindre coût de la transaction, l'augmentation de la stabilité macroéconomique, ou le blindage des banques centrales contre la pression politique des élites nationalistes et leur penchant pour les dépenses excessives sont sans aucun doute attendus. Mais l'objectif sous-jacent le plus important de l'intégration monétaire en Afrique est dérivé de son histoire, en particulier l'héritage de la traite des esclaves et le colonialisme, et la subséquente lutte pour les idéaux panafricains, qui est devenu manifeste dans la promotion de l'unité africaine. Cependant, si il est possible d'atteindre cet objectif politique ambitieux avec des moyens économiques de la coopération économique et monétaire régionale, est ouvert à la question. Les experts et la communauté internationale des donateurs en garde périodiquement de détourner l'attention des besoins les plus pressants des pays africains en poursuivant trop ambitieux politiques monétaires. Les gouvernements africains devraient obtenir les bonnes priorités, à savoir qu'ils doivent mettre en œuvre des solutions durables aux problèmes de la résolution des crises, la lutte contre la corruption et la recherche de rente par les élites, afin de promouvoir la bonne gouvernance, la transparence et la reddition de comptes. Les réalités des économies africaines suggèrent que les grands nouveaux projets de unions monétaires ont peu de chances de réussir. En outre, il est douteux que, un raisonnement économiste orienté vers les résultat et la discussion des concepts monétaires (par exemple celle de la zone monétaire optimale ou du Péché Originel), ce qui pourrait être dûment appliqué aux sociétés occidentales ou d'Amérique latine, ont la même pertinence dans le contexte africain.
N27|Effects of Neighborhood Characteristics on the Mortality of Black Male Youth: Evidence From Gautreaux|We analyze the effects of neighborhood characteristics on the mortality of black male youth in families relocated through the Gautreaux program, a residential mobility program implemented in Chicago in 1976. While we find significant evidence of neighborhood self-selection by families participating in Gautreaux, we nonetheless find evidence that certain placement neighborhood characteristics were associated with lower male youth mortality rates after controlling for household and origin neighborhood characteristics. Placement neighborhood characteristics related to human capital and work were more important predictors of male youth mortality than characteristics related to race, poverty, or family composition.
N27|Eritrea's early stages in monetary and banking development|Eritrea is listed among those countries of Africa, whose independence has been lately achieved. Notwithstanding the monetary and banking history of Eritrea goes back to the Italian colonial settlement on the Red Sea shore of 19th century. The paper offers an overview of the early stages of the Colony's monetary development up to mid-thirties and of the problems met in the substitution of Italian currency for the traditional money. A branch of the Bank of Italy was established in Asmara in 1914 and this event marked the first introduction of banking into the country. The Asmara branch was followed by branch offices of the Italian central bank in the four main centres of the Colony. The Bank of Italy was involved also in commercial banking and fulfilled the functions of banker and fiscal agent for the colonial government as well. Furthermore it worked to promote the creation of local banks and the take-off of the Eritrean banking system. Due attention is given to attempts of the colonial government to develop a suitable agricultural credit system in Eritrea and to the critical issues involved
N27|Central banking: back to the future|Most textbook models explain the operation of monetary policy in terms of how the central bank influences the market rate of interest by managing the supply of its liabilities relative to the demand for them. Yet some central banks no longer operate that way and, instead, set an interest rate for their own liabilities. This raises the question of how under that modus of operation the central bank's rate is transmitted to the financial markets. Another question concerns whether advances in information technology may erode the demand for central bank money and hence threaten the ability of central banks to implement monetary policy. There are, however, some simple answers to these conundrums. In an open and efficient inancial system, the central bank can determine the market rate of interest by standing in the market at its own rate, and rely on interest rate arbitrage to transmit that rate to the market. It follows that even if advances in information technology result in a diminished use of, and thus reduced demand for, a stock of central bank money, that need not undermine a central bank's capacity to implement monetary policy.
N27|A History of Last-resort Lending and Other Support for Troubled Financial Institutions in Australia|This paper surveys the history of last-resort lending and other support provided to financial institutions in Australia and compares the practical implementation of lender-of-last-resort policy with policy prescriptions derived from the theoretical literature. Last-resort support serves to counter the market failures that can see fundamentally sound financial institutions fail due to a lack of liquidity, and to protect the economy from the systemic costs of such failures. The provision of lender-of-last-resort support, however, creates moral hazard costs. During the nineteenth century, Australian colonial governments and banking industry groups provided support to troubled financial institutions in a variety of ways that reflected both the resources they could draw on and their ability to constrain moral hazard behaviour. Since 1900, Australia’s experience has been unusual by international standards: the central bank has rarely acted as a lender of last resort; and, despite this, virtually no Australian bank depositor has lost money. Direct loans were provided only twice: once as a last-resort loan and once to ease the exit of a failed bank. Instead, support has come in more indirect forms. Loans were provided to three banks in support of their efforts to provide funds to illiquid building societies. Most instances of disruptions to financial institutions’ access to liquidity, however, have been successfully staunched by the central bank’s issuance of reassuring public statements.
N27|The Predictability of Management Forecast Error: A Study of Australian IPO Disclosures|Contemporaneous evidence of corporate revenue and profit forecasting error is provided in a different institutional context, Australian sharemarket initial public offerings. This article extends the literature on company forecast risk by incorporating new proxies for forecasting error (float motive, subscription price premium, range of activities and internationalisation) and by refining others. The study investigates the association between earnings forecast risk and conventional ex-ante uncertainty proxies used to explain IPO underpricing. Ex-ante and ex-post explanatory variables are distinguished and a forecast error prediction model is tested. The results show revenue forecast errors were smaller and less sensitive than those for profit. Strong associations are reported between forecast error and float motive, audit quality and unanticipated industry activity. The link between earnings forecast error and proxies for initial public offering underpricing is observed. Predictability was poor regarding individual company forecast error, but improved for portfolio average forecasting error.
N27|Keynes and Australia|JM Keynes was more important to Australia than Australia was to him. Yet the connections are many and varied, and worthy of some attention. As has been said, ‘a survey of the rise and fall of Keynesian economics in Australia’ is ‘an important story which still has to be written’; but it ‘is the subject for at least three years arduous research’ (Groenewegen 1983). This paper is less ambitious. An exercise in economic, personal and political history and in the history of economic thought, it briefly outlines: 1. Keynes’s dealings with the Australian Prime Minister, William Morris Hughes, over the reparations demands against Germany after World War I; 2. some incidental economic issues; 3. Keynes’s opinions and influence on the handling of the Depression in Australia; 4. the early impact of Keynesian economics in Australia; and 5. Australia’s approach to the creation of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, of which Keynes was co-founder.
N27|The Historical Origin of African Debt and External Finance Problems|In this paper an attempt to address the historical origin of African external finance and debt problem is made. It will be argued that Africa's external finance problem is the result of the structure of its trade in the world economy in general and its place as a commodity producer in particular. This is compounded by the adverse effect of Northern (industrialized countries) macroeconomic policies. The whole purpose of this paper is to underline the existence of an economic structure, primarily built in the colonial era, which still continues to shape the external economic condition of countries in the continent.
N27|International Commodity Prices, Macroeconomic Performance and Politics in Sub-Saharan Africa|This study loods at the experience of Sub-Saharan Africa in dealing with commodity-price variability and discusses whether poor macroeconomic results should be attributed to the inherent difficulty of predicting commodity-price fluctuations, or, rather, to flawed internal political and fiscal arrangements. In an attempt to establish the facts and to cast light on some of the mechanisms, it examines pan-African econometric evidence on the effects of commodity-price fluctuations on national output and its components.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N27|The Information Content of a Convertible Debt Offer Announcement|We develop a model of convertible debt financing that combines issue and call decisions into a common framework. The model suggests a role for refinancing costs in a manager's efforts to signal firm productivity to investors by an appropriate choice of debt issue terms. A cross section of convertible debt offers can be divided into two groups: a high conversion ratio group and a low conversion ratio group. The model predicts that high conversion ratios are negatively correlated with offer announcement stock returns and low conversion ratios are uncorrelated with offer announcement stock returns. The model is tested on a sample of 124 convertible debt offer announcements. Test results support model accuracy. Copyright 1995 by Kluwer Academic Publishers

N27|Using the Error in Pre-Election Polls to Test for the Presence of Pork|Polls are used by politicians, voters, and businesspeople alike to form expectations over political outcomes. In an electoral system with pork' at the national level, local economic prospects will be a direct function of political support. Because every poll comes with its margin of error, we can exploit the error in sub-national polls to test for whether forward-looking investment in the economy adjusts to shocks in local political behavior. The covariance between the strength of this adjustment and local-level characteristics allows us to identify the locations in which strong pork' contracts exist. To illustrate the technique, we provide a theoretical foundation and an empirical exercise using data on Ugandan micro-entrepreneurs during the 2001 presidential election. We find evidence that investor behavior responds in a small but significant way to surprises in electoral support, and this responsiveness is strongest in core' electoral districts.
