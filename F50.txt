F50|Taxation,foreign aid and political governance in Africa|This study examines the hypothesis that foreign aid dilutes the positive role of taxation on political governance. The empirical evidence is based on the Generalised Method of Moments and 53 African countries for the period 1996-2010. For more policy options, the dataset is disaggregated into fundamental characteristics of African development based on income levels, legal origins, natural resources and landlockedness. While the hypothesis is invalid in baseline Africa, low income and English common law countries of the continent, the research cannot conclude on its validity for other fundamental characteristics of development. Policy implications, caveats and directions for future research are discussed.
F50|Foreign Aid Complementarities and Inclusive Human Development in Africa|This study complements existing literature by assessing how various types of foreign aid complement each other in boosting inclusive human development in Africa. (a) When â€˜aid to social infrastructureâ€™ is moderated with other aid types, â€˜action on debtsâ€™ is substitutive whereas â€˜aid to the production sectorâ€™, â€˜aid for program assistanceâ€™ and humanitarian assistance are complementary. (b) â€˜Aid to the production sectorâ€™ (â€˜action on debtâ€™) is complementary (substitutive) to â€˜aid for economic infrastructureâ€™. (c) Whereas â€˜action on debtâ€™ is a substitute to â€˜aid to the production sectorâ€™, â€˜aid for social infrastructureâ€™ and â€˜aid for economic infrastructureâ€™ are complementary. (d) â€˜Action on debtâ€™ is a substitute for â€˜aid to the multi-sectorâ€™. (e) While â€˜aid for social infrastructureâ€™ and â€˜action on debtâ€™ are substitutive to â€˜aid for program assistanceâ€™; humanitarian assistance is complementary. (f) The following are substitutes to â€˜action on debtâ€™: â€˜aid for economic infrastructureâ€™, â€˜aid to the production sectorâ€™, â€˜aid to the multi-sectorâ€™ and â€˜programme assistanceâ€™. (g) â€˜Aid for social infrastructureâ€™ and â€˜programme assistanceâ€™ are complementary to humanitarian assistance. The findings reveal various patterns that inform policy makers on the relevance of sequencing aid types to enhance inclusive development. Future research should focus on country-specific studies.
F50|The Impact of a Trade War: Assessment of the Current Tariffs and Alternative Scenarios|This note uses Charbonneau and Landry’s (2018) framework to assess the direct impact of the current trade tensions on the Canadian and global economies, as well as possible implications if the conflict escalates further. Overall, my findings show that the estimated impact of current tariffs on real gross domestic product (GDP) remains relatively small, which is in line with the literature on gains from trade, but the impact on trade is much larger. With a modest escalation of trade tensions, monetary policy in Canada could face a situation of rising prices and falling real GDP. This dilemma would be worse if Canada takes an active role in the trade conflict. If trade tensions rise more dramatically, the effect on Canada would depend on Canada’s access to the US market. A significant and more broad-based rise in tariffs could lead to large global impacts.
F50|Friends for the benefits: The effects of political ties on sovereign borrowing conditions|Do closer political ties with a global superpower improve sovereign borrowing conditions? We use data on voting at the United Nations General Assembly along with foreign aid flows to construct an index of political ties and find evidence that suggests closer political ties leads to both better sovereign credit ratings and lower yields on sovereign bonds. We use heads-of-state official visits and coalition forces troop contributions as exogenous instruments to further strengthen the findings.
F50|On the Effects of Sanctions on Trade and Welfare: New Evidence Based on Structural Gravity and a New Database|Using a new, global data base covering the years 1950 to 2015, we study the impact of sanctions on international trade and welfare. We make use of the rich dimensionality of our data and of the latest developments in the structural gravity literature. Starting with a broad evaluation by sanction type, we carefully investigate the case of Iran. Effects are significant but also widely heterogeneous across sanctioning countries. Moreover, they depend on the direction of trade. We also perform a counterfactual analysis which translates our partial equilibrium sanction estimates into heterogeneous but intuitive general equilibrium.
F50|Increasing resistance to globalization: The role of trade in tasks|We show in this paper that trade in tasks can explain increasing resistance to globalization in industrialized countries. In a traditional trade model of a small open economy, we demonstrate that schooling provides protection against losses from trade if trade increases the relative price of the skill-intensive good. Furthermore, increasing public schooling expenditure may help securing support for trade reform by a majority of voters. However, this conclusion is no longer true, if education provides task-specific skills and trade in tasks makes some of these skills obsolete in the open economy. In this case, increasing public schooling expenditure may be of limited help to secure support for trade reform by a majority of voters, even if the reform is welfare-improving. Our analysis suggests to change the education system to one that provides broader, less-specialized skills in order to facilitate trade reforms. Although such skills may be less productive, they do not become obsolete in the open economy and therefore increase the likelihood that a proposal for a welfare-improving trade reform is successful in a referendum.
F50|The Brexit Conundrum Worsens the UK's Relationship with the European Union|This paper examines the shortcomings in the UK government’s Brexit negotiation strategy which reflected Prime Minister Theresa May’s weak political leadership. The Prime Minister focused on securing the short-term political survival of her government amidst turbulent and fractious domestic politics, over negotiations with the EU27. Brexit negotiations were poorly planned and the government was woefully unprepared. Brexit also threatens a serious re-opening of old wounds in Northern Ireland, as debate grows around the prospect of a united Ireland inside the EU. UK politics is in turmoil and in a chronic crisis. What route the Brexit saga takes next is uncertain. But the crossroads is approaching – either the UK leaves on 31 October 2019 with no deal or it finds a route towards an accommodation with the EU. The phenomenon of British exceptionalism towards the EU is set to take a new dramatic turn, while the UK’s chaotic political divisions will not disappear any time soon.
F50|Overcoming History through International Organizations - Historical Roots of EU Support and Euroscepticism|There is little causal evidence about deep-rooted sources of support for shifting power from nation-states to international organizations. Focusing on the European Union, this paper develops the hypothesis that citizens appreciate the role of international organizations in constraining member state’s the more, the more negatively their region was historically affected by the actions of nation-states. For identification, I use the historically homogeneous regions of Alsace and Lorraine in France as a natural experiment. A municipal level geographical regression discontinuity design documents that more negative exposure led to persistently higher EU support in three important referenda and less success of Eurosceptic parties in parliamentary elections. This effect is not driven by linguistic differences, migration, socioeconomic factors or public good provision, but linked to a stronger European identity. This stronger identity is neither explained by perceived economic benefits, nor comes at the expense of a weaker national or regional identity.
F50|Putting Global Governance in its Place|In a world economy that is highly integrated, most policies produce effects across the border. This is often believed to be an argument for greater global governance, but the logic requires scrutiny. There remains strong revealed demand for policy and institutional diversity among nations, rooted in differences in historical, cultural, or development trajectories. The canonical case for global governance is based on two set of circumstances. The first occurs when there is global public good (GPG) and the second under “beggar-thy-neighbor” (BTN) policies. However, the world economy is not a global commons, and virtually no economic policy has the nature of a global public good (or bad). And while there are some important BTN policies, much of our current discussions deal with policies that are not true BTNs. The policy failures that exist arise not from weaknesses of global governance, but from distortions of domestic governance. As a general rule, these domestic failures cannot be fixed through international agreements or multilateral cooperation. The paper closes by discussing an alternative model of global governance called “democracy-enhancing global governance.”

F50|Global Futures of Energy, Climate, and Policy: Qualitative and Quantitative Foresight towards 2055|Existing long-term energy and climate scenarios are typically a rather simple extrapolation of past trends. Both qualitative and quantitative outlooks co-exist, but they often focus narrowly on individual perspectives, which is opposed to the interlinked and complex nature of energy and climate. Therefore, this study presents a set of novel and multidisciplinary narratives that give insight into four distinct and extreme yet plausible worlds: base case ‘Business-as-usual’, worst case ‘Survival of the Fittest’, best case ‘Green Cooperation’, and surprise scenario ‘ClimateTech’. Going beyond other outlooks, our narratives focus on changes in the geopolitical landscape and global order, social perspectives on climate issues, and technological progress. These holistic scenarios are designed to overcome previous barriers by an innovative bridging between both qualitative and quantitative methods. We start with the generation of qualitative scenario storylines using techniques of foresight analysis, including a facilitated expert workshop. Then, we calibrate the numerical energy systems model Multimod to reflect the different storylines. Finally, we unite and refine storylines and numerical model results into holistic narratives. In addition to the narratives (which include quantitative results on e.g. emissions, energy consumption, and the electricity mix), the study generates insights on the key uncertainties and drivers of different pathways of (more or less successful) climate change mitigation. Additionally, a set of transparent indicators serves as an early-warning system to identify which of the paths the world might enter. Lessons learnt include the dangers from increased isolationism and the importance of integrating economic and energy-related objectives as well as the large role of public opinion and social transition.

F50|Central Asia Oil and Gas Industry - The External Powers’ Energy Interests in Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan|After the Soviet breakup, Central Asia has gained importance for several States because of its geographical location and abundance of hydrocarbon reserves. These hydrocarbon reserves are located mainly in three countries: Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Each of them has taken different path regarding its foreign policy and the regulation of investments and participation of external companies and States in its energy sector. Through the development, production and export of their oil and gas reserves, they have pursued a ‘multi-vector’ policy, consolidating differently their relations with other countries. The main States involved – at different levels and for different reasons – in the oil and gas sector of the Central Asian countries are: Russia, China, United States, European countries, Iran, India and Turkey. Among these players, Russia considers Central Asia still part of its sphere of influence for historical reasons, while it has to deal an increasing presence of Beijing. The Western countries has gained influence particularly in Kazakhstan, but they have no political leverage in Turkmenistan. This working paper provides an overview of the current situation of external players’ interests in the oil and gas industry of Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The working paper is structured into four different sections. In the first section, the paper gives an overview of the main interests and pillars of external involvement in Central Asia as a region. The other three sections are devoted to provide separately the current status of energy relations between each Central Asian country and external players, starting from the closest countries (Russia and China) to the regional ones (Iran, Turkey and India) until non-regional countries (United States and European countries). During these analysis, investments in the oil and gas sector as well as energy export routes and volumes are highlighted in order to understand the current situation of the energy relations. At the end of each country section, the main trends and interests of the countries in the regional oil and gas sector are outlined.
F50|The Seniority Structure of Sovereign Debt|Sovereign governments owe debt to many foreign creditors and can choose which creditors to favor when making payments. This paper documents the de facto seniority structure of sovereign debt using new data on defaults (missed payments or arrears) and creditor losses in debt restructuring (haircuts). We overturn conventional wisdom by showing that official bilateral (government-to-government) debt is junior, or at least not senior, to private sovereign debt such as bank loans and bonds. Private creditors are typically paid first and lose less than bilateral official creditors. We confirm that multilateral institutions like the IMF and World Bank are senior creditors.
F50|Beyond Indonesia’s Sustainable Movement in South Paci?c Area: Study Case on Pilot Projects for Timor Leste and Fiji|This paper aims to review Indonesia’s breakthrough on providing technical assistance under South-South Cooperation (SSC) scheme in Paci?c countries. For years, Indonesia has been engaging with the main bene?ciary countries: Timor Leste and Fiji. From one-off technical assistance programs, Indonesia tried to shift into more sustainable design in the form of pilot projects. By the given two case studies namely Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) Timor Leste and Gender Responsive Planning and Budgeting (GRPB) for Fiji, this article articulated Indonesia’s national interests in term of economics and political level. Both countries also represented as a part of Indonesia’s strategic way in to the South Paci?c area.

F50|The Fracturing of Globalization: Implications of Economic Resentments and Geopolitical Contradictions| In this comprehensive piece about the future of globalization, geopolitical competition will be a deciding factor. Until recently, the United States imposed what the author calls a neoliberal template on global trade. Today, this template is challenged in several ways and may well come apart. There will be regional integrations and adjustments as a result.
F50|The interplay of economic, social and political fragmentation|We develop a model of the social fragmentation along communitarian vs. individualistic values. The endogenous adoption of social values hinges on whether people choose to derive more utility from comparisons with others (materialistic but universalist values) or derive relatively more utility from membership of a group with its distinguishing characteristics (communitarian but exclusive values). Those more well-off, socioeconomically, gravitate towards individualism while those of lower status gravitate towards communitarianism. Crucially, those at the lower end of the middle classes are predicted to align more and more with communitarian values when the status advantage of those at the top increases, holding their own income constant (i.e. rising socioeconomic inequality). Conversely, those at the higher end of the middle classes are predicted to align more and more with individualist values, polarising society. These shifts also increase size of the political constituency for enacting protectionist policies, which act as a stabilising force against socioeconomic polarisation. The model therefore predicts political realignments from the incidence of income growth and the importance of status-oriented (conspicuous) consumption.

F50|Integration of immigrants in the EU_15: success or failure?|In 2015, the so-called migration crisis culminated in Europe. Although immigration can bring along many benefits (labor force, cultural diversification), it constitutes a challenge for fiscal policy if immigrants fail to integrate. This paper examines the level of integration in the EU_15 on the data from Eurostat in period 2009 to 2018. The results show that immigrants who were not born in the EU_28 were significantly worse off in terms of the unemployment rate and the risk-of-poverty rate than the host society. Immigrants born in the other EU_28 country were not significantly worse off on the labor market, but the at-risk-of-poverty rate was significantly higher in comparison with the host society. The data didn?t confirm that share of immigrants with tertiary education (both from the EU_28 or outside the EU_28) was significantly lower than the share of the tertiary educated population in the host society. The level of integration of immigrants did not got worse after the migration crisis. Furthermore, the results showed a considerable difference in the degree of integration between EU_15 countries.
F50|Taxation, foreign aid and political governance in Africa|This study examines the hypothesis that foreign aid dilutes the positive role of taxation on political governance. The empirical evidence is based on the Generalised Method of Moments and 53 African countries for the period 1996-2010. For more policy options, the dataset is disaggregated into fundamental characteristics of African development based on income levels, legal origins, natural resources and landlockedness. While the hypothesis is invalid in baseline Africa, low income and English common law countries of the continent, the research cannot conclude on its validity for other fundamental characteristics of development. Policy implications, caveats and directions for future research are discussed.

F50|Stabilizing Cooperative Outcomes in Two-Person Games: Theory and Cases|We analyze the 78 2 x 2 distinct strict ordinal games, 57 of which are conflict games that contain no mutually best outcome. In 19 of the 57 games (33%), including Prisoners’ Dilemma and Chicken, a cooperative outcome—one that is at least next-best for each player—is not a Nash equilibrium (NE). But this outcome is a nonmyopic equilibrium (NME) in 16 of the 19 games (84%) when the players start at this outcome and make farsighted calculations, based on backward induction; in the other three games, credible threats can induce cooperation. In two of the latter games, the NMEs are “boomerang NMEs,” whereby players have an incentive to move back and forth between two diagonally opposite NMEs, one of which is cooperative. In Prisoners’ Dilemma, the NE and one NME are not Pareto-optimal, but we conjecture that in all two-person games with strict preferences, there is at least one Pareto-optimal NME. As examples of NMEs that are not NEs, we analyze two games that plausibly model the choices of players in international relations: (i) no first use of nuclear weapons, a policy that has been adopted by some nuclear powers; and (ii) the 2015 agreement between Iran, and a coalition of the United States and other countries, that has forestalled Iran’s possible development of nuclear weapons.
F50|16+1, a New Issue in China-EU Relations?|The present paper investigates the positions of individual member states, European institutions and organizations towards the 16+1 cooperation framework. At the institutional level, the European Commission’s Joint communication on elements for a new EU strategy on China of June 2016, the reports and joint statements of the European Economic and Social Committee and China Economic and Social Council (May 2016 and June 2017) and European Parliament publications underline: the absence of a common EU-level strategy on recent large scale Chinese initiatives and some member states pursue individual economic interests, which do not correspond to those of the EU as a whole; 16+1 format as “controversial”, as its arrangements are “in conflict with the EU law” which leads to the “erosion of EU norms”; the necessity to “cooperate with the Commission, the EEAS and other Member States to help ensure that relevant aspects to the EU are in line with EU law, rules and policies, and that the overall outcome is beneficial for the EU as a whole”. We analyze the concerns and make specific proposals so that the 16+1 format might cease to be an issue in China-EU relations.
F50|The Effectiveness Of Development Aid For Agriculture In Sub-Saharan Africa|Agriculture is the major source of livelihood for the majority population in Sub- Saharan Africa, but its productivity is not only low it has started showing signs of decline since 2012. The paper seeks to find out whether official development assistance for agriculture is effective. The data for development assistance for agriculture are broken down into the major agricultural sectors in receiving countries.
F50|Introduction|Sustainable development within the investigated context includes the ability of African countries to meet the present economic, social and environmental needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

This introductory chapter provides highlights on all chapters covered by the book in the direction of addressing the underlying policy syndrome.
F50|Геополитички Аспекти Стратешких Коридора Србије<BR>[Geopolitical Aspects of the Strategic Corridors of Serbia]|Serbian. Коридори преко Балкана могу имати вишеструки значај у саобраћају, енергетици, привреди уопште, али и у ширем геополитичком контексту. У раду се анализирају важни путни и енергетски коридори (цевоводи) преко Србије. У питању су магистрални путеви ширег регионалног па и европског значаја који пролазе преко територије Србије. Потом ту су железничке трасе, укључујући и оне у нацртима, попут оне која ће се уклапати у концепт кинеског пута свиле, пре свега Пиреј‒Будимпешта. Цевоводни правци, пре свега гасоводи, нафтоводи, имају изузетан и шири геополитички значај. То се посебно односи на могућности реализације неке од варијанти Јужног тока, који остаје актуелан, и хипотетички у неком облику остварљив. Иако Србија нема директан излаз на море, најближе луке суседних земаља, пре свега оних блиских и историјских савезника попут Црне Горе, Бугарске, Грчке и Румуније имају посебан значај. Ту су нарочито значајне луке Бар, Солун, а у мањој мери бугарске и румунске важне луке (Бургас, Варна, Констанца) одакле би Србија имала погодан транзит поморским саобраћајем. English. The corridors crisscrossing the Balkans bear significance in the context of transport, energetics and industry as a whole, as well as in a broader geopolitical context. The paper analyzes the important road routes and energy corridors (pipelines) passing through Serbia. Specifically, it refers to highways significant both regionally and on continental level, which pass through the territory of the country. It also covers railroads, including the ones still in draft phase, such as the Piraeus-Budapest one, which is wupposed to be included in the outline of the Chinese Silk Road. The pipelines, especially the gas lines and the oil pipelines, are of wider geopolitical relevance. Specifically, the possibility of the realization of one of the South Stream versions, which continues being considered and in some form a hypotetically attainable plan. Although Serbia does not have access to sea, the closest ports in neighboring countries, especially the close and traditionally friendly ones such as Montenegro, Bulgaria, Greece and Romania, are especially important in that context. The ports of Bar and Thessaloniki are of extraordinary significance, while the Bulgarian and Romanian ports of Burgas, Varna and Constanta, although somewhat less important, could provide Serbia with convenient points for waterway transport routes.

F50|The analysis of the economic impact of Brexit on the European Union|The European Union has been considered over time a guarantor of the regional stability and prosperity, being also recognized as one of the most influential player in the global economic arena. However, the European Union has recently faced significant political and economic challenges, such as the migration and refugee crisis, the United Kingdom’s withdrawal, the increasing power of Russia and the enhancement of the terrorist threat. The purpose of this paper is to present the economic consequences of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, a decision that represents a turning point in the history of over half a century of the regional group. In this regard, the study encompasses the critical review of the literature on this topic and the analysis of the relevant statistical data. The perspectives of theoreticians are extensive and sometimes diverging. While some analysts believe that Brexit will undermine the European integration project, others consider that the effects will be manageable by the remaining 27 Member States. Analyzing the statistical data on GDP, stocks of FDI, trade in goods and services, we have revealed that the United Kingdom plays an important role in shaping the economic power of the European bloc. Consequently, with the completion of Brexit, it is likely that the economic power of the European Union will diminish, particularly in terms of GDP and trade in goods and services.
F50|The “same bed, different dreams” of Vietnam and China: how (mis)trust could make or break it|The relationship between Vietnam and China could be captured in the Chinese expression of “同床异梦”,which means lying on the same bed but having different dreams. The two countries share certain culturaland political similarities but also diverge vastly in their national interests. This paper adds to the extantliterature on this topic by analyzing the element of trust/mistrust in their interactions in trade-investment,tourism, and defense-security. The analysis shows how the relationship is increasingly interdependent butis equally fragile due to the lack of trust on both sides. The mistrust or even distrust of Chinese subjectsrun deep within the Vietnamese mindset, from the skepticism of Chinese investment, Chinese tourists,discrimination against ethnic Chinese, to the caution against Chinese aggression in the South China Sea.The paper forecasts that, despite the deep-seated differences and occasional mistrust, going forward,neither side would risk damaging the status quo even when tensions peak.
F50|National identity under economic integration|Abstract This study empirically investigates how economic integration influences individuals’ national identity. Due to historical reasons and unique cross-strait politics, some people in Taiwan identify themselves as Chinese while others identify themselves as Taiwanese. Using individual survey data with the outward investment data at the industry level from 1992 to 2009, we find that the rising investment in China has strengthened Taiwanese identity and has reduced the probability of voting for the Pan-Blue parties. The effects are much stronger for unskilled workers than for skilled workers, suggesting that outward investment in China may not only have economic impact on the economy but may also deepen the political polarization in Taiwan.
F50|"International environmental governance and the Paris agreement on climate change: The adoption of the ""pledge and review"" governance approach"|"This paper explains the emergence of the ""pledge and review"" governance approach found in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, in place of the ""obligatory targets and timetables"" approach found in the Kyoto Protocol, from a neo-Gramscian perspective. The main argument is that the adoption of pledge and review was a response to both the pressure to agree a new international treaty and the simultaneous divergence of interests and fragmentation of negotiation groups within the UNFCCC regime. In explaining this pressure to agree a new treaty, particular attention is given to the US and China, being the two largest emitters of greenhouse gases, looking at the key interests involved in shaping the recent move away from their long-held core negotiating positions of reluctance in accepting emission reductions. Shifts in the world political economy - the decline of US hegemony, the shift of power towards China and the East, and the emergence of a new multipolarity - and the complex nature of climate change as a problem were given as causes of fragmentation of the global climate regime. These power shifts all occur within the overarching dynamic of fossil capitalism, where the overuse of global sinks and the exploitation of natural resources remains unquestioned. Any attempt to address climate change emerges within this ideological framework of economic growth and economic development. This is continually apparent throughout the analysis, often influencing the actions of different interest groups and changes in the world political economy. When taken together, the pledge and review approach can be seen to have reinforced cooperation between nations and strengthened consensus building, facilitating the search for an agreement under differentiated interests. Being less fixed than obligatory quantitative emission reduction targets, this degree of flexibility is key to the functioning and adoption of the system. This flexibility allowed many of the key contentions within the negotiations to be sidestepped, in order for an agreement to be reached."

F50|The Trade War in Numbers|We build upon new developments in the international trade literature to isolate and quantify the long-run economic impacts of tariff changes on the United States and the global economy. In particular, we apply the most recent data and trade elasticity estimates to the Ricardian model of Caliendo and Parro (2015) to quantify the long-run impacts of the recently applied and proposed tariff changes, including the U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and the rounds of additional tariffs between the United States and China. To fit the reality of the current trade policy shift, our analysis also allows for quotas and endogenizes trade balances. Overall, our results suggest that the newly imposed and proposed tariff schemes imply considerable changes in trade flows and sectoral output reallocations, but modest impacts on long-run aggregate prices and output levels.
F50|Estimating the Impacts of Tariff Changes: Two Illustrative Scenarios|We build upon new developments in the international trade literature to construct a quantitative Ricardian framework similar to Caliendo and Parro (2015) to isolate and estimate the long-run economic impacts of tariff changes. Our framework incorporates the most recent data and shows that the trade elasticities have changed considerably since the 1990s—highlighting the need to use recent data to quantitatively evaluate newly imposed and proposed tariff schedules. We apply our model and use our estimated elasticities to measure the long-run economic impact of the recently announced US tariffs on steel and aluminum and the first round of additional tariffs between the United States and China. Our results suggest that modifying the current global tariff schedules would imply considerable changes in trade flows and sectoral reallocations, but modest impacts on longrun output levels.
F50|Interbank payment system architecture from a cyber security perspective|AThis paper outlines how a paradigm shift is required when approaching cyber risk management for interbank payment systems, which are affected by the growing interconnectedness of systems, the digitalization of financial services and continuously evolving cyber threats. In this scenario, cyber threats may derive from a wider number of actors, who are constantly active on the Internet and able to exploit an increasing number of vulnerabilities and attack vectors to achieve their goals. Financial institutions should therefore assume that specific cyber threats can overcome any defence. Firstly, the paper outlines the theoretical reasons for this necessary paradigm shift; secondly, it aims to highlight the importance of all the stakeholders in strengthening the cyber resilience of payment systems, in particular the central and enabling role of messaging service operators, by providing an analysis of a real case study - the recent Bangladesh Bank cyber fraud; and finally, the paper aims to encourage discussion on the new paradigm and the adequacy of current regulatory frameworks and supervisory approaches.
F50|The context of conflict resolution - international relations and the study of peace and conflict|This paper provides a brief review of almost one century of academic research within the discipline of International Relations with a focus on the thinking about Peace and Conflict and its links to approaches in Conflict Resolution. The framework of analysis is based on the definition of science, what is studied and how it is studied, which delimits the analysis into the four debates in IR: between 1919 and the 1940s, the idealist versus realist debate; in the 1950s and 1960s, the traditionalist versus behaviourist debate; in the 1970s and 1980s, the inter-paradigm debate, and, since the 1990s, the rationalist versus reflectivist debate. This paper identifies how the classical conception of security centred on the state, the military and external threats was broadened by different approaches to include other actors (individuals, groups, societies, civilizations), other sectors (economic, political, social, environmental) and internal threats. In tandem, it maps the epistemological and sometimes ontological challenges to positivism and rationalism found in (Neo) Realism, (Neo) Liberalism and Marxism, by a set of post-positivist and reflective theories or approaches, such as the cases of Human Security, Feminism, Post-structuralism, Constructivism, Post-Colonialism, Critical Studies, and the Copenhagen School. The emergence and development of all these theories and approaches are historically contextualized alongside developments of Conflict Resolution approaches.
F50|Is it the Gums, Teeth or the Bite? Effectiveness of Dimensions of Enforcement in Curbing Corruption|Adding a new dimension to determinants of corruption, this paper examines the effectiveness of enforcement in reducing corruption. We compare the influences of latent enforcement (police, judicial, and prosecutorial employment) versus actual enforcement (conviction rates) and enforcing institutions. Results based on data for more than 80 countries show that piecemeal enforcement to combat corruption by increasing enforcement employment is ineffective, rather comprehensive improvements in institutions by strengthening the rule of law or regulatory quality bear greater results. Thus, when it comes to corruption control, strong gums (institutions) are more effective than showing teeth (enforcement employment) or the bite (conviction rates).
F50|Who is NOT voting for Brexit anymore?|Using estimates of support for Leave across UK local authority areas constructed from a comprehensive 20,000 strong survey, we show that both the level and the geographic variation capturing differential degrees of support for Leave have changed significantly since the 2016 EU referendum. A lot of area characteristics, many of which were previously associated with higher levels of support for Leave, are now significant correlates capturing a swing towards Remain. They include, for example, the degree to which local authorities receive transfers from the EU or the extent to which their economies rely on trade with the EU, along with past electoral support for UKIP (and the BNP) and exposure to immigration from Eastern Europe. Lastly, exposure to austerity since 2010 is among the strongest individual correlates weakening the support for Leave. The evidence is consistent with the argument that the small margin of victory of Leave in 2016 was, to a significant extent, carried by protest voters, who used the EU referendum to voice their discontent with domestic social and economic developments, particularly, austerity. Lastly, we present some evidence suggesting that the UK public, even in Leave supporting areas, would be much more willing to make compromises on free movement and aspects of single market membership compared to what appears to be the UK governments negotiation objective.

F50|La conjetura de Shaikh. Un modelo clásico de la tasa de cambio real Colombia - Estados Unidos|"En este trabajo se presenta lo que hemos denominado la “Conjetura de Shaikh”. (i) explicamos la concepción clásica de la competencia real en el modo de producción capitalista, definida como una guerra continua por la sobrevivencia, cuyas armas son el cambio técnico, la inversión en capital y los ajustes de precios que permiten golpear duramente a los capitales adversarios para concentrar y centralizar el poder en el mercado. (ii) introducimos la teoría de la desventaja absoluta que determina la especialización y la división internacional del trabajo, que explica los procesos de causación circular acumulativa de los superávits comerciales y de acumulación de obligaciones externas entre países desarrollados y en desarrollo (iii) explicamos porque la interpretación monetaria de la tasa de interés impide que las ventajas absolutas se transformen en desventajas comparativas en libre comercio. Por último, se presenta el modelo de determinación de la tasa de cambio real entre dos países (USA y Colombia), que se deriva de la teoría clásica del sistema de precios de producción. ****** In this paper, we present what we have called the ""Shaikh Conjecture"". (i) We explain the classical conception of real competition in the capitalist mode of production, defined as a continuous war for survival, whose weapons are technical change, investment in capital and price adjustments that allow capital to hit hard adversaries to concentrate and centralize power in the market. (ii) We introduce the theory of absolute disadvantage that determines the specialization and international division of labour, which explains the cumulative circular causation processes of trade surpluses and accumulation of external obligations between developed and developing countries. (iii) We explain why the monetary interpretation of the interest rate prevents absolute advantages from becoming comparative disadvantages in free trade. Finally, we present the model for determining the real exchange rate between two countries (USA and Colombia), which is derived from the classical theory of the production price system."
F50|Lessons from historical monetary unions - is the European monetary union making the same mistakes?|Abstract This article examines three historical monetary unions: the Latin Monetary Union (LMU), the Scandinavian Monetary Union (SMU), and the Austro-Hungarian Monetary Union (AHMU) in an attempt to derive possible lessons for the European Monetary Union (EMU). The term ‘monetary union’ can be defined either narrowly or broadly depending on how closely it conforms to Mundell’s notion of ‘Optimal Currency Area’. After examining each of the historical monetary unions from this perspective, the article concludes that none of them ever truly conformed to Mundell’s concept, nor does the EMU. Nevertheless, the article argues that some lessons may be learned from these historical experiences. First, it is necessary that there exist robust institutions such as a common central bank and a unified fiscal policy in order to withstand external shocks. The three early unions could not withstand the shock of WWI. Another important lesson is that continuing national rivalries can undermine any monetary union.
F50|Examining the Interactive Growth Effect of Development Aid and Institutional Quality in Sub-Saharan Africa|This study analyses the interconnectivity of growth, aid and institutions in Sub-Saharan Africa. The study employs annual data on a panel of 39 countries for the period 1996-2017. The hypothesis that the growth impact of aid and institutions could be interactive was examined. The hypothesis was tested using panel data for official development assistance, aggregate and individual measures of institutional quality, and economic growth, while controlling for sub-regional differences in Southern Africa, Eastern Africa, Western Africa and Central Africa. The results indicate the following: Aid has a direct positive, and an indirect negative growth impact through its interaction with domestic institutions. The synergistic growth impact of aid and institutions is substitutive rather than complementary. The substitutive effect is most pronounced in Western Africa, followed by Eastern Africa, and then Southern Africa but lowest in Central Africa. Good quality institutions are positively correlated with growth, and the institutions that reduce rent-seeking and protect property rights are the types of institutions with the biggest growth effects.
F50|Four years in the club - from external to internal Europeanization in Croatia|Croatia joined the European Union on 1 July 2013 after a long and meandrous road. On the one hand, the preparation for the negotiations was long already, on the other hand, the negotiation process itself also went slowly. Croatia was hit by the crisis severely, which also means that the accession process went parallel with an acute crisis management. The question arises whether the two processes had strengthened or rather hampered each other. So what impact of the membership can be identified in Croatia? Could the membership enhance the recovery from the long-lasting recession? Has the EU any role in this story? Almost four years has passed since the entrance conditions were replaced by a new set of internal rules: Croatia faces internal Europeanization pressure. What has changed in Croatia’s Europeanization pattern when it turned from internal to external?
F50|Indo-Japanese Relations on an Upward Trend|The outstandingly positive relationship between India and Japan is a product of the new millennium and a bright spot in the Asia-Pacific, the geopolitics of which region has become increasingly uncertain. A primary reason behind the regional tensions is China’s growing economic and military power combined with her aspiration for dominance over the Indo-Pacific arena. India and Japan both have stakes in maintaining regional stability and creating a truly multi-polar Asia. The booming relationship between the two is thus fuelled by the converging strategic interest to contain China’s assertive behaviour. The security and diplomatic aspects of the Indo-Japanese ties, however, are only one side of the coin. The other is the economic relations which starting from a very low base are now on an upward trajectory as well. This paper analyses several fields of economic interactions. Official development aid (ODA) provided by Japan has been the most successful area of cooperation and was beneficial not only for India’s infrastructure development but also for Japanese companies seeking new opportunities. Foreign direct investments from Japan to India has been growing also steadily but they keep lagging behind those to China and Southeast Asian countries. There are still numerous issues that hold back the dynamics of Indo-Japanese economic relations. Once the ongoing reforms succeed in diminishing the hindering factors, the potential becomes huge given the complementary nature of the two economies. In the medium run, however, the economic relations with China remain more important for both India and Japan.
F50|Political participation of the muslim brotherhood in Kuwait : the impacts of electoral reforms and the arab uprising|This paper examines the impacts of electoral reforms and the Arab Spring on the activities of the Muslim Brotherhood in Kuwait. The Islamic Constitutional Movement (ICM), its political wing, has been participating in parliamentary elections since 1991. As a result of electoral reforms in 2006, the ICM lost some of its seats. However, it gained seats in the February 2012 election. Focusing on the structure of political competition in Kuwait, we analyse the reasons for this volatility.
F50|Hamas's ascension and its international relations : literature review|This paper focuses on a literature review and summarizes the international relations in which Hamas or its preceding Muslim Brotherhood in Palestine has been situated. Its relations with Israel, the U.S., Russia, Iran, and other Arab countries are overviewed based on previous studies. The diplomatic policy of Hamas is also investigated regarding its own approach and relations with other countries.
F50|Hamas and the Gaza war of 2014 : developments since the arab spring in Palestine|This paper demonstrates the impacts of the Arab Spring on Palestine's internal and international politics. It also indicates their links with the subsequent Gaza War in the summer of 2014. A special focus is on Hamas, an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, which was already in power before 2011, though under pressure because of economic sanctions and denial of recognition. Considering such pressure, the associated developments can be explained as a natural consequence.
F50|Indonesian South-South Cooperation: Stepping Up the Institution and Strategy for Indonesias Development Assistance|This paper reviews Indonesiaâ€™s South-South Cooperation (SSC) efforts with an aim of providing policy recommendations to improve Indonesiaâ€™s management and implementation of its development assistance. The National Coordination Team on South-South Cooperation (NCT-SSC)â€”the current national institution mandated with SSC in Indonesiaâ€”is suffering from fundamental constraints in terms of coordination, organization, and institutionalization. Furthermore, the efforts to further the institutionalization by establishing a single agency for SSC have been progressing very slowly due to a lack of firm legal basis on one hand, and a proclivity for practical, business-as-usual approach on the other. To improve the institution and programming of Indonesian development assistance, a number of recommendations are suggested. First, a strong legal basis through the issuance of a Presidential Regulation on SSC management should be pushed to serve as a precursor to the single agency. Second, better public communication and outreach should be conducted to promote the SSC programs. Adequate monitoring and evaluation system should also be developed to measure program impacts. Moreover, Indonesia needs to have a strategy to promote the participation of business sector in SSC, such as by promoting firmsâ€™ participation as contractor or a source of fund for projects in beneficiary countries. Finally, expertise in specific fields, such as agriculture and tsunami and earthquake risk management, should be promoted as a niche branding of Indonesiaâ€™s assistance.
F50|Exports, Jobs, Growth! Congressional Hearings on US Trade Agreements|Who testifies on US trade agreements before Congress and what do they say? We examine the content of Congressional testimony on US trade agreements, and the selection process which determines who testifies in the first place. We find that testimony is systematically tilted towards a sunny view of tradeÕs positive economic effects, while import competition and offshoring are generally downplayed. We argue that tradeÕs supporters strategically frame their motives for supporting trade agreements, and that pro-trade committee chairsÕ decisions on who testifies further skew testimony away from the distributive consequences of globalization within the United States. Congressional hearings on trade agreements therefore represent a key site where the influence of dominant pro-trade interests is both revealed and reinforced.
F50|Leave No One Behind: How are Development Assistance Committee members answering the pledge of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development?|In 2015, UN Member States and the international community more broadly endorsed the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Agenda’s commitment to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals for everyone to leave no one behind. This working paper presents and analyses the findings of a survey circulated to members of the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee (DAC) between April and May 2018. The survey investigated the level and extent of commitment to leave no one behind in development co-operation policies, strategies and programming. It also gathered views and evidence from DAC members about the comparative advantage, opportunities, challenges and strategies for answering this pledge of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The findings presented in this paper inform the analysis of the 2018 Development Co-operation Report: Joining Forces to Leave No One Behind.
F50|Increasing Foreign Aid for Inclusive Human Development in Africa|Abstract In the light of evidence that poverty has been decreasing in all regions of the world with the exception of Africa, where about 45% of countries in sub-Saharan Africa did not achieve the Millennium development goal extreme poverty target, this study assesses whether increasing foreign aid improves inclusive human development. The investigation is on 53 African countries for the period 2005–2012. The empirical analysis is based on (1) the generalised method of moments (GMM) to control for persistence in inclusive human development, simultaneity and time-invariant omitted variables and (2) Instrumental Variable Tobit Regressions to control for simultaneity and the limited range in the dependent variable. The adopted foreign aid variables are: ‘humanitarian assistance’, ‘action on debt’ ‘aid for social infrastructure’, ‘aid to the productive sector’, ‘aid to the multi sector’, ‘aid for economic infrastructure’ and ‘programme assistance’. The following findings are established. From the GMM specifications, there are (1) synergy effects from ‘aid to the productive sector’ and a positive net effect from ‘programme assistance’ and (2) negative net impacts from ‘aid to social infrastructure’ and human assistance, albeit with positive marginal effects. From Instrumental Variable Tobit regressions (1) there is a synergy effect from ‘aid for economic infrastructure’ and (2) there are negative net impacts from ‘aid for social infrastructure’, ‘aid to the productive sector’ and human assistance, albeit with positive marginal effects. Policy implications are discussed.
F50|Is Aid for Agriculture Effective in Sub-Saharan Africa?|One of the key economic development challenges facing Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is its low agricultural productivity. Governments, donors, and foreign investors have underinvested in African agriculture even though research evidence shows that higher agricultural productivity would boost economic growth and poverty reduction. Solutions to the problem require a number of interconnected strategies, including, but not limited to, research on seeds and inputs, extension services, rural development, credit, institutional, and trade and price stabilization policies. We use the system two-step Generalized Method of Moments to examine whether official development assistance (ODA) for agriculture and rural development is helping to boost agricultural productivity. We find a positive relationship between ODA and agricultural productivity. However, when broken down into the main agricultural ODA recipient sectors, there is a substitution effect between food crop production and industrial crop production. While there exists a positive relationship between ODA for industrial and export crops output per worker (agricultural productivity), ODA for food crops has a negative relationship. Better public institutions and economic freedom are also found to enable agricultural productivity growth and to increase the ODA effectiveness. We correct the results for spurious correlation assuming that more ODA might be allocated where agricultural productivity is already increasing due to some other factors. Concerning the determinants of ODA allocation, we find that the allocation of ODA for agriculture is primarily determined by agricultural need, and that the expected effectiveness increases the ODA receipts. Finally, there is a weak ODA-led structural economic change effect in SSA. Labor released from agriculture to the urban sector(s) has a positive market effect on agriculture but is not engendering significant structural economic transformation.

F50|Bulgarian enterprises trading with Sub-Saharan Africa – a synthetic profile|The article aims at synthesizing the main features of Bulgarian enterprises which trade with Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as of those who are interested in the region. The current state of Bulgaria’s trade's relations with countries from that part of the world is outlined. Based on a representative survey of 1000 Bulgarian companies, the expectations of Bulgarian businesses towards these relations are investigated. Some general characteristics of the respondents are highlighted, analyzing the structure and attitudes of Bulgarian companies engaged or expressing interest in trade with Sub-Saharan Africa. The article examines the opinion of Bulgarian enterprises on the reasons why Bulgaria has lost its influence and traditional trade partners in the region.
F50|Cyber attacks: preliminary evidence from the Bank of Italy's business surveys|This paper presents preliminary evidence on cyber risk in the Italian private sector based on the Bank of Italy’s annual surveys of Italian industrial and service firms. The information collected, albeit only covering the incidence of cyber attacks and some aspects of security governance, is the first of its kind for Italy. The results are striking: even though a mere 1.5 per cent of businesses do not deploy any cybersecurity measures, 30.3 per cent – corresponding to 35.6 per cent of total employees – report at least some damage from a cyber attack between September 2015 and September 2016. Once data are corrected to account for unwillingness to report or inability to detect attacks on the part of some respondents, these figures climb to 45.2 and 56 per cent respectively, with large, high-tech and internationally exposed businesses faring worse than average. The economy-wide risk level is likely to be higher still; the financial sector, healthcare, education and social care are excluded from the sample, but they are known from other sources to be particularly appealing to attackers. Further research is needed on the correlation between firm-level vulnerability and investment in cyber defence, and on the cost of cyber breaches.
F50|The price of cyber (in)security: evidence from the Italian private sector|This paper presents evidence on the economic dimension of cyber risk in the Italian private non-financial sector, based on Bank of Italy survey data. In 2016, the median amount spent on preventing cyber attacks was a modest €4,530, i.e. 15 per cent of a typical worker’s annual gross wages. A wide variation exists across sectors and size classes, reflecting differences in how appealing a target a firm is to attackers and firms’ awareness of threats: median values range from €3,120 for small firms to €19,080 in the ICT sector and €44,590 for large firms. The market for cyber defence in our reference universe is worth at least €570 million. Having been attacked in the past proves to be a strong incentive to invest in security. The majority of breached firms suffered damages worth less than €10,000; 0.1 per cent reported costs of at least €200,000. Neither the sampling design nor the questionnaire were geared towards the measurement of tail events: underestimation of large incidents is likely. More information is needed before the economy-wide cost can be estimated.
F50|Energy and the Military: Convergence of Security, Economic, and Environmental Decision-Making|Energy considerations are core to mission delivery of armed forces worldwide. The interaction between military energy issues and non-military energy issues is not often explicitly treated in the literature or media, although in the last decade there has been some increase driven especially by the issues of clean energy. It is recognized that the military has for more than a hundred years taken a leadership role in terms on research and development (R&D) of specific energy technologies - most commonly where they are applicable in theater. More recently that R&D leadership has moved to the energy efficiency of home-country bases, and the development of renewable energy projects for areas as diverse as mini-grids for in-country installations, to alternative fuels for submarines and jets. Nevertheless, the military in most major countries tends to see energy issues as a matter of mission delivery or conversely the denial of enemy energy supply chains as a source of advantage. In this paper we explore the evolving relationship between energy issues and defense planning, and show how these developments have implications for military tactics and strategy and for civil energy policy.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F50|Country Reputation and Trade Policy Preferences - Using the News of the Election of Donald Trump as an Instrument|Using quasi-experimental data, a survey that was held immediately before and after the November 8th, 2016 USA elections, we analyse the impact of reputation on trade policy preference and find that the unexpected election of Donald Trump as 45th president of the USA had a sizeable negative effect on the reputation of the USA in Europe, as measured by the expectations of EU citizens about the future evolution of the USA. But this negative reputational shock seems to have affected in a positive (though not always significant) way the support for future economic cooperation with the USA, as measured by the support of EU citizens for a free trade and investment treaty with the USA. This provides some support for the idea that reputation and formal institutions are substitutes.
F50|Liberation Technology: Mobile Phones and Political Mobilization in Africa|Can digital information and communication technology (ICT) foster mass political mobilization? We use a novel geo-referenced dataset for the entire African continent between 1998 and 2012 on the coverage of mobile phone signal together with georeferenced data from multiple sources on the occurrence of protests and on individual participation in protests to bring this argument to empirical scrutiny. We find that mobile phones are instrumental to mass mobilization during economic downturns, when reasons for grievance emerge and the cost of participation falls. Estimated effects are if anything larger once we use an instrumental variable approach that relies on differential trends in coverage across areas with different incidence of lightning strikes. The results are in line with insights from a network model with imperfect information and strategic complementarities in protest provision. Mobile phones make individuals more responsive to both changes in economic conditions - a mechanism that we ascribe to enhanced information - and to their neighbors’ participation – a mechanism that we ascribe to enhanced coordination. Empirically both effects are at play, highlighting the channels through which digital ICT can alleviate the collective action problem.
F50|Leading the unwilling: Unilateral strategies to prevent arctic oil exploration|Arctic oil extraction is inconsistent with the 2 °C target. We study unilateral strategies by climate-concerned Arctic countries to deter extraction by others. Contradicting common theoretical assumptions about climate-change mitigation, our setting is one where countries may fundamentally disagree about whether mitigation by others is beneficial. This is because Arctic oil extraction requires specific R&D, hence entry by one country expands the extraction-technology market, decreasing costs for others. This means that, on the one hand, countries that extract Arctic oil gain if others do so as well. On the other hand, as countries may disagree about how harmful climate change is, they may disagree whether an equilibrium where all enter is better or worse than an equilibrium where all stay out. Less environmentally-concerned countries (preferring maximum entry) have a first-mover advantage but, because they rely on entry by others, entry in equilibrium is determined by the preferences of those who are moderately concerned about the environment. Furthermore, using a pooling strategy, an environmentally-concerned country can deter entry by credibly “pretending” to be environmentally adamant, and thus be expected to not follow. A rough calibration suggests a country like Norway, or prospects of a green future U.S. administration, could be pivotal in determining whether the Arctic will be explored.
F50|Brexit: The Economics of International Disintegration|This paper reviews the literature on the likely economic consequences of Brexit and considers the lessons of the Brexit vote for the future of European and global integration. Brexit will make the United Kingdom poorer because it will lead to new barriers to trade and migration between the United Kingdom and the European Union. Plausible estimates put the costs to the United Kingdom at between 1 and 10 percent of income per capita. Other European Union countries will also suffer economically, but their estimated losses are much smaller. Support for Brexit came from a coalition of less-educated, older, less economically successful and more socially conservative voters. Why these voters rejected the European Union is poorly understood, but will play an important role in determining whether Brexit proves to be merely a diversion on the path to greater international integration or a sign that globalization has reached its limits.
F50|Negative returns: U.S. military policy and anti-american terrorism|We investigate the effect of U.S. military aid and U.S. troop deployments on anti-American terrorism, using a sample of 106 countries between 1986 and 2011. We find that greater military commitment leads to more anti-American terrorism. We study the underlying mechanisms using a mediation analysis and show that both U.S. military aid and troop deployments in foreign countries do not improve local state capacity. Rather, we find that more military aid (but not troop deployments) is linked to poorer political-institutional outcomes in aid-receiving countries, explaining the positive association between U.S. military aid and anti-American terrorism. Our findings suggest that U.S. military policy does not make the United States safer from transnational terrorism.
F50|Why Democracies Cooperate More: Electoral Control and International Trade Agreements|Over the past fifty years, barriers to international trade have decreased substantially. A key source of this decline in protectionism has been the proliferation of agreements among countries to liberalize commerce. In this article, we analyze the domestic political conditions under which states have concluded such agreements and, more generally, explore the factors affecting interstate economic cooperation. We argue that interstate cooperation on commercial issues depends heavily on the political regime types of participants: as states become more democratic, they are increasingly likely to conclude trade agreements. To test our claim, we examine whether the regime types of states have influenced their propensity to form and expand preferential trading arrangements (PTAs) during the period since World War II. We find that democratic countries are about twice as likely to form a PTA as autocratic countries, and that pairs of democracies are roughly four times as likely to do so as autocratic pairs. These results provide strong evidence that democracies are more commercially cooperative than less democratic countries.
F50|The frequency of wars|Wars are increasingly frequent, and the trend has been steadily upward since 1870. The main tradition of Western political and philosophical thought suggests that extensive economic globalization and democratization over this period should have reduced appetites for war far below their current level. This view is clearly incomplete: at best, confounding factors are at work. Here, we explore the capacity to wage war. Most fundamentally, the growing number of sovereign states has been closely associated with the spread of democracy and increasing commercial openness, as well as the number of bilateral conflicts. Trade and democracy are traditionally thought of as goods, both in themselves, and because they reduce the willingness to go to war, conditional on the national capacity to do so. But the same factors may also have been increasing the capacity for war, and so its frequency.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F50|Turkey’s Strategic Economic Relations with Africa: Trends and Challenges|The Ottoman Empire had extensive economic relations with Africa which provides the structural frameworks for the speedy acceleration of economic partnership and trade interactions between Africa and modern Turkey. This study seeks to examine the structural relevance, challenges and prospects of Turkey’s economic relations and interest in Africa from the traditional period of Ottoman Empire to the contemporary era of competitive interdependence. From a broad perspective, trade interactions between Turkey was driven but the values of economic pluralism and less of colonialist tendencies. Therefore, the greatest challenge that tacitly limits the geometric expansion of trade is the shift in perception of Africa as a hub for disease, economic stagnation, waste and wars. This form of stereotype is a direct input of neo-colonial propaganda adopted by the Western media to keep at bay competitive investors from Africa. So, Africa with an economic growth rate of over 5% offers Turkey new horizon for economic diversification. The consistent use of soft power by Turkey has brought new image and perception of Turkey as a credible economic partner with pragmatic approach promote symbiotic trade relations devoid of the manipulative devices of free market syndrome that benefits only the West at the detriment of Africa. Africa sees Turkey as an economic partner that will assist the continent to intensify the industrialization of its economic base in line with the global economic configuration. Therefore, Turkey-Africa economic partnership and trade volume is likely to expand in future because Turkey’s opening to Africa has created new markets and investment potential that will increase Africa’s participation in global economy and enhance Turkey’s role as a major player in the politics of resource allocation in the international economic system.

Therefore, Turkey-Africa economic partnership and trade volume is likely to expand in future because Turkey’s opening to Africa has created new markets and investment potential that will increase Africa’s participation in global economy and enhance Turkey’s role as a major player in the politics of resource allocation in the international economic system.

F50|The Economics of Growth|This comprehensive introduction to economic growth presents the main facts and puzzles about growth, proposes simple methods and models needed to explain these facts, acquaints the reader with the most recent theoretical and empirical developments, and provides tools with which to analyze policy design. The treatment of growth theory is fully accessible to students with a background no more advanced than elementary calculus and probability theory; the reader need not master all the subtleties of dynamic programming and stochastic processes to learn what is essential about such issues as cross-country convergence, the effects of financial development on growth, and the consequences of globalization. The book, which grew out of courses taught by the authors at Harvard and Brown universities, can be used both by advanced undergraduate and graduate students, and as a reference for professional economists in government or international financial organizations. The Economics of Growth first presents the main growth paradigms: the neoclassical model, the AK model, Romer's product variety model, and the Schumpeterian model. The text then builds on the main paradigms to shed light on the dynamic process of growth and development, discussing such topics as club convergence, directed technical change, the transition from Malthusian stagnation to sustained growth, general purpose technologies, and the recent debate over institutions versus human capital as the primary factor in cross-country income differences. Finally, the book focuses on growth policies—analyzing the effects of liberalizing market competition and entry, education policy, trade liberalization, environmental and resource constraints, and stabilization policy—and the methodology of growth policy design. All chapters include literature reviews and problem sets. An appendix covers basic concepts of econometrics.
