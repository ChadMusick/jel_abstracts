Q16|Immigrant Communities and Knowledge Spillovers: Danish-Americans and the Development of the Dairy Industry in the United States|Despite the growing literature on the impact of immigration, little is known about the role existing migrant settlements can play for knowledge transmission. We present a case which can illustrate this important mechanism and hypothesize that nineteenth century Danish-American communities helped spread knowledge on modern dairying to rural America. From around 1880, Denmark developed rapidly and by 1890 it was a world-leading dairy producer. Using a difference-in-differences strategy, and data taken from the US census and Danish emigration archives, we find that counties with more Danes in 1880 subsequently both specialized in dairying and used more modern practices.
Q16|Innovation Activities and Export Performance of Canadian Small and Medium-Sized Agri-Food Firms|Canadian small and medium-sized firms face two major challenges, namely, that of innovation in supporting their growth and improving their competitiveness and that of access to international markets. The objective of this study is to analyze the impact of research and Development (R&D) investment on the export performance of Canadian agri-food companies and on that of related sectors, namely, the textile and clothing sector and the manufacture of leather goods and similar products. We used impact assessment methods to analyze the effects of firms' innovation activities on their export performance. First, we analyzed explanatory factors for R&D expenses; second, we analyzed the impact of R&D on extensive (market access) and intensive (trade value) margins of trade. In doing so, we used Statistics Canada's National Accounts Longitudinal Microdata File (NALMF) for 2010 to 2015, which is coupled with the Trade by Exporter Characteristics (TEC) database. The size of firms and their support from the Canadian government affect their propensity to invest in R&D, the value of R&D expenses and their intensity, as measured from the ratio of R&D to sales of goods and services. Overall, our results show that investment in R&D has a positive impact on the export performance of agri-food SMEs. Les petites et moyennes entreprises (PME) canadiennes font face à deux grands enjeux soit celui de l’innovation afin notamment de soutenir leur croissance et améliorer leur compétitivité et celui de l’accès aux marchés internationaux. Le présent projet de recherche a pour objectif d’analyser l’impact des investissements en recherche et développement (R&D) sur les performances à l’exportation des entreprises agroalimentaires canadiennes et de celles de secteurs connexes soit les industries du textile et des vêtements et de la fabrication de produits du cuir et produits analogues. Les méthodes d’évaluation d’impact seront utilisées pour analyser les effets des activités d’innovation des entreprises sur leurs performances à l’exportation. Dans un premier temps, les facteurs explicatifs des investissements en R&D sont analysé. Puis nous analysons les effets des investissements en R&D sur les marges extensive (accès aux marchés) et intensive (valeur du commerce). Nous utilisons le Fichier de micro données longitudinales des comptes nationaux (NALMF) de Statistique Canada pour la période de 2010 à 2015 qui est couplé au fichier du programme de Commerce selon les caractéristiques des exportateurs (TEC). La taille des entreprises et l’appui du gouvernement canadien sont déterminants dans la probabilité d’investir dans la R&D ainsi que le montant de ces investissements et son intensité mesurée par le ratio du montant investit sur les ventes totales de biens et services des PME agroalimentaires.
Q16|Structural Transformation, Industrial Specialization, and Endogenous Growth|The introduction of new technologies in agriculture can foster structural transformation by freeing workers who find occupation in other sectors. The traditional view is that this increase in labor supply in manufacturing can lead to industrial development. However, when workers moving to manufacturing are mostly unskilled, this process reinforces a country's comparative advantage in low-skill intensive industries. To the extent that these industries undertake less R&D, this change in industrial composition can lead to lower long-run growth. We provide empirical evidence of this mechanism using a large and exogenous increase in agricultural productivity due to the legalization of genetically engineered soy in Brazil. Our results indicate that improvements in agricultural productivity, while positive in the short-run, can generate specialization in less-innovative industries and have negative effects on productivity in the long-run.
Q16|Determinantes de la productividad agrícola|Uno de los grandes desafíos que enfrenta el país es disminuir la desproporción en el desarrollo social y económico de las zonas urbanas y rurales. Para entender los retos detrás de este desafío es necesario tener una mirada comprensiva de las diferencias en las condiciones urbanas y rurales, tanto en términos de inclusión social, como productiva. En términos sociales los datos parecen mostrar la existencia de un círculo perverso que limita la acumulación de educación en las zonas rurales que, junto con unas bajas opciones de inserción productiva, conduce a un mercado de trabajo con unas condiciones precarias de empleabilidad, que se ve reflejado en bajos ingresos y pobreza. En cuanto al sector productivo, se observa que el acervo de condiciones naturales del país se encuentra en un nivel bajo de utilización, al mismo tiempo aquellos recursos que se utilizan no responden a su verdadera vocación productiva. En esa vía, se indago por los niveles de productividad agrícola y sus determinantes para varios cultivos (agroindustriales, frutales y cereales), teniendo en cuenta los diferentes niveles de la actividad agrícola: las características propias de los productores y de sus unidades productivas; de los aspectos institucionales con los que se cuenta (acceso a crédito, instrumentos de fomento, etc.), así como los aspectos las características geográficas (distancia a los centros principales de acopio, facilidad de acceso a los mercado, etc.).
Q16|Estudio sobre el impacto socioeconómico del sector agroindustrial de la caña en Colombia|Este estudio elaborado por Fedesarrollo para Asocaña identifica y cuantifica los impactos socioeconómicos de la agroindustria de la caña en Colombia, así como los impactos regionales de la actividad agrícola de la producción de caña de azúcar y de las actividades industriales de la producción de azúcar, bioetanol y cogeneración de energía. Los impactos se miden y se analizan a partir de métodos cuantitativos y cualitativos.
Q16|Technology Adoption and Access to Credit via Mobile Phones|Farmers in developing countries often lack access to timely and reliable information about modern technologies that are essential to improve agricultural productivity. The recent diffusion of mobile phones has the potential to overcome these barriers by making information available to those previously unconnected. In this paper we study the effect of mobile phone network expansion in rural India on adoption of high yielding variety seeds and chemical fertilizers. Our empirical strategy exploits geographical variation in the construction of mobile phone towers under a large government program targeting areas without existing coverage. To explore the role of mobile phones in mitigating information frictions we analyze the content of 1.4 million phone calls made by farmers to a major call center for agricultural advice. Farmers seek advice on which seed varieties and fertilizers better meet their needs and how to use them. We find that areas receiving mobile phone coverage experience higher adoption of these technologies. We also observe that farmers are often unaware of the eligibility criteria and loan terms offered by subsidized credit programs. Consistently, we find that areas receiving mobile phone coverage experience higher take-up of agricultural credit.
Q16|The relationship between fuel and food prices: Methods, outcomes, and lessons for commodity price risk management|We review the fuel-food price linkage models of the time series, structural, and general or partial equilibrium nature with the main attention devoted to the time series literature. Our assessment is nested in the discussion of general commodity prices co-movement on one side and in the prediction of most likely development of biofuel policies and production development on the other side. We pay particular attention to financial markets relevant features of commodity price co-movement significant for price risk management. We show that indeed the introduction of significant biofuels policies around 2005 increased the price transmission between fossil fuels and food commodities with intuitively expected prevailing leading role of fuel prices over food prices and with particular price linkages dynamically evolving in time and depending on the particular market under consideration. The econometric results show that due to the policy induced trade barriers, there is no evidence of sufficiently integrated international biofuels market with the US, European and Brazilian markets and policies following separate paths.
Q16|Valuing meteorological services in resource-constrained settings: Application to smallholder farmers in the Peruvian Altiplano|Changing climate and weather patterns have resulted in reduced agricultural productivity in some parts of the world and put pressure on global food security. Availability and improved quality of meteorological information is seen as a potentially propitious means of adaptation to changing climate conditions. Forecasts of extreme weather events are especially valuable in resource-poor settings where climate-related vulnerability is high, such as for smallholder farmers in the developing world. In this paper we provide estimates of frost warnings valuation in the context of small-scale quinoa production in the Peruvian Altiplano. We first present a detailed contextual assessment of quinoa production in the study region based on agrometeorological and socio-economic data that was obtained through a representative farm household survey conducted in December 2016. Building on this assessment, we propose a stochastic life-cycle model, replicating the lifetime cycle of a quinoa-producing household, in order to derive a theoretical valuation of frost warnings. Calibrating the model to our data we provide estimates of potential frost-warning valuation which are in the range of $30-50 per household and year, depending on the forecast accuracy and agents' risk aversion. In a last step, using the observational data from the farm household survey, we show that access to existing meteorological services is empirically associated with avoided losses in agricultural production that amount to $18 per average household and per year. Our findings point to high climate vulnerabilities of smallholders in the Peruvian Altiplano and potentially large welfare gains from incorporating improved meteorological services into their decision-making process.
Q16|Geography of public service delivery in rural Ethiopia|Remote areas are often characterized by lower welfare outcomes due to economic disadvantages and higher transaction costs for trade. But their worse situation may also be linked to worse public service delivery. Relying on large household surveys in rural Ethiopia, we explore this by assessing the association of two measures of remoteness – (1) the distance of villages and primary service centers to district capitals and (2) the distance of households to service centers (the last mile) – with public service delivery in agriculture and health sectors. In the agriculture sector, we document statistically significant and economically meaningful associations between exposure to agriculture extension and the two measures of remoteness. For health extension, only the last mile matters. These differences between the two sectors could be due to the fact that more remote villages tend to have fewer agriculture extension workers who also put in fewer hours than their peers in more connected areas. This does not apply in the health sector. These findings provide valuable inputs for policymakers aiming to improve inclusiveness in poor rural areas.
Q16|Agriculture in 2018: decline or growth?|Over recent years, agriculture – if we choose to look at available data prior to their adjustment based on the results of the All-Russia Agricultural Census – has been growing at a sufficiently high rate: in 2013 – by 5.8 percent, in 2014 – by 3.5, in 2015 – by 2.6, in 2016 – by 4.8, and in 2017 – by 2.5 percent3. Overall, growth over the course of 5 years amounted to 20.7 percent. Based on Rosstat’s current statistics, managers on both the federal and regional levels describe the development pattern of the agroindustrial complex (AIC) as a breakthrough and a leap forward. We likewise mentioned this fact in our overviews released over several previous years2. However, in 2018, there were some problems involved in the estimation of the growth rate both for 2018 and for the previous years.
Q16|Off-Farm Participation, Agricultural Production and Farmersâ€™ Welfare in Tanzania and Uganda|Panel data from the Living Standards Measurement Study-Integrated Surveys on Agriculture for Tanzania and Uganda were analyzed to investigate the impact of off-farm participation on agricultural production and farmersâ€™ welfare. Using strategies ranging from simple least squares to a dynamic panel model, we demonstrated how each of the intermediate models, such as the random effects Tobit model, could tackle censoring bias. Our results reveal that off-farm participation had a negative impact on agricultural production in both countries, though the impact was positive on welfare for Tanzania only. Policy makers should consider the complexities surrounding the formulation of pro-agriculture and pro-welfare policies aimed at producing desirable outcomes from off-farm participation. In that effort, policies that minimize the trade-off between agricultural production and off-farm participation and which enhance positive welfare effects are vital.
Q16|The Effects of Decentralized and Video-based Extension on the Adoption of Integrated Soil Fertility Management – Experimental Evidence from Ethiopia|The slow adoption of new agricultural technologies is an important factor in explaining persistent productivity deficits among smallholders in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Farmers delay in particular the uptake of technology packages. Since knowledge constraints are an important barrier to adoption, effective extension approaches are key. In recent decades, extension systems in many SSA countries have moved towards decentralized “bottom-up” models involving farmers as active stakeholders. In this study we assess the effects of a decentralized extension program and an additional video intervention on the adoption of integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) among 2,382 farmers in Ethiopia using a randomized controlled trial. ISFM should enhance soil fertility and productivity by combining organic and inorganic soil amendments. We find that both extension-only and extension combined with video increase ISFM adoption and knowledge. We further find evidence for increased adoption of ISFM practices among farmers in treatment communities that do not actively participate in the extension activities. The additional video intervention shows a significant complementary effect for these non-actively involved farmers, in particular regarding the combined use of the practices on the same plot. A causal mediation analysis reveals that increases in knowledge explain part of the treatment effects on adoption.
Q16|From Learning to Doing: Diffusion of Agricultural Innovations in Guinea-Bissau|This paper analyzes the role of social networks in the diffusion of knowledge and adoption of cultivation techniques, from trainees to the wider community, in the context of an extension project in Guinea-Bissau. In order to test for social learning, we exploit a detailed census of households and social connections across different dimensions. More precisely, we make use of a village photo directory in order to obtain a comprehensive and fully mapped social network dataset. We find evidence that agricultural information spreads across networks from project participants to non-participants, with different networks having different importance. The most relevant connection is found to be between the network of people from which individuals would ‘borrow money’. We are also able to disentangle the relative importance of weak and strong ties: in our context, weak ties are as important in the diffusion of agricultural knowledge as strong ties. Despite positive diffusion effects in knowledge, we found limited evidence of network effects in adoption behavior. Finally, using longitudinal network data, we document improvements in the network position of treated farmers over time.
Q16|Local Effects of Land Grant Colleges on Agricultural Innovation and Output|To estimate the local effect of establishing land grant colleges, I compare locations that receive a land grant college to “runner-up” counties that were in contention to receive the land grant but did not for as-good-as-random reasons. I find that establishing a land grant college causes an increase in local invention, including in particular agricultural inventions, in college counties relative to the runner-up counties. But land grant college counties see only small and imprecisely estimated improvements in agricultural performance, measured by yield and output, relative to runner-up counties. I discuss several alternative interpretations of these findings. By comparing the establishment of land grant colleges to non-land grant colleges, I show that land grants appear to cause smaller increases in local invention, population, and agricultural output, but larger increases in agricultural yields and new crop varieties. The effect of land grant colleges on local innovations is largest, even relative to non-land grant colleges, following the passage of legislation that increases funding to agricultural research.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Q16|Digital Opportunities for Trade in the Agriculture and Food Sectors|How are new opportunities to create and share information shaping the digital transformation of the agriculture and food system, and thus potentially fostering its reorganisation? This report focuses on cross-border trade aspects along the global agriculture and food value chain, and looks at how changes brought about by digital technologies can influence who participates in the value chain, where value added is created, and how value is distributed between actors in the chain. However, it is not only changes in the agriculture and food sector from digital technologies that matters, but also the digital transformation of other actors in the global value chain (GVC) such as support services, logistics and governments. Digital technologies present a potential to reduce trade and transaction costs, including those related to identifying and negotiating a deal, proving compliance with standards and to delivering products across borders quickly and efficiently.
Q16|Technology Advancement & Its Adoption: A Booster for Sericulture Development and Expansion in Madhya Pradesh, India|Sericulture, as an agro based artisanal industry, has proved its potential in raising sustainable income and employment in the rural sector of both traditional and non-traditional states of India. The entire gamut of production in sericulture generates huge economic growth for small villages and its inhabitants and restrict rural to urban migration. This study is based on primary data of sample size 50 which belong to the sericulture farmers and artisans in Burhanpur district of Madhya Pradesh, India. The paper analyzes their knowledge level on improved technology and the adoption level of this advanced technology in sericulture business. The knowledge of technology has found to have greater impact on improving the productivity and production in terms of agriculture as well as its allied activities. This study finds out significant positive impact of variables like, full and partial knowledge about advanced technology and its adoption on the development of the sector. Farmers’ perception about ‘high cost of technology adoption’ and ‘lack of awareness’ are two chief reasons for their non-adoption of the technical advancement. So knowledge and adoption level of advance technology need to be synchronized and extended to base level, making it more cost efficient and easily available to poor farmers and artisans.
Q16|Анализ На Състоянието На Системата За Споделяне На Знания И Иновации В Селското Стопанство В България<BR>[Analysis of the State of the System of Sharing of Knowledge and Innovations in Bulgarian Agriculture]|This study analyses the state and development of the system of sharing of knowledge, innovations and digitalisation of Bulgarian agriculture. First, the scope of the study and information sources are outlined. After that analysis is made of the state and evolution of the research and development activity in Bulgaria. Following is the analysis of the state and development of major agents in the system of sharing knowledge and innovations in agriculture and the relations - the system of agrarian research, the system of agrarian education, advises and consultations, and the system of application of agrarian innovations. Next, the state and evolution of the digitalisation in agriculture and rural regions are analysed. After that the results of an expect assessments on the state, efficiency and factors of development of the system of sharing of knowledge, innovations and digitalisation in agriculture are presented. Finally, conclusions of the study are made.
Q16|Teknik Penanaman Jajar Legowo untuk Peningkatan Produktivitas Padi Sawah di Jawa Tengah<BR>[Jajar legowo cultivation technique to improve the yield of wetland paddy in Central Province]|This research is aimed to analyse the distribution of a cultivation technique of wetland paddy so-called “Jajar Legowo” in Central Java Province as well as its impact on paddy productivity. We made use of the Results of the 2017 Cost Structure of Food Crops Cultivation Survey carried out by Statistics Indonesia (BPS). A spatial analysis and an estimation of Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression model was used to achieve aims. Our results pointed out that the wetland paddy households implementing the technique only made up about 32.05 per cent of the total number of wetland paddy households in Central Java. They were concentrated in some municipalities, i.e., Prubalingga, Banjarnegara, Grobogan, Kudus, Demak, Temanggung and Kendal. Meanwhile, the OLS estimations showed that the technique has a significant impact in boosting productivity up to 16 per cent compared to other cultivation techniques. Therefore, it could be a key measure in increasing rice production in Central Java. Moreover, our findings also pointed out that other measures such as enhancing the capacity of farmers, the use of high-quality seed and mechanisation and improving the access on financial resources also have a pivotal role in improving the productivity of paddy in the province.
Q16|Wahrnehmungen und Erfahrungen von Landwirtinnen und Landwirten in SüdostÖsterreich zu betrieblichen und regionalen Maßnahmen zur Regulierung des Westlichen Maiswurzelbohrers|Die Etablierung des Westlichen Maiswurzelbohrers (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera) stellt eine zentrale Herausforderung für die österreichische Maisproduktion dar. Eine aktive Regulierung ist unerlässlich, um weitere Schäden zu verhindern bzw. zu reduzieren. Die Umsetzung bzw. Nicht-Umsetzung von einzelbetrieblichen Maßnahmen, z.B. Fruchtfolgen oder Pestizidanwendungen, hat insbesondere in kleinstrukturierten österreichischen Agrarlandschaften Auswirkungen auf benachbarte Betriebe. Die Anwendung von Maßnahmen auf regionaler Ebene in Zusammenhang mit dem WMB, z.B. die Koordination von Fruchtfolgen oder Pestizidanwendungen, ist bisher gering. Um entsprechende Maßnahmen – auf einzelbetrieblicher sowie regionaler Ebene – aus Sicht der Beratung und Politik zu unterstützen, bedarf es der Kenntnis von Wahrnehmungen und Erfahrungen betroffener LandwirtInnen. Im Herbst 2017 wurden 23 leitfadengestützte Interviews mit betroffenen LandwirtInnen in der Projektregion der ARGE Innobrotics (Burgenland, Kärnten, Steiermark) geführt. Die Auswertung der Interviews erfolgte mit Hilfe einer qualitativen Inhaltsanalyse. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die Anwendung von Maßnahmen zur Regulierung des WMB von zahlreichen Faktoren beeinflusst wird, darunter den persönlichen Kenntnissen und betrieblichen Gegebenheiten, der wahrgenommenen Wirksamkeit, dem Betriebstyp oder der landwirtschaftlichen Struktur. Weiters spielen äußere Rahmenbedingungen, wie rechtliche Vorschriften, klimatische Bedingungen, ökonomische Aspekte oder das wahrgenommene Verständnis der Gesellschaft gegenüber den Maßnahmen eine wichtige Rolle. Zudem beeinflussen persönliche Erfahrungen und Einstellungen, wie das wahrgenommene Schadensausmaß oder wahrgenommene Umweltauswirkungen von Pestizidanwendungen, die Umsetzung. Die Notwendigkeit der aktiven WMB-Regulierung wird von allen befragten LandwirtInnen erkannt, die Wahl der Maßnahmenkombinationen ist aber heterogen. Maßnahmenvorschläge zur Regulierung auf regionaler Ebene werden positiv beurteilt. Eine Umsetzung können sich viele befragte LandwirtInnen jedoch nicht vorstellen, wenngleich einzelne von Planungen bzw. auch erfolgreichen Umsetzungen auf regionaler Ebene berichten.
Q16|Perceptions des consommateurs de la sortie de Lidl du hard discount alimentaire en France|"In 2012, the French Lidl top management announced a major strategy change of the ""low cost"" food specialist. A comprehensive plan is then implemented both in terms of investment and organization of stores and in terms of communication and image change of the retailer. Based on two surveys of French consumers, we asked about consumer perceptions of the image of Food hard discounter of Lidl. Our results show a perceived ""repositioning"" Lidl, and a relative gain in competitiveness. ....French Abstract: En 2012, la direction de l’enseigne Lidl en France annonçait un changement majeur de la stratégie du pionnier du « low cost » alimentaire. Un vaste plan est alors mis en place en termes d’investissement, d’organisation des magasins de communication et d’image du distributeur. Les perceptions des consommateurs de l’image de Lidl ont été recueillies via deux enquêtes (2011 et 2016). Nos résultats montrent un « repositionnement » perçu de l’image de Lidl et un gain relatif en compétitivité."
Q16|Effects of information and seedling provision on tree planting and survival in smallholder oil palm plantations|Oil palm expansion in Indonesia is associated with a reduction in biodiversity and ecosystem services, as well as livelihood improvements for smallholder farmers. While this dichotomy highlights the importance of sustainable management options, empirical evidence on which policies are effective in stimulating biodiversity-friendly plantation management is relatively scarce. This paper addresses this gap by presenting results from a randomized controlled trial implemented in Jambi province, Sumatra, in 2016. We focus on native tree planting in oil palm plantations as one sustainable management option. To test whether information and input provision affect the number of trees planted by smallholders two treatments were designed: the first provided information about tree planting in oil palm, while the second combined information and seedling delivery. We model adoption in a double-hurdle framework where farmers first decide whether to adopt or not and then how many trees they plant per hectare. Our results suggest that both interventions are effective in stimulating tree planting in oil palm. Seedling provision in combination with information leads to a higher probability of adoption, but farmers plant on average relatively few trees per hectare. In contrast, in the informational treatment, few farmers adopt, but they plant more trees per hectare than farmers who received seedlings. Furthermore, we observe that the survival rate of trees planted is lower for farmers who received seedlings in comparison to farmers who only received information. Since we cannot find evidence for farmer and plot selection effects, it is likely that species choice and seedling quality are the underlying drivers of this difference.
Q16|Agricultural extension, intra-household allocation and malaria|Can agricultural development programs improve health-related outcomes? We exploit a spatial discontinuity in the coverage of a large-scale agricultural extension program in Uganda to causally identify its effects on malaria. We find that eligibility for the program reduced the proportion of household members with malaria by 8.9 percentage points, with children and pregnant women experiencing substantial improvements. An examination of the underlying mechanisms indicates that an increase in income and the resulting increase in the ownership and usage of bednets may have played a role. Taken together, these results signify the importance of financial constraints in investments for malaria prevention and the potential role that agricultural development can play in easing it.
Q16|Immigrant Communities and Knowledge Spillovers: DanishAmericans and the Development of the Dairy Industry in the United States|Despite the growing literature on the impact of immigration, little is known about the role existing migrant settlements can play for knowledge transmission. We present a case which can illustrate this important mechanism and hypothesize that nineteenth century Danish-American communities helped spread knowledge on modern dairying to rural America. From around 1880, Denmark developed rapidly and by 1890 it was a world-leading dairy producer. Using a difference-in-differences strategy, and data taken from the US census and Danish emigration archives, we find that counties with more Danes in 1880 subsequently both specialized in dairying and used more modern practices.
Q16|Resistant grape varieties and market acceptance:an evaluation based on experimental economics|We analyze consumers’ evaluations of white wines from resistant varieties, produced in the Languedoc winegrowing region of France (2016 vintage). We use the results from a laboratory experiment performed in Paris in June 2017, where a panel of more than one hundred and sixty consumers, regular buyers of this type of wine, were asked to evaluate a wine of the Bouquet 3159 grape variety (monogenic variety resistant to mildew and powdery mildew and optimized for quality) and compare it with two conventional wines of different quality levels, and with a certified organic wine of similar type and price. The environmental and health performances and the production methods of the different wines were quantified according to several indicators: treatment frequency indicator (TFI) and pesticide residue analysis.\r\nThe consumers first evaluated the wines after tasting, having been given only a minimum amount of information about the region of origin and the vintage, then again after receiving information on production methods and the levels of our indicators. The method used to lend credibility to individual valuations used experimental economics, via a mechanism based on direct disclosure of their willingness to pay (maximum purchase price for a bottle of wine according to available information). The results showed that, on a purely sensory level, consumers had difficulty in accepting wine from a resistant variety. We were then able to see that communication focusing on environmental and health performances very much improved the position of the resistant variety of wine, putting it ultimately at the top of the average qualitative evaluations. In economic terms, we show that this promotion results in high market share, gained from conventional wines. Market share losses were lower, however, for the premium conventional wine, suggesting that the higher quality wines would be less directly challenged by wines produced from resistant varieties.
Q16|Impact Of Climate Dynamics On Cyclical Properties Of Wine Production In Douro Region Using A Time-Frequency Approach|In this paper we model the impact of climate dynamics on wine production temporal cycles for the period 1933 to 2013 in the Douro wine region. We identify the cyclical properties of wine production and which cycles are de-termined by spring temperature and soil water levels during summer. We find that the in-season spring temperature as well as the temperatures of two and three years ago explain about 65% of the variability of wine pro-duction. When the soil water level in summer is incorporated, the R2 in-creases to 83% minimizing the Akaike criterion. The effects of soil water in wine production are depending on the timing. The in-season effect of an increase in soil water is negative, whilst soil water from two and three years ago have a positive effect on wine production. There is a stable but non- constant link between production and the spring temperature. The temper-ature is responsible for two long-medium cycles of 5.8 year and 4.2 years as well as a short one of 2.4 years that began since the 80s. The soil water level can explain 60% of the 7 years cycles of wine production as well as a short one of 2.3 years cycle which has been happening since the 90s. We also identify a shift of the relative importance away from temperature to soil water. Despite using a new an extended dataset, our results largely confirm the results of the impact of climate on the wine production in Douro region in our previous research. Modelling the impact of climate on the wine production can be an important instrument contributing for mitigation strategies facing the projected climate conditions in order to remain com-petitive in the market.
Q16|Coordination and information sharing about pest resistance|We develop a dynamic oligopolistic Cournot model of a pesticide market where resistance to pesticides can develop. We first study firms' incentives for resistance management through pricing and we distinguish two cases of demand for pesticides; one where users are able to coordinate their pesticide use and one where they are not. We show that users benefit from coordination, but that this gain is at the expense of firms facing a lower demand. When firms are allowed to obtain scientific information on the likelihood of pest resistance and, possibly, to share this information among themselves, we find that they have an incentive to acquire information and to share it with competitors. They also benefit from transmitting this information to users if the latter are coordinated. In the case of uncoordinated users, transmission of information to users is not necessarily profitable for firms if it favors their coordination. Finally, we discuss the policy implications for existing information sharing committees in the pesticide industry.
Q16|On the link between oil and agricultural commodity prices: Do biofuels matter?|The aim of this paper is to investigate the long-term effect of the price of oil on agricultural commodity prices by accounting for the influence of biofuel production. Relying on the estimation of nonlinear, cointegrating regime-switching processes, we show that biofuel development has led to an increase in the oil-price effect on agricultural commodity prices: the growing production of biofuels is contributing to the price rise of agricultural commodities. This result underlines the importance of considering alternative biofuels which are not produced from agricultural commodities, and of analyzing the potential effects of the second-generation biofuels derived from agricultural plant residuals or non-food plants.

Q16|On the current account - biofuels link in emerging and developing countries: do oil price fluctuations matter?|Many developed countries promote the use of biofuels for environmental concerns, leading to a rise in the price of agricultural commodities utilized in their production. Such environmental policies have major effects on the economy of emerging and developing countries whose activity is highly dependent on agricultural commodities involved in biofuel production. This paper tackles this issue by examining the price impact of biofuels on the current account for a panel of 16 developing and emerging countries, and the potential nonlinear effect exerted by the price of oil on this relationship. Relying on the estimation of panel smooth-transition regression models, we show that positive shocks in the price of biofuels lead to a current-account improvement for agricultural commodity exporters (resp. producers) only when the price of oil is below 45 (resp. 56) US dollars per barrel. When the price of oil exceeds these thresholds, the effect of fluctuations in the price of biofuels on the current account tends to weaken and become non significant. Under these conditions, our findings indicate that, for agricultural commodity exporters which are also oil importers, the current account is pulled by two opposite forces, making its overall reaction modest or even nil.
Q16|Income-generating Effects of Biofuel Policies: A Meta-analysis of the CGE Literature|While the production of biofuels has expanded in recent years, findings in the literature on its impact on economic growth and development remain contradictory. This paper presents a meta-analysis of computable general equilibrium (CGE) studies published between 2006 and 2017 on the effect of biofuel production on economic development worldwide. Using 30 CGE studies, we found that biofuel-supportive policies generated significant impacts on GDP and household incomes. CGE studies included in our database reported an average 0.25 percentage point increase in GDP and a 0.49 percentage point increase in household incomes. We also found that results were driven by several key features of the CGE studies included in our database. We investigated features such as biofuel type, geographic area, and characteristics of the CGE models employed. We found that biofuel expansion has heterogeneous effects in developed versus emerging countries. Simulations on longer time periods and in multi-country studies led to results that indicate higher impacts of biofuel expansion on GDP growth and household incomes. Moreover, simulations with an increase in agricultural productivity indicate positive welfare impact gains, unlike simulations with land expansion. Lastly, we found that biodiesel development leads to higher welfare impact gains than that of bioethanol.
Q16|Does the expansion of biofuels encroach on the forest?|In this paper, we explore the role of biofuel production on deforestation in low- and middle-income countries. Since the 2000s, biofuel production has been rapidly developing to address issues of economic development, energy poverty and reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the sustainability of biofuels is being challenged, particularly at the environmental level, due to their impact on deforestation and the GHG emissions they can generate as a result of land-use changes. In order to isolate the impact of bioethanol and biodiesel production among classic determinants of deforestation, we used a fixed effects panel model of 112 low- and middle-income countries between 2001 and 2012. Firstly, we found a positive relationship between bioethanol production and deforestation in these countries, among which we highlighted the specificity of Upper-Middle-Income Countries (UMICs). An acceleration of incentives for the production of biofuels from 2006 onwards enabled us to highlight higher marginal impacts for the production of bioethanol in the case of low- and middle-income countries and UMICs. Secondly, for low- and middle-income countries, these results are not significant before 2006. Thirdly, biodiesel production appears to have an impact on deforestation before 2006 on both subsamples. These last two results seem surprising and could be related to the role of biofuel production technologies and the crop yields used in their production.
Q16|Les « upgradings stratégiques » des firmes subordonnées dans les CGV : le cas des éleveurs investissant dans des unités de méthanisation|?This article considers the analysis of upgrading strategies, focusing at the level of subordinate firms themselves, with a more classical study at the GVC level. This approach develops the concept of ?strategic upgrading,? studies the institutional environment of subordinate firms, and draws on concepts from industrial economics, such as differentiation, diversification, and specialization, in order to understand these firms? strategies. It thus reexamines the category of inter-chain upgrading, i.e., the improvement of the position of actors of a GVC by integrating a new GVC. We confront this proposal with a territorialized case study on the development of biogas production by farmers in the Ardennes. We observe that these farmers are part of the emerging GVC of biomass energy based on their experience as ?captive? actors in the agro-industrial GVC. In particular, they have sized their biogas production units to be autonomous regarding agro-industry. This new activity also has feedback effects on their positioning in the agro-industrial GVC. ? ?JEL classification: ? ?L22, L23, Q13, Q16, Q42.?
Q16|Farm Size, Technology Adoption and Agricultural Trade Reform: Evidence from Canada|Using detailed census data covering over 40,000 farms in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, Canada, we document the vast and increasing farm size heterogeneity, and analyze the role of farm size in adapting to the removal of an export subsidy in 1995. We find that larger farms were more likely to switch to new labor-saving tillage technologies in response to the large negative shock to grain prices caused by the reform. Small- and medium-sized farms responded to the reform by adopting the more affordable minimum tillage technology. We develop a simple model of heterogeneous farms and technology adoption that can explain our findings. The results suggest that farm size plays a crucial role in determining farm-level adaptation to agricultural trade reform. Consistent with the Alchian-Allen hypothesis, the increase in per-unit trade costs due to the reform was associated with farms shifting their production of crops from low-value wheat to higher value canola.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Q16|Technology Classification for the Purposes of Futures Studies|The paper analyses problems associated with technologies classification for the purposes of futures studies, in order to ensure definitive inclusion of technologies in specific classes/types when conventional approaches to classification are applied. The evolution of classification approaches in the scope of science philosophy is shortly reviewed, together with the latest research on expert-based and computerised (algorithmic) classification and methodological dilemmas related to hierarchical aggregation of technological and production processes are analysed. Common problems with classifying technologies and industries frequently encountered in the age of converging technologies are examined, using the agricultural sector and related industries as an example. A case study of computerised classification of agricultural technologies based on clustering algorithms is presented, with a brief analysis of the potential and limitations of the methodology. For doing so a two-stage approach to classifying technologies is suggested, based on distinguishing between platform (multipurpose) and industry-specific technologies. An adaptive approach to analysing technological structures is proposed, based on many-to-many relationships and fuzzy logic principles.
Q16|The impact of private R&D on the performance of food-processing firms: Evidence from Europe, Japan and North America|This report investigates the impact of corporate research and development (R&D) on firm performance in the food-processing industry. The agro-food industry is usually considered to be a low-tech sector (the share of total output that is attributable to R&D is around 0.27% in the EU). However, the agro-food industry is very heterogeneous. On the one hand, there are many highly innovative food-processing firms with intensive R&D activity and, on the other hand, many food-processing firms derive and adopt innovations from other sectors such as machinery, packaging and other manufacturing suppliers. We perform data envelopment analysis (DEA) with two-step bootstrapping, which allows us to correct the bias in (in)efficiency and generate unbiased estimates for (in)efficiencies. We use a corporate dataset of 307 companies from agriculture and food-processing industries from the EU, the USA, Canada and Japan for the period 1991â€“2009. The estimates suggest that R&D has a positive effect on firmsâ€™ performance, with marginal gains decreasing at the R&D level, and performance differences detected across regions and food sectors. General public expenditure in R&D is also associated with a positive impact on firm performance. As a result, policy support for this type of non-high-tech innovative sector is expected to generate growth. However, results that suggest heterogeneity in R&D effects across EU Member States may point to differences in the implications of innovation policies across EU regions.
Q16|Effects of trade policy on technological innovation in agricultural markets - implications for the developing economies|An induced technological innovation, which may be biased as a result of policy orientation, can have a complex impact on the traded commodity, particularly in a market with highly differentiated products. Furthermore, especially for developing countries, most of which are based on agriculture, it is important to understanding that impact. This paper aims to study a recent policy change at the European Union, by using an Ex-Ante method and a displacement model. The policy change affected global apple exports, particularly for large exporters such as China, South Africa, Chile, and the United States. Considering data availability, the project focuses on the U.S. market to study the impact of the EU’s policy-induced, biased, and technological innovation in the U.S. agricultural industry. The results and policies implications are generally applicable to other major agricultural exporters, including those from developing countries.
Q16|Factors affecting farmers’ WTP for innovative fertilizer against soil salinity|Salt stress noxiously shocks agricultural yield all over the world affecting production either it is for subsistence or economic outcomes. However, the market for anti-salinity products is still developing and little is known about the willingness to pay for agricultural supplies, these have been largely focused on using stated preference methods only. This paper applied both Contingent and Inferred Valuation Method for the purpose of examining the determinants of farmers’ willingness to pay for two packages of an innovative anti-salinity fertilizer, which does not yet exist in the market, in the regions of southwest Greece. With the aid of questionnaire, primary data were obtained from 150 farmers. Willingness to pay for the two packages of liquid fertilizer was measured through dichotomous choice. For the econometric analysis, interval regression model was used. The results revealed that farmers’ willingness to pay for the specific anti-salinity product is influenced by a host of factors. Especially, the regression showed that the size of cultivated land, the level of education, the knowledge scale about salinity, the package of liquid fertilizer that farmers usually buy and the consequentiality script have a positive effect on willingness to pay, whilst hypothetical bias and inferred valuation method have a negative effect. Also, we examined a methodological issue concerning the order that the package of fertilizer was appeared in the willingness to pay question which has a positive effect on willingness to pay. The implication is that taking these factors into account while large companies are looking for new and profitable products by investing for research and development enables companies’ managers to come up with projects that win acceptance from the farmers.
Q16|Droits de propriété foncière et performance des petits producteurs agricoles des pays en développement : une synthèse de la littérature empirique|This article reviews the methods and results of empirical studies analyzing the impact of land property rights on the performance of smallholder farmers in developing countries. The results of previous empirical studies are mixed about the real effects of land property rights. The heterogeneity of the results is related to both the evaluation techniques used and the local context of the tenure system’s management. However, the results converge toward an endogenous relationship between land property rights and smallholder farmers’ performance in contexts where customary land management is predominant. Cet article fait la revue critique des méthodes et résultats des études empiriques qui analysent l’impact des droits de propriété foncière sur la performance des petits producteurs agricoles des pays en développement. Les résultats des études empiriques antérieures sont contrastés quant aux effets réels des droits de propriété. L’hétérogénéité des résultats est liée à la fois aux techniques d’évaluation utilisées et au contexte local de gestion du système foncier. Toutefois, les résultats convergent vers une endogénéité entre les droits de propriété et la performance des producteurs dans les contextes où la gestion coutumière du foncier est prédominante.
Q16|Estudio sobre el impacto socioeconómico del sector agroindustrial de la caña en Colombia|El presente estudio identifica y cuantifica los impactos socioeconómicos de la agroindustria de la caña en Colombia, así como los impactos regionales de la actividad agrícola de la producción de caña de azúcar y de las actividades industriales de la producción de azúcar, bioetanol y cogeneración de energía. Los impactos se miden y se analizan a partir de métodos cuantitativos y cualitativos.
Q16|Market Timing with Moving Averages for Fossil Fuel and Renewable Energy Stocks|The paper examines whether the moving average (MA) technique can beat random market timing in traditional and newer branches of an industrial sector. The sector considered is the energy sector, divided into balanced stock portfolios of fossil and renewable energy companies. Eight representative firms are selected for both portfolios. The paper finds that MA timing outperforms random timing with the portfolio of renewable energy companies, whereas the result is less clear with the portfolio of fossil energy companies. Thus, there seems to be more forecastable stochastic trends in sunrise branches than in sunset branches.
Q16|Division of Labour Amongst Innovation Intermediaries in Agricultural Innovation Systems: The Case of Indonesia|Innovation intermediaries are individuals and organisations that enhance connectivity amongst constituencies of national, sectoral, and regional systems of innovation, thereby facilitating knowledge spillover. This paper articulates the whole picture of Indonesia’s agricultural innovation system, with a special focus on how different innovation intermediaries play different roles in technology transfer and knowledge dissemination. First, the public sector accounts for more than half of the actors involved in research and extension, but insufficient routes to transfer local needs to the public sector impede efficient feedback. Second, village unit cooperatives are closely associated with extension workers, suggesting the presence of a feedback mechanism, but many of them face serious financial distress. Third, private agricultural research and development and extension are organised and managed efficiently where they involve fewer internal actors working in an environment with minimal bureaucracy. However, a vague regulatory environment makes it difficult for multinational enterprises to hold a positive view towards agricultural research and development and extension from the public sector. Last, the changing governance system and the ensuing shift in political decision-making have introduced uncertainties to the arrangement of actors and resources in the system, which may take some time to resolve.
Q16|The Relationship Between Fuel, Biofuel and Food Prices: Methods and Outcomes|We assess the fuel-food price linkage models of the structural and of the time series nature with the main attention devoted to the time series literature. We document shifting focus from a straightforward vector autoregressive and error-correction analysis of fuel-food commodity price level co-movement towards inclusion of biodiesel and ethanol prices directly into analysis, towards consideration of both price levels and price volatilities, and towards growing sophistication of econometric methodologies and integration of econometrics of price co-movement with theoretical considerations. The key insight of biofuels price transmission literature is that the price transmission is time and market specific, evolving with the development of biofuels policies and technologies. The most prominent relationships are coming from oil to agricultural commodities and then towards biofuels. While here are also studies not finding any strong connection between biofuels and their feedstock, the literature finding biofuels driving the prices of agricultural commodities up is negligible.
Q16|Farmers’ perception of Controlled Traffic Farming (CTF) and associated technologies|This report presents descriptive results from a recent survey conducted with the objective of assessing the use of Controlled Traffic Farming (CTF) practices and associated precision farming technologies among farmers in eight European countries. About 26 % of the surveyed farmers use some CTF systems of which 45 % apply CTF on their entire farm. For the CTF users, the major motives to use CTF are to reduce soil structure damage and to improve efficiency (reduce cost) followed by a desire to make more profit. Concern about heavy machinery – induced soil compaction and perceptions about the potentials of CTF are considerably high. However, adoption appears to be constrained mainly by: high cost of machinery modification and RTK purchase, lack of compatibility of equipment and also GPS systems from different manufacturers, and lack of decision support systems. Issues about evidence on demonstrated benefits under local conditions and availability of contractors are also mentioned as limiting factors.
Q16|Agricultural R&D investment, knowledge stocks and productivity growth in Latin America and the Caribbean:| Between 2001 and 2012, Latin America and the Caribbeanâ€™s (LAC) agriculture saw its best performance of the last 30 years. Given the importance of agricultural R&D investment to sustain agricultural growth in the future, this study looks at the state of agricultural R&D investment in LAC, and analyzes the role that this investment played in the performance of agriculture in recent years. This is done by developing a new approach for the estimation of knowledge stocks that allow us to obtain R&D elasticities and measures of return to R&D investment that avoid some of the major problems encountered in the literature that uses econometric methods.
Q16|Growth factors in the agriculture of Russia|In 2017, the harvest of cereals, including wheat, Russia’s top agricultural export commodity, hit its record high. This happened mostly due to a significant rise in wheat harvest against the three previous years (Tables 34, 35). At the same time, the record-high harvest caused problems with the transportation of grain from the regions of the Siberian Federal District. Agricultural producers also note a decline in the profitability of agricultural production (on the average, by 8.4 percent, to 12-14 percent[1]) due to the accelerated growth in the prices of inputs by comparison with that of the sales price of grain, which lagged behind because of the record-high harvest.

Q16|The Effects of Risk and Ambiguity Aversion on Technology Adoption: Evidence from Aquaculture in Ghana|We study how aversion to risk and ambiguity affects the adoption of new technologies by Ghanaian smallholder aquafarmers. We conduct a set of field experiments designed to elicit farmers's risk and ambiguity preferences and combine it with surveybased information on their technology adoption decisions. We find that aquafarmers who are more risk-averse were quicker to adopt the new technologies: a fast-growing breed of tilapia fish, extruded feed and floating cages. By contrast, ambiguity aversion has no effect on the adoption of the new tilapia breed and extruded feed. Furthermore, it slows down the adoption of floating cages - a technology which entails higher fixed costs than the others - and the effect is diminishing in the number of other adopters in the village. We argue that these differential effects are due to the fact that the technologies are risk-reducing, with potential ambiguity about their payoff distributions at the early stages of adoption. The findings highlight the importance of distinguishing between risk and ambiguity in investigating technology adoption decisions of small-holder farmers in developing countries.
Q16|How to Make Farming and Agricultural Extension More Nutrition-Sensitive: Evidence from a Randomized Controlled Trial in Kenya| We analyze how agricultural extension can be made more effective in terms of increasing smallholder farmers adoption of pro-nutrition technologies, such as biofortified crops. In a randomized controlled trial with farmers in Western Kenya, we implemented several extension treatments and evaluated their effects on the adoption of beans that were biofortified with iron and zinc. Difference-in-difference estimates show that intensive agricultural training tailored to local conditions can increase technology adoption considerably. Within less than one year, adoption of biofortified beans increased from almost zero to more than 20%. Providing additional nutrition training further increased adoption by another 10-12 percentage points, as this has helped farmers to better appreciate the technology s nutritional benefits. These results suggest that effective nutrition training through agricultural extension services is possible. Providing marketing training did not lead to additional adoption effects, although the study period may have been too short to measure these effects properly. This study is a first attempt to analyze how improved designs of agricultural extension can help to make smallholder farming more nutrition-sensitive. More research in this direction is needed. Key words: agricultural extension, technology adoption, biofortification, nutrition-sensitive agriculture, Kenya JEL codes: C93, O33, Q12, Q16, Q18 Acknowledgement : This research was financially supported by the German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) based on a decision of the Parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany (grant number 2813FSNu01).

Q16|International Agricultural Mitigation Research and the Impacts and Value of Two SLMACC Research Projects|Evaluating the benefits of publicly funded research is always a challenging task. This paper cannot produce air-tight quantification of the benefits of Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change (SLMACC) research. We do, however, demonstrate the key building blocks of significant impact have been obtained. First, it is clear that public funding has contributed importantly to New Zealand’s positioning itself as one of the leading global contributors to agricultural mitigation research. Second, the prominence of the research combined with the low likelihood of research occurring on this scale without public support suggests strongly that the results would not have been obtained absent public funding. Finally, though the realization of ultimate environmental and/or economic benefits will depend on the evolution of farming practices and climate change policy settings, the advances in genetic markers for low CH4 animals and identification of emission-reducing management practices have the potential for GHG emission reductions that would be significant in environmental terms, and whose value at likely carbon pricing levels would be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Although the results discussed are conditional on several factors such as future policy implementation, adoption rates and the practical availability of mitigation options and practices for different farm landscapes; the impacts, economic and environmental values attached to mitigation research cannot be overlooked and provide important insights to the benefits that public investments can make to the development of a more sustainable agricultural system for the country.
Q16|Two Blades of Grass: The Impact of the Green Revolution|We examine the impact of the Green Revolution, defined as the discusion of high-yielding crop varieties (HYVs), on aggregate economic outcomes in developing countries during the second half of the 20th century. We use time variation in the development and discusion of HYVs of 10 major crops, and the spatial variation in agro-climatically suitability for growing them, to identify the causal effects of adoption. In a sample of 84 counties, we estimate that a 10 percentage points increase in HYV adoption increases GDP per capita by about 15 percent. This effect is fully accounted for by a combination of the direct effect on crop yields, factor adjustment in agriculture, and structural transformation. Our analysis also reveals that the Green Revolution reduced fertility and that the reduction was only partly ofset by decreasing mortality rates. The net effect on population growth was therefore negative.

Chapters give a deep insights on diverse issues associated with agrarian and rural development in Bulgaria and China.
Q16|New Technological Knowledge, Rural and Urban Agriculture, and Steady State Economic Growth|Abstract We analyze the growth effects over space arising from the adoption of new agricultural technology in a rural-urban setting. We use a dynamic model to study the impacts of technology and learning on the steady state growth rates of rural and urban regions that produce agricultural goods. New applications of agricultural technologies are tested and adopted in the rural region and they are gradually learned by the urban region. Our analysis leads to four results. First, we determine the steady state growth rate of agricultural output per worker in the rural region. Second, we define an urban to rural region agricultural technology knowledge ratio, analyze its stability properties, and then use this ratio to compute the steady state growth rate of agricultural output per worker in the urban region. Third, for specific parameter values, we study the ratio of agricultural output per worker in the urban to the rural region when both regions have converged to their balanced growth paths. Finally, we discuss the policy implications of our analysis.
Q16|Analysis of Decision Factors to Purchase Organic Fertilizer by White Pepper Farmers|This study aims to determine the effect of farmers' perceptions of quality and attitudes toward purchasing decisions. Population in this study is white pepper farmers in Bangka Belitung Province, Indonesia. The method of determining the samples is performed by the quota method, based on sampling criteria performed then the number of samples selected as many as 97 farmers. The results show that the perception of quality has a positive and significant effect on purchasing decisions; the farmer's attitude has a positive and significant effect on purchasing decisions and simultaneously has a significant effect. The decision to purchase organic fertilizer by respondents is not qualified concerning productivity.
Q16|Agricultural Policy and Long-Run Development: Evidence from Mussolini’s Battle for Grain|This paper explores the effect of agricultural policies on industrialization and economic development over the long run. I analyze the differential effect of the Battle for Grain, implemented by the Italian Fascist regime to achieve self-sufficiency in wheat production, on the development path across areas of Italy. Employing time variation, along with cross-sectional variation in the suitability of land for implementing the advanced wheat production technologies, I find that the policy had unintended positive effects on industrialization and economic prosperity which have persisted until the present day. Furthermore, I find that the positive effect of the Battle for Grain on human capital accumulation was instrumental in this process, suggesting that the complementarity between human capital and agricultural technology may be a critical mechanism through which agricultural productivity may enhance the development of non-agricultural sectors.
Q16|Do Agricultural Raw Materials Imports Cause Agricultural Growth? Empirical Analysis from North Africa|The aim of this paper is to study empirically the impact of agricultural raw materials imports on agricultural growth since it never done before. We have made this study in the context of three countries from North Africa (Tunisia, Morocco and Egypt) for the period 1965 – 2016. By using cointegration analysis and vector error correction model, empirical analysis proves that agricultural raw materials imports produce a positive effect on agricultural growth in the long run for all the three countries and cause agricultural growth in the short run in the case of Tunisia and Egypt. It is seen that agricultural raw materials imports are a source of economic growth in the agricultural sector. For this reason, countries of North Africa should adopt to integrate foreign technology imports and not technological innovation to stimulate agricultural sector.

Q16|Digital Agriculture: Mobile Phones, Internet & Agricultural Development in Africa|This study examines the non-linear relationship between mobile phones, internet and agricultural development in Africa for the period 2001–2015 using system generalized method of moments. The empirical results show a non-linear relationship between mobile phones, internet and agricultural development. Mobile penetration and squared mobile penetration have significant positive effects on agricultural value added, implying that mobile penetration has an increasing effect on agricultural value added. In contrast, internet usage has significant negative effects on agricultural value added, but squared internet usage has significant positive effects. This suggests a U-shaped pattern and a quadratic relationship: as internet usage increases, agricultural value added decreases, but after a certain level of internet usage which is the turning point, agricultural value added starts to increase. The causality analysis suggests the existence of uni-directional causality from mobile penetration and internet usage to agricultural value added. However, there is bi-directional causality between squared mobile penetration, squared internet usage and agricultural value added. This indicates that mobile phones and internet stimulate agricultural development which, in turn, boosts mobile penetration and internet usage even further in these countries. The results therefore provide evidence that mobile phones and internet play significant roles in agricultural development, as agricultural development also plays important roles in the expansion of mobile phones and internet.
Q16|Agricultural irrigation of vine crops from desalinated and brackish groundwater under an economic perspective. A case study in Siġġiewi, Malta|Maltese agriculture faces great challenges due to the severe scarcity ofwater. Sufficientwater resources, in quantity and quality, are necessary to cover the demand in the production of wine grape, one of the most important crops in Maltese agriculture. But also, economic efficiency is essential in the grape cultivation. A Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) is defined for Maltese vineyards in the Siġġiewi region, considering two irrigation scenarios, irrigation with groundwater or “do-nothing”, comparedwith the “use non-conventional waters” from mixing water from a small desalination plant and groundwater. For the alternative ‘mixing desalinatedwater with groundwater’ it is possible to improve water availability and quality for vine crops, while increasing economic benefits for farmer. The results indicate a profitable project fromaminimumarea of 1 ha, but final benefit is highly dependent on the irrigated surface extension according to water price. Desalination, compared with other type of nonconventional water is considered the best option in this assessment with a small reverse osmosis (RO) desalination plant (120 m3 /day) for covering the irrigation needs.
Q16|Reinvigorating Cambodian agriculture: Transforming from extensive to intensive agriculture|In this paper we analysis to identify the factor constraining on Cambodian agriculture in transforming from extensive to intensive agriculture. The objective of this study was to examine the general situation of Cambodian agriculture by comparing with neighboring countries in Southeast Asia from a period of 22 years (1996 – 2018) through cultivate areas, technical using, technologies using, fertilizer using, agricultural infrastructure system, agricultural production cost, agricultural output, agricultural market and climate change. The results show that the Cambodian agriculture sector is still at a level where there is significant need to improve the capacity of farmers, the new technologies use and the prevention of climate change. However, the production cost is still high cost and agricultural output has been in low prices. It also causes for farmers to lose confidence in farming and they will be stop working in the sector. Moreover, we also have other policies to improve agriculture sector in Cambodia.

Q16|The cost of services use in horticulture on farms in the European Union countries in 2004-2016|Agricultural services address the demand for the technological, economical and environmental dimension of agricultural activities. This paper focuses on agricultural services used by farms specializing in horticultural production. The objective of the study was to identify the output of agricultural services used by farms specializing in horticultural production in European Union countries in 2004?2016. The study was based on a deductive and comparative method and relied on FADN data; also used were correlation indexes. In the group of farms covered by this study, the use of agricultural services may be found to depend on two basic factors. The first one is the farms? development level and the intensity and structure of production activities. The differences between EU-12 and EU-7 countries suggest that national specificities of horticultural production and local farming patterns are at least as important as the development level. Another significant factor is the availability of the farms? own machinery and the amount of labour engaged in production. However, own equipment and service use were not found to be substitutes, whereas companies with large resources of productive inputs usually incurred higher service costs. Also, as the demand for labour grows, so does the demand for services. This suggests that services are complementary rather than substitute to physical capital.
Q16|Benefit sharing mechanisms for agricultural genetic diversity use and in-situ conservation|The agricultural genetic diversity is reducing at an accelerating pace. Benefit sharing mechanisms are well-known instruments to incentivize local genetic resource providers to maintain in-situ diversity and to avoid free-riding behaviour by multinational bioprospecting firms. We explore the role of these mechanisms in a setting where the output of bioprospecting activities (i.e. a modern seeds variety), competes with traditional agriculture, and the latter is necessary to conserve the genetic pool from which the multinational could extract the resources for developing new modern varieties in the future. We adopt a multistage game where the multinational anticipates the impact of its bioprospecting investments and price settings on the local owner incentives to conserve genetic diversity. We focus our attention on two benefit sharing mechanisms, namely profits sharing and technology transfers, and compare them with a benchmark featuring free genetic resources access. Our main conclusions suggest that incentives to conservation are the strongest under profit sharing, while a technology transfer produces a genetic erosion that is even higher than under free access. These results shed new light on policy design, especially in developing countries where agricultural genetic diversity is a strategic natural asset.
Q16|Market Timing with Moving Averages for Fossil Fuel and Renewable Energy Stocks|The paper examines whether the moving average (MA) technique can beat random market timing in traditional and newer branches of an industrial sector. The sector considered is the energy sector, divided into balanced stock portfolios of fossil and renewable energy companies. Eight representative firms are selected for both portfolios. The paper finds that MA timing outperforms random timing with the portfolio of renewable energy companies, whereas the result is less clear with the portfolio of fossil energy companies. Thus, there seems to be more forecastable stochastic trends in sunrise branches than in sunset branches.
Q16|The Effects of Risk and Ambiguity Aversion on Technology Adoption: Evidence from Aquaculture in Ghana| We study how aversion to risk and ambiguity aects the adoption of new tech- nologies by Ghanaian smallholder aquafarmers. We conduct a set of eld experiments designed to elicit farmers' risk and ambiguity preferences and combine it with survey- based information on their technology adoption decisions. We nd that aquafarmers who are more risk-averse were quicker to adopt the new technologies: a fast-growing breed of tilapia sh, extruded feed and oating cages. By contrast, ambiguity aversion has no eect on the adoption of the new tilapia breed and extruded feed. Furthermore, it slows down the adoption of oating cages - a technology which entails higher xed costs than the others - and the eect is diminishing in the number of other adopters in the village. We argue that these dierential eects are due to the fact that the technolo- gies are risk-reducing, with potential ambiguity about their payo distributions at the early stages of adoption. The ndings highlight the importance of distinguishing be- tween risk and ambiguity in investigating technology adoption decisions of small-holder farmers in developing countries.
Q16|Measuring the Effect of Agricultural Extension on Technical Efficiency in Crop Farming: Meta-Regression Analysis|Agricultural extension services have been dominated by development programs to improve the productivity of crops and to increase farmers’ income. The virtues and limitations of these programs ignite a debate among scholars from distinct strands of research. How effective are agricultural extension services in improving the productivity level of the agricultural output? We examine the key determinants driving systematic variations in the obtained technical efficiency estimates from all relevant crop farming studies. A weighted least square meta-regression analysis is conducted by using 193 observations from 96 farm level studies to evaluate the estimates of technical efficiency in crop farming and to review the relationship between agricultural extension services and farm performance. Evidence for the absence of a publication bias in the farm studies used in the meta-analysis is identified. The empirical results manifest that there is a positive and significant effect of extension services on technical efficiency estimates. Farm productivity is significantly influenced by country level characteristics, sample size of farm studies and type of crops. Our empirical findings are robust when replacing missing observations with imputed values applying the multiple imputation method.
Q16|Innovations entrepreneuriales en Afrique : défis agricoles et enjeux alimentaires|Current academic research strongly suggests adapting models of analysis of entrepreneurial innovations to the specificity of African contexts. The purpose of this short note is to explore through an up-dated literature review of academic research and empirical applications, the question of entrepreneurial innovations in African. By extension, we will examine some possible links with agricultural challenges and future food issues. ....French Abstract: Les recherches actuelles plaident pour une adaptation des modèles d’analyse des innovations entrepreneuriales à la spécificité des contextes africains. L’objet de cette note courte est d’explorer à travers une revue de littérature actualisée des recherches académiques et des applications empiriques, la question des innovations entrepreneuriales dans le contexte africain. Nous examinerons par extension certains liens possibles avec les défis agricoles et les enjeux alimentaires futurs du continent.
Q16|Monitoring agricultural productivity for sustainable production and R&D planning|Argentina's G20 presidency has emphasized the need to improve soil management and sustainably increase agricultural productivity to achieve an inclusive and resilient food future. While increased agricultural productivity can improve economic welfare and help address food security problems by benefiting both consumers and producers simultaneously, it also must address the depletion of already scarce natural resources. In the context of a changing climate, sustainable and resilient agricultural production forms a major cornerstone of both adaptation and mitigation strategies. The global community needs to have the proper tools with which to monitor sustainable agricultural productivity gains, identify countries and sectors lagging behind, and commit R&D efforts accordingly to address the challenges ahead. As such, it is suggested that 1) an international consortium should monitor agricultural total factor productivity (TFP) to provide international comparisons and track performance over time; 2) the G20 should acknowledge and address the issue of sustainable productivity measurement, and; 3) the G20 should support more in-depth research into the relationship between agricultural TFP and agricultural R&D.
Q16|Reduzierung von landwirtschaftlichen Stickstoffeinträgen in Gewässer: Die Wirksamkeit von Beratung am Beispiel der hessischen WRRL-Beratung|Stickstoffemissionen aus der Landwirtschaft belasten neben anderen Stickstoffquellen Gewässer und andere Umweltmedien, sowohl in Deutschland als auch in anderen Ländern der Europäischen Union und weltweit. Um Landwirte2 von Handlungsänderungen zu überzeugen, werden neben regulativen und ökonomischen Instrumenten in einigen Regionen Beratungsinstrumente angewandt und für die zukünftige Politikgestaltung diskutiert. Es ist jedoch nur sehr begrenzt möglich, die Effektivität von Beratungsdiensten zu beurteilen, und daher ist es unklar, wie hoch die Kostenwirksamkeit von Gewässerschutzberatungen ist. Um zur Lösung dieses Problems beizutragen, wurde als Fallstudie eine Wirkungsanalyse der hessischen Gewässerschutzberatung im Rahmen der EU-Wasserrahmenrichtlinie mit einem aus Empirie und Theorie abgeleiteten Set von Indikatoren durchgeführt. Den Kern der Studie bildete eine standardisierte Befragung, die mit Antworten von 1.477 beratenen und nicht beratenen Landwirten quantitative Analysen erlaubte. Die Befragung wurde vor allem durch Vorinterviews und durch Validierungsrunden mit Beratern und Landwirten sowie durch Transkripte von 18 qualitativen Vertiefungsinterviews mit Landwirten ergänzt.

Q16|Bewässerung in der Landwirtschaft - Tagungsband zur Fachtagung am 11./12.09.2017 in Suderburg|"Am 11. und 12. September 2017 fand an der Ostfalia Hochschule, Campus Suderburg, eine vom Thünen-Institut, dem Julius-Kühn Institut und der Ostfalia Hochschule gemeinsam organisierte Fachtagung zum Thema ""Bewässerung in der Landwirtschaft"" statt. Dazu wurden deutschland-weit Experten des Fachgebiets Bewässerung eingeladen, aktuelle Einschätzungen zur Entwicklung des Bewässerungsbedarfs und der Bewässerungswürdigkeit verschiedener Kulturen an unterschiedlichen Standorten in Deutschland sowie zur Entwicklung der Bewässerungstechnik zu geben. Die Bewässerung von Kulturen im Freilandgemüsebau oder Sonderkulturbereich gehört in ganz Deutschland seit langem zur gängigen Praxis. Die Rentabilität der Bewässerung weiterer landwirtschaftlicher Feldkulturen war bisher auf einige wenige, trockene Standorte begrenzt. Im Zuge des Klimawandels werden seit einigen Jahren eine steigende Jahresdurchschnittstemperatur und veränderte Niederschlagsmuster (v. a. geringere Niederschläge zu Beginn der Vegetationsperiode im Frühjahr) in Deutschland beobachtet. Für die Zukunft sind laut der Ergebnisse von Klimamodellen eine weitere Zunahme der Temperaturen und weitere Veränderungen der Niederschlagsverteilung, z. B. eine Abnahme der Sommerniederschläge und eine Zunahme der Winterniederschläge, zu erwarten. Der Tagungsband gibt einen Überblick über neueste Erkenntnisse aus der Forschung und diskutiert mögliche alternative Quellen für die Deckung des Beregnungswasserbedarfs landwirtschaftlicher Kulturen. Dabei werden auch Aspekte des Landschaftswasserhaushalts und hydrologische Zusammenhänge in der Agrarlandschaft angesprochen und Lösungsansätze präsentiert. Einblicke in mögliche Nutzungskonflikte der Wassernutzung und praktische Erfahrungen mit der Erarbeitung von Lösungsansätzen werden begleitet von der Darstellung der rechtlichen Rahmenbedingungen der Wassernutzung. Ergänzt werden die Beiträge durch Berichte langjähriger Beregnungs-Feldversuche der Landwirtschaftskammer Niedersachsen. Einerseits ergaben die Versuche, dass die Bewässerung die Nährstoffeffizienz der Pflanzen und die Qualität der Ernteprodukte erhöhen kann. Andererseits werden der derzeitige Stand der Technik der Bewässerung erläutert und Grenzen sowie Möglichkeiten für eine Steigerung der Effizienz in der Zukunft dargelegt. Zur Steigerung der Effizienz der Bewässerung kommt der Bewässerungssteuerung eine hohe Bedeutung zu, deren aktueller Stand dargestellt und die Trends für die Zu-kunft aufgezeigt werden. Die Rentabilität der Investitionen in Bewässerungstechnik wird in zwei Beiträgen dargestellt. Hier werden sowohl die verschiedenen Techniken als auch deren Rentabilität bei verschiedenen Kulturen betriebswirtschaftlich beurteilt. Als Abrundung wird die Entwicklung des regionalen Bewässerungsbedarfs am Beispiel Nordrhein-Westfalens aufgezeigt. Der Tagungsband schließt mit einem Kapitel zur Übersicht über bisherige Projekte im Bereich des Wassermanagements und zu Fragen der Bewässerung landwirtschaftlicher Nutzflächen im Hinblick auf zukünftige Klimaveränderungen in Deutschland."
Q16|Development and Concentration of Maize Seed Market in Thailand| Today Thailand is the second largest field crop seed exporter in Asia with maize contributing the highest value to seed exports. Hybrid maize is considerably adopted in Thailand mainly due to the demand from feed industry and development of livestock and poultry industry. The success of varietal development of commercial maize hybrids is owed to the investments of international donors during the 1980s and continuous breeding efforts of multinational seed companies even as public institutions played a key role in maintaining genetic resources conservation and pre-commercial lines research. This paper reviews the history of research and development in maize and maize seed market development in Thailand. Furthermore, expert elicitation method is used to reveal the adoption of commercial maize varieties in 2013/2014 cropping seasons. The results of adopted maize varieties were used to estimate market shares and suggested that maize seed market in Thailand is moderately concentrated with tendencies towards oligopolistic competition.
Q16|What should we expect of the impact of microcredit on farmsÕ performances? A literature review of experimental studies|In this article,we review the literature on the best ways to identify the causal effects of microcredit, present, and discuss some empirical results of the impact of microcredit on the adoption of innovations, investments, farm incomes, and profits. The results of empirical studies converge toward a positive impact of access to microcredit on the adoption of agricultural technology and investment. In terms of the effect on the technical efficiency of farms, agricultural income and profit, and consumption, the results do not all point in the same direction.The effects of microcredit are likely to vary depending on the context of the study.
Q16|Agricultural Transformation in Senegal: Impacts of an integrated program|This paper evaluates the impact of an agriculture transformation program on poverty, migration, food security and agricultural revenue. We used Inverse Propensity Score Matching (IPSM) techniques, to correct the selection bias arising from the non-randomness of the allocation of farmers to the treatment. The results find that ANIDA farms are better equipped with irrigation technologies, and so, appear more resilient to climatic events such as droughts. They spent $2,905 USD per hectare on inputs and produced 10,526 kg per worker more than traditional farmers. The intention to migrate, the depth and severity of poverty are significantly below those of beneficiariesÕ households. The ANIDA program is a model that should be promoted in all municipalities of the country, in order to modernize the agricultural sector. The analysis is limited by the fact that the non-compliance rate of the program is high and needs more investigation to better understand the underlying factors.
Q16|Heterogeneous Yield Impacts from Adoption of Genetically Engineered Corn and the Importance of Controlling for Weather|Concern about declining growth in crop yields has renewed debates about the ability of biotechnology to promote food security. While numerous experimental and farm-level studies have found that adoption of genetically engineered crops has been associated with yield gains, aggregate and cross-country comparisons often seem to show little effect, raising questions about the size and generalizability of the effect. This paper attempts to resolve this conundrum using a panel of United States county-level corn yields from 1980 to 2015 in conjunction with data on adoption of genetically engineered crops, weather, and soil characteristics. Our panel data contain just over 28,000 observations spanning roughly 800 counties. We show that changing weather patterns confound simple analyses of trend yield, and only after controlling for weather do we find that genetically engineered crops have increased yields above trend. There is marked heterogeneity in the effect of adoption of genetically engineered crops across location partially explained by differential soil characteristics which may be related to insect pressure. While adoption of genetically engineered crops has the potential to mitigate downside risks from weeds and insects, we find no effects of adoption on yield variability nor do we find that adoption of presently available genetically engineered crops has led to increased resilience to heat or water stress. On average, across all counties, we find adoption of GE corn was associated with a 17 percent increase in corn yield.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Q16|Impacts of Climate Change and Extreme Weather on U.S. Agricultural Productivity: Evidence and Projection|This paper employs a stochastic frontier approach to examine how climate change and extreme weather affect U.S. agricultural productivity using 1940-1970 historical weather data (mean and variation) as the norm. We have four major findings. First, using temperature humidity index (THI) load and Oury index for the period 1960-2010 we find each state has experienced different patterns of climate change in the past half century, with some states incurring drier and warmer conditions than others. Second, the higher the THI load (more heat waves) and the lower the Oury index (much drier) will tend to lower a state’s productivity. Third, the impacts of THI load shock and Oury index shock variables (deviations from historical norm fluctuations) on productivity are more robust than the level of THI and Oury index variables across specifications. Fourth, we project potential impacts of climate change and extreme weather on U.S. regional productivity based on the estimates. We find that the same degree changes in temperature or precipitation will have uneven impacts on regional productivities, with Delta, Northeast, and Southeast regions incurring much greater effects than other regions, using 2000-2010 as the reference period.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Q16|Agricultural Trade Reform, Reallocation and Technical Change: Evidence from the Canadian Prairies|We decompose the impact of trade reform on technology adoption and land use to study how aggregate changes were driven by reallocation versus within-farm adaptation. Using detailed census data covering over 30,000 farms in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, Canada we find a range of new results. We find that the reform-induced shift from producing low-value to high-value crops for export, the adoption of new seeding technologies and reduction in summer fallow observed at the aggregate level between 1991 and 2001 were driven mainly by the within-farm effect. In the longer run, however, reallocation of land from shrinking and exiting farms to growing and new farms explains more than half of the aggregate changes in technology adoption and land use between 1991 and 2011.
Q16|Scale versus scope in the diffusion of new technology: evidence from the farm tractor|Although tractors are now used in nearly every agricultural field operation and in the production of nearly all crops, they first developed with much more limited application. Early diffusion was accordingly rapid in these narrower applications but limited in scope until tractor technology generalized. The sequence of diffusion is consistent with a model of Research and Development (R&D) in specificâ€ versus generalâ€ purpose attributes and with other historical examples, suggesting that the key to understanding technology diffusion lies not only in explaining the number of different users, but also in explaining the number of different uses.
Q16|Overcoming barriers to the adoption of climate-friendly practices in agriculture|"Considerable efforts have been devoted to understanding and developing technologies and practices that can help the agricultural sector reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. The uptake of these ""climate-friendly"" technologies and practices, however, remains low. This report, based on a comprehensive review of the literature, analyses barriers that may prevent farmers from adopting climate-friendly practices. A multitude of potential barriers exist, some associated with farm-level constraints, others operating at the sector level, or created by existing policies. A series of recommendations are made to properly identify these types of barriers and to select the right instruments that would work to implement effective policy solutions."
Q16|Estimating the link between farm productivity and innovation in the Netherlands|This report investigates the link between farm innovation and economic performance. The study uses a unique survey dataset maintained by Wageningen Economic Research in the Netherlands. A structural multi-stage model of firm-level innovation is applied. The model contains four steps: first, the decision of the farmer to innovate at all; second the innovation intensity, measured by expenditures on innovation activities; third the output of the innovation process, which is measured by realized product, process, organisational or marketing-related innovation; fourth, productivity changes as a result of innovation. The analysis is performed for two types of farms – dairy and crop farms – and covers the period from 2004 to 2014. A number of factors are found to be decisive for the magnitude and success of farm innovations in the Netherlands. Among them regulations and standards, the level of co-operation with knowledge producing institutions, own product and process-related development activities, farm size, the age of the farm operator as well as confidence in business and sector developments. Based on these and other results, the report derives implications for policies aimed at promoting farm innovation and productivity and sustainability in the agricultural sector.
Q16|University Licensing Of Intellectual Property In Developing Countries: A Case Study Of The Purdue Improved Crop Storage(Pics) Technology|"With five million bags sold in the 2007-2015 period and thousands of rural vendors, the Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS) bags have been a very successful innovation for African and Asian farmers. The primary Purdue University intellectual property (IP) in PICS is the trademark. The goal of this study is to describe the role of PICS trademark licensing in the PICS success. Some key points from the study: •Trademarking PJCS seems to have been an effective strategy for combating low quality imitators. Initially, PICS trademarking was suggested by a Nigerian PICS manufacturer as a way to manage imitators. While several large manufacturers have made their own version of the triple layer PICS bag, none of those larger businesses tried to use the trademark. The small ""backyard"" manufacturers who tried to use the trademark stopped when sent a cease and desist letter by Purdue. Anecdotal accounts indicate that West African farmers have confidence in PICS trademarked bags and prefer to buy them to store their crops. •As donorfunding wound downfor PJCS projects, the trademark became the main mechanism for Purdue support to manufacturers and licensees. The trademark license provides a formal, legal structure within which that relationship can function. Ina context where national institutions are weak, many manufacturers and distributors find that technical support from Purdue attractive. The support provided ranged widely from help with manufacturing problems to facilitating succession when a licensee died without leaving succession plans. •PJCS has shown that African and Asian licensees are willing topay licensefees, but the transactions and opportunity costs are high on both sides. Those transactions costs include bank wire fees, exchange costs, staff effort and informal taxes required for the paperwork. In the developing country context where cash is hard to come by and work capital perpetually lacking, there is a real opportunity cost of sending some of that money out of the country, instead of reinvesting it in the business. •The sustainability of the PJCS brand probably requires moving management outside of the university. University business processes are slow and cumbersome. Management costs are high because of public sector accounting and personnel rules. University faculty and staff have many responsibilities; they cannot devote full time to commercialization of an innovation. •The most durable impact of the PICS project is in the private investment in developing the next generation of hermetic grain storage for smallholder farmers. Twenty years ago those companies would have dismissed the idea of developing grain storage technology for small holder farmers. The perception was that smallholder farmers lacked the entrepreneurial motivation and/or the cash flow to be a substantial market. PICS showed the business community that there is a market on smallholder farms for technologies that solve their problems."
Q16|Biofuels Markets and Policies in Belarus|This paper provides an overview of biofuel’s markets and policies in Belarus. Belarus remains the country with a critical level of energy dependence on Russia. Availability of cheap Russian sources and lack of diversification within energy sector hinder Belarus from expanding the potential of local energy resources. While energy independence and security, which is defined as share of local energy sources in the total energy balance, is declared as Belarusian priority, there is essentially no biofuels industry v Belarus. An interesting option of development of biofuels is a possibility of utilization of large areas unsuitable for human food or animal feed production because of Chernobyl nuclear disaster.
Q16|Quantification of Biofuels Potential of Post-Soviet Countries in the Context of Global Biofuels Development|This paper provides an overview of biofuel’s markets in Russian Federation, Belarus and Ukraine and it estimates prospects of their future development in the context of global biofuels development. We first provide a general characterisation of biofuels, followed by description of development of biofuel industry in the key selected countries and the outline of current trends on the global market. This is followed by a quantitative analysis of the possible development of biofuels in Russian Federation, Belarus and Ukraine
Q16|Biofuels Markets and Policies in Russia|This paper provides an overview of biofuel’s markets and policies in Russian Federation. It shows that one of the many barriers that hinder biofuel development is strong oil and gas lobby, which cooperates with Russian government. The main obstacle for the development of biofuel’s sector in Russia is a significant lack of coherent policy and regulation. Creation of healthy biofuel’s sector requires authorities to found a new governing body, owning adequate rights, staffed with qualified personnel and resistant to the external influence. In order to reduce the uncertainty in biofuels sphere, the government would have to provide sustained long-term policy commitment and clarify the energy strategy. These actions would bring confidence in investments into sector of biofuels and motivate the growth within industry. Until the proposed incentives are not established on the legal base, the progress in the sector of biofuels is not possible. Even in case of the growing support from the government, the rapid flourishing of the sector is not expected.
Q16|Biofuels Markets and Policies in Ukraine|This paper provides an overview of biofuel’s markets Ukraine. While Ukraine has great competitive advantage in the production of biofuels based on availability of the feedstock and fertile soils, it does not utilize this opportunity despite the policy goal of decreasing energy dependence on Russian fossil fuels. In the recent years Ukraine was working on fulfilment of European standards in the sector of biofuels. Most importantly, as opposed to Russia, Ukraine has built legislative base which aims to support the industry development and offer large scale of benefits. But due to high excise duty, low oil prices and no penalties for not achieving established indicators, the biofuel industry still stays non-operating.
Q16|Measuring and explaining productivity growth of renewable energy producers: An empirical study of Austrian biogas plants|This study explores productivity growth for a group of 65 Austrian biogas plants from 2006 to 2014 using Data Envelopment Analysis. The sample covers about 25 % of the installed electric capacity of Austrian biogas plants. Productivity growth is measured by calculating the Malmquist productivity index, and the contributions of technical change, efficiency change and scale change to productivity growth are isolated. Average annual productivity growth between 2006 and 2014 is 1.1 %. The decomposition of the Malmquist index shows that the annual scale change, technical change, and efficiency change for the average plant is 0.6 %, 0.3 % and 0.3 %, respectively. Those results indicate that the exploitation of returns to scale is a major driver of productivity growth in the Austrian biogas sector. However, there is a large variation in productivity growth across biogas plants. A second-stage regression analysis identifies important determinants of productivity growth. The results show that i) the exploitation of returns to scale as well as changes in ii) output diversification iii) capital intensity, iv) capacity utilization and v) feedstock prices are positively associated with productivity growth.
Q16|Penelitian Serat Alami Untuk Mendukung Pengembangan Industri Textil di Indonesia|Abstract Indonesian textile industry is based on imported raw material, more than 94% cotton fiber must be imported. Ramie fiber has the same characteristic as cotton fiber and fulfills the condition for human clothes. Textile industry is developing to contribute to people economic welfare. Ramie fiber can substitute cotton fiber. Mostly Indonesian land has the agro-climatic characteristic which is unsuitable for cotton plant cultivation, but is suitable for ramie plant cultivation. Ramie is rapid growing plant, it is harvested every 60 days,so it needs more water to solve nutrition available and potential in the soil. Cultivation the natural fiber producing plant is considered very possible with some amendment in some environmental condition
Q16|A Study on Maize Production in Samastipur (Bihar): An Empirical Analysis|Maize is an important cereal crop in the world. It has several important uses for industrial purposes, human food and animal feed. It is grown under variety of agro-ecological conditions and posses highest yield potential above 80 quintal per hectare among the food grain crop. The demand of maize is growing globally due to multiple uses and need to increase production continuously. This crop has tremendous potential for increase in productivity, profitability and sustainability in agriculture. But the drawback is that it is cultivated mostly under stress condition. In this backdrop the present study has plan to access the maize production and utilization system in Samastipur district of Bihar with objectives of maize production system prevails in the area, opportunities for utilization of maize and constraints thereon is the main focus of the paper. The study is based on primary data collected through 120 different categories of house hold from six villages falls under two blocks in Samastipur district. The main findings emerged from the analysis that in study area farmers were growing maize extensively in rabi season only. In kharif season flood and water logging condition is the main problem from August to January almost every year. Due to high risk involved in kharif and summer season farmers were found growing maize generally local variety with less input use. The farmers were reported that adoption of hybrid maize during risk situation avoids and uses open pollinated varieties (OPVs). Due to lacks of good quality maize seed varieties particularly for stress situation of flood, and droughts, bad marketing facilities, storage facilities etc. are the factors which limits the increase in productivity and production of maize in the areas. The hybrid variety of maize during the rabi season was extensively grown for commercial purpose not for consumption of human is the main drawback of utilization. The study also finds that due to high risk involve in kharif and summer season farmer were kept their cultivated land fallow. The paper suggests that more research and development is required for increase production and productivity particularly in abiotic stress conditions in the study area with development of suitable hybrid varieties of maize for human consumption. This is important for food and nutritional security to the economically poor families in the study area.
Q16|Changing Scenario of Pulses in India: An Analysis of its Growth and Instability in Eastern States|Despite of deceleration in area and marginal rise in production due to higher productivity growth rate but gross decline in area and production is perceived to be a major threat towards future food and nutritional security of the country as well as the Eastern states.Framing strategies to overcome the present gloomy situation may be considered as a greatest ever challenge faced by policy makers as well as agricultural scientists. The present situation necessitates long term planning to augment production. The strategies for stepping up domestic production must include development and adoption of modern technology including high yielding varieties, better monetary incentives to farmers to make pulses cultivation more remunerative than competitive crops, assured market which will motivate farmers to allocate more land for pulses cultivation. The minimum support price should be greater coordination with farm harvest price and market price. The Inputs constraints particularly quality seeds, fertilizers and lifesaving irrigation growth are not enough as compared to rice and wheat crops. Liberalized and subsidized import of pulses of India helps to meet demand-supply gaps,which have occurred because of stagnation in the area under cultivation, very slow growth in yield, poor increase in production and speedy increase in population. Ban on export and re-export of pulses make the closure of Indian pulses processing units. Problems of pulses economy can be solved with the increase the sources of production. Effective and continuous efforts are needed to increase the area under cultivation with better technological and logistic support.
Q16|Cost efficiency and economies of diversification of biogas-fuelled cogeneration plants in Austria: a nonparametric approach|This paper investigates the existence and the degree of economies of diversification for small-scaled, renewable-fuelled cogeneration systems using 2014 cross-sectional data from 67 Austrian biogas plants. In addition, cost efficiency of those biogas plants is estimated with a non-parametric linear programming technique, known as Data Envelopment Analysis. This is the first study applying the methodology proposed by Chavas and Kim (2010). Economies of diversification are decomposed into three additive parts: a part measuring complementarity among outputs; a part reflecting economies of scale; a part reflecting convexity. Furthermore, this paper extends the decomposition introduced by Chavas and Kim (2010) in such a way that the contribution of each input to economies of diversification and its components can be investigated. The results indicate substantial cost savings from diversification. For very-small scaled plants ( 250 kWel) positive complementarity and convexity effects are the main source of economies of diversification and outweigh the negative effect from scale diseconomies. In addition to substantial fuel/feedstock cost reductions, significant costs saving effects from the jointness in labour and other inputs positively contribute to the complementarity effect. While on average capital and labour costs positively contribute to economies of scale, feedstock costs work in the direction of diseconomies of scale.
Q16|Rural Waste Management Issues at Global Level(Introductory chapter)|This chapter intends to draw attention to solid waste management sector toward rural areas where bad practices and public health threats could be avoided through traditional and integrated waste management routes. The expansion of waste collection services across rural municipalities should be a priority for many countries. Agricultural and municipal waste diversion from wild dumps and open burning practices must be avoided through smart solutions at the local level which are cost-efficient particularly in developing countries. The book further examines, on the one hand, the main challenges in the development of reliable waste management practices across rural regions and, on the other hand, the concrete solutions and the new opportunities across the world in dealing with rural solid waste.
Q16|Enhancing Pulses Production in Bihar: Constraints and Strategies for Sustainable Growth|Food grains are the major agricultural commodity, produced on about 93 percent of cropped area, of which pulses share merely 7.06 per cent and the productivity of pulses ranges between 819 kg/ha in 2000-01 to 897 kg/ha in 2013-14. Bihar ranks 9th in terms of pulses production with a contribution of 0.52 million tons to the national pulse pool. Traditionally pulses have been considered important elements of cropping systems in the Bihar, but with the introduction of irrigation and high profitability of alternative sources of soil nutrients in the form of inorganic fertilizers in 1960s, pulses were replaced or relegated to marginal lands and were substituted by high- yielding varieties of rice and wheat. There has been an incessant decline in pulses area, production and productivity during last three and half decades accounting for about 437.24 thousand hectares, 428.93 thousand tons and 981 kg ha-1 respectively in 2014 - 15 against the corresponding figures of 717.2 thousand hectares, 620.7 thousand tons and 865 kg ha-1 in 2000-01 registering a compound annual decline of -2.5 percent in area and -0.41 percent in production but productivity increased by 2.15 percent per annum. Lentil is only crop which has performed well in Bihar whereas area and production of most of the major pulses have gone down. In Bihar 2.2 million ha rice fallow land is there which are most suitable for pulses cultivation where medium and long duration paddy is cultivated and after field vacating due to lack of irrigation facility and delay normally the field remains vacant. Pulse production is also adversely affected by a number of biotic and abiotic stresses which can be overcome by assembling the available components of integrated pest management like host plant resistance, cultural practices to disrupt the life cycles of pests, and need-based use of pesticides and to validate them in farmers' participatory on-farm trial and demonstration in farmers field, to deliver management components effectively to stabilize and increase the productivity of pulses. There is also need to strengthen extension efforts to disseminate available pulse technologies through on-farm demonstrations and farmers' participatory research.
Q16|Environmental sustainability of Bulgarian agricultural Farms – assessment, state, factors|The issue of assessment of diverse aspects of sustainability of agricultural farms is among the most topical in the last decades. In Bulgaria there are no comprehensive studies on environmental sustainability of farms in general or different types. This article applies a holistic framework for assessing environmental sustainability of Bulgarian farms. Initially the multiprinciple, multictiteria and mulriindicator framework for assessing environmental sustainability of farm in the country is outlined. After that a level of environmental sustainability of Bulgarian farms is evaluated in general and of farms different juridical type, size, production specialization, and ecological and administrative location. Sustainability assessment is based on a first large-scale survey on environmental aspects of sustainability of agricultural farms in the country carried out in 2016. Third, relations between environmental and socio-economic and integral sustainability of Bulgarian farms are specified. Finally, factors for improving environmental and overall sustainability of agricultural farms in the country are identified. Our study has found out that environmental sustainability of Bulgarian farms is at a good level. Nevertheless due to an inferior level of governance and economic sustainability the integral sustainability of Bulgarian farms is lower and the improvement of the latter two is critical for maintaining overall sustainability of Bulgarian farms at current stage of development.
Q16|The evolution of chemical properties of soil under the influence of tillage systems and fertilization at the culture of wheat in the period 2007-2016 at ARDS Turda|"Through the experiment realized at ARDS Turda in 2007, was monitored in comparativ, the evolution the soil under the influence of the tillage system, the crop plant, and the level of fertilization. Increasing the reserve in the macro -elements is much more significant in the case of the conservative system compared to the classic system, especially at the depth of 0-20 cm. The production data registered at the variety of autumn wheat Ariesan in the period 2007-2016, indicates the suitability of cultivation in the ""no tillage"" system, the difference in production between the two systems, the classical (5535 kg/ha) - ""no tillage"" (5435 kg/ha) being only 100 kg/ha."
Q16|Research on the influence of the soil tillage system on soybean yield at ARDS Turda|The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the soybean yield obtained from the application of the minimum tillage system compared to the classical tillage system. Conservative tillage systems have become an important part of agriculture, and the need to apply these systems is justified by the growing area of land degraded by the erosion process. Experimental factors: Factor A - the tillage system: classical tillage system and minimum tillage system (chisel variant); Factor B - soybean varieties: Onix, Felix, Mălina TD and Darina TD; Factor C - experimental years: 2015 and 2016. Following the application of the conservative tillage system, there is a slight decrease in yield compared to the classical tillage system, and between the two years studied, in 2016 there are yields with significantly higher differences compared to 2015. The application of conservative tillage systems brings important long-term benefits to both the soil and the environment by reducing soil compaction and fossil fuels used in crop technology.
Q16|The influence of mineral fertilization upon production and quality of spring barley on agricultural research and development station Turda|In order to clarify some aspects of the spring barley reaction on the production and accumulation of the protein in grain, at different levels of fertilization, some estimates of this chemical component were made at 16 levels of fertilization with N: P: K in the period 2016-2017 . The increase in protein content was achieved at the highest levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, even when potassium fertilizers were not used, but the highest protein content in grain accumulating at the level of N60P80K0 was 11.78%. The highest yield can be attributed to the fertilization variant N120P80K40, which confirms the negative relationship between production and protein content.
Q16|Analysis regarding the fleet and the farm equipment in Romania compared to the European Union|Taking under consideration the fact that the main factor of increasing work productivity, and increasing agricultural production is mechanization, in the present work, I want to analyze the evolution of the farm equipment fleet in Romania and the E.U. during 2010-2016, highlighting the upgrading trend of this sector compared to the demands from the Romanian farmers who buy these equipments from abroad. There are discussions regarding the decreasing of the number of workers in the agricultural sector due to the modernization and the invasion of the market with new models of tractors and equipments that ease the farmer’s work by reducing the work hours by half for the same surface compared to the European average.
Q16|Design, Sustainability Analysis and Multiobjective Optimisation of Ethanol Production via Syngas Fermentation|Ethanol production from non-edible feedstock has received significant attention over the past two decades. The utilisation of agricultural residues within the biorefinery concept can positively contribute to the renewable production of fuels. To this end, this study proposes the utilisation of bagasse in a hybrid conversion route for ethanol production. The main steps of the process are the gasification of the raw material followed by syngas fermentation to ethanol. Aspen plus was utilised to rigorously design the biorefinery coupled with Matlab to perform process optimisation. Based on the simulations, ethanol can be produced at a rate of 283 L per dry tonne of bagasse, achieving energy efficiency of 43% and according to the environmental analysis, is associated with low CO2 emissions. The conduction of a typical discounted cash flow analysis resulted in a minimum ethanol selling price of 0.69 $ L−1. The study concludes with multiobjective optimisation setting as objective functions the conflictive concepts of total investment costs and exergy efficiency. The total cost rate of the system is minimised whereas the exergy efficiency is maximised by using a genetic algorithm. This way, various process configurations and trade-offs between the investigated criteria were analysed for the proposed biorefinery system.
Q16|Numerical Investigation of Head Frontal Velocity of nonconservative Dense Flows in Small Inclined Beds|Non-conservative dense flow frontal velocity has been simulated two dimensionally by fluent numerical code. The outcomes have been compared with experimental results. Numerical simulation was conducted as two-phase through Euler-Lagrange method. Reynolds-Stress Turbulent Model (RSM) with non-uniform grid and shredding mesh on the channel floor. The results obtained from numerical model of head frontal velocity show a good compliance with experiment results and greatly help analyzing the pattern of fluid movement in different scales.
Q16|On the direct, indirect and induced impacts of public policies: The European biofuel case|This paper deals with the controversial indirect land use changes of the European biodiesel policy. Two studies sponsored by the European Commission finds significant, but contrasted, land use effects for the different vegetable oils used for biodiesel production. The first study uses an aggregate computable general equilibrium model capturing direct, indirect and induced effects. The second recent study uses a biotechnical partial equilibrium model offering a detailed representation of the indirect effects occurring through the livestock sectors. We develop an original economic emulator to understand the diverging key results of these studies and test their sensitivity. We find that the direct and indirect effects on vegetable oil markets explain most of the differences. We also find that indirect effects on the livestock sector and the induced effects do not significantly influence the biodiesel results. However results are critically sensitive to crop yield responses that are considerably underestimated in both studies. The cropland displacement due to the biodiesel policy computed by the recent study is overestimated by a factor of 5.
Q16|Technology Adoption, Capital Deepening, and International Productivity Differences|Cross-country differences in capital intensity are larger in agriculture than in the non-agricultural sector. I build a two-sector model featuring technology adoption in agriculture. As the economy develops, farmers gradually adopt modern capital-intensive technologies to replace traditional labor-intensive technologies, as is observed in the U.S. historical data. Using this model, I find that technology adoption is key to explaining lower agricultural capital intensity and labor productivity in poor countries. By allowing for technology adoption, my model can explain 1.56-fold more in rich-poor agricultural productivity differences. I further show that land misallocation impedes technology adoption and magnifies productivity differences.
Q16|Technology Adoption, Capital Deepening, and International Productivity Differences|Cross-country differences in capital intensity are larger in the agricultural sector than in the non-agricultural sector, indicating that rich and poor countries differ in agricultural technology adoption. I build a two-sector general equilibrium model featuring technology adoption in agriculture. As the economy develops, farmers gradually adopt a modern capital-intensive technology to replace the traditional labour-intensive technology, as is observed in the U.S. historical data. Using this model, I find that the technology adoption channel is key to accounting for low agricultural capital intensity and labour productivity in poor countries. In the model, measured aggregate factors – land endowment, economy-wide productivity, and barriers to investment – can explain 1.56-fold more in rich-poor agricultural productivity differences compared to a model without technology adoption. I further show that land market frictions in agriculture impede technology adoption and magnify productivity differences.
Q16|An employment guarantee as risk insurance? Assessing the effects of the NREGS on agricultural production decisions|This paper assesses the role of risk constraints in households’ production decisions. Using representative panel data for Andhra Pradesh, India, it analyses the effects of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) on households’ crop choices. This paper shows that the introduction of the NREGS reduces households’ uncertainty about future income streams because it provides reliable employment opportunities in rural areas independently of weather shocks and crop failure. Households with access to the NREGS can therefore increase the share of inputs allocated to more profitable but also riskier crops, especially cotton. These shifts in agricultural production can considerably raise the incomes of smallholder farmers. Linking the employment guarantee to risk considerations is the key innovation of this paper. Therewith, it provides empirical evidence of the validity of the theory of decision-making under uncertainty and contributes to the ongoing debate on the effects of the NREGS on agricultural productivity.
Q16|Will climate change benefit or hurt Russian grain production? A statistical evidence from a panel approach<BR>[Wird der Klimawandel der russischen Getreideproduktion nutzen oder schaden? Statistische Evidenz auf der Grundlage eines Panel-Ansatzes]|We conduct an examination of the climate effect to analyze the historical dependence of grain production on temperatures and precipitation levels, and project this dependence to estimate the productivity of different grain types in the mid- and long-terms, given four greenhouse gas concentration pathways. We find that altering temperatures have an equivocal effect on agriculture. The most productive zones of the southern black soil belt is projected to face considerable declines in yields, due to insufficient precipitation levels and high probability of heat waves during the summer vegetation period. The northern part, on the contrary, can experience increases in productivity as a result of milder and drier winters and warmer springs.
Q16|Indirect land use change (iLUC) revisited: An evaluation of current policy proposals|The contribution of biofuels to save greenhouse gas emissions has been challenged over the last years. A still unresolved question is how to quantify emissions from indirect land use change (iLUC). In this article we discuss the implications of uncertainties on the current policy proposals in the European Union (EU). We conclude that it is inappropriate to calculate crop-specific iLUC-emissions and to include them into binding regulation. We argue that modelling results, particularly crop-specific ones, should not be used for policy decisions. Our discussion of the current EU policy proposal suggests that a combination of an increase in the minimum emissions savings threshold and limits to biofuel production are a safe way to ensure with a high degree of certainty a climate mitigation impact of biofuels.
Q16|A comprehensive evaluation of the EU's biofuel policy: From biofuels to agrofuels|During a time in which the subject of climate change is deemed high on the list of priorities of many governments, it is important to assess to what extent policies in this field are achieving meaningful results. The link between energy usage and global warming is clear and today in the European Union the use of renewable resources is being promoted more than ever before. The move towards a renewables based economy has clear benefits over a fossil fuel based one with regards to climate change and the environment, however if the implementation of renewables is not monitored and regulated then this is not a given by any means. Of the renewable resources, bioenergy has a high level of importance in the EU. For this reason, this paper will make a comprehensive evaluation of the EU's biofuel policy in order to assess what the driving forces behind the regulation of this resource are, and how they affect to what extent it is successful or not. In order to do this, firstly the impacts of current EU bioenergy consumption will be assessed, to determine whether it is achieving the stated and desired climate goals or not. Findings will show that in fact the current formulation of Europe's Renewable Strategy creates pressure to meet binding targets for renewable usage and the resultant rapid increase in the demand for bioenergy has caused a number of negative social and ecological impacts to arise. Therefore in light of this, the current systems in place at the EU level meant to regulate the use of bioenergy and ensure it is implemented in a sustainable way will be critically analysed in order to find out how such negative impacts have been able to occur. The final section will then look into the driving forces responsible for regulation of this kind through a case study of Germany and Indonesia.
Q16|General equilibrium effects of public adaptation in agriculture in LDCs: Evidence from Ethiopia|Ethiopia is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change. This is because its important economic sector, agriculture, is virtually rain-fed. The role of the sector in the current economic structure and the potency of the anticipated biophysical impacts of climate change necessitates proactive adaptation in agriculture. This, however, breeds questions of adaptation costs and adaptation finance. This study attempts to derive plausible range of planned adaptation costs in agriculture along with their economy-wide and regional effects in Ethiopia. It also assess the economy-wide and regional effects of the likely options available to a government of a least-developed country to finance adaptation in agriculture. The results show that planned public adaptation in agriculture puts pressure on government surplus, impedes on manufacturing and private services, and GDP of urbanized regions. As such, it may strain the current macroeconomic endeavors of the country which puts government driven structural transformation and reducing fiscal deficit relative to GDP at the center. Government of Ethiopia may reconcile this by laying out incentives to urban agriculture and private investment in agriculture. Besides, foreign support in the form of biotechnology transfer and debt-relief may help to control the side effects of grants on foreign exchange market and trade balance.
Q16|The Biofuel-Development Nexus: A Meta-Analysis|Although the production of biofuels has expended in recent years, the literature on its impact on growth and development finds contradictory findings. This paper presents a meta-analysis of computable general equilibrium studies published between 2006 and 2014. Using 26 studies, we shed light on why results differ. We investigate factors such as the type of biofuels, the geographic area and the characteristics of models. Our results indicate that the outcomes of CGE simulations are sensitive to models parameters. They also suggest a divide between developed / emerging countries versus Sub-Saharan African countries.
Q16|Inequidad espacial y de tierras. Lectura comparada entre enfoque-territorial y territorios campesinos|El objetivo de este artículo es modesto. Informar, a partir de una vieja historia, sobre una forma espacial de la inequidad que suele pasar desapercibida, o en todo caso poco se discute como una forma de concentrar (en cada vez menos usos) el acceso a elementos naturales como suelos, agua y aire. Así mismo, sobre la tecnificación de la inequidad de tierras (concentradas en cada vez menos predios) a través de la estrategia de cerrar las salidas agrícolas a la exclusión de muchas comunidades campesinas y de pequeña agricultura. El resultado del documento es presentar indicios de cómo en agriculturas desiguales y combinadas la operación principal no es concentrar la naturaleza sino su uso. Espera, en general, contribuir a las constataciones de que producir inequidad es el primer requisito para que funcionen las políticas (neo)liberales de tierras y de ‘modernindustrialización’ de la agricultura. *** This article has a modest objective. To inform, upon an old story, about some spatial form of inequality which is often overlooked or is, otherwise, seldom discussed as a way to concentrate (in few forms of use) the access to natural elements as: air, soil and water. As well as about the tencification of land inequality (concentrated in few holdings) through strategies based on the clousure of agricultural escapes from exclusion to peasant communities. This paper results in insights that on uneven and combined agricultures the main action is not the land concentration but the spatial use concentration. It expects, in general, to contribute evidence on the fact that the production of inequality is the first requirement for implementing neoliberal land policies and agriculture industrialization.
Q16|Factor Endowments and Farm Structure : Algerian Settler Agriculture During the First Globalization (1870-1914)|The adaptation of crops, agricultural techniques, and farm size to the new environments ushered in by colonialism help identify the sources of long-term development. This paper is a simplified approach to this adaptation process. It analyzes the relative factor endowments (land and labor) based on the timing of settlement to study the regional differences in the adoption of improved agricultural techniques in Constantine at the beginning of the 1900s. During the colonial years, the Algerian farming system diverged into large estates reliant on indigenous wage labor and sharecropping. As fertile land became increasingly scarce, the ability to participate in the grain export market depended on the capability of engaging in new and non-labor saving agricultural techniques. The results demonstrate that innovation in cash-crop production depended on the abundance of indigenous labor but also required a significant capital investment to offset the worse land quality. Thus, access constraints to agricultural advancement help explain the Algerian origins of colonial land inequality and the failure of colonial institutions to create a small-peasant settler economy.
Q16|Lâ€™impact des biocarburants sur les prix des matiÃ¨res premiÃ¨res agricoles|La rÃ©cente expansion des biocarburants soulÃ¨ve des interrogations quant Ã lâ€™Ã©mergence dâ€™une nouvelle relation entre les marchÃ©s agricoles et Ã©nergÃ©tiques. Dans ce contexte, nous analysons lâ€™influence du dÃ©veloppement des biocarburants sur les prix des matiÃ¨res premiÃ¨res agricoles (maÃ¯s, soja et blÃ©) en recourant aux techniques de cointÃ©gration afin dâ€™Ã©valuer, dans un premier temps, les liens de long terme entre les prix des biens agricoles, du pÃ©trole et de lâ€™Ã©thanol. Dans un second temps, nous analysons les dynamiques de court terme, en tenant compte de lâ€™existence potentielle de ruptures sur la pÃ©riode Ã©tudiÃ©e (1997-2017). Nos rÃ©sultats montrent que les effets liÃ©s au dÃ©veloppement des biocarburants divergent en fonction de la matiÃ¨re agricole Ã©tudiÃ©e. Pour le maÃ¯s (composant principal de lâ€™Ã©thanol), lâ€™expansion de lâ€™Ã©thanol amÃ©ricain nâ€™a pas contribuÃ© Ã la hausse de son prix. Pour le soja, les liens entre son marchÃ© et les marchÃ©s Ã©nergÃ©tiques (prix du pÃ©trole et de lâ€™Ã©thanol) sont plus importants. Lâ€™essor de la production du biodiÃ©sel a, en effet, contribuÃ© Ã la hausse de son prix. Enfin, pour le blÃ©, Ã long terme, son prix dÃ©pend du prix du pÃ©trole et de lâ€™Ã©thanol. Le dÃ©veloppement des biocarburants impacte le prix du blÃ© via un effet de substitution et via un impact sur les coÃ»ts des facteurs de production agricole. Cependant, Ã court terme, seules les variations du prix du pÃ©trole tendent Ã impacter celles du prix du blÃ©, via les effets sur les coÃ»ts de production
Q16|Asymmetric Spillover Effects between Agricultural Commodity Prices and Biofuel Energy Prices|This study addresses the problem of causal price relationships of biofuels for an enhanced group of agricultural commodities to capture possible asymmetric causal effects. It investigates the long-run equilibrium and assumes that an adjustment process toward this equilibrium exists. The adjustment process can be non-linear, implying that we can identify critical thresholds that determine regions in the sample that once exceeded, price inter linkages may vary. The empirical results indicate that there are commodity prices that have strong causal (asymmetric) relationship with biofuel energy prices.
Q16|Consumer preferences for second-generation bioethanol|This study investigates the consumer responses toward fuel from second-generation, nature-inspired lignocellulose processing systems. Data was collected via in-person consumer surveys across in three major U.S. cities with two different information treatments. A dichotomous-choice contingent valuation methodology is utilized to estimate consumers' willingness to pay for this product and analyze factors that affect consumer choice. The results suggest that the average respondent was willing to pay an 11% premium for second-generation nature-inspired bioethanol compared to conventional fuel. The willingness to pay was the highest in Portland, Oregon (17%), followed by Minneapolis (9%) and then Boston (8%). Driving distance was found to have a negative effect on consumer willingness to pay. Consumers who purchase more organic foods were more willing to pay a premium for the product. Risk attitude had heterogeneous effects in different locations. The effect of information regarding the second-generation, nature-inspired lignocellulose process was found to be significantly positive.
Q16|Welfare implications of the renewable fuel standard with an integrated tax-subsidy policy|This paper derives the optimal integrated tax-subsidy policy where one input is taxed and revenues are used to subsidize the use of a substitute input to reduce greenhouse gas emissions given the existing policies under the Renewable Fuel Standard policies. We measure the welfare effects and impact on cellulosic ethanol production after implementing the tax-subsidy policy using a general equilibrium model. A revenue-neutral integrated tax-subsidy scheme leads to a small positive tax rate for crude oil and a large positive subsidy for cellulosic ethanol because the former has a larger emissions coefficient than the latter. The overall welfare effects of an integrated tax subsidy scheme are less than a 1% increase for the economy but the growth in the cellulosic ethanol industry could range from 28% to 238% because the revenues from taxing crude oil are directly used to subsidize cellulosic ethanol production.
Q16|Ten striking facts about agricultural input use in Sub-Saharan Africa|Conventional wisdom holds that Sub-Saharan African farmers use few modern inputs despite the fact that most poverty-reducing agricultural growth in the region is expected to come largely from expanded use of inputs that embody improved technologies, particularly improved seed, fertilizers and other agro-chemicals, machinery, and irrigation. Yet following several years of high food prices, concerted policy efforts to intensify fertilizer and hybrid seed use, and increased public and private investment in agriculture, how low is modern input use in Africa really? This article revisits Africa’s agricultural input landscape, exploiting the unique, recently collected, nationally representative, agriculturally intensive, and cross-country comparable Living Standard Measurement Study-Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) covering six countries in the region (Ethiopia, Malawi, Niger, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda). Using data from over 22,000 households and 62,000 agricultural plots, we offer ten potentially surprising facts about modern input use in Africa today.
Q16|Using National Statistics to Increase Transparency of Large Land Acquisition: Evidence from Ethiopia|Almost a decade after the rise in land demand triggered by the 2007/08 commodity price boom, most potential target countries still lack access to relevant information on a routine basis. This has reduced their ability to effectively regulate, monitor, and attract responsible investors rather than speculators in their effort to increase agricultural productivity and have benefits accrue to the host communities. The example of Ethiopia shows how building on existing data collection efforts allows to address this challenge and help formulate policies that guide the path forward. Using the 2013/14 nationally representative smallholder and commercial farm surveys, we find that (i) for most crops commercial farms’ yields are higher than smallholders’, with a peak in the 10–20-ha bracket; (ii) commercial farms create few permanent jobs (with just one permanent job per 20ha) and use only 55% of the land transferred to them; and (iii) after a peak in 2008, formation of new commercial farms is down to the pre-2007 levels. These findings imply that having reliable data on commercial farms, collected on regular intervals, could generate feedback loops for policy formulation and also provide vital information to assess and take regulatory actions aimed at improving the performance and attracting higher levels of investment to the sector.
Q16|Food versus Fuel: An Updated and Expanded Evidence|"This paper replicates and extends the study of Zhang et al. (2010): „Food versus fuel: What do prices tell us?"" Energy Policy 38, pp. 445-451. We confirm the findings of the original paper that there was only a weak relationship between ethanol and food commodities in the period between March 1989 and July 2008. In addition, we extend that study and examine the cointegration relationship between biofuels and related commodities for a considerably enlarged dataset (3 vs. 1 market, 26 vs. 8 commodities, analysis up till 2017 vs. 2008, weekly vs. monthly data frequency). Focusing on the biofuel markets of Brazil, the EU and the USA in the three separate periods before, during, and after the food crisis of 2007 and 2008, we show that studying the time variation of the relationships plays an essential role in their proper understanding. Our results help to clarify the wide extensive discussion about the role of biofuels prices in food shortages manifested particularly during the food crises. In agreement with the original study, we confirm that price series data do not support strong statements about biofuels uniformly serving as main leading source of high food prices and consequently the food shortages."
Q16|The biofuel-development nexus: A meta-analysis|While the production of biofuels has expanded in recent years, findings in the literature on its impact on growth and development remain contradictory. This paper presents a meta-analysis of computable general equilibrium studies published between 2006 and 2014. Using 26 studies, we shed light on why their results differ. We investigate factors such as biofuel type, geographic area and the characteristics of models employed. Our results indicate that the outcomes of CGE simulations are sensitive to model parameters and also suggest heterogenous effects of biofuel expansion between developed / emerging countries and Sub-Saharan African countries. Our quantitative meta-analysis complements existing narrative surveys and confirms that results are sensitive to key hypotheses on essential parameters. Simulations on longer time periods and in multi-country studies lead to results that indicate higher impacts of biofuel expansion on growth and household income. Moreover, simulations with a shock in agricultural productivity indicate positive welfare gains, unlike simulations with a shock on land expansion. Lastly, we find that biodiesels lead to higher welfare gains than biofuels.
Q16|Prices of Biofuels and Related Commodities: An Example of Combined Economics and Graph Theory Approach|The article investigates the connections between the prices of biofuels and many traded commodities and other relevant assets in Europe, USA and Brazil. The analysis uses a comprehensive dataset covering price data for 32 relevant traded titles over the period 2003-2015. Main contribution of this article is a combination of minimum spanning tree and hierarchical tree approaches with expert economic understanding of biofuels market leading to identification of price connections in a complex trading system. Our analysis of mutual price connections discovers the major defining features of world leading biofuels markest over the last decade. We provide characteristics of main bioethanol and biodiesel markets with respect to technical and local features of the production and consumption of particular biofuels.

Q16|Limitations of Contract Farming as a Pro-poor Strategy: The Case of Maize Outgrower Schemes in Upper West Ghana|Contract farming (CF) arrangements have the potential to address market failures and improve technology adoption, productivity, and welfare. In Ghana, government and donors use CF as a strategy for increasing adoption of new agricultural technologies and developing value chains. Yet to date, there has not been a rigorous assessment of these CF schemes.

Q16|Growth factors in the agriculture of Russia|In 2016, record-high yields of grain, including wheat, maize, sunflower, soya and sugar-beet were received. A new record in poultry meat production was set. Despite economic recession, gross agricultural output has been growing in the past few years. Such results are attributed by many experts to the effect of the embargo on imports of food from some countries and import substitution measures. However, neither the embargo nor import substitution was a decisive factor behind growth in agriculture. The most important factors were the interest of the business in developing agriculture, depreciation of the ruble and favorable weather conditions of the past few years.
Q16|Can Phosphate Salts Recovered from Manure Replace Conventional Phosphate Fertilizer?|Pig farming produces more manure than can reasonably be spread onto surrounding fields, particularly in regions with high livestock densities and limited land availability. Nutrient recycling offers an attractive solution for dealing with manure excesses and is one main objective of the European commission-funded project “BioEcoSIM”. Phosphate salts (“P-Salt”) were recovered from the separated liquid manure fraction. The solid fraction was dried and carbonized to biochar. This study compared the fertilizing performance of P-Salt and conventional phosphate fertilizer and determined whether additional biochar application further increased biomass yields. The fertilizers and biochar were tested in pot experiments with spring barley and faba beans using two nutrient-poor soils. The crops were fertilized with P-Salt at three levels and biochar in two concentrations. Biomass yield was determined after six weeks. Plant and soil samples were analysed for nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium contents. The P-Salt had similar or even better effects than mineral fertilizer on growth in both crops and soils. Slow release of nutrients can prevent leaching, rendering P-Salt a particularly suitable fertilizer for light sandy soils. Biochar can enhance its fertilizing effect, but the underlying mechanisms need further investigation. These novel products are concluded to be promising candidates for efficient fertilization strategies.

Q16|Development and Testing of a Device to Increase the Level of Automation of a Conventional Milking Parlor through Vocal Commands|A portable wireless device with a “vocal commands” feature for activating the mechanical milking phase in conventional milking parlors was developed and tested to increase the level of automation in the milking procedures. The device was tested in the laboratory and in a milking parlor. Four professional milkers participated in the experiment. Before the start of the tests, a set of acoustic models with speaker-dependent commands defined for the project was acquired for each milker using a dedicated “milker training procedure”. Two experimental sessions were performed by each milker, with one session in the laboratory and a subsequent session in the milking parlor. The device performance was evaluated based on the accuracy demonstrated in the vocal command recognition task and rated using the word recognition rate (WRR). The data were expressed as %WRR and grouped based on the different cases evaluated. Mixed effects logistic regression modeling was used to evaluate the association between the %WRR and explanatory variables. The results indicated significant effects due to the location where the tests were performed. Higher values of the %WRR were found for tests performed in the laboratory, whereas lower values were found for tests performed in the milking parlor (due to the presence of background noise). Nevertheless, the general performance level achieved by the device was sufficient for increasing the automation level of conventional milking parlors.
Q16|Practices for Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Rice Production in Northeast Thailand|Land management practices for rice productivity and carbon storage have been a key focus of research leading to opportunities for substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. The effects of land management practices on global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) from rice production within the farm gate were investigated. For the 13 study sites, soil samples were collected by the Land Development Department in 2004. In 2014, at these same sites, soil samples were collected again to estimate the soil organic carbon sequestration rate (SOCSR) from 2004 to 2014. Surveys were conducted at each sampling site to record the rice yield and management practices. The carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ), and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions, Net GWP, and GHGI associated with the management practices were calculated. Mean rice yield and SOCSR were 3307 kg·ha −1 ·year −1 and 1173 kg·C·ha −1 ·year −1 , respectively. The net GWP varied across sites, from 819 to 5170 kg·CO 2 eq·ha −1 ·year −1 , with an average value of 3090 kg·CO 2 eq·ha −1 ·year −1 . GHGI ranged from 0.31 to 1.68 kg·CO 2 eq·kg −1 yield, with an average value of 0.97 kg·CO 2 eq·kg −1 yield. Our findings revealed that the amount of potassium (potash, K 2 O) fertilizer application rate is the most significant factor explaining rice yield and SOCSR. The burning of rice residues in the field was the main factor determining GHGI in this area. An effective way to reduce GHG emissions and contribute to sustainable rice production for food security with low GHGI and high productivity is avoiding the burning of rice residues.
Q16|State Support in Brazil for a Local Turn to Food|The local turn to food is often claimed to be a way to increase the value-added component retained by primary producers and to provide healthy, fresh and affordable food to consumers. Rio do Grande do Sul in Brazil has several governmental support programs that aim to empower family farmers and open up new market opportunities for them. This article examines these programs, investigates how small-scale farmers engage with them and the resultant changes in farming and marketing practices that ensue. The article uses cluster and content analysis to identify and interpret the extent, and the different ways, in which these farmers engage with and make use of the local knowledge and innovation system. The results provide useful insights into how policy instruments improve the performance of family agribusinesses, helping them to make better use of the resources available to them, encouraging farm diversification, and strengthening local interrelations between producers and consumers.
Q16|Beyond Food Provisioning: The Transformative Potential of Grassroots Innovation around Food|The newly-emerged ethical foodscape includes multiple expressions of innovation around food. With reference to the Italian context, this paper focuses on the transformative potential of the experiences of social innovation, innovative grassroots initiatives, which have been significantly contributed to shaping the food culture and production-consumption practices during the last two decades. While still consolidating their fundamentals and facing the challenge of growth, the networks behind them continue to be engaged in an effort of innovation, inside and outside their niche. The paper explores these dynamics. Understanding how these networks are managing their transformative capacity and what are the opportunities and challenges arising in the relation with the mainstream system may help to better capture and value the potential of this innovation niche, drawing useful lessons for fostering its expression and for a broader transition to more equitable and sustainable food systems.
Q16|Rice Cultivation and Greenhouse Gas Emissions: A Review and Conceptual Framework with Reference to Ghana|Rice is an essential crop in Ghana. Several aspects of rice have been studied to increase its production; however, the environmental aspects, including impact on climate change, have not been studied well. There is therefore a gap in knowledge, and hence the need for continuous research. By accessing academic portals, such as Springer Open, InTech Open, Elsevier, and the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology’s offline campus library, 61 academic publications including peer reviewed journals, books, working papers, reports, etc. were critically reviewed. It was found that there is a lack of data on how paddy rice production systems affect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly emissions estimation, geographical location, and crops. Regarding GHG emission estimation, the review identified the use of emission factors calibrated using temperate conditions which do not suit tropical conditions. On location, most research on rice GHG emissions have been carried out in Asia with little input from Africa. In regard to crops, there is paucity of in-situ emissions data from paddy fields in Ghana. Drawing on the review, a conceptual framework is developed using Ghana as reference point to guide the discussion on fertilizer application, water management rice cultivars, and soil for future development of adaptation strategies for rice emission reduction.
Q16|Efflux of Soil Nitrous Oxide from Applied Fertilizer Containing Organic Materials in Citrus unshiu Field in Southwestern Japan|Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions from agricultural fields are an important source of the increasing atmospheric N 2 O concentration. We conducted a two-year investigation of soil N 2 O emissions induced by the application of combined organic and synthetic fertilizer (COS) and distilled silage waste (DSW). Three experimental treatments were applied to a Citrus unshiu field in January 2013 in Ehime, Japan: no fertilizer (NF), COS, and DSW. The applied nitrogen (N) from DSW was 192 and 244 kg N ha −1 in the first and second years, respectively, although the N application in COS was 192 kg N ha −1 in both years. The main N forms in COS and DSW were ammonium- and nitrate-N, respectively. Soil N 2 O and carbon dioxide fluxes, soil chemical properties, and mineral N leaching from topsoil were measured. The soil N 2 O flux increased after fertilization in COS and DSW, and a higher N 2 O efflux after supplemental fertilization was induced by warm and wet soil conditions. The emission factor of N 2 O was higher in COS (2.02%) than in DSW (1.18%), while N leaching was higher in DSW than in COS. The organic materials remaining after the application possibly increased the N 2 O emissions in the summer season. Therefore, to mitigate N 2 O emissions in citrus orchards, fertilizer containing organic materials should be applied during a cool and dry season.
Q16|Small-Scale Vegetable Farmers’ Participation in Modern Retail Market Channels in Indonesia: The Determinants of and Effects on Their Income|The rise of supermarkets in Indonesia since the end of the 1990s have been transforming the food retail sector and providing further market opportunities for small-scale farmers, in which most of Indonesia’s farmer falls into this category. The aim of this paper is to examine the supermarket participation and its effect on the well-being of small-scale farmers. We compare the differences between participants and non-participants in supermarket channels in order to explore the constraints on supermarket participation. By applying a treatment effects model which allows capturing the possibility of selection bias, we examine the factors that determine farmers’ participation as well as the effect on their income. The results show that younger farmers with higher levels of education, irrigated land, who have packaging equipment and storage facilities, and are located near paved roads, are more likely to participate in the supermarket channels. On the other hand, farmers who have sprayer equipment are more likely to participate in the traditional market channels. The effect analysis shows that small-scale farmer participation in the supermarket channels can boost their income.
Q16|Durum Wheat Cover Analysis in the Scope of Policy and Market Price Changes: A Case Study in Southern Italy|Agricultural land systems are the result of human interactions with the natural environment, and subjective evidence of socio-economic and environmental interactions has been demonstrated. Nevertheless, it is still difficult to analyze empirically the link between agricultural market and policy, as well as the environmental response due to changes in crop management by local stakeholders. In this study, we propose a cross investigation and analysis to bring the link between vegetation cover, policy, market and farmer’s behavior to light. Our methodology is a combination of a rational positive and analogical approach between the quantifiable and non-quantifiable agents on a temporal basis. The method is applied to a dominant mono-crop agricultural watershed in Southern Italy that has been dedicated to durum wheat cultivation. In this region, we studied the relationship between the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), durum wheat market price, vegetation cover and land allocation. As a first step, we conducted a separate analysis for each factor, exploiting Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite observed Leaf Area Index (LAI) to analyze the land vegetation space–time distribution over the period 2000–2014 and three Land Satellite (Landsat) validated images as check-points for the agricultural pattern and CAP’s reforms. We used the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) and Eurostat data to investigate the on-farm accountancy and the durum wheat market price changes, respectively. Based on the study period, we developed a storyline of the major relevant CAP’s policy changes. In a second step, we conducted a comparative analysis where the CAP’s reforms were used as interpretational support, the land allocation and the on-farm accountability for CAP’s implementation, the price of durum wheat and the LAI for analytical comparison. We found interesting insights regarding the non-agronomic driving forces of LAI dynamics. The behavior of the individual farmers is influenced by the CAP policy that has been implemented by using profitability as the stimulus for the decision making of the farmer. This explains the correlation of the trend between the market price, the LAI of durum wheat and their associated dynamics.
Q16|Mitigating Global Warming Potential and Greenhouse Gas Intensities by Applying Composted Manure in Cornfield: A 3-Year Field Study in an Andosol Soil|A 3-year study was conducted in cornfield to evaluate how composted cattle manure application affects net global warming potential (GWP; the sum of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and methane (CH 4 ) minus net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB)) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI; net GWP per unit of plant biomass yield). In the first experiment, conducted from 2010 to 2012, five fertilization strategies that included an unfertilized control plot, inorganic fertilizer-only plot, two plots with inorganic fertilizer plus composted cattle manure, and composted cattle manure-only plot were established. In the second experiment composted cattle manure was applied in autumn 2012 and the field was subdivided into three plots in spring 2013, with one plot receiving additional composted cattle manure, the second plot received additional inorganic fertilizer and the third plot did not receive any additional fertilization. Fluxes of N 2 O, CH 4 and CO 2 were measured using the static closed chamber method. NECB was calculated as carbon (C) inputs minus C output (where a negative value indicates net C loss). In experiment 1, manure application significantly increased NECB and reduced net GWP by more than 30% in each of the three years of the study. GHGI in the manure-amended plots was lower than in other plots, except in 2012 when the manure-only plot had higher GHGI than fertilizer-only plot. Application of inorganic fertilizer alone increased GWP by 5% and 20% in 2010 and 2011, but showed a 30% reduction in 2012 relative to the unfertilized control plot. However, due to higher net primary production (NPP), fertilizer-only plot had lower GHGI compared to the control. Application of inorganic fertilizer together with manure showed the greatest potential to reduce GWP and GHGI, while increasing NPP and NECB. In experiment 2, additional manure or inorganic fertilizer application in spring increased NPP by a similar amount, but additional manure application also increased NECB, and decreased GWP and GHGI. Manure application, as a partial substitute or supplemental fertilizer, shows potential to mitigate GWP and GHGI.
Q16|Advances in Eco-Efficient Agriculture: The Plant-Soil Mycobiome|In order to achieve a desirable ecological and sustainable agriculture a thorough understanding of the plant-soil mycobiome is imperative. Commercial industrial agriculture alters greenhouse gas emissions, promotes loss of plant and soil biodiversity, increases pollution by raising atmospheric CO 2 , and releases pesticides, thus affecting both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Diversified farming systems, including perennial cultivated pastures, are among worldwide strategies that aim to reduce terrestrial greenhouse gas emissions and deal with threats to global sustainability. Additionally, stimulation of soil microbes and appropriate soil management can influence soil interactions as well as the rates of organic matter decomposition and the release of gases. Agricultural soil microbial communities play a central role in ecosystem processes and are affected by biocontrol agents, biofertilizers, and exposure to pesticides, the extent to which is yet to be fully elucidated. Intercropping different plant species is beneficial, as this can increase carbon fixation by plants, transferring carbon to the soil, especially via mycorrhizas, thus modifying interplant interactions. This review focuses on agro-ecosystems, showing the latest advances in the plant-soil interface (the mycobiome) for an eco-efficient agricultural production.
Q16|Achieving Sustainability: Insights from Biogas Ecosystems in India|This paper focuses on how the use of renewable energy technologies such as biogas can help to achieve environmental and socio-economic sustainability. It combines research on sustainable consumption and production, natural and industrial ecosystems and renewable energy adoption to develop a framework for an industrial ecosystem for biogas for bottom-of-the-pyramid and rural populations. The framework suggests that three dimensions of industrial ecosystems and a meta-dimension can be embedded in the design of a new industrial ecosystem for biogas to facilitate environmental and socio-economic sustainability. Case studies of an organization engaged in using biogas to create a sustainable bioenergy ecosystem for rural populations and two organizations producing biogas in urban India provide support for the framework.
Q16|Assessment of Photosynthetic Pigment and Water Contents in Intact Sunflower Plants from Spectral Indices|Under water-limited conditions, monitoring water and chlorophyll status is essential to avoid restrictions in crop growth and yield. This study was carried out to assess water and chlorophyll contents from spectral indices in sunflower plants. The hybrid Sunbright Supreme was cultivated inside a non-acclimatized greenhouse until the start of the flowering stage, and later was maintained in a growth chamber with the purpose of submitting the plants to a slow and progressive dehydration rate for 12 consecutive days. Spectral (reflectance and transmittance), leaf masses (fresh and dry), and total chlorophyll measurements were accomplished in sunflower plants. The water stress caused a reduction in the water and chlorophyll contents, resulting in linear and nonlinear decreases for the spectral indicators Water Index (WI) and Chlorophyll Content Index (CCI), respectively. The low scattering of the average values around the fitted models indicates that WI and CCI were effective in representing changes in water and chlorophyll status for sunflowers ( R 2 = 0.912 and R 2 = 0.905). The benefits of using hand-held optical meters for reflectance and transmittance are that they enable rapid, accurate, and nondestructive assessments of water and chlorophyll contents in sunflower plants from radiometric indicators.
Q16|Changes in the Polyphenolic Profile, Carotenoids and Antioxidant Potential of Apricot ( Prunus armeniaca L.) Leaves during Maturation|Apricot ( Prunus armeniaca L.) leaves were studied to assess the potential of apricot leaves for future studies and their applications in nutraceutical and bioactive functional ingredients. The changes in the phenolic profile, carotenoids, pigments and antioxidant potential were studied at four maturation stages. Polyphenols and carotenoids were studied using reversed-phase HPLC-DAD. Pigments, total phenolic contents and radical scavenging activity were also measured. Results revealed twelve phenolic compounds in the apricot leaves. The major phenolic compounds were 3- O -caffeoylquinic acid (14.6–49.6 mg/g), 4- O -caffeoylquinic acid (0.56–7.5 mg/g), 5- O -caffeoylquinic acid (5.6–25.7 mg/g) and quercetin-3- O -glucosides (8.6–19.9 mg/g), while others include caffeic acid and derivatives of coumaric acid and kaempferol. Significant changes were observed in polyphenolic compounds during maturation. Lutein (56.7–65.7 µg/g), neoxanthin (0.66–4.79 µg/g), 5,6-epoxy-α-carotene (5.89–7.9 µg/g), and β-carotene (12.3–26.9 µg/g) were the major carotenoids. There were significant variations in the carotenoids, pigment contents, total phenolic contents and radical scavenging activity during maturation. In conclusion, significant variation occurred in the polyphenolic profile, carotenoids contents and antioxidant potential of apricot leaves under the studied conditions.
Q16|Ammonia and Methane Emission Factors from Cattle Operations Expressed as Losses of Dietary Nutrients or Energy|The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of published literature on ammonia (NH 3 ) and enteric methane (CH 4 ) emissions from beef and dairy cattle operations to obtain statistically representative emission factors based on dietary intakes of nutrients or energy, and to identify major causes of emission variations. NH 3 emissions from lagoon or other manure storage facilities were not included in this review. The NH 3 and CH 4 emission rates, expressed as a percentage losses of dietary nutrients or energy, demonstrated much less variation compared with emission rates expressed in g/animal/day. Air temperature and dietary crude protein (CP) content were identified as two major factors that can affect NH 3 emission rates in addition to farm type. Feed digestibility and energy intake were identified as two major factors that can affect CH 4 emission rates expressed as a percentage losses of dietary energy. Generally, increasing productivity and feed efficiency represented the greatest opportunity for mitigating NH 3 or CH 4 emissions per unit of livestock product. Expressing CH 4 loss on a digestible energy basis rather than a gross energy intake basis can better represent the large variation among diets and the effects of varying dietary emission mitigation strategies.

Q16|Effect of Organic and Inorganic Fertilizers on Soil Properties and the Growth, Yield and Quality of Tomato in Mymensingh, Bangladesh|Field trials were conducted on tomato for yield and quality of fruits using different types of organic and inorganic fertilizers at the horticulture farm of Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU), Mymensingh. Fertilizer treatments were tested on two varieties of tomato ca. Roma VF and BARI 15. The fertilization treatments were T1, vermicompost (12 t/ha); T2, compost (10 t/ha); T3, integrated plant nutrient system (IPNS) or mixed fertilizers (organic 2/3 part and inorganic 1/3 part); T4, inorganic fertilizers; and a control (T5). Results showed growth and yield (20.8 t/ha) in tomato were higher in the IPNS treatment. A higher number of fruits per plant (73.7) and plant height (73.5 cm) were obtained from mixed fertilizers (organic 2/3 + inorganic 1/3) or IPNS (integrated plant nutrient system) in Roma VF than other treatments. Fruit yield and diameter were found statistically significant. No significant difference was observed in the quality (total soluble solids) of tomato fruits in both varieties’ response to the treatments. The electrical conductivity and pH of the soil were improved by the application of organic manure.
Q16|Guest Editorial: Conservation Tillage for Organic Farming|There is interest in reducing or even eliminating tillage in organic production systems. In this special Issue, research teams in Europe and North America summarize recent and on-going efforts to develop conservation-tillage systems that can be used on commercial organic farms. While progress is being made in the development of organic no-tillage (no-till) systems, considerable work still needs to be done before there will be wide-spread adoption by organic farmers.
Q16|The Impact of a Warming Micro‐Climate on Muooni Farmers of Kenya|Rainfed agriculture has become highly vulnerable to the depleting water resources in most arid and semi‐arid tropics (ASATs) under the effect of climate change. The impact has certainly been very high in Muooni catchment where more than 99% of the natural forest has been cleared. The warming micro‐climate is accelerated by extended deforestation, unsustainable irrigation, and water over‐abstraction in the catchment by eucalyptus and other exotic trees. The dwindling crop yields add to the farmer’s suffering. Farming communities have created various innovative ways of coping with a warming environment to increase their agriculture resiliency. These include, among others, rain water management, reforestation and agro‐forestry. To what extent have these practices been disturbed by the increasing temperatures, and decreasing rainfalls and river discharges in Muooni catchment? This study used statistical forecast techniques to unveil the past, current and future variations of the micro‐climate in Muooni catchment, and relevant factors determining farmers’ vulnerability to drought. Muooni catchment is warming by 0.8 to 1.2 °C in a century as a result of a changing micro‐climate. These changes are mainly driven by deforestation due to the high urbanization rate and agricultural practices in Muooni catchment. Centennial rainfall is subsequently plummeting at 30 to 50 mm while discharges are decreasing from 0.01 to 0.05 m3∙s−1, with unmet water demands of 30% to 95% and above. In view of the current trends of the population growth and urbanization in Muooni, agricultural expansion is seriously threatened if no appropriate policy, extension service and science based emergency measures are put in place by the Government of Kenya.
Q16|Suppression of CH4 Emission by Rice Straw Removal and Application of Bio‐Ethanol Production Residue in a Paddy Field in Akita, Japan|To elucidate the effects of rice straw removal and rice straw‐based bio‐ethanol production residue application on rice growth and methane (CH4) emission from a paddy field, a lysimeter experiment with three treatments (application of rice straw after harvesting (the rice‐straw plot); removal of rice straw and the application of bio‐ethanol production residue (the Et‐residue plot); removal of rice straw (the no‐application plot)) was conducted over three years. Though the grain yields in the Et‐residue and no‐application plots tended to be slightly higher than that in the ricestraw plot, there were no significant differences among the plots (530–546 g∙m−2). Suppression of CH4 emission by the treatments was found clearly in the early part of the growing season. The total CH4 emissions during the rice‐growing season (unit: g∙C∙m−2∙period−1) followed the order of the noapplication plot (11.9) < the Et‐residue plot (14.6) < the rice‐straw plot (25.4), and a significant difference was found between the no‐application and rice‐straw plots. Consequently, bio‐ethanol production from rice straw and a following application of its residue to paddy fields is considered to be a promising technology which can obtain new sustainable energy and suppress CH4 emission without any inhibition on rice growth.
Q16|Development and Evaluation of Poly Herbal Molluscicidal Extracts for Control of Apple Snail ( Pomacea maculata )|Golden Apple Snail (GAS) is the most destructive invasive rice pest in Southeast Asia. The cost of synthetic molluscicides, their toxicity to non-target organisms, and their persistence in the environment have propelled the research of plant-derived molluscicides. Most research efforts have focused on individual plant extracts for their molluscicidal potency against GAS and have not been proven to be entirely effective in rice field conditions. Selective combination of synergistically acting molluscicidal compounds from various plant extracts might be an effective alternative. In this direction, ethanolic extracts from six different plants (Neem, Tobacco, Nerium, Pongamia, Zinger, and Piper) were evaluated against Pomacea maculata Perry. Of the various combinations studied, a binary extract (1:1) of nerium and tobacco (LC 90 177.71 mg/L, 48 h), and two tri-herbal extract formulations (1:1:1) of (nerium + tobacco + piper) and (nerium + tobacco + neem) were found to be most effective, with LC 90 values of 180.35 mg/L and 191.52 mg/L, respectively, in laboratory conditions. The synergistic effect of combined herbal extracts resulted in significant reduction in LC 90 values of the individual extracts. The findings of this study demonstrate that the selective combinations of potent molluscicidal herbal extracts are effective for management of P. maculata under laboratory conditions.
Q16|Fusarium Wilt Affecting Chickpea Crop|Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) contributes 18% of the global production of grain legume and serves as an important source of dietary protein. An important decrease in cropping area and production has been recorded during the last two decades. Several biotic and abiotic constraints underlie this decrease. Despite the efforts deployed in breeding and selection of several chickpea varieties with high yield potential that are tolerant to diseases, the situation has remained the same for the last decade. Fusarium wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceris (Foc) is the major soilborne fungus affecting chickpeas globally. Fusarium wilt epidemics can devastate crops and cause up to 100% loss in highly infested fields and under favorable conditions. To date, eight pathogenic races of Foc (races 0, 1A, 1B/C, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) have been reported worldwide. The development of resistant cultivars is the most effective method to manage this disease and to contribute to stabilizing chickpea yields. Development of resistant varieties to fusarium wilt in different breeding programs is mainly based on conventional selection. This method is time‐consuming and depends on inoculum load and specific environmental factors that influence disease development. The use of molecular tools offers great potential for chickpea improvement, specifically by identifying molecular markers closely linked to genes/QTLs controlling fusarium wilt.
Q16|Phytochemistry and Agro-Industrial Potential of Native Oilseeds from West Africa: African Grape ( Lannea microcarpa ), Marula ( Sclerocarya birrea ), and Butter Tree ( Pentadesma butyracea )|Ethnobotanical investigations on local oilseed species in Burkina Faso revealed that oils from tree oilseeds are frequently used for food, cosmetics and traditional medicine by local people. To test the bio-preservative capacity, the effect of the oilseed extracts on the stabilization of Shea butter was evaluated. Levels of bioactive phyto-components were evaluated through several methods. Some aspects of the quality of oilcakes were evaluated based on their inhibitory capacity on the endogenous digestive enzymes of cattle. For fat stabilizing quality, the extract from Lannea microcarpa Engl. & K. Krause has showed the largest increase (91.47%) in the Rancimat induction time (TIR) of Shea butter. Using DPPH and FRAP methods for prevention or scavenging of free radicals, the results evidenced the highest activity with extracts of L. microcarpa . With respect to the feed quality of the oilcakes, the IC 50 obtained with α-amylase and trypsin have showed that the ethanolic extracts of Pentadesma butyracea Sabine (1824) is less toxic for cattle. These results suggest that phenolic compounds extracted from these native oilseeds, especially those of Lannea microcarpa , can be used as biological antioxidants for bio-preservation of edible fats. In addition, the by-products of the oil-extraction can be valorized as nontoxic and protein-rich oilcakes for livestock feed.
Q16|Changes in Carbon Cycling during Development of Successional Agroforestry|Successional agroforestry systems (SAFS) mimic the structure of natural forests while providing economical outputs. This study clarifies how carbon cycling and carbon sequestration change during successional development of SAFS. In Brazil, three successional stages of SAFS, 6, 12, and 34 years old, were compared in terms of carbon balance. Aboveground biomass, fruit harvest, litterfall, soil respiration, and soil organic carbon were measured for two years and analyzed. Carbon sequestration expressed by net primary productivity increased with age of SAFS from 9.8 Mg·C·ha −1 ·year −1 in 6-year-old system to 13.5 Mg·C·ha −1 ·year −1 in 34-year-old system. Accumulation of plant biomass and increased internal carbon cycling in SAFS led to an intensive sequestration of carbon. SAFS can be a sustainable way of agricultural production on vulnerable tropical soils.
Q16|Impacts of Rural Labor Resource Change on the Technical Efficiency of Crop Production in China|This paper probes effects of the evolvement of labor resources on technical efficiency in crop production in rural China. Based on twelve years of data on crop production of 30 provinces in China, a stochastic frontier production function model is used to measure crop production efficiency in three crop-functional areas—the production area, the consumption area, and the balanced area. Then effects of both quantity and quality change in labor force on technical efficiency in different regions of China are analyzed. Results show that rural China generally has an increasing number of employees shifted to non-agricultural sectors and a decreasing trend of the stock of human capital. However, both these two changes in rural labor force have significantly positive effects on improving crop production efficiency. In addition, China’s technical inefficiency is at an average of 22.2%. Dynamically, the technical efficiencies show a tendency to rise steadily throughout China and in three areas, while the consumption area possesses the highest technical efficiency. Those results may lend some experience for other countries that are currently experiencing rural labor force and economic transition.
Q16|Surface and Subsurface Transport of Nitrate Loss from the Selected Bioenergy Crop Fields: Systematic Review, Analysis and Future Directions|Nitrate loss from bioenergy crop fields has attracted considerable attention during the last few years because of its potential negative impact on aquatic and human health. Both controllable and uncontrollable factors for nitrate loss have been the subject of several previous studies. Due to differences in climate, biophysical dissimilarities and land management characteristics in different parts of the world the factors affecting nitrate loss are often inconsistent and hence difficult to generalize. Therefore, reanalyzing the experimental field or plot scale studies to understand the nitrate loss factors in crop fields is useful and necessary in developing management strategies for reducing nitrate loss. This research synthesized and investigated 36 peer reviewed scientific journal articles related to selected bioenergy crop fields that included: continuous corn, corn in rotation with soybean, switchgrass and Miscanthus to conduct a meta-analysis of the available research. In this study, factors such as drain tile spacing, tillage practices, type and timing of the fertilization rate, irrigation and various other factors, which are challenging to represent in regression equations, were also systematically analyzed. In addition, various other agronomic characteristics that are attributed too nitrate loss are caused by perennially planted bio energized crops such as Miscanthus and switchgrass. Results indicated that 49% of nitrate loss through surface runoff from corn fields is directly related to the annual precipitation and fertilization rate. Multiple linear regression equations were developed to estimate the annual subsurface nitrate loss for the continuous corn fields with a R 2 value of 0.65, 0.58 and 0.26 for sandy loam, silty loam and clay loam, respectively. Our analysis resulted in the conclusion that corn has a 2 to 3 times higher nitrate loss in surface runoff compared to switchgrass. Likewise, continuous corn and corn in rotation with soybean contributed more than 9 times the subsurface loss of nitrate compared to the established subsurface loss attributed to the Miscanthus and switchgrass.
Q16|Evaluation of Pectin Extraction Conditions and Polyphenol Profile from Citrus x lantifolia Waste: Potential Application as Functional Ingredients|The citrus by-products pectin and polyphenols were obtained from Citrus x lantifolia residues. The use of acid type, solute-solvent ratio, temperature, and extraction time on pectin yield recovery was evaluated using a factorial design 3 4 ; pectin physicochemical characterization, polyphenol profile, and antioxidant activity were also determined. Results indicated a total polyphenol content of 3.92 ± 0.06 mg Galic Acid Equivalents (GAE)/g of citrus waste flour in dry basis (DB), with antioxidant activity of 74%. The presence of neohesperidin (0.96 ± 0.09 mg/g of citrus flour DB), hesperidin (0.27 ± 0.0 mg/g of citrus flour DB), and ellagic acid (0.18 ± 0.03 mg/g of citrus flour DB) as major polyphenols was observed. All of the factors evaluated in pectin recovery presented significant effects ( p < 0.05), nevertheless the acid type and solute-solvent ratio showed the greatest effect. The highest yield of pectin recovery (36%) was obtained at 90 °C for 90 min, at a ratio of 1:80 ( w / v ) using citric acid. The evaluation of pectin used as a food ingredient in cookies elaboration, resulted in a reduction of 10% of fat material without significant texture differences ( p < 0.05). The pectin extraction conditions and characterization from these residues allowed us to determine the future applications of these materials for use in several commercial applications.
Q16|Nitrous Oxide Emission from Organic Fertilizer and Controlled Release Fertilizer in Tea Fields|A field experiment was conducted for two years in the Green Tea Laboratory of Saitama Prefectural Agriculture and Forestry Research Center, Iruma, Saitama, Japan from March 2014 to December 2015. Controlled release fertilizers (CRF) or organic fertilizers (ORG), which are a mixture of chicken manure and oil cake, were applied with the amount of 450 kg·N·ha −1 ·year −1 in 2014 and 397 kg·N·ha −1 ·year −1 in 2015. Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions from soil in green tea fields were measured by the closed chamber method. The results showed that CRF has significantly lower N 2 O compared to ORG. The cumulative N 2 O emissions from CRF accounted for 51% of N 2 O emissions from ORG fields and 138% of control with no fertilizer treatment. The N 2 O flux from the row was higher than that under the canopy, since fertilizer was applied on the row. However, the total emission from the area between the rows was lower than that under the canopy because the area ratio between the row and canopy was 1:5.
Q16|Impact of Practice Change on Runoff Water Quality and Vegetable Yield—An On-Farm Case Study|Intensive agricultural practices in farming systems in eastern Australia have been identified as a contributor to the poor runoff water quality entering the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). A field investigation was carried out to measure the off-farm water quality and productivity in a coastal farming system in northeastern Australia. Two vegetable crops (capsicum and zucchini) were grown in summer 2010–2011 and winter 2011 respectively using four different management practices (Conventional—plastic mulch, bare inter-row conventional tillage and commercial fertilizer inputs; Improved—improved practice with plastic mulch, inter-row vegetative mulch, zonal tillage and reduced fertilizer rates; Trash mulch—improved practice with cane-trash or forage-sorghum mulch with reduced fertilizer rates, minimum or zero tillage; and Vegetable only—improved practice with Rhodes grass or forage-sorghum mulch, minimum or zero tillage, reduced fertilizer rates). Results suggest improved and trash mulch systems reduced sediment and nutrient loads by at least 50% compared to conventional systems. The residual nitrate nitrogen in soil accumulated at the end-of-break crop cycle was lost by deep drainage before the subsequent sugarcane crop could utilize it. These results suggest that future research into establishing the linkages between deep drainage, groundwater quality and lateral movement into adjacent streams is needed. The improvement in runoff water quality was accompanied by yield reductions of up to 55% in capsicum and 57% in zucchini under trash mulch systems, suggesting a commercially unacceptable trade-off between water quality and productivity for a practice change. The current study has shown that variations around improved practice (modified nutrient application strategies under plastic mulch, but with an inter-space mulch to minimize runoff and sediment loss) may be the most practical solution to improve water quality and maintain productivity. However, more work is required to optimize this approach and thus reduce the size of any potential productivity and profitability gap that would necessitate an expensive policy intervention to implement.
Q16|Effect of Organic, Inorganic Fertilizers and Plant Spacing on the Growth and Yield of Cabbage|The impact of chemical farming and the negative consequences on the environment and human health in Bangladesh are on the rise. Organic farming is gaining attention and increasing globally because it is eco-friendly, safe and has benefits for human health. A field study was conducted at the horticulture farm of Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU), Mymensingh, to evaluate the growth and yield performance of cabbage cv. Atlas—70 using organic and inorganic fertilizers in various plant spacing arrangements. Two factor experiments were conducted on plant spacings of 60 cm × 40 cm (S 1 ), 60 cm × 50 cm (S 2 ) and 60 cm × 60 cm (S 3 ) and fertilizers vermicompost (T 1 ), biogen (T 2 ), integrated plant nutrient system (IPNS) Organic (⅔) + inorganic (⅓) (T 3 ) and inorganic (T 4 ). IPNS (T 3 ) application increased the marketable yield (54.77 t·ha −1 ) of cabbage. The highest marketable yield (48.75 t·ha −1 ) was obtained with a plant spacing of 60 cm × 40 cm (S 1 ). No significant variation was found in plant spacings S 1 and S 2 . The treatment combination of S 2 T 3 recorded the highest plant height (37.81 cm), plant spread (47.75 cm), cabbage head (21.80 cm), stem length (12.31 cm), thickness of the cabbage head (12.53 cm) and marketable yield (65.0 t·ha −1 ). The results suggest that IPNS (T 3 ) combining organic and inorganic fertilizer applications with a 60 cm × 50 cm spacing (S 2 T 3 ) increases the yield performance of cabbage.
Q16|Global Biofuels at the Crossroads: An Overview of Technical, Policy, and Investment Complexities in the Sustainability of Biofuel Development|Biofuels have the potential to alter the transport and agricultural sectors of decarbonizing societies. Yet, the sustainability of these fuels has been questioned in recent years in connection with food versus fuel trade-offs, carbon accounting, and land use. Recognizing the complicated playing field for current decision-makers, we examine the technical attributes, policy, and global investment activity for biofuels (primarily liquids). Differences in feedstock and fuel types are considered, in addition to policy approaches of major producer countries. Issues with recent, policy-driven trade developments are highlighted to emphasize how systemic complexities associated with sustainability must also be managed. We conclude with near-term areas to watch.
Q16|The private value of plant variety protection and the impact of exemption rules| Plant Breeders Rights (PBRs) are sui generis IPRs intended to promote plant variety creation. Two characteristics distinguish PBRs from patents: the research and the farmers' exemptions. This article attempts to assess the impact of these exemption rules on the private value of PBRs. For this purpose, a microeconometric model of PBRs renewals is developed and estimated. This model extends previous models of patents renewals by allowing the use of PBRs-specific variables. It is argued that simple tests on the coefficients associated with key PBRs-specific variables can provide insights into the impact of the two exemption rules. Implementation to PBRs in France over the period 1973–2011 for six major crops suggests that neither the farmers' exemption nor the research exemption have a clear-cut effect on the private value of PBRs. We conclude that there is no evidence to argue in favor of a reform of PBRs.
Q16|Are the Laffer curve and the green paradox mutually exclusive?|In this paper, we study the relationship between the Laffer curve and the green paradox in the context of a Ramsey model with endogenous labor supply in which pollution increases consumer demand (through a compensation effect). We find that—in the long run—the conditions under which a Laffer curve and a green paradox emerge are mutually exclusive. Indeed, the Laffer curve exists under a weak compensation effect, while the green paradox requires a strong effect. Also, we find that, in the short run, limit cycles may arise in the presence of a Laffer curve, while they never occur under a green paradox.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Q16|The ecological footprint of early-modern commodities Coefficients of land use per unit of product|Land availability and overseas trade have been central topics in economic history. The current paper contributes to this literature by setting the empirical foundations necessary for the calculation of the direct ecological footprints of more than eighty traded commodities throughout the 19th and early 20th century. The main focus is placed upon products which were heavily traded by and within the British Empire during this period. Various secondary sources have been reviewed and are critically discussed while the methodological steps that have been followed for the calculation of an acreage conversion factor for each product are analyzed in detail. The data presented here can be useful for researchers examining the importance of ghost acreages and ecological footprint historically but also the role of natural resources and land use in a long term perspective.
Q16|Agricultural Trade Reform, Reallocation and Technical Change: Evidence from the Canadian Prairies|We decompose the impact of trade reform on technology adoption and land use to study how aggregate changes were driven by reallocation versus within-farm adaptation. Using detailed census data covering over 30,000 farms in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, Canada we find a range of new results. We find that the reform-induced shift from producing low-value to high-value crops for export, the adoption of new seeding technologies and reduction in summerfallow observed at the aggregate level between 1991 and 2001 were driven mainly by the within-farm effect. In the longer run, however, reallocation of land from shrinking and exiting farms to growing and new farms explains more than half of the aggregate changes in technology adoption and land use between 1991 and 2011.
Q16|How to measure greenhouse gas emissions by fuel type for binary sustainability standards: Average or Marginal emissions? An example of fertilizer use and corn ethanol|This study proposed a modelling framework which addresses various issues such as decreasing marginal yield of corn with respect to fertilizer use in biofuel production and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions. Particularly, the framework considered exogenous changes including oil price development and biofuel policy through market interactions of different inputs and outputs in biofuel production. We applied the modelling framework numerically in an example of corn ethanol production in the United States to illustrate how the economics of fertilizer use could impact the GHG emissions based on both average and marginal emissions. The results show that higher oil prices increase the prices of gasoline, natural gas, ethanol, and corn, which stimulates corn-based ethanol production and increases corn yields by encouraging profit-maximizing farmers to increase their application rate of nitrogen fertilizers slightly. The effect is that, on average, GHG emissions per unit of produced corn ethanol remain almost constant if oil price increases from 60 to 120 $/barrel. However, the marginal emissions per additional unit of ethanol production increase by 2.2% or10%, depending on whether the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit is implemented or not. More important is that the marginal emissions of corn ethanol are much higher than those of conventional gasoline. Although on average there are GHG emission savings of corn ethanol compared to conventional gasoline, the savings are negative when based on the marginal emissions of corn ethanol. An interesting implication is that the effectiveness of biofuel policies aimed at reducing GHG emissions might be questionable.
Q16|The adoption potential of Conservation Agriculture technologies in Malawi: A lead farmer promoter-adopter approach and assessment|This paper assesses the adoption potential of conservation agriculture (CA) technologies in Malawi, where CA appears highly appropriate. Estimation of CA adoption rates and their determinants is complicated by the relatively recent introduction of these technologies and limited awareness of CA among the general population of smallholder farmers. We propose a lead farmer promoter-adopter approach and use it to assess the adoption potential of CA among smallholder farmers in Malawi. This approach relies on the promoters being potential adopters themselves, having had sufficient exposure and access to the technologies, and their incentives not having been distorted by excessive incentives. These conditions are reasonably satisfied in our application with a sample of 181 lead farmers from central and southern Malawi. We find adoption rates for the lead farmers of 56% for organic manure and crop rotation, 26% for minimum tillage, 30% for mulching, and 12% for herbicide application. Lead farmers recommend CA to their followers at rates of 66% for organic manure, about 50% for crop rotation and minimum tillage, 28% for mulching, and less than 10% for herbicide application. Assuming the validity of the promoter-adopter approach, these findings together suggest that, in central and southern Malawi, organic manure and crop rotation have the highest adoption potential, mulching and minimum tillage come next, and herbicide application has the lowest potential. With the farmer-to-farmer extension approach gaining popularity in many countries, we expect that our promoter-adopter approach to assessing adoption potential of new technologies will be of broad interest.
Q16|Adoption of CA technologies among Followers of Lead Farmers: How Strong is the Influence from Lead Farmers?|This study investigates how the Farmer-to-Farmer-Extension (F2FE) system with lead farmers and follower farmers influences adoption of Conservation Agriculture (CA) technologies in Malawi. Using data from 180 lead farmers and their 455 followers in central and southern Malawi, we assess the level of influence lead farmers have on their followers’ familiarity with and adoption of CA. The main findings are that (a) lead farmers have significant influence on CA familiarity and adoption among followersthrough their motivation, familiarity, and own adoption and (b) F2FE is a complement rather than a substitute for other agricultural extension activities. Policy implications are discussed.
Q16|Adoption of Soil Fertility Management Technologies in Malawi: Impact of Drought Exposure|Soil fertility management (SFM) technologies may potentially protect against climate risks, reduce nutrient depletion and enhance food security. In this paper, we study impact of drought exposure on adoption and adoption intensity of SFM technologies, specifically, focusing on maize-legume intercropping and organic manure. The paper uses four-round panel data collected from six districts in Malawi over a period of nine years and we use correlated random effects models with a control function approach for data analysis. Results show an increase in adoption rates from 33% in 2006 to 76% in 2015 for maize-legume intercropping and from 30% (2006) to 53% (2015)for organic manure. Regression results reveal that exposure to early and late dry spells increases the likelihood of adoption and adoption intensity of maize-legume intercropping with late droughts also having a positive impact on adoption and adoption intensity of organic manure. We also find positive effects of fertilizer use intensity and fertilizer price on adoption and adoption intensity of both intercropping and organic manure.
Q16|Contract Farming, Farm Mechanization, and Agricultural Intensification: The Case of Rice Farming in Cote d’Ivoire|It is critically important to intensify farming systems by disseminating proper agronomic practices and promoting the increased application of inputs to raise agricultural productivity in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the region’s public agricultural extension systems are weak, and their input and output markets often fail to function properly. Under these circumstances, contract farming (CF) is expected to be a promising way to overcome market imperfections by providing inputs, production training, and marketing services. We examine this possibility by analyzing the case of rice production CF in Cote d’Ivoire. We find that CF did not lead to farming intensification, due mainly to the inadequate and uncertain provision of tractor services. Further analysis reveals a complementarity between tractor use and labor inputs, whereby tractor use in land preparation enhanced the adoption of input- and labor-intensive practices in subsequent farming activities, thereby increasing labor use and improving land productivity. The diffusion of tractors is thus likely to be key to the intensification of rice farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa.
Q16|Global Economic Growth and Agricultural Land Conversion under Uncertain Productivity Improvements in Agriculture|We study how stochasticity in the evolution of agricultural productivity interacts with economic and population growth at the global level. We use a two-sector Schumpeterian model of growth, in which a manufacturing sector produces the traditional consumption good and an agricultural sector produces food to sustain contemporaneous population. Agriculture demands land as an input, itself treated as a scarce form of capital. In our model both population and sectoral technological progress are endogenously determined, and key technological parameters of the model are structurally estimated using 1960-2010 data on world GDP, population, cropland and technological progress. Introducing random shocks to the evolution of total factor productivity in agriculture, we show that uncertainty optimally requires more land to be converted into agricultural use as a hedge against production shortages, and that it significantly affects both optimal consumption and population trajectories.
Q16|The Expansion of Modern Agriculture and Global Biodiversity Decline: An Integrated Assessment|The world is banking on a major increase in food production, if the dietary needs and food preferences of an increasing, and increasingly rich, population are to be met. This requires the further expansion of modern agriculture, but modern agriculture rests on a small number of highly productive crops and its expansion has led to a significant loss of global biodiversity. Ecologists have shown that biodiversity loss results in lower plant productivity, while agricultural economists have linked biodiversity loss on farms with increasing variability of crop yields, and sometimes lower mean yields. In this paper we consider the macro-economic consequences of the continued expansion of particular forms of intensive, modern agriculture, with a focus on how the loss of biodiversity affects food production. We employ a quantitative, structurally estimated model of the global economy, which jointly determines economic growth, population and food demand, agricultural innovations and land conversion. We show that even small effects of agricultural expansion on productivity via biodiversity loss might be sufficient to warrant a moratorium on further land conversion.
Q16|The Hedonic Approach to Vineyard Site Selection: Adaptation to Climate Change and Grape Growing in Emerging Markets|This paper shows how the hedonic approach to vineyard site selection can be used in the adaptation of vineyard land to climate change, natural disasters or other exogenous events. The basic idea is that, if the relation between weather and grape quality is known for each grape type in existing growing areas, then it is possible to predict the quality of grapes that would be produced in other locations, or in the same location with a changed climate. This permits the optimization of grape type selection for a location and also provides an indication of the value that a particular planting should produce. The relation of grape quality to the weather is provided for several well-known viticultural areas, including Burgundy, Bordeaux, Rioja, and the Piedmont. An application of the method to a new vineyard area in the Czech Republic following the demise of Communism is used to demonstrate the method.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

Q16|Development And Concentration Of Maize Seed Market In Thailand|Today Thailand is the second largest field crop seed exporter in Asia with maize contributing the highest value to seed exports. Hybrid maize is considerably adopted in Thailand mainly due to the demand from feed industry and development of livestock and poultry industry. The success of varietal development of commercial maize hybrids is owed to the investments of international donors during the 1980s and continuous breeding efforts of multinational seed companies even as public institutions played a key role in maintaining genetic resources conservation and pre-commercial lines research. This paper reviews the history of research and development in maize and maize seed market development in Thailand. Furthermore, expert elicitation method is used to reveal the adoption of commercial maize varieties in 2013/2014 cropping seasons. The results of adopted maize varieties were used to estimate market shares and suggested that maize seed market in Thailand is moderately concentrated with tendencies towards oligopolistic competition.
Q16|The Economic Impact of Rice Sheath Blight Alleviation in the Mid‐South| The most tangible outcome of a breeding program of any type is increased yield; however, breeding for biotic stresses (maintenance breeding) generally results in pathogen resistance, which can be viewed as mitigating potential crop losses. Economists tend to undervalue the opportunity cost of this type of agricultural research. This study estimates the loss (volume and revenue) in rice production in the Mid-South attributed to the presence of sheath blight, a common fungus in the US. We then ask the counterfactual question: what would the implications be if sheath blight was not present in US rice production. To do this we estimated the additional rice supply from sheath blight resistance and entered it into the RiceFlow model. The RiceFlow model generates global estimates of changes in rice price given an increase supply, as well as changes in consumer and producer welfare. Finally, the counterfactual increased yield and decreased fungicide usage from the absence of sheath blight were analyzed in a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) model to assess the environmental impact that would have resulted if sheath blight was not present. These results provide insight on how potential genetic resistance to sheath blight could affect producer livelihoods, food security, and environmental sustainability.
Q16|Food Waste in Rural Households| The paper examines food waste volume generated by a sample of rural households accounting for four different categories of food waste. Food waste does occur and some of it is unavoidable leading to the question how to manage it. This study identifies factors responsible for the volume of food waste by category, but also identifies factors influencing the decision to collect food waste in household for the purpose of local biogas production. Tobit technique is applied to identify factors, demographic and socio-economic characteristics of consumers and their households that influence the percentage of wasted food by type. A separate decision equation identifies supporting or limiting factors influencing the decision to sort food waste for biogas production. Education, gender, age, household size, and employment status have been identified as relevant characteristics determining the volume of wasted food and the decision to support using food waste for biogas generation.
Q16|A Spatial Econometric Analysis of Within-field Crop Yield Variability Using Yield Monitor Data from a Mississippi Farm| It is widely observed that the crop yields vary significantly within the field, primarily because of the intra-field variations in soil, landscape, water, and nutrient conditions. That variability forms the foundation for site-specific management in precision agriculture. However, thus far the studies about the within-field yield variability are mostly based on one or several sample fields, while the variability distribution for a real world farm or a larger region have received less investigations. In addition, due to the small number of sample fields, the determining factors of yield variability have not been fully examined. This study fill this research gap by collecting and analyzing high resolution yield monitor data of over a hundred fields from a large size farm in the Mississippi Delta. It quantitatively describes the extent of the within-field yield variability over a large scale area, and empirically examines the relationship between the yield variability and factors such as soil types, landscapes, weather conditions, management inputs, etc. A spatial econometric model is utilized to account for other unobserved but spatially correlated yield-impacting soil properties. This study contributes to exploring the method of analyzing GIS data from farming and turning the data into site-specific management decisions.
Q16|Agricultural Productivity and Structural Transformation: Evidence from Brazil|We study the effects of the adoption of new agricultural technologies on structural transformation. To guide empirical work, we present a simple model where the effect of agricultural productivity on industrial development depends on the factor-bias of technical change. We test the predictions of the model by studying the introduction of genetically engineered soybean seeds in Brazil, which had heterogeneous effects on agricultural productivity across areas with different soil and weather characteristics. We find that technical change in soy production was strongly labor-saving and led to industrial growth, as predicted by the model.
Q16|Technological Innovations, Downside Risk, and the Modernization of Agriculture|We use a randomized experiment in India to show that improved technology enhances agricultural productivity by crowding in modern inputs and cultivation practices. Specifically, we show that a new rice variety that reduces downside risk by providing flood tolerance has positive effects on adoption of a more labor-intensive planting method, area cultivated, fertilizer usage, and credit utilization. We find that a large share of the expected gains from the technology comes from crowding in of other investments. Therefore, improved technologies that reduce risk by protecting production in bad years have the potential to increase agricultural productivity in normal years.
Q16|Diversification Strategies and Adaptation Deficit: Evidence from Niger| This paper provides fresh empirical evidence on the adaptation process to face climate changes through the analysis of original cross-sectional data collected at household-level in Niger merged with detailed geo-referenced climatic information. In particular, we identify the main drivers and barriers of crop and labour diversification, which constitute two livelihood strategies in mitigating the adaptation deficit by employing a Seemingly-Unrelated Regression (SUR) model, which accounts for potential interdependence among different diversification practices. Secondly, the effectiveness of diversification practices is assessed by means of three complementary welfare measures, namely income changes, food security and the poverty gap using quantile regression and instrumental variable strategy. We find that, aside from climate shocks, the diversification level varies in response to the educational level of household members and spatial location as well as the adoption of ICTs. The impacts of diversification appear differentiated. While labour diversification is always positively associated with all the three welfare measures, positive coefficients of crop diversification are significant only when associated to food security. Robust causal inference confirms that anomalies in rainfall patterns and droughts in particular, induce adaptation responses, which result in welfare gains limited by a richer calorie intake, while the effects on income and severity of poverty appear detrimental.
Q16|Impact of cocoa farmer field schools on cocoa yield: empirical evidence of cocoa farmers in Cameroon| The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of Farmer Field Schools (FFSs) on cocoa yield in the Centre and South-west regions in Cameroon. The evaluation of FFSs is important for improving cocoa production by agricultural research and extension. This evaluation is done by using the “Propensity Score Matching” technique and Rosenbaum bounds sensitivity analysis method to ensure robustness of results. The data comes from IITA surveys conducted in 2009 and concerned 201 cocoa farmers in the Centre and South -West Regions in Cameroon for the 2008/2009 cocoa season. The sample cocoa farmers contain participants and non participants to FFSs. Results show that participate to FFSs have a positive and significant effect on the cocoa yield per hectare. This effect is estimated at about 97 kilograms per hectare. This effect is statistically significant at 10%, only for the kernel matching but not for the five nearest neighbors matching. This weak significant of FFS impact could be lead to the fact that farmers who joined FFS are those who have low capacity in cocoa production compare with those who did not joined FFS. This can also lead to the poor quality of FFSs training. The first recommendation is to promote the FFSs in the area where there is no FFSs by highlighting agricultural extension service. The second recommendation is to improve the quality of training in Farmer Fields Schools in other to increase their impacts on cocoa yield. In the current context of agricultural intensification challenges in developing countries, this analytical framework is of interest for policy makers for identifying conditions of farmer participation to FFSs and designing effective motivation strategies.
Q16|Distributional effects of agricultural productivity in benefit cost analysis: alternative weighting of benefits and costs| This paper proposes a methodology to weight benefit/cost analysis in a way that increases the policy focus on food insecure households. Such a weighting may be important to policy makers such as the Consulting Group for International Agricultural Research who must choose between research and development alternatives in developing countries. Specifically, the weights can be set to emphasize the needs of low-resource households and smallholder agriculture.
Q16|The Effects of Residue Tolerance on Pesticide Use, Hop Marketing and Social Welfare| Pesticide use can mitigate production risks from pest and disease infestations. However, intensive pesticide use may result in large amount of pesticide residues, causing hop-quality damages and raising food safety issues. Pesticide use also leads to sizable negative ecological and environmental externalities. In respond to food safety and other socio-economic issues, policy makers, such as national governments and international organizations, pursue low pesticide residues by implementing tolerance which permits only a maximum concentration of agrichemical residues. This paper examines the social-economic impacts of the residue tolerance. To this end, a four-stage game theoretic model is outlined to characterize the stylized attributes of both domestic hop production and marketing. The model highlights the strategic interactions between hop growers, hop merchant and the government. Multiple market equilibria are characterized. The analysis contributes to a better understanding of social welfare which accommodates the environmental externalities of pesticide use. Simulations are conducted based on hop production information in the Pacific Northwest of the United States.
Q16|Quantifying Breakeven Price Distributions in Stochastic Techno-Economic Analysis — A Case of Cellulosic Biofuel Production from Fast Pyrolysis and Hydroprocessing Pathway| Techno-economic analysis (TEA) is a well-established modeling process in which benefit-cost analysis (BCA) is used to evaluate the economic feasibility of emerging technologies. Most previous TEA studies focused on creating reliable cost estimates but returned deterministic net present values (NPV) and deterministic breakeven prices. Nevertheless, the deterministic results cannot convey the considerable uncertainties embedded in techno-economic variables such as capital investment, conversion technology yield, and output prices. We obtain distributions of NPV, IRR, and breakeven price. The breakeven price is the most important indicator in TEA because it is independent of scale and communicates results effectively. The deterministic breakeven price is the price for which there is a 50 percent probability of earning more or less than the stipulated rate of return. For an investment under relatively high uncertainty, it is unlikely that investors would provide financing to a project with a 50 percent probability of loss. The point estimate breakeven price, therefore, does not represent the threshold under which investment would occur. In this study, we introduce the stochastic techno-economic analysis in which we incorporate Monte Carlo simulation into traditional TEA. A case of cellulosic biofuel production from fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing pathway is used to illustrate the method of modeling stochastic TEA and quantifying the breakeven price distribution. The input uncertainties are translated to outputs so that the probability density distribution of both NPV and breakeven price are derived. Two methods, a mathematical method and a programming method, are developed to quantify breakeven price distribution in a way that can consider future price trend and uncertainty. We analyze two scenarios, one assuming constant real future output prices, and the other assuming that future prices follow an increasing trend with stochastic disturbances. We demonstrate that the breakeven price distributions derived using our methods are consistent with the corresponding NPV distributions regarding the percentile value and the probability of gain/loss.
Q16|Modeling Temperature and Precipitation Influences on Yield Distributions of Canola and Spring Wheat in Saskatchewan| Warmer temperatures and variable rainfall are likely to affect Saskatchewan’s production of canola and spring wheat. This study employs moments-based approaches (full- and partial-moments) to estimate the impact of precipitation and temperature changes on canola and spring wheat yield distributions. Environment Canada weather data and Statistics Canada crop yield, planted area, and summer fallow area are employed for 20 crop districts over the 1987-2010 period. Our results show that the average crop yields are positively associated with the growing season degree days (GDD), and pre-growing season precipitation, while negatively affected by extremely high temperatures. Furthermore, the climate measures have asymmetric effects on the higher moments of crop yield distribution.
Q16|Stochastic Techno-Economic Analysis of Alcohol-to-Jet Fuel Production| This study assesses the alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) biofuel production pathway for three biomass feedstocks, and advances existing techno-economic analyses (TEA) of biofuels in three ways. First, we incorporate technical uncertainty for all by-products and co-products though statistical linkages between conversion efficiencies and input and output levels. Second, future price uncertainty is based on case-by-case time-series estimation. Third, breakeven price distributions are developed to present profitability at each price level. The stochastic dominance results show that sugarcane is the lowest cost feedstock over the entire range of uncertainty, followed by corn grain and switchgrass, with the mean breakeven jet fuel prices being $0.96/liter ($3.65/gal), $1.01/liter ($3.84/gal), and $1.38/liter ($5.21/gal), respectively. With a 75% profitability level, the breakeven prices for corn grain, sugarcane and switchgrass become $1.07/liter ($4.05/gal), $1.05/liter ($3.97/gal), and $1.53/liter ($5.81/gal), respectively. Sensitivity analyses show that technical uncertainty significantly impacts breakeven prices and NPV distributions.
Q16|An Assessment Of The Site-Specific Nutrient Management (Ssnm) For Irrigated Rice In Asia| Site-specific nutrient management (SSNM) provides guidelines for effective nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium management to help farmers make better decisions on fertilizer input and output levels in rice production. I evaluated the assumptions underlying the SSNM strategy for rice in the top rice producing countries in the world: India, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. Using a generalized quadratic production function, I explored whether major nutrients are substitutes as inputs, and if there are complementarities between inorganic fertilizer and soil organic matter (SOM). I also used non-nested hypothesis framework to contrast the quadratic model against the linear von Liebig model. Results showed that the relationships among major nutrients vary across sites – some inputs are complements, some are substitutes, and some are independent. In addition, I found that the SOM significantly affects the economic returns to nitrogen fertilizer inputs. Accounting for these relationships in the fertilizer recommendation algorithm can make the SSNM strategy more adaptive to farmer’s fields. In areas where soils have limiting organic matter content, fertilizer subsidy or distribution might not be appropriate means to support rice production. Increased rice productivity can be achieved through integrated soil fertility management and adoption of soil conservation technologies.
Q16|A Question of Integrity: Variants of Bt Cotton, Pesticides and Productivity in Pakistan| Bt cotton remains one of the most widely grown biotech crops among smallholder farmers in lower income countries, and numerous studies attest to its advantages. However, the effectiveness of Bt toxin, which depends on many technical constraints, is heterogeneous. In Pakistan, the diffusion of Bt cotton occurred despite a weak regulatory system and without seed quality control; whether or not many varieties sold as Bt are in fact Bt is also questionable. We utilize nationally representative sample data to test the effects of Bt cotton use on productivity. Unlike previous studies, we invoke several indicators of Bt identity: variety name, official approval status, farmer belief, laboratory tests of Bt presence in plant tissue, and biophysical assays measuring Bt effectiveness. Only farmer belief affects cotton productivity in the standard production model, which does not treat Bt appropriately as damage-abating. In the damage control framework, all Bt indicators reduce damage from pests. Biophysical indicators have the largest effect and official approval has the weakest. Findings have implications for impact measurement. For policymakers, they suggest the need, on ethical if not productivity grounds, to improve variety information and monitor variety integrity closer to point of sale.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Q16|China’s Regional Agricultural Productivity Growth: Catching Up or Lagging Behind| In this study, we use a multilateral total factor productivity (TFP) panel data, spanning 1985-2011 period, to test the hypotheses of convergence to a single TFP level (σ convergence) or to a region-specific steady state TFP growth rate (β convergence) for China’s farm sector. Results show that there is no evidence of an overall σ convergence across all provinces. However, we find robust evidences of β convergence. Estimated rates of β convergence are conditional on how we capture the heterogeneity across regions. Overall, the rate of β convergence ranges from 0.016 to 0.028. Estimates also show that higher growth rate of education, R&D, capital/labor ratio, or intermediate goods/labor ratio can boost the rate of TFP growth.
Q16|Academic Knowledge Spillovers and the Role of Geographic Proximity in Regional Agriculture-related Sectors: The impact of agricultural research at Colorado State University on the Colorado economy, and beyond| This study examines the mechanisms and geographic scope of the impact of university knowledge spillovers on the agricultural economy, using the case of Colorado State University (CSU) and the state’s agricultural economy. Our findings show that the spillover impacts of journal publications are rarely localized within Colorado; rather, the geographic scope of these impacts is national and even global. However, the extent to which the spillover impacts of patented knowledge is localized within Colorado is open to question because it is possible to control permissions for use, but at the same time it is impossible to limit everyone’s awareness and use of it, particularly in foreign jurisdictions where patents are not taken out by the university. The collaboration mechanism of knowledge dissemination, such as indicated by industry coauthorship on journal articles and private sponsorship of grants and contracts, which are more rivalrous by virtue of the more tacit qualities of knowledge being disseminated and because of the higher transaction costs, requires closer interaction and greater geographic proximity, which usually prevents global dissemination. Thus, we observe geographic proximity is significantly important for these channels. Finally, university start-ups are highly geographically bounded near universities because in the early stages start-up companies need support from their host university.
Q16|The Changing Structure of Retail Food Stores, Direct Marketing (DM) and Its Impact on Farmers’ Financial Performance| We examine the changing structure of retail food stores, direct marketing (DM), and its impact on farmers’ financial performance in the United States. We use a maximum simulated likelihood estimation with multinomial treatments and continuous measures of sales to accommodate the treatment effects relative to the base (no direct marketing). Our analyses indicate that on the changing structure of retail food stores, no direct marketing (base case) outlet is the most adopted channel by direct marketers compared to direct market to consumers only (Treatment-1), direct marketing to retailers only (Treatment-2), and direct marketing to both consumers and retailers (Treatment-3). We find that farmers who have chosen no direct marketing option show better earning performance compared to the other treatments or market outlets channel options from which earning decreases by 75%, 19%, and 11%, respectively under Treatment-1, T-Treatment-2 and Treatment-3 from 2008 to 2010. Direct marketers who are more likely to choose either Treatment 1-3 option relative to no direct marketing on the basis of their unobserved characteristics, choose direct marketing less and less.
Q16|Modelling of Bt Corn Production under Choice of Abatement Specification| For modelling Bt corn production, we proposed a joint abatement function to capture pest life cycle. Simulation of pest adaptation to popular Bt corn varieties was developed and applied to generate random sample of abatement, where in-field parameters were adopted in favor of practical corn production. On the basis, logistic model was used to fit the sample data. The estimates were compared to those from exponential model for choice of abatement specification. At last, Cobb-Douglas production model was integrated with the pre-estimated abatement function along with farm level data and distribution of corn growers’ choices, where instrument variables estimator and delta method were adopted to solve simultaneity problem induced by farm level data. The estimated marginal net return was positive, suggesting that Bt corn as pesticide is underutilized. However, the value kept decline in recent three years. We attributed the decline of marginal net return to the widespread adoption of new Bt corn varieties with blended refuge, and the insect resistance management would benefit from it.
Q16|Agricultural Technology Adoption under Multiple Constraints: An Analysis of System of Rice Intensification (SRI) in India| The study analyses the role of multiple binding constraints such as information, extension services, availability of labourers and irrigation in conditioning System of Rice Intensification (SRI) adoption by rice farmers in selected rice producing districts of India. The multiple thresholds that farmers need to overcome are analysed using a multi-hurdle model which explicitly incorporates the impact of constraints in adoption decisions. The results showed that age of the farmer reduced the access to information whereas the size of the farm increased the access to information. Gender of the head of the household, education, membership in farmer organisations etc. was crucial in getting access to extension services. Age of the household head, full time farming etc. increased the availability of labourers. Type of soil and terrain were found to be important in getting access to irrigation facility. District wise disparities showed that the disparities were the highest in the case of accessing information and followed by extension services. Although factors influencing the intensity (in terms of acres) as well as the depth of adoption (in terms of packages) were slightly different household assets, number of improved rice varieties known, membership in farmer organisations, risk etc. were significant in influencing the adoption decisions.
Q16|`Land Grab' or Development Opportunity?: The Effect of Transnational Farmland Investments on the Ghanaian Economy| Transnational investments in farmland in countries where agriculture is a relatively large share of the economy are recent and controversial. Some economists view these investments as developmental opportunities including capital deepening, new technology, and employment opportunities. Others view these investments as land grabs, emphasizing the dislocation of local farmers and insufficient compensation for land use. However, these views are not based on structural growth model analyses. This paper investigates how these seemingly conflicting effects interact with each other in the process of economic growth by fitting a dynamic general equilibrium model to Ghanaian data. Capital and land markets are modeled to be segmented between domestic and foreign agents. The differing effects of two common foreign investment activities, grain farming and biofuel production, are investigated. Both entail the displacement of local capital and labor in agriculture, which has economy-wide effects over time. Grain farming investments tend to promote capital accumulation and increase income and consumption over the transition, whereas labor income is adversely affected. Biofuel projects induce the reverse. Results suggest that the current predominance of foreign investment in biofuel production is likely to increase labor income and household welfare, measured by consumption level, yet leads to a decline in national income in the long run. Results identify the relative labor intensity of technology on foreign-operated farms, which affects the returns to domestic capital and the pace of capital deepening, as a major determinant of the long-term effect of farmland investments.
Q16|Examining the effects of uncertainty on second-generation biofuel investment by using a two stochastic process approach| Investment in the production of advanced biofuel has been encouraged by the federal regulation which enacted the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). However, investments and production of advanced biofuel has been lower than expected in recent years, leading regulators to substantially reduce required volumes of advanced biofuel. Real option analysis is used to help explain why uncertainty has reduced investment in advanced biofuel and eroded the requirements put forth by USEPA. This study examines the effect of uncertainty and irreversibility on a second-generation biofuel investment while considering the volatility of Renewable Identification Number (RIN) price, conventional fuel price and their correlations by applying a two stochastic variable approach.
Q16|Information technologies and field-level chemical use for corn production| We investigate the effectiveness of soil testing and pest scouting by focusing on field-level chemical use for corn production. Based on the ARMS phase II and phase III data, we estimate equations for technology adoptions and chemical use. For estimation, we incorporate nonlinear endogenous switching regression to account for the nonnegative chemical use and endogeneity problems regarding adoptions of conservation practices. We find that: 1) adopting information technologies are positively correlated with farmers’ human capital, field characteristics, and corn prices. 2) the effects of information technologies on farmers’ nitrogen use depends on crop rotation. To be specific, farmers who adopt soil testing and crop rotation use nitrogen less than farmers who use crop rotation but do not adopt soil testing by about 8 lb/acre, but soil testing has insignificant effects on the rate of nitrogen application by farmers who grew corn continuously. 3) farmers’ management practices such as the use of manure and GM corns have significant effects on their nitrogen and herbicide use, but the directions and sizes of them depends on adoption of information technologies and previous field use.
Q16|Social exchanges and attitudes toward uncertainty of different types of subjects: Experimental evidence from Bangladesh| The literature discusses risk aversion as one of the behavioral determinants of technology adoption. However, little attention has been paid to measuring ambiguity aversion of poor people in developing countries or in finding the role of ambiguity aversion in technology adoption. Risk experiments in the previous studies have been designed in such a way that individuals face the risky and/or ambiguous situations alone. Individuals in the real world, especially farmers in developing countries, are likely to get information from peers before making any decision regarding a new innovation that has an ambiguous nature. This paper addresses two broad issues. The first issue is to measure the risk and ambiguity preferences of Bangladeshi rural farmers. The paper investigates whether the attitudes toward uncertainty (risk and ambiguity) differ when farmers face the uncertainty alone versus when they are allowed to communicate with peer groups of 3 or 6. It also investigates whether farmers’ demographic characteristics affect their attitudes toward uncertainty or not. A second issue is to find whether measures of attitudes toward uncertainty is same across different groups of subjects using experimental lotteries. To do so, this paper replicates the same experiments with groups of students in two universities in Bangladesh. Finally, the paper also investigates whether demographic variables affect the attitudes toward risk and ambiguity aversion or not. It finds that risk attitudes of farmers and students are same when deciding alone. However, farmers tend to show higher variation in risk aversion than students sample when deciding in a group of 3. In the latter case, farmers tend to show less risk aversion than students. While disaggregating the measured risk attitudes across gender, female students tend to show more risk aversion as well as higher variation in risk aversion than male students in the sample. The study also finds that The study also finds that students’ and farmers’ demographic characteristics affect both risk and ambiguity aversion.
Q16|Evaluating the Potential for Precision Mechanization in U.S. Wine Grape Production| The motivation for this study centers on the labor-and cost-intensive nature of wine grape production and the potential opportunities for robotic technology. The study objectives are to develop cost of production budgets for six representative wine grape vineyards in five U.S. states, assess the economic viability of wine grape production under current operating conditions, evaluate labor costs by production task, and identify common production challenges and tasks that could be augmented with robotic technology development. Investigators have worked with grower panels to develop a production budget for representative vineyards in five states, and to gather input on production tasks that the growers and technology developers feel would be most suitable for robotic technology. A stochastic simulation model was developed to assess baseline pro-forma financial statements for each vineyard size. Combined, the results help in exploring opportunities to strengthen vineyard profitability and competitiveness using robotics.
Q16|Comparing the trends and strength of determinants to deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon in consideration of biofuel policies in Brazil and the United States|Recent assessments of the lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with increased production of liquid biofuels in the U.S. have found that a relatively large share of these emissions is related to land-use change in other countries, with Brazil playing a prominent role. However, most of the existing analyses including EPA's RFS assumptions about indirect land-use change (ILUC) do not reflect recent data on deforestation rates in Brazil, which have been declining. There seems to be evidence that agricultural producers in Brazil are intensifying crop and livestock production and incorporating new land at lower rates than in the recent past. Additionally, the competition for forestry areas, and in particular between agriculture, pastures, and planted forests is poorly understood, and not explicitly taken into account in previous assessments in several modeling exercises. This paper provides a review of several of the major factors that will determine the need to incorporate additional land to production in response to a demand increase, for example as a result of biofuel policies. This additional land that may need to be brought into production is critical as it will affect significantly the environmental credentials and in particular carbon footprints of different biofuels. Among the factors reviewed are the potential for yield intensification in response to higher returns (intensification effects), and the limited existing evidence in yield drags as areas are incorporate to crop production (extensification effects). Scenario analysis using an augmented version of the CARD/FAPRI agricultural modeling system (augmented to include planted forests in Brazil) seem to provide evidence, that intensification of crops and livestock production in countries like Brazil, and of competition with planted forests reduces the pressure for deforestation of natural areas. We also highlight that the explicit modeling of planted forests as a user of land, allows for the inclusion of the competition of this activity (and its resistance to give away area) with the more traditionally modeled crops and pastures.
Q16|Impact of modern irrigation on household production and welfare outcomes: Evidence from the PASIDP project in Ethiopia| Investments in irrigation have been shown to substantially improve farmers' agricultural outcomes and alleviate poverty. Our study provides an example of such investment, the Participatory Small-Scale Irrigation Development Programme (PASIDP) in Ethiopia. Combining a primary household survey with detailed geographical information, we estimate the impact of the project on agricultural production and households expenditures using a novel quasi-experimental approach. Beneficiaries gain from the project through improved crop yields, which raise revenues, and allow switching from relying mainly consuming their own produce to purchasing greater amount of food from the market. Though we rule out that the project may have targeted farmers based on their agricultural performance, summary statistics indicate notable differences between beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries, an indication that the project might have systematically targeted farmers with certain attributes. Systematic targeting is often favoured either to ensure the highest rate of success, or to deliver the project to those who may need it the most, but may limit the generalizability of the project in relation to any efforts to scaling up.
Q16|Are Agricultural R&D Returns Declining and Development Dependent?| There is widespread professional consensus that agricultural research and development (R&D) receives high economic returns, though there is also concern that these returns have been declining over the past few decades and unevenly distributed among different regions in the world. This study attempts to reveal both the time trend (i.e., increasing or decreasing) and regional developmental differences in the reported returns to agricultural R&D. Using a newly updated and expanded global database of estimated returns to agricultural R&D and a robust statistical methodology, our findings suggest that after accounting for methodological changes and other study factors that have varied over time, the contemporary returns to agricultural R&D investments are as high as ever. Furthermore, this study provides evidence that regional developmental differences are attributable to more than differences in the focus of research, researcher or research methodology.
Q16|Into the Weeds: A Structural Model of Herbicide Demand and Glyphosate Resistance on U.S. Corn Farms| The first case of glyphosate resistant weeds was documented in 1998, two years after the commercialization of genetically engineered, herbicide tolerant (HT) corn and soybeans. Currently, over 14 resistant weed species affect U.S. crop production areas. This study uses a novel two-stage, structural model to derive cost functions for pre-emergent and postemergent herbicide use. The parameters of the structural model are estimated using censored nonlinear full information maximum likelihood. Control functions from firststage regressions account for endogeneity of farmers’ profit-maximizing decisions. The results of the analysis are used to determine the extent to which resistance has eroded the benefits associated with glyphosate applications in HT production systems. Our preliminary results suggest that glyphosate resistance may have decreased weed control by as much as 11 percentage points from 2005 to 2010.
Q16|Interaction of biofuel, food security, indirect land use change and greenhouse mitigation policies in the European Union| The European Union is putting a lot of effort in mitigating climate change effects and lessen the dependence of fossil fuels. Several policies are being proposed in the Renewable Energy Directives (RED), such as increasing the share of renewable sources in fuel mix, specific increases in fuel production? and anti-dumping strategies. However, these policies raise concerns with respect to competition with food production, and indirect increases GHG emissions caused by land use change. Our study evaluates the RED policies together with additional climate mitigation policies using a computable general equilibrium modeling. Our results suggest that, for the case of the European Union (EU), an increase in biofuel production does not represent a threat in food security. In addition, we found that the land use change in the EU are modest compared to previous studies in developing regions. Our findings illustrate how the imposition of a regime can vary depending on the economic development of a region.
