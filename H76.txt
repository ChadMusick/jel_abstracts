H76|Under Pressure? Performance Evaluation of Police Officers as an Incentive to Cheat: Evidence from Drug Crimes in Russia|This paper provides an empirical analysis of possible manipulations of amounts of seized drugs, based on a unique dataset that contains full information on drug crimes in Russia reported during 2013-2014. First, using a standard bunching estimator, I investigate the incentives for police officers to manipulate and find that the motivation most likely arises from the officers’ performance evaluation system. Second, applying a novel bunching technique, I determine that police officers are more likely to manipulate the drug amounts seized from repeat offenders. The overall effect of manipulation is an additional year of incarceration, and this is not dependent on a guilty plea.
H76|Impulse Purchases, Gun Ownership and Homicides: Evidence from a Firearm Demand Shock|Do firearm purchase delay laws reduce aggregate homicide levels? Using quasi-experimental evidence from a 6-month countrywide gun demand shock starting in late 2012, we show that U.S. states with legislation preventing immediate handgun purchases experienced smaller increases in handgun sales. Our findings are hard to reconcile with entirely rational consumers, but suggest that gun buyers behave time-inconsistently. In a second step, we demonstrate that states with purchase delays also witnessed 2% lower homicide rates during the same period compared to states allowing instant handgun access. We report suggestive evidence that lower handgun sales primarily reduced impulsive assaults and domestic violence.
H76|Anatomy of public procurement| We provide novel stylized facts about competition, bidding, entry and bidders across a wide spectrum of public procurement auctions using comprehensive and rich Finnish data. Competition for publicly procured contracts is relatively low with a median bidder count of two (three conditional on receiving any bids). Bidders typically are very heterogeneous in size, which likely limits competition further. Competition seems to work roughly as expected as on average (standardized) bids mainly decrease with the number of actual and potential bidders. Using information on registrations as a good proxy for potential bidders, we show that the ratio of actual to potential bidders increases with the number of actual bidders. We also show that being present in the contracting authority's municipality or province correlates positively with registering, entry (bidding) and winning, but other firm characteristics matter less. While attracting more competition by means of contract and auction rule design is a desirable policy goal and we show suggestive evidence that the use of scoring rule can be an entry barrier, increasing competition may be in practice difficult. Therefore, reservation prices may be a more useful policy tool to alleviate issues associated with the lack of competition.
H76|Do Private Prisons Affect Criminal Sentencing?|This paper provides causal evidence of the effect of private prisons on criminal sentencing. Our identification strategy uses state-level changes in private-prison capacity and compares changes in sentencing across trial court pairs that straddle state borders. We find that a doubling of private prison capacity raises sentence lengths by 1.3 percent, but not the likelihood of conviction. The effect is not driven by changes in state legislation, and we find no evidence for ‘judicial capture’. We do find some evidence that judges may internalize the lower cost of imprisonment in private prisons. Lastly, private prisons do not appear to accentuate existing racial biases in sentencing decisions.
H76|How Common are Electoral Cycles in Criminal Sentencing?|Existing empirical evidence suggests a pervasive pattern of electoral cycles in criminal sentencing in the U.S.: judges appear to pass more punitive sentences when they are up for re-election, consistent with models of signaling where voters have more punitive preferences than judges. However, this pervasive evidence comes from only three states. Combining the existing evidence with data we collected from eight additional states, we are able to reproduce previous results, but find electoral cycles in only one of the eight additional states. Sentencing cycles appear to be the exception rather than the norm. We find that their existence hinges on the level of competition in judicial elections, which varies considerably across states.
H76|Affordable Housing and City Welfare|Housing affordability has become one of the main policy challenges for the major cities of the world. Two key policy levers are zoning and rent control policies. We build a new dynamic equilibrium asset pricing model to evaluate the implications of such policies for house prices, rents, production and income, residential construction, income and wealth inequality, as well as the spatial distribution of households within the city. We calibrate the model to New York City, incorporating current zoning and rent control systems. Our model suggests large welfare gains from relaxing zoning regulations in Manhattan, and more modest gains from reducing the size of the rent control program. The former policy is progressive and a Pareto improvement, while rent control reform is regressive in nature and hurts the current beneficiaries.
H76|The Optimal Provision of Information and Communication Technologies in Smart Cities|We exploit the public good attributes of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and theoretically analyze an aggregate economy of two smart cities in which ICTs are provided in either a decentralized or a centralized manner. We first determine the efficient ICT levels that maximize the aggregate surplus from the provision of ICTs in the two cities. Second, we compute the optimal level of ICT provision in the two cities in a decentralized regime in which spending on the ICTs is financed by a uniform tax on the city residents. Third, we ascertain the optimal level of ICT provision in the two cities in a centralized regime subject to equal provision of ICTs and cost sharing. Fourth, we show that if the two cities have the same preference for ICTs then centralization is preferable to decentralization as long as there is a spillover from the provision of ICTs. Finally, we show that if the two cities have dissimilar preferences for ICTs then centralization is preferable to decentralization as long as the spillover exceeds a certain threshold.
H76|Gasto Público Social, Gobernanza y Desarrollo Humano: Una Aplicación con Datos Municipales de Bolivia: 1994-2008<BR>[Social Public Expenditure, Governance and Human Development: An Application with Municipal Data of Bolivia: 1994-2008]|In this opportunity, we analyze the relationship among public social spending, governance and human development based on cross-sectional sample of data from more than 300 municipalities of Bolivia. Considering the municipal statistical information, we estimate a multiple linear regression model with instrumental variables, using least squares in two stages. We have instrumentalized the public social expenditure variable through an efficiency government index (governance). In the first stage, we have found that government efficiency explains the differences in total social public expenditure per capita executed between 1997 and 2005. In the second stage, we find a positive effect of total social public expenditure per capita executed between 1997 and 2005 on human development, measured in 2005. Therefore, estimates reveal that higher levels of social public spending tend to generate a higher level of human development in municipalities where government efficiency is higher. In quantitative terms, the results reveal that, keeping the rest of the variables constant and considering the importance of government efficiency, if the total social public expenditure per capita executed during 1997 to 2005 had increased by Bs 100 per capita, then human development measured in 2005, it would have increased by 6.6%.
H76|Public investment and the fiscal common pool problem on municipal mergers in Japan|The purpose of this paper is to reveal which kinds of public investment cause municipal mergers to create a fiscal common pool problem in Japan. In particular, we focus on whether municipal mergers increase road and public park construction just before the mergers or not because previous papers reveal only that municipal mergers increase local bonds. The empirical results reveal that the subordinate merger partners rapidly increase their road and public park expenses just before mergers.
H76|Electoral Reform and Public Sector Efficiency. Some Evidence From Italian Municipalities|We study the effect of Law 81/1993, which introduced a different electoral rule for the election of the mayor, on the technical efficiency of Italian cities. Since 1993, municipalities below 15,000 inhabitants vote with a single-ballot system, whereas cities above 15,000 inhabitants threshold are subject to a double ballot. We first estimate the technical efficiency in 1994 (taken as a pre-change year), and 1999 and 2004 for a sample of Italian municipalities, through a non-parametric DEA, and then we perform on both input and output oriented efficiency scores a difference-in-differences analysis, through various panel techniques. We find evidence that, after the reform, municipalities voting under a double-ballot show low levels of efficiency compared to cities voting under a single-ballot, by about 16 (input oriented) and 4 percentage points (output oriented). We speculate that the difference in the level of efficiency among cities voting under a different electoral rule is essentially driven by a lower average quality of politicians elected under a double ballot compared to those elected with a single ballot.
H76|The quasi-market of employment services in Italy|This paper aims to study the shortcomings and merits of the first experiment of quasi-market in the provision of employment services: the Lombardy DUL (Dote Unica Lavoro). This system, which has inspired the 2015 national reform within the Jobs Act, has reactivated and revitalized the sector by providing important job opportunities to jobless workers. The system has the typical problems of quasi-markets in the provision of public services (lion's share of private organizations; cherry picking; gaming). However, different expedients are devised in the program to minimize these shortcomings. The empirical analysis suggest that such phenomena if existent are at a physiological level. Analysis of the determinants of completing successfully the program provides non-trivial results as to, among others, the role organizations of different ownership type and of services provided.
H76|Institutional change and the development of lagging regions in Europe|According to the dominant economic theories, economic growth is the result of a combination of three factors – physical capital, human capital or labour, and innovation –plus a residual factor or error term, which represents what we do not know or cannotexplain. Depending on whether a neoclassical growth (Solow, 1956; Swan, 1956) or an endogenous growth approach is adopted (Romer, 1986: Lucas, 1988), the weight attributed to each of the components varies, but they remain, in different guises the fundamental drivers informing development policies across the world. The European Union’s (EU) regional development and cohesion policy has been no exception. The bulk of cohesion investments have been channelled towards improving the infrastructure endowment and accessibility of the least developed regions of the EU, as well as increasing the availability and quality of human resources, and developing the innovative capacity of individuals and firms across lagging areas of Europe.
H76|Resource Transfers to Local Governments: Political Manipulation and Household Responses in West Bengal|We study how political support of household heads respond to receipt of different private and public good benefits delivered by local governments, and whether upper level governments respond strategically by manipulating program budgets to lower level government in West Bengal, India. We exploit redistricting of electoral boundaries by a non-partisan Election Commission, a plausibly exogenous shock to political competition. Consistent with a model of politically motivated allocation, private recurring benefit programs contracted (resp. expanded) in villages redistricted to more competitive constituencies when bottom and upper tier governments were controlled by opposing (resp. same) parties. The resulting changes in household benefit flows help predict household political support, which in turn rationalize the inter-village targeting patterns. The results illustrate the tendency for political parties to manipulate transfers across constituencies in the absence of formula-based grants to local governments, and more generally for political incentives to focus on delivery of short-term private benefits rather than one-time benefits or public goods consistent with theories of political clientelism.
H76|Dynamics in Gun Ownership and Crime - Evidence from the Aftermath of Sandy Hook|Gun rights activists in the United States frequently argue that the right to bear arms, as guaranteed by the Second Amendment, can help deter crime. Advocates of gun control usually respond that firearm prevalence contributes positively to violent crime rates. In this paper, we provide quasi-experimental evidence that a positive and unexpected gun demand shock led to an increase in murder rates after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School and the resulting gun control debate in December 2012. In states where purchases were delayed due to mandatory waiting periods and bureaucratic hurdles in issuing a gun permit, firearm sales exhibited weaker increases than in states without any such delays. We show that this finding is hard to reconcile with standard economic theory, but is in line with findings from behavioral economics. States that saw more gun sales then experienced significantly higher murder rates in the months following the demand shock, as murders increased by 6-15% over the course of a year.
H76|Public Spending on Transportation and Water Infrastructure, 1956 to 2017|The Congressional Budget Office regularly documents trends in public spending for transportation and water infrastructure. There are six types of infrastructure that are paid for largely by the public sector: highways, mass transit and rail, aviation, water transportation, water resources, and water utilities.
H76|Fiscal Substitution of Investment for Highway Infrastructure: Working Paper 2018-08|The federal government provides grants to state and local governments for their transportation infrastructure. State and local governments use some of those funds to replace funds that they would have provided for such investment.
H76|Informe del gasto del gobierno de Colombia en lucha antidrogas 2013 - 2015. Informe final|El objetivo de este documento es responder a la siguiente pregunta: ¿Cuánto gasta el Estado colombiano en la lucha contra las drogas? La respuesta corta es que, excluyendo el gasto en seguridad y defensa, el Estado colombiano gastó en 2015 $970.480 millones de pesos en la lucha contra las drogas. En 2013 esa cifra fue de $1.174.651 millones y en 2014 de $1.140.019 millones. ¿Por qué es relevante responder a esta pregunta? Básicamente por dos razones: la primera es que se trata de un gasto importante, equivalente al 0,5% del gasto general de la Nación. La segunda es que la cifra hace parte del informe de seguimiento que periódicamente se remite al congreso de Estados Unidos y del cual depende en gran medida la aprobación de recursos de cooperación para Colombia.
H76|Comisión del Gasto y la Inversión Pública. Informe final|De acuerdo con lo dispuesto en la Ley de Reforma Tributaria de 2016, en febrero de 2017 se creó la Comisión del Gasto y la Inversión Pública, con el propósito de revisar, entre otros, los programas de subsidios y de asistencia pública, los criterios de priorización de la inversión, las inflexibilidades presupuestales, las rentas de destinación específica, y los efectos sobre la equidad y la eficiencia de las decisiones de gasto, con el objeto de proponer reformas orientadas a fortalecer la equidad, la inclusión productiva, la formalización y la convergencia del desarrollo entre zonas urbanas y rurales, la redistribución del ingreso, la eficiencia de la gestión pública y el fortalecimiento del Estado. La Comisión tuvo un plazo de diez meses a partir de su conformación para allegar al Gobierno Nacional un documento con sus principales análisis y recomendaciones. Este informe consta de diez capítulos que a su vez sirvieron de soporte para sus recomendaciones. En los primeros cinco capítulos se abordan temas transversales como son: las tendencias y perspectivas del gasto público en las últimas décadas, dado el escenario económico y de ingresos previstos; las principales limitaciones del proceso presupuestal, del empleo público, del sistema de compras y contratación públicas y, por último, la carga que, para el presupuesto, se presentan los litigios contra el Estado, acompañado todo de las respectivas recomendaciones en cada tema. En los siguientes cinco capítulos se abordan los temas sectoriales que, a juicio de la Comisión, son de mayor impacto en materia de eficiencia y eficacia del gasto público. En esta parte del documento se analizan y formulan recomendaciones sobre el gasto público en pensiones, salud, educación, defensa y el gasto en subsidios a personas y hogares y al sector productivo. Los nueve comisionados firmantes de este informe participaron a título ad-honorem. Para las labores de la secretaría técnica se contó con la financiación de la Cooperación de la Secretaría de Asuntos Económicos del Gobierno Suizo (SECO) en el marco del proyecto “Fortalecimiento de la Gestión de las Finanzas Públicas”, cuya implementación adelanta AECOM International Development Europe.
H76|Public Procurement versus Laissez-Faire: Evidence from Household Waste Collection| We document that switching from laissez-faire production to public procurement in residential waste collection in Finland reduces the number of firms active in the local market, but induces a statistically significant and large decrease in unit prices on average. While public procurement, thus, seems to be desirable from the citizensâ€™ perspective, not all municipalities adopt public procurement. We provide descriptive evidence that municipal council composition is associated with the chosen regime. This suggests that local politics may be one obstacle for the efficient provision of local public goods.
H76|Institutional change and the development of lagging regions in Europe|The success of the policy in delivering greater economic convergence does not hide the fact that we are witnessing a decline in the returns of intervention in the three main growth axes. There is, for example, growing concern about a potential exhaustion of additional investments in transport infrastructure and of improvements in accessibility as drivers of growth in certain lagging regions of Europe (Crescenzi and Rodríguez-Pose, 2012). While this issue remains controversial, the truth is that physical capital, human capital, and technology can explain a waning share of the variation in regional economic growth in Europe. Growth theories that accounted for differences in economic performance relatively well two decades ago are becoming less capable of doing so. The residual factor is growing, meaning that, in spite of improvements in growth theory, we tend to know less about what determines regional growth in Europe.
H76|Rural waste disposal issues within urban borders|The paper examines the waste management issues in the villages annexed to administrative-territorial units of the Romanian cities which have been frequently neglected by urban waste operators. The lack of waste collection services in such peri-urban communities favored the illegal waste disposal practices particularly prior to EU accession. The extension of waste collection services from main cities to such areas is compulsory in order to mitigate the environmental risks and the public health threats. The paper estimates the amounts of household waste susceptible to be uncontrolled disposed of by peri-urban villages in different geographical areas of North-East region with a particular focus on Neamt county. The paper points out that these rural settlements should receive the same attention concerning the municipal waste management services as the main urban areas. Traditional recovery of waste fractions at the household level (e.g., home composting) should be further promoted in such areas in order to avoid illegal dumping issue and to prevent the landfill of biodegradable waste as requested by EU regulations.
H76|Crime and Government Expenditure in Brazil: Estimating the Impact of Government Security Spending on Homicide Rates|Despite the widespread debate about crime in Brazil and the alarming increase in homicides in recent years, few studies have analyzed or exposed evidence of the impact of public security spending on deterring violence in the country. This may be due to issues of endogeneity when estimating the relationship between security spending and the rate of homicides. The primary innovation presented in this paper is the use of a Bartik-inspired instrument to address the simultaneity issue. It measures government security spending in a two-stage least squares estimation, obtaining outcomes that are not only statistically but also practically significant. Results indicate that an increase of R$10 per capita in annual security expenditure leads to a decrease of 0.6 per 100,000 people in the number of homicides.
H76|Strategies to Productively Reincorporate the Formerly-Incarcerated into Communities: A Review of the Literature|Two-thirds of those released from prison in the United States will be re-arrested within three years, creating an incarceration cycle that is detrimental to individuals, families, and communities. There is tremendous public interest in ending this cycle, and public policies can help or hinder the reintegration of those released from jail and prison. This review summarizes the rigorous evidence on the effectiveness of programs that aim to improve the reintegration and rehabilitation of the formerly-incarcerated. While there is a need for much more research on this topic, the existing evidence provides some useful guidance for decision-makers. The importance of evaluating existing and new strategies is also discussed.
H76|Is Your Lawyer a Lemon? Incentives and Selection in the Public Provision of Criminal Defense|Governments in the U.S. must offer free legal services to low-income people accused of crimes. These services are frequently provided by assigned counsel, who handle cases for indigent defendants on a contract basis. Court-assigned attorneys generally garner worse case outcomes than privately retained attorneys. Using detailed court records from one large jurisdiction in Texas, we find that the disparities in outcomes are primarily attributable to case characteristics and within-attorney differences across cases in which they are assigned versus retained. The selection of low-quality lawyers into assigned counsel and endogenous matching in the private market contribute less to the disparities.
H76|The impact of mayor-council coalitions on local government spending, service delivery, and corruption in Indonesia|This study examines the impact of majority coalitions on local government spending, service delivery, and corruption in Indonesia. The investigation finds that majority coalitions, i.e. those coalitions for which participating political parties control greater than half of council seats, cause a shift in local government spending towards health sector activities and induce improvements in citizen health service access—but only for a year or two, after which the positive effects disappear. The study shows that budget fraud starts to become problematic in the last two years of the coalition’s life. Majority coalition support for the local health spending and service agenda dissipates quickly as attention turns to corrupting the budget, via increased infrastructure outlays and associated rent-seeking. We hypothesize that budget fraud serves, in part, to finance subsequent rounds of local parliamentary and executive elections.

H76|Natural Disasters, Public Spending, and Creative Destruction: A Case Study of the Philippines|Typhoons, floods, and other weather-related shocks can inflict suffering on local populations and create life-threatening conditions for the poor. Yet, natural disasters also present a development opportunity to upgrade capital stock, adopt new technologies, enhance the risk-resiliency of existing systems, and raise standards of living. This is akin to the “creative destruction” hypothesis coined by economist Joseph Schumpeter in 1943 to describe the process where innovation, learning, and growth promote advanced technologies as conventional technologies become outmoded. To test the hypothesis in the context of natural disasters, we look at the case of the Philippines—among the most vulnerable countries in the world to such disasters, especially typhoons. Using synthetic panel data regressions, we show that typhoon-affected households are more likely to fall into lower income levels, although disasters can also promote economic growth. Augmenting the household data with municipal fiscal data, we show some evidence of the creative destruction effect: Municipal governments in the Philippines helped mitigate the poverty impact by allocating more fiscal resources to build local resilience while also utilizing additional funds poured in by the national government for rehabilitation and reconstruction.
H76|Political Turnover and the Performance of Local Public Enterprises|We study how political party turnover at the municipal level affects the economic performance of Italian Local Public Enterprises. To this end, we match data on municipal elections in Italy to the budget data of firms whose shares are owned by Italian municipalities. As political turnover and performance are likely to be jointly endogenous, we exploit the quasi-experimental nature of close electoral races to estimate the causal treatment effect. We find evidence that municipal party turnover disrupts investment and slows down productivity growth. At the same time, the probability of observing financial distress is larger. No significant effect can be established, on the other hand, in terms of profitability and employment growth. We link the effect of municipal party turnover to three mechanisms: first, the nature of close electoral races alters the incumbent party’s incentives to invest; second, turnover makes the appointment of new, less-experienced, board directors more likely; third, the new political leadership directly reduces the amount of resources transferred in order to signal its commitment to curb wasteful municipal expenditure. We finally set up a survival analysis, whose results show that municipal party turnover is associated to an increase in the likelihood to observe bankruptcy.

We report suggestive evidence that lower handgun sales primarily reduced impulsive assaults and domestic violence.
H76|Lo stock di capitale comunale: indicazioni per le politiche di intervento infrastrutturale di Regione Lombardia|Partendo dalle spese per investimento dei comuni lombardi nel periodo 2000-2015 e utilizzando il metodo dellâ€™inventario permanente si Ã¨ ricostruito lo stock di capitale pubblico a livello comunale per la regione Lombardia. Si mostra come alcune variabili come la popolazione e lâ€™altitudine influiscano sullo stock di infrastrutture esistente. Per meglio comprendere le determinanti dello stock di infrastrutture pro-capite comunale, si Ã¨ quindi provveduto ad effettuare una stima di questâ€™ultimo utilizzando la tecnica di regressione ai minimi quadrati. Utilizzando i coefficienti di questa regressione si Ã¨ giunti alla definizione di una formula che permette di distribuire trasferimenti in conto capitale, tenendo conto dello stock di infrastrutture in essere. Infine si Ã¨ confrontata lâ€™effettiva distribuzione degli spazi finanziari, concessi da Regione Lombardia ai sensi della legge n. 243/2012, con una distribuzione teorica derivante dallâ€™applicazione del modello delle infrastrutture standard.
H76|The Impact of Public Libraries on School Achievement: The Case of Medellin| This paper explores the relationship between public libraries and school achievement. Medellin counts on a system of public libraries. However, public library parks are part of a separate system. The library parks are understood as cultural centers for social development that seek to encourage the meeting of citizens and to develop educational activities that involve the digital culture. The project began in 2004 and was consolidated until 2011 with the introduction of 9 different library parks. Using an approach of differences-in-differences and matching techniques, we explore the effect of the library parks in Medellin on school performance. We found a significant effect on the performance of the language test in the students treated, especially in the long-term specification. Key Words: Public libraries, school achievement, impact evaluation, public investment. JEL Classification: C33, H54, H76, I2, I26.
H76|The Effects of DNA Databases on Crime|Every US state has a database of criminal offenders' DNA profiles. These databases receive widespread attention in the media and popular culture, but there has been no rigorous analysis of their impact on crime. This paper intends to fill that gap. I exploit the details and timing of state DNA database expansions in two ways, first to address the effects of DNA profiling on individuals' subsequent criminal behavior and then to address the aggregate effects on crime rates. I show that DNA databases deter crime by profiled offenders, reduce crime rates, and are more cost-effective than traditional law enforcement tools.
H76|Tax Me, but Spend Wisely? Sources of Public Finance and Government Accountability|Existing evidence suggests that extra grant revenues lead to little improvements in public services in developing countries--but would governments spend tax revenues differently? This paper considers a program that invests in the tax capacity of Brazilian municipalities. Using variations in the timing of program uptake, I find that it raises local tax revenues and that the increase in taxes is used to improve both the quantity and quality of municipal education infrastructure. In contrast, increases in grants over which municipalities have the same discretion as taxes have no impact on any measure of local public infrastructure. These results suggest that the way governments are financed matters: governments spend increases in tax revenues more toward expenditures that benefit citizens than increases in grant revenues.
H76|Sanitation and Education|I explore whether the absence of school sanitation infrastructure impedes educational attainment, particularly among pubescent-age girls, using a national Indian school latrine construction initiative and administrative school-level data. School latrine construction substantially increases enrollment of pubescent-age girls, though predominately when providing sex-specific latrines. Privacy and safety appear to matter sufficiently for pubescent-age girls that only sex-specific latrines reduce gender disparities. Any latrine substantially benefits younger girls and boys, who may be particularly vulnerable to sickness from uncontained waste. Academic test scores did not increase following latrine construction, however. Estimated increases in enrollment are similar across the substantial variation in Indian district characteristics.
H76|Incentives to local public service provision: An evaluation of Italy's Obiettivi di Servizio|Set up by the Italian central government and implemented in the lagging regions, Obiettivi di Servizio is an innovative scheme designed to encourage local authorities to reach given targets for the provision of public services such as education, childcare and elderly care, waste management, and water supply. The paper finds that the programme was only partially successful, with considerable differences across regions and targets. An important driver of effectiveness was local institutional quality. We also find signs of displacement effects: local authorities involved in the programme might have concentrated on the targets to the detriment of other local public services. Creado por el gobierno central italiano e implementado en las regiones menos desarrolladas, Obiettivi di Servizio es un programa innovador diseñado para animar a las autoridades locales a alcanzar determinados objetivos en la prestación de servicios públicos como la educación, el cuidado de niños y ancianos, la gestión de residuos y el suministro de agua. El artículo concluye que el programa sólo logró un éxito parcial, y mostró diferencias considerables entre regiones y objetivos. Un factor importante de la eficacia fue la calidad de las instituciones locales. También se encontraron indicios de efectos de desplazamiento: las autoridades locales involucradas en el programa podrían haberse concentrado en sus objetivos en detrimento de otros servicios públicos locales. Obiettivi di Servizioは、イタリア中央政府によって設立された、発展が遅れている地域で実施されている、イノベーションスキームで、教育、育児・介護、廃棄物処理、水道設備などの公共サービスの提供について、地方自治体が一定の目標を達成することを促進するものである。このプログラムは部分的にしか成功しておらず、地域や目標によってかなりの差があると考えられる。効果を推進する要因として、地域の制度の質が重要であることがわかった。また、プログラムに参加した地方当局は、結果的に他の地方公共サービスに損害を与える目標に集中していた可能性があり、置換効果の兆候も認められた。
H76|The political economy of transportation investment|Will politics lead to over-building or under-building of transportation projects? In this paper, we develop a model of infrastructure policy in which politicians overdo things that have hidden costs and underperform tasks whose costs voters readily perceive. Consequently, national funding of transportation leads to overspending, since voters more readily perceive the upside of new projects than the future taxes that will be paid for distant highways. Yet when local voters are well-informed, the highly salient nuisances of local construction, including land taking and noise, lead to under-building. This framework explains the decline of urban mega-projects in the US (Altshuler and Luberoff, 2003) as the result of increasingly educated and organized urban voters. Our framework also predicts more per capita transportation spending in low-density and less educated areas, which seems to be empirically correct.
H76|Distributive politics inside the city? The political economy of Spain's Plan E|We study distributive politics inside cities by analysing how local governments allocate investment projects to voters across neighbourhoods. In particular, we ask whether politicians use investment to target their own supporters. To this aim, we use detailed geo-located investment data from Plan E, a large fiscal stimulus program carried out in Spain in 2009–2011. Our main empirical strategy is based on a close-elections regression-discontinuity design. In contrast to previous studies – which use aggregate data at the district or municipal level – we exploit spatial variation in both investment and voter support within municipalities and find no evidence of supporter targeting. Complementary results indicate that voters may be responding to investment by increasing turnout.
H76|Urban Resurgence as a Consumer City: A Case Study for Weimar in Eastern Germany|Weimar achieved urban recovery as a ‘consumer city’ with sub-brandings like a population magnet with a high living-quality, a cultural city with touristic attractions, and a university city. Its intensive cultural promotion policies combined with urban regeneration programs have contributed to the recent demographic and economic growth. This study demonstrates this success and investigates its sectoral weaknesses compared to other German cities. Weimar needs an optimal mixture of consumption- and production-oriented development strategies to rectify the current structural imbalances and better control those negative impacts caused by a rapidly ageing population. Besides ample presence and intact connectivity of high-tech industries and producer services within a city which enhance R&D, innovation and productivity, Weimar should more seriously consider, when design-ing future development policy, that both urban growth approaches are interrelated: agglomeration generates higher income for the creative class, whereas high urban amenities attract young creative entrepreneurs selecting locations for start-ups.
H76|Kommunale Investitionsschwäche: Engpässe bei Planungs- und Baukapazitäten bremsen Städte und Gemeinden aus|Leistungsfähige Infrastrukturen sind eine wesentliche Voraussetzung für die Sicherung der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit und die Schaffung von Wachstumspotentialen. Obwohl der Bund zusätzlich Finanzmittel bereitgestellt hat, sind die vor allem durch Bauleistungen geprägten kommunalen Nettoanlageinvestitionen aber immer noch viel zu gering, um den jährlichen Verschleiß zu kompensieren. Ein Grund hierfür ist auch der Rückgang der Planungskapazitäten in den Kommunen. Bundesweit sank die Zahl der mit Baufragen befassten Angestellten in den Kommunalverwaltungen zwischen 1991 und 2010 um etwa 35 Prozent. Bis 2015 ging sie nochmals um fast zehn Prozent zurück. Die Bereitstellung zentraler Beratungskapazitäten im Rahmen des Aufbaus einer kommunalen Infrastrukturgesellschaft könnte helfen, bestehende Planungsengpässe aufzulösen. Die Auslastung der Bauwirtschaft hat zuletzt einen historischen Höchststand erreicht. Dies dürfte ein weiterer Grund für die geringe Investitionstätigkeit der Kommunen sein. Die Kapazitäten in der Bauwirtschaft müssten spürbar ausgeweitet werden, um mehr Infrastrukturprojekte auf kommunaler Ebene umsetzen zu können. Ansonsten würden immer wieder kurzfristig zusätzlich bereitgestellte Investitionsmittel vor allem in steigenden Preisen verpuffen. Voraussetzung für den Aufbau der Kapazitäten durch die Bauwirtschaft ist eine dauerhafte Erhöhung der kommunalen Investitionsmittel. Dazu ist nachhaltig die Situation finanzschwacher Kommunen zu verbessern. Nicht einzelne kurzfristige Bundesinitiativen, sondern verlässliche Regelwerke sind gefragt. Ein Ansatzpunkt besteht hier bei der Weiterentwicklung der Bund-Länder-Gemeinschaftsaufgabe „Verbesserung der regionalen Wirtschaftsstruktur“ (GRW). Sie müsste so umgebaut werden, dass gezielt eine größere Zahl von bedürftigen Kommunen von den Kofinanzierungsmitteln des Bundes und der Länder profitieren kann.

H76|資源配分の変化に伴う地域の生産性向上と経済政策の役割 : 社会資本整備か規制緩和か|経済全体の生産性上昇率は、その経済を構成する各産業固有の生産性上昇率と産業間の資源配分の変化による生産性上昇率に分解できる。この点は地域経済についても同様である。そこで、R-JIP データベースを利用して、各都道府県の生産性向上のうち、資本収益率差に沿って資本が移動することによる生産性向上とTFP 格差に伴って労働力が移動することで生産性の向上が達成される項目に対して社会資本や構造改革特区がどのような影響を及ぼすかについて分析を行った。まず社会資本の影響では、資本収益率差に伴う生産性向上に対してはマイナスの効果しかもたらしていない。一方、産業別社会資本に限れば、生産性格差に伴う生産性向上効果に影響を及ぼしているという結果が得られる。二つ目として、2000 年代に入って新たな地域政策として登場した構造改革特区の影響を検証した。この構造改革特区数の増加が資源配分に伴う生産性向上効果にどのような影響があったかを推計したところ、労働力の移動に伴う生産性向上効果に対しては有意な影響が観察された。

H76|Tax Progressivity and Top Incomes: Evidence from Tax Reforms|We study the link between tax progressivity and top income shares. Using variation from large-scale Western tax reforms in the 1980s and 1990s and the novel synthetic control method, we find large and lasting boosting impacts on top income shares from the progressivity reductions. Effects are largest in the very top groups while earners in the bottom half of the top decile were almost unaffected by the reforms. Cuts in top marginal tax rates account for most of this outcome whereas reduced overall progressivity contributed less. Searching for mechanisms, real income responses as measured by growth in aggregate GDP per capita, registered patents and tax revenues were unaffected by the reforms. By contrast, tax avoidance behavior related to the management of capital incomes in the very income top appears to lie behind the observed effects.
H76|The Economic Evaluation of Floods Using Spatial Software Aplication|The economic evaluation in the case of floods includes the full costs and benefits of activities such as prevention, response and recovery, i.e. before, during and after the occurrence of the event. The aim of this study is based on an open source geographical software application for flood modelling with different heights of the tidal wave by means of which to evaluate the costs and benefits of specific alternatives and to show how the costs of preventing floods have an impact on a given region. For the purposes of this article several floods in the city of Lukovit are subject to flood modelling. The selected area has a specific topology which makes it difficult in terms of flood protection. This is also determined by the fact that 3 major rivers (the Iskar River, Vit River, Zlatna Panega) and other smaller ones pass through the region.
H76|Traffic Safety in Korea: Understanding the Vulnerability of Elderly Pedestrians|Pedestrians are vulnerable in traffic, with frequently reported injuries and fatalities. These risks are believed to be correlated with socio-economic attributes such as age, income or education levels. For Korea, it is shown that elderly pedestrians have a higher mortality risk than other road users. On a municipal level, risk factors are high car ownership, an aging population and low population density; factors associated with rural areas. Some tentative evidence also points to financially stronger municipalities having better traffic safety, which could reflect a larger capacity to maintain roads and implement road safety measures.
H76|The Impact of Developmental Exependiture on the Competitiveness of Local Governments|Research background: Development policy in Poland is based on various strategic documents, and it utilizes both the national resources and the European funds. Managing development at the local level is an important element of this policy. Many facets of this management are of incessant interest to the theory and practice of public finance. One of undisputed findings is the relationship between development and increase in competitiveness. However there are no studies showing the relationship between the shape of local government expenditure policy and increase of competitiveness at the local level. Purpose of the article: The paper is focused on demonstrating the importance of specific groups of public expenditure implemented by local government units for development processes at the local level. The authors try to answer the question whether the implementation of certain local budget expenditure positively impacts the level of local government tax revenue, which determine the ability to provide public services, while creating a boost to the growth of competitiveness. Methodology/methods: On the basis of international consensus on the impact of individual factors on the competitiveness measured at the regional level, the authors propose the concept of public developmental expenditure and they adjust it to current standards of budget reporting. In turn, the indicator of tax revenue per capita was chosen to measure the achievement of the objectives of development policy at the local level. The study covers all major cities in Poland (poviat-cities). The authors calculate the volume of the developmental expenditure over the reference period in each city covered by the study as well as the average dynamics of tax revenue per capita. Regression analysis constitutes the essential part of the study. Findings: The observations that had been made, allowed to draw some conclusions regarding both the usefulness of proposed classification of developmental expenditure for the processes of planning, monitoring and evaluation of development strategies and the importance of developmental expenditure for the growth of competitiveness. The proper allocation of budgetary resources in developmental projects should lead in the long run to the growth of local economy and thus also to increase in local budget revenue.
H76|Autocorrelation of spatial allocation of funds at the municipality level of Slaskie Voivodship|Research background: Local development is a harmonized and systematic activity of the local community, local authorities and other entities operating in a municipality, aimed at creating and improving the usability of existing municipalities. The primary factor in the local development is investments undertaken by the municipality. The financial reflection of these activities is the amount of investment expenditure. The amount of a municipality's income, its development strategy and the expectations of the local communities influence both the level of investment expenditure and structure, which is diversified both in terms of time and space. Purpose of the article: The aim of the study was to determine the spatial distribution of total funds allocated for investment, and investments in transport and communications in the municipalities of Slaskie Voivodship. Spatial relationship was also determined with the Moran's I statistic. The scope of work included creating a spatial database of the examined region at the level of basic local government units, i.e. 167 municipalities. The data were obtained from the studies of official statistics for the years 2008, 2011 and 2014. Methodology/methods: Based on information contained in attribute data sheets, along with the postal codes of municipalities, a spatial database was created in the program ArcView. The analyzed maps were prepared in the GIS program ArcView. For better illustration and reading of detailed data from the prepared maps, the attribute variables were divided into groups using the Jenks method. With it, classes could be determined by comparing the sum of the squares of the differences. The developed classes can also be called a natural border of the division. Based on the prepared spatial database, an analysis was performed with the program R-cran, using Moran's I statistics. Moran's I statistic determines the differences and similarities between the two objects, and allows analyzing the researched area.Findings: With relation to the analysis of the total funds allocated for investment, the least among the investment periods studied was the year 2008. Noticeable in this period is the largest number of municipalities included in class I (142 municipalities), with the investment range 0 - 6,510,016.26 zloty. The developed spatial distribution shows that municipalities concentrated in the central part of the voivodship make up an island of high investment funds. These communes are located in the Upper Silesia Agglomeration, with a high population density. High values are also noticeable in large urban centers such as Czestochowa in the north of the voivodship, and Bielsko-Biala in the south.
H76|Yardstick competition and fiscal disparities: An experimental study|Recent theoretical research suggest that yardstick competition may be biased by the presence of fiscal disparities between local governments and that fiscal equalization may help in correcting this bias. This paper provides an empirical test of these theoretical predictions by means of a laboratory experiment.
H76|R&D Efficiency in High-Tech Firms in China|Using firm-level data from Changzhou, one of the representative prefectural cities in the Yangzi River Delta in China, we investigate the performances of both internal and external R&D in high-tech firms. We find that, on average, high-tech firms with more internal R&D expenditure apply for more patents in terms of both the total number of patents and the number of invention patents. Internal R&D is the most efficient in foreign firms, followed by private firms and then followed by SOEs (state-owned enterprises). These findings highlight the importance of privatizing high-tech firms in China if the Chinese government intends to accelerate industrial upgrading and convert the pattern of “Made in China” into “Created in China.”
H76|Is There a 1033 Effect? Police Militarization and Aggressive Policing|Events in Ferguson and Baltimore in the United States in the past 3 years have brought to light issues related to the militarization of police and adverse police–citizen interactions. Through federal programs and grants, local law enforcement agencies have been able to acquire surplus military items to combat terrorism and drug activity. The acquisition of these items has accelerated over the past 10 years. These agencies acquired nearly $1 billion worth of property in 2014 alone through the Pentagon’s 1033 Program, a program that distributes excess military surplus to law enforcement agencies. This study seeks to determine whether the increased acquisition of these items has led to more police use-of-force incidents. We create a dataset merging administrative data from the Pentagon’s 1033 Program database and survey data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Using a binary treatment effects estimator, we show that there is little evidence of a causal link between general military surplus acquisition and documented use-of-force incidents. In fact, the acquisition of military vehicles leads to fewer use-of-force incidents. The results also show that more diverse departments have fewer incidents, while agencies with SWAT team have more incidents.
H76|¿Cuántos trabajadores emplea el Estado de Chile? Problematización y orden de magnitud de la contratación a honorarios|En el presente artículo se presentan los resultados de un análisis que, en base a distintas fuentes de información administrativa, permite entregar un orden de magnitud a la cantidad de trabajadores que emplea el Estado de Chile. El principal resultado ha sido constatar que, independiente de la fuente de información utilizada, se identifica un cambio en la fisonomía del Estado: las formas de contratación temporales y desprovistas de derechos laborales han aumentado en los últimos 10 años de manera importante. El segundo hallazgo relevante es la incertidumbre que existe respecto al verdadero tamaño del Estado producto de las diferencias que tienen las diversas fuentes oficiales de información sobre la contratación de “trabajadores a honorarios”. El año 2014, de acuerdo la Dirección de Presupuestos y el Sistema Nacional de Información Municipal, se emplearon 358 mil trabajadores en el Gobierno Central y municipios, de los cuales 93 mil eran trabajadores a honorarios (1 de cada 4). Sin embargo, de acuerdo al Servicio de Impuestos Internos, para el mismo año calendario, 295 mil trabajadores emitieron boletas de honorarios al Estado. Estos resultados nos revelan la necesidad de estudios adicionales que permitan entender hasta qué punto están extendidas las formas precarias de contratación en el Estado y qué implicancias tiene ello sobre la calidad y sentido de la función pública. This article presents the results of an analysis that, based on different sources of administrative information, allows to deliver an order of magnitude to the number of workers employed by the State of Chile. The main result has been to verify that, regardless of the source of information used, a change in the physiognomy of the State is identified: temporary and precarious employment have increased significantly in the last 10 years. The second relevant finding is the uncertainty concerning the true size of the State, particularly because of the differences identified among official sources of information regarding the number of atypical workers. In 2014, according to the Bureau of Budgets and the National System of Municipal Information, 358 thousand workers were employed in the Central Government and municipalities, of which 93 thousand were atypical workers (1 in 4). However, according to the Internal Revenue Service, for the same calendar year, 295 thousand atypical workers were hired by the State. These results reveal the need for additional studies to understand the extent to which precarious forms of recruitment in the State are widespread and what implications this has for the quality and sense of the public function.
H76|One Mandarin Benefits the Whole Clan: Hometown Favoritism in an Authoritarian Regime|We study patronage politics in authoritarian Vietnam, using an exhaustive panel of ranking officials from 2000 to 2010 to estimate their promotions' impact on infrastructure in their hometowns of patrilineal ancestry. Native officials' promotions lead to a broad range of hometown infrastructure improvement. Hometown favoritism is pervasive across all ranks, even among officials without budget authority, except among elected legislators. Favors are narrowly targeted toward small communes that have no political power, and are strengthened with bad local governance and strong local family values. The evidence suggests a likely motive of social preferences for hometown.
H76|Rundfunkfinanzierung: von Gebühren und Beiträgen jetzt zur Indexierung?<BR>[Funding Strategies for German Public Broadcasting]|Zusammenfassung Die vor vier Jahren eingeführte Reform der Rundfunkfinanzierung kommt nicht aus den Schlagzeilen. Vermutlich auch durch die Kritik am neuen Gebührenmodell motiviert bringen die öffentlich-rechtlichen Sender neue Formen der Rundfunkfinanzierung ins Gespräch. Hanno Beck und Andrea Beyer diskutieren die Möglichkeiten einer Reform der Rundfunkfinanzierung unter ökonomischen Gesichtspunkten.
H76|Dutch Municipalities are Becoming Greener: Some Political and Institutional Explanations|This paper analyzes whether Dutch municipalities became greener between 1999 and 2014 by investigating whether they implement different unit-based pricing systems. Based on their incentive, systems are ranged from green ('weight' ) to less green ('volume' ), or not green ('flat rate' ). In one-third of the municipalities, shifts took place, with 83 percent becoming greener and 17 percent less green. Political fragmentation (measured in three ways) plays a key role in explaining these shifts. There is less evidence for political motivation. Particularly, Conservative Liberals are not in favor of unit-based pricing, whereas Social Liberals are in favor. In addition, municipalities in rural and shrinking areas are more in favor of unit-based pricing.
H76|Assessing Electronic Service Delivery in Municipalities|In the Netherlands, electronic service delivery has become an important issue in many municipalities. Using the Internet for service delivery is seen as an important element of e-government. Based on 2014-2016 panel-data of ICT service delivery for all Dutch municipalities, we show that there is a large variety among the municipalities in the extent to which they offer their service delivery digitally. We explore the factors that may explain the differences among the municipalities. Some trends can be discerned, most notably the strong relationship of e-government adoption with demographic characteristics, such as population, population density and both older age and younger age groups. Remarkably, we did not find an influence of educa-tion and income. Finally, we did not observe a relation between municipal allocated costs and level of e-maturity, hereby leaving the question open if and how e-government can lead to cost reductions.
H76|Economies of scale and governance of library systems: evidence from West Virginia|Abstract Public libraries are a billion dollar industry in the United States. We explore the institutional determinants of public library technical efficiency using data from West Virginia. We first document considerable cross-district variation in library efficiency. While the average library district in our sample is between 81 and 90% efficient depending upon the year and measure, there are many district-years that are under 50%. We then explain our technical efficiency measures as a function of institutional variables reflecting the type of district and sources of funding. We find consistent evidence that urban libraries are more inefficient, perhaps because they are too small to achieve sufficient economies-of-scale in production of library services. In addition, we find revenue from local sources is associated with reduced efficiency, contrary to what would be predicted by local public goods producer theory.
H76|Efficiency, But At What Cost? Evidence from a DEA Analysis of WV School Districts|West Virginia schools are consistently below the national average on the NAEP. Using Data Envelopment Analysis, we estimate the technical efficiency of West Virginia school districts. We find less variation in technical efficiency in West Virginia than in similar studies conducted in other states. This appears to be because of state policy imposing homogeneity of input usage. Due to the limited variation in technical efficiency across districts, we cannot analyze how non-school inputs such as socioeconomic factors affect technical efficiency across districts. Summary statistics organized by county economic status, however, suggest that socioeconomic status plays a role. Our results highlight an important limitation of DEA analysis on schools.
H76|Publicly announced speed limit enforcement and its impact on road safety: Evidence from the German Blitzmarathons|This paper studies a unique traffic law enforcement campaign in Germany and its impact on road safety. Key features of the campaign are (1) repeated one-day lasting massive speed limit monitoring (so called Blitzmarathons) and (2) a media campaign that informs the public in advance about the timing, extent, and purpose of the speed limit monitoring. Using administrative records on all police reported vehicle crashes in Germany from 2011 to 2014 and generalized difference-indifferences estimations, we find an eight percent reduction in the number of traffic accidents and a nine percent reduction in the number of slightly injured during Blitzmarathon-day compared to regular days. The effect begins to emerge with the onset of the media campaign, one to three days before a Blitzmarathon. However, while the initiators of the Blitzmarathons intended a permanent change in road safety, we do not find that the reduction in traffic accidents persists beyond a Blitzmarathon-day. In terms of mechanisms, we show that a substitution of traffic from motorized vehicles to other modes of transport not targeted by the Blitzmarathons does not drive our results, and we demonstrate that overall driving speed is lower during a Blitzmarathon-day compared to other days. Given the general relevance of traffic law enforcement strategies, our result have important implications for policy makers beyond the German context.
H76|Power Politics: Electoral Cycles in German Electricity Prices|We provide evidence that German public energy providers, over which municipality-level politicians hold substantial sway, systematically adjust the pricing of electric energy in response to local electoral cycles. The documented pattern is in line with both, an artificial reduction in prices before an election that needs to be countermanded by future price increases, and an artificial postponement of market-driven price increases until after the election is over.
H76|Personalized Risk Assessments in the Criminal Justice System|In an effort to bring greater efficiency, equity, and transparency to the criminal justice system, statistical risk assessment tools are increasingly used to inform bail, sentencing, and parole decisions. We examine New York City's stop-and-frisk program, and propose two new use cases for personalized risk assessments. First, we show that risk assessment tools can help police officers make considerably better real-time stop decisions. Second, we show that such tools can help audit past actions; in particular, we argue that a sizable fraction of police stops were conducted on the basis of little evidence, in possible violation of constitutional protections.
H76|Productivity and Selection of Human Capital with Machine Learning|Economists have become increasingly interested in studying the nature of production functions in social policy applications, with the goal of improving productivity. Traditionally models have assumed workers are homogenous inputs. However, in practice, substantial variability in productivity means the marginal productivity of labor depends substantially on which new workers are hired--which requires not an estimate of a causal effect, but rather a prediction. We demonstrate that there can be large social welfare gains from using machine learning tools to predict worker productivity, using data from two important applications - police hiring and teacher tenure decisions.
H76|Infrastructure, Incentives, and Institutions|Expensive infrastructure is ineffective if it doesn't travel the last mile. In nineteenth-century New York and modern Africa, disease has spread when urbanites chose not to use newly built sanitation infrastructure to save money. Either subsidies or Pigouvian fines can internalize the externalities that occur when people don't use sanitation infrastructure, but with weak institutions subsidies generate waste and fines lead to extortion. Our model illustrates the complementarity between infrastructure and institutions and shows how institutional weaknesses determine whether fines, subsidies, both or neither are optimal. Contrary to Becker (1968), the optimal fine is often mild to reduce extortion.
H76|Does the Technological Content of Government Demand Matter for Private R&D? Evidence from US States|Governments purchase everything from airplanes to zucchini. This paper investigates the role of the technological content of government procurement in innovation. In a theoretical model, we first show that a shift in the composition of public purchases toward high-tech products translates into higher economy-wide returns to innovation, leading to an increase in the aggregate level of private R&D. Using unique data on federal procurement in US states and performing panel fixed-effects estimations, we find support for the model's prediction of a positive R&D effect of the technological content of government procurement. Instrumental-variable estimations suggest a causal interpretation of our findings. (JEL H57, H76, O31, O32, O38)
H76|The Stimulative Or Inhibitor Impact Of The Associative Structures Of Local Authorities On Local Financial Autonomy|This paper attempts to emphasize the effects generated by different forms of association of local authorities upon the local financial autonomy. This empirical analysis we put forward highlights the extent to which we can speak about a legislative support and agreement in relation to the process of association of several local authorities and the financial impact such associations may have upon the local budget of a local authority. The data set we used highlights the particular case of a local community which became member of an intercommunity development association of Timis County (contracts with operators before and after accession in ADID, budgetary planning and the amount of local taxes sanitation).The empirical results we got underline the financial impact such association may have upon the town hall and the extent to which the town hall and the decisions of the local council may effectively apply the principles of local autonomy conferred and supported by the law no. 215/2001.
H76|Electoral incentives and firm behavior: Evidence from U.S. power plant pollution abatement|Researchers have utilized the fact that many states have term limits (as opposed to being eligible for re-election) for governors to determine how changes in electoral incentives alter state regulatory agency behavior. This paper asks whether these impacts spill over into private sector decision-making. Using data from gubernatorial elections in the U.S., we find strong evidence that power plants spend less in water pollution abatement if the governor of the state where the plant is located is a term-limited democrat. We show that this evidence is consistent with compliance cost minimization by power plants reacting to changes in the regulatory enforce- ment. Finally, we show that the decrease in spending has environmental impacts as it leads to increased pollution.
H76|The Sustainable Development Of The Brasov Growth Pole|The demographic dynamics analysed in the context of the relationship between economic development and social inclusion presents an image of the sustainable development of a community as well as the manner how the financial resources have been used. With an allocation of 74.3 million euro in the programming period 2007-2013, the Brasov Growth Pole has pursued the contribution to the achievement of sustainable development since 2005 by the participation in the Agenda 21. The implementation of projects with European financing in areas such as transport, social and educational infrastructure or tourism have generated changes/demographic movements, which this paper proposes to present. The evolution of the stable population, its dynamics at the level of each locality that is part of the Brasov growth pole as well as the dynamics of the number of employees or the development of the unemployment rate are presented by the cluster analysis. The effects of the European financing obtained from Regional Operational Programme 2007-2013 are thus reflected in the sustainable development of the Brasov growth pole from the point of view of the dynamics of the population.
H76|Cámaras de fotodetección y accidentalidad vial. Evidencia para la ciudad de Cali|Este artículo busca evaluar el impacto sobre la accidentalidad de 19 cámaras de fotodetección instaladas en la ciudad de Cali en el 2012. Usando un total de 10.146 intersecciones con accidentes registrados entre el 2010 y el 2013, se emplea un algoritmo de emparejamiento para construir un grupo de control. Utilizando diferentes estimadores se evalúa el registro total de accidentes, con daños y con heridos en las intersecciones tratadas, en comparación con el grupo de control, en el periodo posterior a la instalación de las cámaras. Se encuentra un aumento en todos los registros de accidentes para las cuatro intersecciones tratadas en enero del 2012. Este efecto se reduce en las cinco intersecciones tratadas en mayo y desaparece en las diez tratadas en agosto.
H76|Preservación ambiental de la Amazonia colombiana: retos para la política fiscal|Este artículo explora los retos encarados por la política fiscal en la preservación de la Amazonia colombiana. Se discuten algunos sesgos en contra del gasto público ambiental y se examinan las modalidades de financiación de la función estatal de protección del ambiente en la región. Los autores arguyen que muchas de las herramientas fiscales empleadas en Colombia para el efecto generan incentivos contrarios a los objetivos de conservación. Además de que las externalidades ambientales rebasan allí las jurisdicciones de las entidades territoriales, la eficacia potencial de los gobiernos subnacionales de la Amazonia en el ámbito de la política ambiental es constreñida por su relativamente baja capacidad fiscal. La intervención del nivel nacional de gobierno, acompañada de la acción internacional, es vista como necesaria en el caso de la Amazonia. ***** This paper explores the challenges faced by fiscal policy in the preservation of the Colombian Amazon. Some biases against public environmental expenditure are discussed; the financing arrangements for the state function of environmental protection in the region are examined. The authors argue that many of the fiscal tools used to that effect in Colombia generate perverse incentives for conservation purposes. In addition to the fact that environmental externalities go beyond the jurisdictions of local and departmental authorities, the potential effectiveness of Amazonian subnational governments in the realm of environmental policy is constrained by their relatively low fiscal capacity. The intervention of the national level government, accompanied by international action, is viewed as particularly necessary in the case of the Amazon.
H76|Does public transit reduce car travel externalities? Quasi-natural experiments' evidence from transit strikes|One of the unanswered questions in the field of urban economics is to which extent subsidies to public transit are justified. We examine one of the main benefits of public transit, a reduction in car congestion externalities, the so-called congestion relief benefit, using quasi-natural experimental data on citywide public transit strikes for Rotterdam, a city with mild congestion levels. On weekdays, a strike induces travel times to increase only marginally on the highway ring road (0.017min/km) but substantially on inner city roads (0.224min/km). During rush hour, the strike effect is much more pronounced. The congestion relief benefit of public transit is substantial, equivalent to about 80% of the public transit subsidy. We demonstrate that during weekends, travel time does not change noticeably due to strikes. Furthermore, we show that public transit strikes induce similar increases in number of cyclists as number of car travelers suggesting that bicycling-promoting policies to reduce car congestion externalities might be attractive in combination with first-best congestion pricing.
H76|Government-subsidized R&D and firm innovation: Evidence from China|This study investigates the effects of government R&D programs on firm innovation outputs, which are measured by the number of patents, sales from new products, and exports. Particularly, we examine the effects of Innovation Fund for Small and Medium Technology-based Firms (Innofund), which is one of the largest government R&D programs that support R&D activities of small and medium-sized enterprises in China. Using a panel dataset on Chinese manufacturing firms from 1998 to 2007, we find that Innofund-backed firms generate significantly higher technological and commercialized innovation outputs compared with their non-Innofund-backed counterparts and the same firms before winning the grant. Moreover, the changes in the governance of Innofund in 2005 from a centralized to a decentralized one because of policy amendments have significant effects on the effectiveness of the program. Specifically, the magnified effects of Innofund on technological innovation outputs become significantly stronger after the governance of Innofund becomes more decentralized. Identification problems are addressed by utilizing both propensity score matching and two-stage estimation approaches.
H76|Achieving political acceptability for new transport infrastructure in congested urban regions|This paper analyzes the efficiency and political acceptability of road pricing and infrastructure policies targeted at relieving urban congestion. It combines a stylized transport model of an urban road network with a model of the political process that incorporates interactions between voters, citizen interest groups and politicians to explore the possibilities to reach political acceptability for efficient transport policies. In a numerical illustration, the paper compares a set of pricing and investment policies in terms of efficiency and acceptability. The illustration shows how conflicting interests can lead to non-efficient policies being chosen.
H76|Search for Resources in a High Income State: A Study of State Finances of Sikkim|The paper examines the public financial management (PFM) of Sikkim focusing mainly on resources generation effort and budget management practices. We note that any deviation from the Central transfers creates fiscal stress as the State depends heavily on them to fund vast expanse of social and economic services and infrastructure. The sparse internal resources reduce flexibility to invest in the sectors where the State has inherent advantages. The search for resources to drive the development needs and create higher employment opportunities remain a major drag for the State. The paper looks at the possibilities of strengthening internal resources and improving the efficiency of public spending to ensure value for money. The fiscal stress faced by the State due to decline in Central assistance to the State plan should be considered as an opportunity to make an unbiased assessment of its fiscal capacity and development commitment.
H76|Public Expenditure, Governance and Human Development: A Case of Madhya Pradesh|This paper examines the link between quality of governance, public expenditure and human development outcomes in the state of Madhya Pradesh. The role of governance is measured in five dimensions: Political, Legal Judicial, Administrative, Economic and Social. A total of 22 indicators have been used to measure the Governance Index (GI) of Madhya Pradesh at district level. The results in this paper suggest that, at district level, development expenditure alone is not sufficient in achieving human development outcomes. However, the effectiveness of public expenditures improves with better governance indicators. In addition, GI is found to be significant and positive in improving development outcomes. Among the governance dimensions, weak administrative index appears to be the main constraint in improving the human development outcomes in less developed districts. Disaggregated analysis suggests that the districts with lower human development achievements need to prioritize only in one or two dimensions of governance, in particular administrative governance. Prioritization of various or specific dimensions of governance should help in reducing the divergences in development outcomes across the districts. The findings of this paper are very important as they suggest that public expenditure efficiency depends on the quality of governance. Hence, there is a need to equally focus, both, on improving governance as well as on increasing development expenditures. In the context of achieving SDGs and with the lessons learnt from MDGs, the findings of the paper suggest that we should focus on policy both at the sub-national and sub-state level.
H76|Intergovernmental fiscal relations and subnational finance in Russia in 2015| In 2015, the share of subnational budget expenditure of the Russian Federation consolidated budget dropped considerably from 39.7% in 2014 to 32.1% in 2015 (excluding expenditure for the Crimean Federal Okrug). The share of tax revenues shrank to a lesser extent, from 32.6% to 28.6%, during the same period. The decline in the share of subnational budget expenditure of the total volume of Russia’s consolidated budget expenditure is explained largely by faster-than-normal growth of the federal budget expenditure (by 5.6% in nominal terms). The federal budget expenditure increased first of all for ‘General National Issues’ (by 18.6%), ‘National Defense’ (by 28.3%), ‘Housing and Utilities’ (by 20.5%), ‘Social Policy’ (by 23.5%), ‘Municipal and Public Debt Servicing’ (by 24.8%). Subnational budget expenditure increased in the period under review by 1.4% (excluding expenditure for the Crimean Federal Okrug).
H76|Comparative Study Of The Level 5 Leadership Model Applied To Managing Human Talent In Public Administration Of Costa Rica, Estudio Comparativo Del Modelo De Liderazgo Nivel 5 Aplicado A La Gestion Del Talento Humano En La Administracion Publica De Tres Municipalidades De Costa Rica|This research presents the results of an assessment using the measuring instrument Level 5 Leadership Collins (2005) to identify the degree of leadership in the public administration of the municipality of PococÃ­, GuÃ¡cimo and Siquirres Costa Rica. We use the measuring g instrument to make a comparative study of the three municipalities. We present findings and recommendations to the relevant authorities and propose alternatives or solutions to help improve the performance of departments.
H76|City competition for the creative class|Abstract This paper explores the conditions under which decentralization and fiscal competition lead to a policy of providing public amenities in order to attract highly productive labor. It provides a theoretical analysis which shows that the incentive to provide such amenities is particularly strong, if institutional restrictions prevent local governments from adjusting their tax structure. The empirical analysis considers the case of Germany, where public subsidies to local theaters are shown to exert a compensating earnings differential for highly educated labor. Taking account of the institutional setting, our empirical results suggest that local jurisdictions in Germany are subject to a substantial fiscal incentive to subsidize cultural activities.
H76|The Impact of the Limited Government Policy on the Management of the Japanese Prefectural Museums|"This paper focuses on estimating the efficiency of Japanese prefectural museums and its determinants. Using econometric methods, the aim of this paper is to determine how the small government policy has changed the management of Japanese prefectural museums since 2006. In order to reconstruct the budget positions of local governments, the Koizumi government advocated a policy of ""small"" government and cuts in the costs of public cultural facilities. One example was the introduction of the Designated Manager System (DMS) into public facilities in 2006, which was an example of the New Public Management and enabled private managers to manage public facilities. The main contribution of this paper is to examine the impact of the introduction of New Public Management into public museums, using statistical data. A stochastic production frontier is used to confirm if there has been any improvement in the economic efficiencies of museums since 2006 and whether or not this is due to the DMS itself. Microdata for the period from 1998 to 2014 obtained from the ""Prefectural Art Museum Survey"" (Todoufukenritsu Bijutsukan Kihon-chosahyou) which was conducted by the Council of Deputy Director Generals and others of Prefectural Art Museums (Todoufukenritsu Bijutsukan Fukukanchotou-jimusekininsya-kaigi) is used in the analysis. The estimation results show that designated managers could reduce inefficiencies when they engage in planning the exhibitions in the prefectural museums. Museums where their designated managers are selected through a competitive process also show a more efficient performance."
H76|Can Tax Increment Financing Support Transportation Infrastructure Investment?|This report reviews alternative sources of revenue to support new infrastructure and other development projects for which municipal funds are not readily available. We review two such instruments: Tax Increment Financing (TIF) and Land Value Capture (LVC). We found more frequent use of TIF than LVC. TIF has largely been used to fund small-scale projects, often not exceeding one or two hundred million dollars in capital costs. We could find only two TIF implementations that aimed to generate over a billion dollars in TIF revenue, and those projects fell short of meeting the revenue targets. The evidence for TIF efficacy is mixed and depends, to some extent, on the type of methods used in the analysis. Some studies found the TIF districts reported higher rates of development and greater real estate price appreciation than comparable non-TIF districts. Other studies reached different conclusions. Three key elements were repeatedly found to contribute to TIF success. (1) Mixed land use developments often met their intended TIF objectives. (2) The timing of TIF implementation mattered; TIFs initiated during recessions met with limited success. (3) Smaller TIFs were more successful in meeting revenue targets than larger ones. We simulate a 30-year TIF implementation along the Sheppard East corridor in Toronto, the route for the Sheppard subway line that started operations in 2002, and offer insights for local and higher tiers of government interested in implementing TIF. Our analysis of the Sheppard East corridor found that the net present value of the simulated TIF revenue covered only a small portion of the capital costs of extending the subway line.
H76|Did the Land Transfer Tax Reduce Housing Sales in Toronto?|The City of Toronto implemented a land transfer tax on real estate transactions in February 2008. We explore the impact of the tax on housing sales in the City of Toronto and the rest of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). Previous research has shown that housing sales declined in Toronto once the City imposed the land transfer tax. This study, however, concludes that the negative impact of the tax on housing sales was statistically insignificant. Our approach differs from earlier studies in three ways. First, we highlight other influences on housing sales, in particular, the impact of the Great Recession, which overlapped with the imposition of the land transfer tax in Toronto, and the tightening of mortgage regulations in Canada that prevented lenders from issuing subprime mortgages. Second, we analyze the sale of both freehold and condominium properties in the GTA; previous research restricted analysis to freehold properties. Third, we take a regional perspective by contrasting any decline in housing sales in Toronto against an increase in sales in the suburban municipalities.
H76|Financing the Golden Age: Municipal Finance in Toronto, 1950 to 1975|Toronto is known for having been a prosperous and successful city in the decades after the Second World War, and the postwar period has come to be seen as something of a Golden Age for the city. While acknowledging the problems inherent in this sort of characterization, this study seeks to uncover what role Torontoâ€™s postwar municipal finances played in making the city the success that it was. It presents the historical context, briefly explaining the formation of Metropolitan Toronto and the emergence of Ontarioâ€™s welfare state. The main body of the study analyses the annual reports of both Torontoâ€™s and Metropolitan Torontoâ€™s Commissioners of Finance, and highlights trends and features: the shift from hard to soft services, the impact of the welfare state, increases in provincial funding, and the importance of debt financing. The author shows that although Toronto, as an overall urban system, was fiscally healthy in this Golden Age, several of the circumstances that made it so were beginning to unravel by the mid-1970s. The study concludes by suggesting what this history might teach us about Torontoâ€™s municipal finances today.
H76|Renewal Investment in Water Infrastructure and Sustainability of Municipal Water Service Utility|This paper estimates renewal investment in aging water infrastructure to investigate the fiscal sustainability of water service utilities operated by municipalities in Japan. Specifically, we focus on the water infrastructure in Nishiwaki City, Hyogo Prefecture and estimate the past infrastructure investment and the future renewal costs, and further forecast the future balance of payment in the water utility account. The past infrastructure investment is estimated on the basis of the actual record of water supply facilities such as water pipes developed and the actual construction costs at present, and the amount of future renewal investment is estimated on the assumption that investment would be made after the end of each facility fs service life. The estimated annual amount of renewal investment during the 50 years from FY2017 to FY2065 comes to 0.9 to 1 billion yen per year. It is about three times as large as the annual average of recent infrastructure investment by Nishiwaki City from FY2009 to FY2013, which stands at 334 million yen. The result suggests that the future renewal investment will be a huge fiscal burden on this city. Assuming that earnings from water supply services will decline in the future and the present revenues structure and water service charge will not be changed, the city will run out of its accumulated funds (internal reserve funds) in the water utility account by around FY2020 and will face revenue shortfalls. In order to renew infrastructure as needed while maintaining the present water services, the city must consider countermeasures such as the integration or abolition of facilities, revision of water charges, reform of the management approach, and the possibility of covering a part of expenses by general public expenditure, as soon as possible. It is also necessary to understand that this situation is not a particular problem faced by one local city but it is common to all municipalities throughout the country.
H76|Search for Resources in a High Income State: A Study of State Finances of Sikkim|The paper examines the public financial management (PFM) of Sikkim focusing mainly on resources generation effort and budget management practices. We note that any deviation from the Central transfers creates fiscal stress as the State depends heavily on them to fund vast expanse of social and economic services and infrastructure. The sparse internal resources reduce flexibility to invest in the sectors where the State has inherent advantages. The search for resources to drive the development needs and create higher employment opportunities remain a major drag for the State. The paper looks at the possibilities of strengthening internal resources and improving the efficiency of public spending to ensure value for money. The fiscal stress faced by the State due to decline in Central assistance to the State plan should be considered as an opportunity to make an unbiased assessment of its fiscal capacity and development commitment.
H76|Public Expenditure, Governance and Human Development: A Case of Madhya Pradesh|This paper examines the link between quality of governance, public expenditure and human development outcomes in the state of Madhya Pradesh. The role of governance is measured in five dimensions: Political, Legal & Judicial, Administrative, Economic and Social. A total of 22 indicators have been used to measure the Governance Index (GI) of Madhya Pradesh at district level. [Working Paper No. 171].
H76|The Destinations of State Trade Missions|From 1997 to 2006, US state governors led more than 500 trade missions to foreign countries. Trade missions are potentially a form of public investment in export promotion. I create a theory of public investment by introducing government to a Melitz (2003)–Chaney (2008) model. Controlling for state and country characteristics, the model accounts for the frequency and destination of trade missions and predicts a positive relationship between missions and exports by destination. By collecting data on trade mission origins and destinations, I estimate this relationship in the data and find that mission destinations are qualitatively consistent with the model. (JEL codes: F13, H76, O24)
H76|Municipal Debt and Its Economic Effects – The Romanian Case|The paper analyzes the municipal debt of Romanian subnational governments and its effects on the economic development of local communities, especially focusing on the particularities of local indebtedness in the context of the recent economic and financial crisis. By combining qualitative and quantitative analysis (based on indicators of the level, structure and dynamics of local debt) we seek to identify the sources of malfunction or inconsistencies in public policy making and further provide alternative solutions to eliminate them. Taking into account the particularities of the socio-economic environment and the current socio-political realities of Romania, as a European Union Member State, our assessments are carried out by reference to the developments in the municipal indebtedness of other European countries, developed but also developing ones. The quantitative analysis is based on both national and European regulations and incident databases of national authorities and Eurostat.
H76|Local political fragmentation: Fiscal and service delivery effects in Indonesia|This study examines the direct and indirect impact of local political fragmentation on fiscal and service outcomes in Indonesia, focusing particular attention on the interaction between local legislatures and directly elected executives. The investigation uses newly accessed data on council size—a common measure of political fragmentation—over two recent electoral periods. The analysis employs a regression discontinuity design, which assists in overcoming problems associated with the endogeneity of council size. The study determines that council size directly suppresses local government spending, as other recent work has also found. The effects of council size are also indirectly expenditure-constraining. When councils are small the impact of direct executive elections on spending is positive; as council size grows positive election effects decline; and when councils become particularly large the influence of direct elections on expenditure becomes negative. Recent research on this topic contends that such constraints on local spending are constructive—they reflect useful limitations on the budget maximizing tendencies of local administrations. This analysis argues otherwise. It posits that the reduced spending caused by fragmentation adversely affects service delivery and therefore constitutes a harmful effect. The study provides evidence to show that increasing council size does indeed negatively influence service outcomes. (revised Feb2017)
H76|Resident Bid Preference, Affiliation, and Procurement Competition: Evidence from New Mexico|In public procurement auctions, governments typically offer preferences to qualified businesses in the form of bid discounts. Previous studies that examine how these bid preferences affect auction outcomes fail to address affiliation -- a particular type of correlation among costs that can be generated in a public procurement setting. This paper addresses that issue by studying the joint effect of bid preferences and affiliation in project-completion costs on procurement auctions using novel data from the New Mexico Department of Transportation's Resident Preference Program. Bidders, heterogeneous in residency status, compete in an auction with endogenous entry and affiliated project-completion costs for the opportunity to complete a construction project. Here affiliation is modeled using copulas, and an empirical model is developed to disentangle a bidder's participation and bidding decisions. I find that accounting for affiliation in project-completion costs considerably changes the evaluation of how offering preferences to resident bidders affects the cost of procurement and the number of resident bidders who ultimately win these preference auctions. The estimates indicate that the New Mexico Department of Transportation can increase the current level of preference to increase the number of winning resident bidders without a major change in the cost of procurement.
H76|Social Sector Expenditure and Human Development of Indian States|The Study tries to explore the effect Social Sector Expenditure (SSE) on Human Development Index (HDI) of Indian States. It is found that SSE has a positive impact on HDI.
H76|Subcontracting Requirements and the Cost of Government Procurement|Government procurement auctions can be subject to policies that specify, as a percentage of the total project, a subcontracting requirement for the utilization of historically disadvantaged firms. This paper studies how these subcontracting policies affect auction outcomes using administrative data from New Mexico’s Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program. Through the use of a procurement auction model with endogenous subcontracting, I show that subcontracting requirements need not correspond to higher procurement costs – even when disadvantaged firms are more costly. I find small differences in procurement costs as a result of New Mexico’s current policy.
H76|Decentralization and fiscal performance in Central and Eastern Europe|The paper provides empirical evidence on the association between decentralization and fiscal performance of the general government on a panel of 11 former transition countries during 1996-2012, controlling for the effects of various demographic, institutional, and macroeconomic variables. Also, for robustness check we make a comparison with a panel of 18 industrialized European economies. The main findings from the empirical investigation suggest that decentralizing government activities in Central and Eastern Europe leads to an increase in the efficiency in the provision of public goods. Also, we show that not only the extent of fiscal decentralization, but the composition of local revenue, too, matters for fiscal discipline. In these regards, providing local governments with higher autonomy in financing their activities by relying more on their “own” tax revenues instead of intergovernmental grants seems to be conducive with fiscal discipline. In contrast to the sample consisting of the former transition economies, we cannot find evidence on the association between decentralization and fiscal discipline in the developed European countries.
H76|The Impact of Public Expenses for Innovativeness and Entrepreneurship on Local Development in the Eastern Poland (Wplyw wydatkow zwiazanych z innowacyjnoscia i przedsiebiorczoscia na rozwoj lokalny regionow przygranicznych Polski Wschodniej)|The aim of the paper is to prove the positive impact on local development by the Lisbon Strategy expressed with the public expenditures on innovation, environmental protection and labor market support in cross-border regions of the Eastern Poland. This chapter presents the basic statistics describing the priority themes and intervention categories of cohesion policy in the European Union. The study was hypothesized in line with the Lisbon Strategy, with presumption of the positive impact of expenditures for innovation, the environment and the labor market support on local development. Basic hypothesis would be accepted when at least one of proposed independent variables would be positively influencing the dependent variable. Extended hypothesis needs all independent variables to be positively influencing the dependent one. The method, used to prove the impact and to verify the hypothesis was multiple regression model with backward elimination, in which the explanatory variables were public expenditures spent within 8/11 priority themes and 71 out of 74 intervention categories of cohesion policy in 87 counties belonging to cross-border regions of the Eastern Poland (Lublin, Podlaskie, Subcarpathian and Warmian-Masurian voivodeships). Economic aggregate was chosen as a dependent variable in the model, based on average salaries in the county, treated as a measure of local development. As a result of the econometric modeling the hypothesis was confirmed in the basic variant and rejected in the extended one. The expenditures on innovation activities, being statistically significant, positively influenced the local development (with liberalized conditions of statistical significance also expenditures on entreprenurship). However, the lack of statistical significance for expenditures on environment and negative impact of expenses for the integration in the labor market on local development makes it impossible to confirm the hypothesis in extended variant.
H76|Benefit Sharing Exploring Water Resources in Brazil|Large infrastructure projects may cause permanent impacts on their local environment, affecting the living conditions of local people in a negative manner. To mitigate impacts caused by installation of hydroelectric plants, Brazilian law provides that municipalities are compensated by the Compensação Financeira pelo Uso de Recursos Hídricos (CFURH) and the payment of royalties (Itaipu). In this work I test whether such payments have actually worked as a benefit sharing mechanism, examining its effects on some social and economic indicators by way of two steps procedure: first, the propensity score of municipalities benefiting from the compensation is estimated using georeferenced data from WWF’s project HydroSHEDS. Then, I estimate a difference-in-differences model, comparing the dependent variables in the control and treatment groups before and after the compensation. The results show a limited effect of the compensation on living conditions. Human Development Index (HDI) and infant mortality showed a little improvement, but illiteracy rate and income inequality worsened.
H76|A Comprehensive Analysis of Expenditure Decentralization and of the Composition of Local Public Spending| S acchi A. and S alotti S. A comprehensive analysis of expenditure decentralization and of the composition of local public spending, Regional Studies . Many industrialized countries have recently implemented fiscal decentralization reforms assigning more spending responsibility to sub-national governments. This paper investigates the causes of the decentralization of different categories of public expenditure in 19 developed countries over the period 1980-2006. Different models for each of the spending functions under analysis are estimated adopting a general-to-specific empirical approach. Results confirm existing findings on the negative link between regional income disparities and expenditure decentralization. A similarly negative relationship is found for a set of demographic variables, leading to the conclusion that macroeconomic and, more importantly, political factors are responsible for the recent increase in decentralization. Finally, the analysis is completed by a study of the factors driving sub-national expenditure composition, with political and demographic changes emerging as the most important determinants.
H76|Electoral Incentives and Firm Behavior: Evidence from U.S. Power Plant Pollution Abatement|Researchers have utilized the fact that many states have term limits (as opposed to being eligible for re-election) for governors to determine how changes in electoral incentives alter state regulatory agency behavior. This paper asks whether these impacts spill over into private sector decision-making. Using data from gubernatorial elections in the U.S., we find strong evidence that power plants spend less in water pollution abatement if the governor of the state where the plant is located is a term-limited democrat. We show that this evidence is consistent with compliance cost minimization by power plants reacting to changes in the regulatory enforcement. Finally, we show that the decrease in spending has environmental impacts as it leads to increased pollution.
H76|Does the Median Voter or Special Interests Determine State Highway Expenditures? Recent Evidence|Abstract Using cross-sectional data from 50 states of the United States and the District of Columbia for two different time periods, this paper examines the degree to which special interests or the median voter determine state highway expenditures. In addition to finding that previous estimates of the determinants of state highway expenditures are robust, we find that that special interests that were important in 1984 were no longer significant nearly 20 years later. Like the previous literature, we conclude that the reduced form median voter model performs well in explaining state highway expenditures.
H76|Spanish Public Policies towards the Promotion of Cloud Computing and Digital Services for SMEs|The paper focuses on the first public programs in Spain to support the introduction of cloud computing services for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and micro-SMEs, and facilitating the digital transformation of SMEs, stimulating e-commerce and encouraging competitiveness. The paper analyses how the programs that the Spanish Government launched in 2015 transcend technology and impact over the digital ecosystem, with influences over supply and demand. The paper identifies the main drivers of SMEs providing cloud services and ICT solutions and other key elements that help to understand the eligible portfolio of cloud solutions and authorised providers that will contribute to the digital transformation of Spanish SMEs and micro-SMEs.
H76|The Judge, the Politician, and the Press: Newspaper Coverage and Criminal Sentencing across Electoral Systems|We study how media environments interact with political institutions that structure the accountability of public officials. Specifically, we quantify media influence on the behavior of US state court judges. We analyze around 1.5 million criminal sentencing decisions from 1986 to 2006 and new data on the newspaper coverage of 9,828 trial court judges. Since newspaper coverage is endogenous, we use the match between newspaper markets and judicial districts to identify effects. We find that newspaper coverage significantly increases sentence length by nonpartisan elected judges for violent crimes. For partisan elected and appointed judges, there are no significant effects.

H76|Asymmetric Incentives in Subsidies: Evidence from a Large-Scale Electricity Rebate Program|Many countries use substantial public funds to subsidize reductions in negative externalities. Such policy designs create asymmetric incentives because increases in externalities remain unpriced. I investigate the implications of such policies by using a regression discontinuity design in California's electricity rebate program. Using household-level panel data, I find that the incentive produced precisely estimated zero treatment effects on energy conservation in coastal areas. In contrast, the rebate induced short-run and long-run consumption reductions in inland areas. Income, climate, and air conditioner saturation significantly drive the heterogeneity. Finally, I provide a cost-effectiveness analysis and investigate how to improve the policy design. (JEL D12, D62, H76, L94, L98, Q48)
H76|US State Fiscal Policy and Natural Resources|An analytical framework predicts that, in response to an exogenous increase in resource-based government revenue, a benevolent government will partially substitute away from taxing income, increase spending and save. Fifty-one years of US-state level data are largely consistent with this theory. A baseline fixed effects model predicts that a $1.00 increase in resource revenue results in a $0.25 decrease in nonresource revenue, a $0.43 increase in spending and a $0.32 increase in savings. Instrumenting for resource revenue reveals that a positive revenue shock is largely saved and the rest is transferred back to residents in the form of lower non resource tax rates.

H76|The Influence Of Public And Private Sector Investment On Economic Growth In The European Union|The objective of this working paper is to investigate the correlation between private and public sector investment and economic growth in the European Union. The analysis will be made between 1996 and 2012. This was a time of big changes for the European community, by the large number of states that were integrated and also by the turbulent times after the start of the economic crisis in 2008. A better understanding of the influences on economic growth by the public and private sectors will help policy makers in the EU to allocate more efficiently the financial resources. Our research will follow two major paths. One will be concentrated on the impact of the variables at national level and another will try to understand the effects of public and private sectors at regional level. The result of the analysis ought to show the bigger impact of the private sector on growth compared with the influence of public investment.

H76|Past And Potential Roles Of Electricity System Operators: From Liberalisation To Climate Change Management In Britain|This paper discusses the changing role of electricity system operators in Britain. Until 2008, the UK electricity system operator was the key co-ordinator for a liberalized electricity generation market. However, since 2008, the British electricity system operator has, under the Energy Market Reform, primarily become a delivery agency for technology-specific generation within a planned electricity system. This paper discusses the transformation in the role of the British electricity system operator since 2008 and analyses the relationship between this change and the development of EU energy and climate change policy. The paper concludes with a discussion of the alternative views of the EU energy policy – the EU Commission has been proposing much increased interconnection to encourage multi-country regional markets, linking those markets into a Single European Electricity Market. Conversely, the UK, Germany and some other Member States have been promoting their national markets based on large-scale investment on national renewables with sizeable budgetary subsidies, supported by capacity payments. The role of the national electricity system operator is central to this debate with its functions very different in the two models.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H76|Self-preserving Leviathans - Evidence from Regional-level Data|This paper investigates the impact of the intensity of political competition on the leviathan behavior by political incumbents. Using panel data from German municipalities, we test whether the relative political strength of parties in local councils influences the spending behavior of officeholders. We find only weak evidence that strong officeholders (with weak political opponents) exhibit leviathan behavior in total government spending. Additionally, we test for political budget cycles at the local level. Here, we find strong empirical evidence that the spending pattern during a legislative period depends on the distribution of power in local councils. In municipalities with weak political competition the public spending reaches a peak in election years. The political incumbents act as self-preserving leviathans. If officeholders face politically strong opponents, they do not initiate a political budget cycle.
H76|Urban Shrinkage in Eastern Germany|This paper questions the widely applied parallelism of demographic and economic development in characterizing urban shrinkage in Germany, and argues that the usage of population change as a single indicator leads to incorrect policy recommendations for combating urban shrinkage. As the cases of several Ruhr cities (Essen, Gelsenkirchen and Dortmund) and East German cities (Erfurt, Rostock and Magdeburg) prove, urban economic growth can also be achieved thanks to the substantial presence of modern industries and business services, and despite declines in population size. The serious shrinkage of Halle, Cottbus and Schwerin is primarily due to failures in the post-industrial transformation process. Recent policy measures strongly oriented towards slowing the downsizing process of population (via urban regeneration measures to hinder suburbanisation and low core urban density) do not address this major problem effectively. More active industrial policy measures are required in these East German shrinking cities to create a competitive manufacturing sector (endowed with new high-tech firms) and to boost its growth interdependence with modern local services.

H76|Local Public Infrastructure Showing Signs of Wear and Tear|Investment in public infrastructure is essential to ensure competitiveness and create growth potential. Although Germany certainly has a well-developed infrastructure compared to other countries, local public infrastructure has been in decline for many years now. This means that current levels of investment are not sufficient to offset this decline, and the infrastructure is becoming increasingly outdated and limited in its scope. In order for this backlog of local public investment to at least not continue growing, a rapid change in policy is urgently needed. The creation of a special central government fund to encourage investment in financially weak areas is a step in the right direction. Given the enormity of the local public investment backlog, a massive increase in immediate financial assistance seems imperative. At the same time, a systematic approach must be developed to compensate for the chronic underfunding of certain types of municipality. One improvement might be to take proper account of the financial weakness of the municipalities in fiscal equalization among the federal states.
H76|Neue Parteien, Skandale und Alltägliches in Landtagswahlkämpfen: Thementreiber der Inneren Sicherheit|Topics around security are a central field of political discourse in democracies – in the German case federalism plays a characterizing role. This article is a first trial to measure policy positions and its dynamics within the policy field of crime and internal security in Germany. The salience of the different issues in party manifestos on state and federal level is analyzed. The comparative approach is based on a comprehensive analysis of the party manifestos of parties that were elected into federal parliaments successfully between September 2011 (House of Representatives election in Berlin) and September 2014 (Parliament elections in Brandenburg and Thuringia). Results show the substantial inequality of the relevance different topics of internal security play. Relevant differences become apparent within political parties as well as across the German Länder. Still, the contents of parties’ programs seem to be influenced by a number of rather generalizable factors. During the observation period, topics gained timeliness for two reasons: On the one hand it appears that emerging and presumed single-issue parties (the Pirate Party and the AfD) can “set” topics for the already established parties that seek after a similar clientele within the electorate. On the other hand, in particular the NSU-scandal had the power to bring up issues that are normally avoided in party manifestos, such as issues around the secret services. This area was not explicitly covered by any political party before the NSU-scandal. However, these German-wide scandals do not need to be salient in all manifestos. The NSUscandal, for example, had only a regional impact. Sicherheitsthemen sind ein klassisches Feld der politischen Auseinandersetzung in Demokratien – im deutschen Fall spielt dabei die föderale Prägung eine entscheidende Rolle. Der vorliegende Beitrag ist ein erster Versuch, die politische Positionierung von Parteien in Deutschland im Bereich Kriminalität und Innere Sicherheit zu messen und deren Dynamiken zu erklären. Um diesen Fragen nachzugehen, wird die Bedeutung von Themen der Inneren Sicherheit in Wahlprogrammen sowohl auf Landes- als auch Bundesebene codiert, wobei alle Wahlprogramme der in Landesparlamenten eingezogenen Parteien zwischen September 2011 (Abgeordnetenhauswahl in Berlin) und September 2014 (Landtagswahlen in Brandenburg und Thüringen) berücksichtigt werden. In den gewonnenen Daten zu den Policy-Positionen der Parteien werden erhebliche Unterschiede in der Bedeutung der Problemfelder der Inneren Sicherheit deutlich. Bedeutsame Unterschiede treten dabei sowohl in einzelnen Bundesländern im Vergleich der Parteien als auch zwischen den Landesverbänden einer Partei zutage. Gleichzeitig lassen sich auch grundsätzliche Einflussfaktoren auf die Themensetzung von Parteien identifizieren. So gelingt es neu entstehenden, vermeintlichen Ein-Themen- Parteien (Piratenpartei und AfD) einerseits, die Themen für jene parlamentarisch etablierten Parteien zu einem gewissen Grad „vorzugeben“, die ihnen bei der Wählerklientel vergleichsweise nahe stehen. Andererseits können besonders sogenannte Skandale dazu beitragen, dass ansonsten in Wahlkämpfen vermiedene Themen herausgestellt werden. So erlangte insbesondere durch den NSU-Skandal die Arbeit der Geheimdienste eine zuvor nicht gekannte Bedeutung für Policy-Positionen der Parteien. Allerdings zeigen sich solche bundesweit beachteten Skandale nicht notwendigerweise in allen Wahlprogrammen. Die NSU-Affäre schlug sich beispielsweise programmatisch nur regional begrenzt nieder.

Investitionen in die öffentliche Infrastruktur sind eine wesentliche Voraussetzung für die Sicherung der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit und die Schaffung von Wachstumspotentialen. Zwar besitzt Deutschland im internationalen Vergleich eine durchaus gute Infrastrukturausstattung. Allerdings fährt insbesondere die kommunale Infrastruktur seit Jahren auf Verschleiß. Das heißt, die Investitionen reichen nicht aus, den Werteverzehr der Infrastruktur auszugleichen, und Umfang und Modernität nehmen immer mehr ab. Damit der kommunale Investitionsstau zumindest nicht noch weiter zunimmt, ist ein rasches Umsteuern dringend erforderlich. Die Schaffung eines Sondervermögens beim Bund, mit dem Investitionen in finanzschwachen Kommunen gefördert werden sollen, war ein erster Schritt. Angesicht der Dimension des kommunalen Investitionsstaus in den finanzschwachen Kommunen dürfte dies aber nur ein Tropfen auf den heißen Stein sein. Während die Finanzlage der Kommunen insgesamt gut ist, verfestigt sich die Spaltung in finanzstarke und finanzschwache Gemeinden. Ein erster Schritt zu einem systematischen Lösungsansatz könnte darin bestehen, die Finanzschwäche der Kommunen stärker im Länderfinanzausgleich zu berücksichtigen und auf diese Weise zumindest die Länder in die Lage zu versetzen, die chronische Unterfinanzierung bestimmter Gemeindetypen ausgleichen zu können.
H76|Risk Assessment in Construction Process in Nuclear Sector within the Central and Eastern Europe|This article assesses various risks arising within the process of building, running and decommissioning of nuclear units with the Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) where nuclear power is still perceived as a reliable and widely utilized energy source. The region is specific for its relations with Russia which is a dominant provider of technologies and fuel thanks to former ties between the region and the Soviet Union. The debate on building new nuclear producing units with Russian companies as potential contractors is thus echoing old concerns about the rise of Russian influence and one-sided dependency. The main conclusions are twofold. First, financing is the key issue to be addressed in order to conduct a successful project with current electricity prices undermining any new project not only in the region but also in Europe as a whole. Second, precise formulation of project documentation is crucial to avoid hidden costs, delays and potential disputes with contractors.
H76|Behavioral Determinants of Russian Nuclear State-Owned Enterprises in Central and Eastern European Region|Rosatom State Nuclear Corporation play a substantial role in the energy sector of the Central and Eastern European (CEE) region and the behavioral characteristics of the company forms the basis of this article. Rosatom is positioned as the dominant provider of nuclear technology and fuel supplies to the region, in large part stemming from the Soviet legacy in CEE countries. Compounding this challenge, nuclear energy is one of the major sources of power generation in CEE. Given the long-time, near monopoly of Russian nuclear technology/design in the region and plans to expand further the nuclear capacity of select CEE countries, the sector requires careful monitoring from both a technical and security-minded perspective.
H76|Urban Crime|We survey the literature on index crime, paying particular attention to spatial issues. We note the contrasting descriptive traditions of Lombroso (characteristics matter) and Beccaria (incentives matter), and the contrasting policy traditions of incapacitation (predict who will offend and keep them from doing it) and deterrence (uncover who offended and punish them). The economics of crime has several points of contact with the economics of space, since the commission of an index crime requires proximity between offenders and victims (or their property). We explore these linkages, as well as a range of other issues: the effects of certainty and severity of punishment on crime; the role of stereotypes in interactions between offenders, victims, and law enforcement officers; and racial disparities in victimization, offending, and incarceration. The economics of crime has made tremendous progress, but enormous variation across both time and space remains poorly understood, and many nontraditional explanations often neglected by economists need to be explored more systematically.
H76|Past And Potential Roles Of Electricity System Operators: From Liberalisation To Climate Change Management In Britain|This paper discusses the changing role of electricity system operators in Britain. Until 2008, the UK electricity system operator was the key co-ordinator for a liberalized electricity generation market. However, since 2008, the British electricity system operator has, under the Energy Market Reform, primarily become a delivery agency for technology-specific generation within a planned electricity system. This paper discusses the transformation in the role of the British electricity system operator since 2008 and analyses the relationship between this change and the development of EU energy and climate change policy. The paper concludes with a discussion of the alternative views of the EU energy policy – the EU Commission has been proposing much increased interconnection to encourage multi-country regional markets, linking those markets into a Single European Electricity Market. Conversely, the UK, Germany and some other Member States have been promoting their national markets based on large-scale investment on national renewables with sizeable budgetary subsidies, supported by capacity payments. The role of the national electricity system operator is central to this debate with its functions very different in the two models.
H76|Sustainable development as an opportunity for innovation in the management model of public organisations|The literature recognises the great influence that environmental spending exerts on implementing LA21. But some authors raise doubts about the firm commitment of local government. Thus the main objective of this paper is to verify the authenticity of political commitment towards meeting the objectives of sustainable development by means of the budgetary support to these policies. To accomplish this verification, we apply the Difference in Differences technique for the period 2002-2012 in the Spanish municipalities. Results obtained confirmed the initial hypothesis and show that local governments that adhered to LA21 increased their environmental expenses to a greater degree.

H76|Acquisition Management In Public Institutions On Higher Education Of Mexico, Gestion De Las Adquisiciones En Las Instituciones Publicas De Educacion Superior De Mexico|This paper describes the acquisition management of goods and services effects by Mexican higher education institutions. The study methodology is based on documental compilation from requirements of the legal framework established regarding this topic. The analysis was performed using the thematic analysis technique, which belongs to analysis of content. The empirical results show that, in Mexico, higher education institutions, which buy, sell or lease any goods or services, must adopt established procedures in laws and regulations. These regulations and laws are: Public bidding procedure, Invitation for at least three persons and direct adjudication. This research contributes to the construction of a theoretical reference framework on procurement procedures for goods and services used by the Mexican public universities
H76|Direct Democracy, Partial Decentralization and Voter Information: Evidence from Swiss Municipalities|In this paper I investigate whether changes in the availability of direct democratic institutions in local Swiss jurisdictions affect expenditure decentralization. By using a panel-based difference in differences estimation I find a statistically significant reduction in decentralization when the mandatory fiscal referendum is introduced at the local level. This result is consistent with the proposed theoretical framework. Direct democracy increases citizens' awareness of governments' behaviour which eventually affects politicians' electoral incentives. When officials from two different levels of government share the responsibility for the provision of public goods, they find it convenient for electoral purposes to favor expenditures where citizens have the lowest control over government actions.
H76|Shale Public Finance: Local Government Revenues and Costs Associated with Oil and Gas Development|Oil and gas development associated with shale resources has increased substantially in the United States, with important implications for local governments. These governments tend to experience increased revenue from a variety of sources, such as severance taxes distributed by the state government, local property taxes and sales taxes, direct payments from oil and gas companies, and in-kind contributions from those companies. Local governments also tend to face increased demand for services such as road repairs due to heavy truck traffic and from population growth associated with the oil and gas sector. This paper describes the major oil- and gas related revenues and service demands (i.e., costs) that county and municipal governments have experienced in Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, Montana, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wyoming. Based on extensive interviews with officials in the most heavily affected parts of these states, along with analysis of financial data, it appears that most county and municipal governments have experienced net financial benefits, though some in western North Dakota and eastern Montana appear to have experienced net negative fiscal impacts. Some municipalities in rural Colorado and Wyoming also struggled to manage fiscal impacts during recent oil and gas booms, though these challenges faded as drilling activity slowed.
H76|Nepal's Fiscal Federalism Model in the New Constitution: Agenda for Amendments|The first Constituent Assembly (CA) was dissolved without producing the constitution. The Constitution of Nepal as Federal Democratic Republic was promulgated on September 20, 2015 by the second CA. The primary objective of this study is to review the modality presented in the new constitution on the natural resources, economic rights and revenue allocation and recommend some amendments. The study finds that the fiscal decentralization initiatives have not been successful in minimizing the political, social, economic, regional and ethnic inequalities inherent for nearly 240 years of a unitary system of governance in Nepal. The study recommends: VAT and income taxes will have to be collected concurrently at both the central and sub-national levels. Other taxes including excise duties will have to be collected by the sub-national governments which will support the expenditure responsibilities of the sub-national governments adequately in federal Nepal. Intergovernmental transfer modality has to be included in the constitution. A Federal Finance Commission (FFC) and the National Planning Commission will have to be constituted at the central level to make national level development plans and to make recommendations for additional grants and loans. A State Planning Commission (SPC) and a State Finance Commission can be established in each state to prepare state development plans and to deal with the transfers to be made to local bodies.
H76|Juvenile Incarceration, Human Capital, and Future Crime: Evidence from Randomly Assigned Judges|Over 130,000 juveniles are detained in the United States each year with 70,000 in detention on any given day, yet little is known about whether such a penalty deters future crime or interrupts social and human capital formation in a way that increases the likelihood of later criminal behavior. This article uses the incarceration tendency of randomly assigned judges as an instrumental variable to estimate causal effects of juvenile incarceration on high school completion and adult recidivism. Estimates based on over 35,000 juvenile offenders over a 10-year period from a large urban county in the United States suggest that juvenile incarceration results in substantially lower high school completion rates and higher adult incarceration rates, including for violent crimes. In an attempt to understand the large effects, we found that incarceration for this population could be very disruptive, greatly reducing the likelihood of ever returning to school and, for those who do return, significantly increasing the likelihood of being classified as having an emotional or behavioral disorder.

H76|The ERDF Contribution to the Development of the Social and Educational Infrastructure, as well as to the Reduction of Local Disparities in Cluj, Brasov, Vaslui and Giurgiu Counties in the Period 2007-2013|The long term objective of the regional development policy at European level is to reduce regional disparities. Aiming to bring its own contribution, Romania differentially allocated amounts from ERDF and from the State budget for the less developed regions. This however was not reflected in the counties, the local authorities having a low financial and technical capacity, which was decisive in accessing funds, the counties with higher total or own income being those that have managed to attract more funds. The paper presents the situation of the utilisation of ERDF and of the national funds related to 4 counties, 2 of the most developed, Cluj and Brasov and 2 of the least developed, Vaslui and Giurgiu, in order to improve the educational and social infrastructure.
H76|The modern challenges of regional development and socio-economic potential of town districts belonging to North macro-region of Poland|Today, however, the concept of capital strongly focuses on intellectual capital, understood as the current or potential creative resource, or the increase in the wealth of a community. In this context, it is worth to examine the legitimacy of thesis about the expansive reality of Polish town distritcs. Over the past 10 years, in North macro-region, there has been a significant improvement of characteristics relating to intellectual capital. At the same time, gross domestic product per capita in the macro-region annually increased its value. It is, therefore, necessary to maintain and multiply the rate of change in the socio-economic sphere, based on a coherent, harmonious and innovative development strategies, evaluating intellectual potential of the communities.
H76|Análisis de la relación entre la capacidad administrativa y la transparencia en gobiernos locales en México|Uno de los principales atributos de la gobernanza es la transparencia en las cuentas públicas (Kim, 2007); es por ello que en México el tema de la transparencia ha estado presente en las agendas públicas, sin embargo, los resultados no han sido los esperados. El objetivo de este trabajo es determinar la relación que existe entre la capacidad administrativa y la transparencia en los municipios de Yucatán, estado de México. Los resultados comprueban que sí existe una relación significativa, alta y positiva, entre estas dos variables, por lo que se confirma la necesidad de llevar a cabo acciones que fortalezcan las capacidades administrativas locales para lograr las metas planeadas.
H76|The privatisation of urban water services: theory and empirical evidence in the case of Spain|Following the wave of deregulation and privatisation of public firms that started in Anglo-Saxon economies in the late 1970s, most industrialised countries changed their laws to encourage the contracting out of local services. Accordingly, in 1985 many Spanish municipalities began to privatise their urban water services. However, three decades after the first privatisations took place, and against a backdrop of increasing opposition to new privatisations, several municipalities are now returning to the public provision of these services. In this context, after establishing a theoretical framework for privatisation, this paper goes on to describe the main features of the process of privatisation of urban water services in Spain, as well as recent trends towards remunicipalisation. With no clear empirical evidence as to whether public or private management of urban water services is better, this ongoing debate is set to continue and will be strongly influenced by prevailing ideological trends as well as other environmental factors.
H76|Decentralized Urbanization Policies And Regional Development: Experience Of Turkey|Today, while the dynamics of globalization are observed in almost every area of life, some changes; which are sometimes in the opposite and sometimes the same direction, but somehow interrelated; are faced. In that process, approaches some approaches seeing centralized policies and structures inadequate for solving some of the problems except for certain areas, have begun to come up. The proportional change on the urban and rural population that was created by the immigrations, which have gone along with the industrialization, has consistently improved in favour of the city, and eventually has paved the way for negative consequences such as the clutter of that population on some specific points.Some countries, which adopted liberal policies, have refused to interfere with the natural development of the urbanization process and have expected such rapid urbanization to reach equilibrium after a period. However, that rapid urbanization, which is limited to certain centres and leads to regional and urban imbalances, has pushed many counties to take various measures and to create new policies for struggling against it. First, some efforts were made for improving the living conditions of rural areas and creating new opportunities in order to stop migration that is the main reason for this and to keep the rural population in their villages and even to bring the immigrants back. Some countries have had the expectation of benefits for the development of the whole country, from directing the population to some major city centres. That ultimately has led to certain social and cultural problems. On the other hand, for eliminating those social, cultural and economical problems, some countries have applied decentralized urbanization policies, which were expected to end the regional imbalances, by preventing the population and urbanization from being directed to some specific centres, in the aim of spreading that evenly throughout the country.In this study, first, the concepts of urbanization and regional development will be dealt. Urbanization policies that have been developed by scholars and been implemented in different countries, will be discussed. Strategies, which provide regional development taking the advantage of different policies and especially the investment policies, for eliminating disparities between regions, will be specified. Then, the idea of decentralization in urban and regional development will be focused. And in the last section, decentralised urbanization and regional development policies, which have been applied and are being applied in Turkey, will be discussed.
H76|Wieviel Verwaltung benötigt der Bürger?|An important element for measuring the efficiency of public administration is the demand for the number of staff. There are different economic methods to measure the demand. Typically, the determinations are based on the per capita staff. However, the scientific literature documents the insufficiency of per capita based determinations. This paper presents more necessary aspects for measuring the efficiency of public administrations. Besides the measuring of efficiency, the German financial equalization systems also consider differences by the per capita administration staff and deduce additional financial demand. So the German financial equalization systems integrates these additional financial demand by ‘upgrading’ the local population and increases the financial compensation in these upgraded regions. However, the existence and specific amount of the additional demands are discussed very controversially. The German Federal Constitutional Court authorizes the additional financial demand only for duty tasks of public expenditures. Therefore, in the municipal administration there is a need to differentiate between the total number of staff and the number of staff in core administration. The core administration operates only duty tasks of the municipality. Nevertheless, there are a lot of difficulties for interregional comparisons between the German States caused by a missing definition for the core administration. This paper eliminates this deficit by an analysis of 184 municipal staff appointment schemes and selects the core administration for these municipalities. The empirical estimations present highly significant influence of the settlement structure and other determinants for the per capita number of staff and the per capita staff expenditures. Inter alia overhead costs are noticed which cause temporary additional financial demands. A recognition of these additional financial demands in the public administration are still missed in the German financial equalization system and the measuring of efficiency.

H76|Does Public Transit reduce Car Travel Externalities?|One of the main unanswered questions in the field of urban economics is to which extent subsidies to public transit are justified. We examine one of the main benefits of public transit, a reduction in car congestion externalities, the so-called congestion relief benefit, using quasi-natural experimental data on citywide public transit strikes for Rotterdam. On weekdays, a strike induces car speed to decrease only marginally on the highway ring road (by 3 percent) but substantially on inner city roads (by 10 percent). During rush hour, the strike effect is much more pronounced. The congestion relief benefit is substantial, equivalent to about half of the public transit subsidy. We demonstrate that during weekends, car speed does not change noticeable due to strikes. Further, we show that public transit strikes induce similar increases in number of cyclists as number of car travelers suggesting that bicycling-promoting policies to reduce car congestion externalities might be attractive.

H76|Organizing for Emergencies - Issues in Wildfire Fighting in Croatia|Croatia's accession to the European Union implies inevitable changes in the national emergency management system. New requirements for adjustment in accordance with the EU standards and practices also apply to the fire-services organization. Harmonious functioning of a large number of relatively autonomous organizations related to the National Protection and Rescue Directorate necessitates clear decision-making authority and coordination mechanisms as well as a high level of interoperability and core competencies development. This paper gives an overview of the Croatian fire protection organization along with its accompanying legislation, followed by an analysis of identified problems, especially those concerning fighting of wildfire. In our research a survey questionnaire comprised of Likert-scale items was used to assess the attitudes and experiences of trained fire department members. The respondents reported a relatively low evaluation of effectiveness and appropriateness of the following key fire service attributes: organizational structure, legislation and firefighting logistics support. From the obtained results guidelines can be drawn for possible redesign of the emergency management organization, especially those concerning the fire protection service.
H76|Subways, Strikes, and Slowdowns: The Impacts of Public Transit on Traffic Congestion|Public transit accounts for 1 percent of U.S. passenger miles traveled but attracts strong public support. Using a simple choice model, we predict that transit riders are likely to be individuals who commute along routes with severe roadway delays. These individuals' choices thus have high marginal impacts on congestion. We test this prediction with data from a strike in 2003 by Los Angeles transit workers. Estimating a regression discontinuity design, we find that average highway delay increases 47 percent when transit service ceases. We find that the net benefits of transit systems appear to be much larger than previously believed.
H76|Beaches, Sunshine, and Public Sector Pay: Theory and Evidence on Amenities and Rent Extraction by Government Workers|Rent extraction by public sector workers may be limited by the ability of taxpayers to vote with their feet. But rent extraction may be higher in regions where high amenities mute the migration response. This paper develops a theoretical model that predicts such a link between public sector wage differentials and local amenities, and the predictions are tested by analyzing variation in these differentials and amenities across states. Public sector wage differentials are, in fact, larger in the presence of high amenities, with the effect stronger for unionized public sector workers, whose political power may allow greater scope for rent extraction.
H76|Life and Death in the Fast Lane: Police Enforcement and Traffic Fatalities|Simultaneity complicates the estimation of the causal effect of police on crime. We overcome this obstacle by focusing on a mass layoff of Oregon State Police in February of 2003. Due solely to budget cuts, 35 percent of the roadway troopers were laid off, which dramatically reduced citations. The subsequent decrease in enforcement is associated with a significant increase in injuries and fatalities. The effects are similar using control groups chosen either geographically or through data-driven methods. Our estimates suggest that a highway fatality can be prevented with $309,000 of expenditures on state police.

This article reviews the water and sewer infrastructure projects funded in the state of Oklahoma between 1990 and 2000 and evaluates their impact on different measures of economic growth over both the short (one to 10 years) and long (10 to 20 years) term. Evaluation techniques include multivariate regression and average treatment effects. Results suggest that although most economic growth measures (population, income levels, and poverty levels) are not impacted by the program, housing values do show a statistically significant increase in communities receiving water or sewer infrastructure funding over the long term.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

H76|Commercial Revitalization In Low-Income Urban Communities: The Holdup Problem And Urban Development Policy|" type=""main"" xml:lang=""en""> A commercial development model, based on Fujita's monopolistic competition model of spatial agglomeration, addresses firms' decisions to enter urban communities. The model focuses on commercial developers and large department stores, and identifies a potential holdup problem in the commercial development market arising because developers incur costs before negotiating with anchor tenants over profit sharing; the holdup problem is more likely to occur in low-income communities where the profitability of commercial projects is small. The model predicts that direct incentives to developers are preferred to general tax incentives for addressing this market failure. (JEL R58, H50, H76)"
H76|The Location of US States' Overseas Offices| Forty US states operated an overseas office in 2002. Treating overseas offices as sales offices, the model assumes offices facilitate exports by reducing the transaction cost of selling abroad. From theory, states operate an office if aggregate savings outweigh operating costs. Exploiting the differences in where states locate offices in the data, and controlling for aggregate characteristics, the paper estimates the impact of exports on the probability of an office existing. In addition, the average state savings from an office is 0.04–0.10% of exports, with a cut-off threshold of US$850 million.
H76|Implementación de las Políticas de Desarrollo Productivo en Colombia: Una Visión desde las Regiones|En este documento se hace un análisis de la implementación de las Políticas de Desarrollo Productivo (PDP) del gobierno central a nivel regional en Colombia y se estudia en detalle la experiencia de un par de departamentos, uno con una experiencia económica positiva y otro con una experiencia negativa. Nuestro análisis muestra que la percepción en las regiones es que las PDP son diseñadas desde el gobierno central sin tener en cuenta sus necesidades. No obstante, las regiones pueden aprovechar estas políticas si logran una mejor organización interna de sus actores públicos y privados. Nuestro análisis identifica tensiones institucionales y políticas que complican la implementación regional de las PDP. También identifica la falta de incentivos de los departamentos para consolidar las Comisiones Regionales de Competitividad y para poner en marcha sus respectivos planes de competitividad. Algunas recomendaciones son sugeridas.
H76|Evaluación institucional y de procesos con énfasis en el ciclo de proyectos del Sistema General de Regalías|En 2011 a través de la creación del Sistema General de Regalías –SGR- se modificó la manera como se distribuyen los recursos de regalías en Colombia, permitiendo que participaran de manera equitativa todas las entidades territoriales del país. Después de varios años de entrada en vigencia de este nuevo sistema es necesario evaluar su diseño, gestión e implementación y su capacidad para el cumplimiento de los objetivos propuestos. Este documento evalúa la institucionalidad y los procesos del nuevo sistema, con un particular énfasis sobre el ciclo de proyectos. La evaluación se desarrolló a través de la recolección y análisis de información primaria y secundaria, de carácter cualitativo y cuantitativo, incluyendo un extenso trabajo de campo en ocho departamentos del país. La evaluación concluye que el esquema general planteado sigue un modelo institucional que supera el funcionamiento del sistema anterior, sin embargo advierte que el modelo es vulnerable al mal funcionamiento de sus eslabones los cuales en muchas ocasiones trascienden al SGR.
H76|Electoral politics and regional development: assessing the geographical allocation of public investment in Turkey|One of the most important decisions that governments face is how to allocate the public resources necessary for development, given each country’s budget constraints. According to the literature on the links between wealth and institutional performance, highly kleptocratic countries are expected to show higher levels of politicisation of the public purse. The article tests the extent to which socioeconomic criteria (equity and efficiency) or electoral concerns determined the geographical distribution of public investment in the 81 provinces of Turkey between 2004 and 2012. Our results show that, although electoral concerns mattered for the allocation, socioeconomic measures remained the most relevant predictors of investment. Moreover, in contrast to official regional development policy principles, the Turkish state tended to favour areas with a higher level of development over those with greater ‘socioeconomic need’. Our results therefore challenge much of the distributive politics literature, which has overly emphasised the role of pork-barrel in public policy-making. At the same time, they underline the need of paying more attention to the political economy of regional development strategies.
H76|Mutual influence across routes using a common airport: The case of the domestic market in Japan|This paper empirically investigates the mutual influence of traffic volumes across routes serving the same airport. Regression analysis using the data on Japan's domestic air transport market reveals that an increase in passengers on a given route has a positive effect on the number of passengers on other routes that share an endpoint airport with the given route. This result implies that a change in policy for an airport is likely to influence routes that do not serve that airport as well as the routes that do.
H76|Public provision vs. outsourcing of cultural services: Evidence from Italian cities|Cultural policy often implies the transfer of public resources to cultural institutions. In this contribution we focus on the determinants of a government's choice between subsidies to external cultural organizations and in-house cultural production. We argue that the determinants of grants in the cultural field may be the same as those of outsourced services, and we make reference to the empirical literature on the drivers of public services outsourcing. We consider Italian cities' cultural policies in the 1998–2008 period, a time when overall cultural expenditure shrank while cultural transfers increased. Using dynamic panel data analysis and controlling for specific economic, fiscal, and political characteristics of each city, we find that transfers to cultural organizations are negatively affected by asset specificity and more likely to occur in cities subject to fiscal stress. The results also highlight that the timing of elections plays a role.
H76|The reform of passenger rail in Switzerland: More performance without competition|The Swiss railway system is known for its high quality of service and integration in a particularly dense public transport system. People are generally less aware of ongoing institutional reform. This article strives to shed light on passenger transport reform, and more particularly on regional traffic. Which institutional frameworks are implicated? What have been the results obtained both for public finances and for travelers? What are the key elements for explaining recorded performance gains? What lessons could be drawn for railway reform? In summary, it appears that improved performance has been possible in Switzerland even in the absence of competition. These improvements are due to the nature of public governance and its impact on the various stakeholders. Public authorities have imposed ambitious but negotiated targets on operators, coupled with severe financial constraints, in a context of decentralization of public procurement. Given this new institutional framework, railway companies and especially the former state-owned railway, the national incumbent SBB have achieved significant productivity increases through management and technical innovation. Client satisfaction, at the heart of the reform, also contributes to these successes.
H76|Administrative Overspending in Indonesian Districts: The Role of Local Politics|We analyze the determinants of the excessive administrative spending of local governments in Indonesia. In an unbalanced panel data set of 399 districts for 2001–09, we show that the proliferation of districts has not led to increased administrative spending; instead a lack of political accountability is responsible for this excess. The degree of political competition influences the level of administrative spending significantly; newly introduced direct elections of district heads, however, did not curtail the waste.
H76|Bureaucratic Delay, Local-Level Monitoring, and Delivery of Small Infrastructure Projects: Evidence from a Field Experiment in Bolivia|Decentralization of public services to local governments and community participation in the monitoring of the delivery is now regarded as the key to improved public service delivery in developing countries. This paper examines bureaucratic delay within the allocation of small infrastructure projects in Bolivia, and it presents a randomized field experiment designed to improve public service delivery by promoting voice, transparency, and accountability among grassroots organizations. The findings of this paper suggest that monitoring tools designed to promote transparency and access to information by grassroots organizations might play an important role in improving public service delivery outcomes.
H76|CO2 emissions and value added change: assessing the trade-off through the macro multiplier approach|Recently, political and scientific debate is strongly focused on issues questioning the economic sustainability of environmental policies at regional level. Following European directives and protocols and in accordance with the principles of sustainable development, the interventions designed by policy makers are required to aim at restructuring the final emissions. In this paper an effort is made to assess a new structure for the final demand which would be able to achieve a composite task: the economic sustainability and the environmental improvement. In this respect, the regional Social Accounting Matrix (SAM), referred to a typical region of the Mediterranean area, the Sardinia, will be integrated with the environmental accounting scheme in order to develop the regional multisectoral extended model. The resulting inverse matrix will be used to identify which composition of the final demand (policy control variable) is consistent with the complex emissions together with a positive variation of the aggregate total output (policy target variable). For this purpose the Macro Multipliers approach, through the use of a bidimensional decision-making index, will allow us to identify the convenient structures for both economic and environmental target and assessing the expected negative trade-off.

H76|Is Disaster Risk Reduction Spending Driven by the Occurrence of Natural Disasters? Evidence from Peru|This paper studies the allocation of total disaster risk reduction public spending among regions in Peru. The main objective of this work is to identify the main determinants of the distribution of these resources, and for this purpose an index of historical physical impacts of natural disasters, social vulnerability, and institutional capacity was created. It is found that historical impacts of climatological disasters are positively correlated with the per capita amount received by region in order to prevent future natural disasters. Impacts of geological disaster, on the other hand, affect the amount of executed and budgeted resources used to cope with the effects of past disasters. The prevention expenditure is mainly driven by climatological effects on the agriculture sector. Additionally, results confirm that higher social vulnerability is a main determinant of the distribution of prevention spending but conditioned on being affected by climatological disasters. Institutional capacity seems to define only the amount of recovery expenditure, positively for regions more seriously affected by geological disasters and negatively for regions devastated by climatological disasters.
H76|The local government of Tuscany. A review of 2013|Because of the instability of the present economic phase and the undecidedness of politics in facing it, it is difficult to attentively track the continual evolution of public financial regulations and procedures. However, the progression of the crisis – on the one hand – and the bundle of regulations – on the other – are increasingly changing the modus operandi of the public actor and his relationships with firms, families and territories. The long-run effect of too strict measures (such as the Internal Stability Pact or the block of turnover), accompanied, from time to time, by exceptional interventions (like the abolition of the Municipal property tax on first homes, or the payment of public administration debts) only increased the distance between citizenship and administration, sharpening the conflict between a growing demand for services and an unbearable fiscal burden. Presently, the country has still no comprehensive framework of reforms, while its public administration system is deprived of financial and human resources and brought into the disrepute – often out of simplist evaluations – of public opinion. This report is composed of short monographs on cross-sections of public administration and offers a concise reading of the changes afoot in the different areas of public interventions. The figures for Tuscany, a region traditionally having a good supply of services and presenting a virtuous integration of the public and the private spheres, provide many cues for thinking about the processes of sectoral reform that have been started and never completed, as well as the impacts of public actions on territories and the corresponding replies of administrations.
H76|Factors Influencing the Selection of Waste Collection Companies by Municipalities – Are Municipal Decision Effective?|This paper is based on an analysis of factors influencing the selection of waste collection companies by municipal authorities in selected municipalities in the Czech Republic, and their impact on the cost efficiency of current municipal expenditures. The aim of this paper is analysing the factors influencing the choice of waste management company and the influence of these factors on the decision making process, and discussing the relation of these factors to the cost efficiency of municipal waste management. The first part of this paper is focused on the factors influencing the choice of waste management company and the influence of these factors on the decision making process, and discusses the relation of these factors to the cost efficiency of municipal waste management. In the other part of this paper we focus our attention on the form of ownership (public and private companies) and strength of competition as two key factors which are frequently mentioned in many foreign research papers and which influence the importance of other factors. The study uses a quantitative approach to investigate the research questions and analyses original collected qualitative survey data obtained during our own research. A survey was conducted for a selected local public service (waste management) in order to collect data about factors influencing the selection of waste collection companies by 115 municipalities in the Czech Republic. The results show that the most powerful factors that influence the selection of waste collection companies at municipalities in the Czech Republic are the price and the quality of services. It was also clearly shown that the significance of individual factors is related to the competitive environment. The level of significance of individual factors is directly proportional to the strength of the competitive environment.
H76|Revealing Malfeasance: How Local Media Facilitates Electoral Sanctioning of Mayors in Mexico|We estimate the effect of local media outlets on political accountability in Mexico, focusing on malfeasance by municipal mayors. We study federal grants earmarked for infrastructure projects targeting the poor, and leverage two sources of plausibly exogenous variation. First, we exploit variation in the timing of the release of municipal audit reports. Second, and moving beyond existing studies, we exploit variation in media exposure at the electoral precinct level. In particular, we compare neighboring precincts on the boundaries of media stations’ coverage areas to isolate the effects of an additional media station. We find that voters punish the party of malfeasant mayors, but only in electoral precincts covered by local media stations (which emit from within the precinct’s municipality). An additional local radio or television station reduces the vote share of an incumbent political party revealed to be corrupt by 1 percentage point, and reduces the vote share of an incumbent political party revealed to have diverted funds to projects not benefiting the poor by around 2 percentage points. We also show that these electoral sanctions persist: at the next election, the vote share of the current incumbent’s party continues to be reduced by a similar magnitude. The electoral costs of diverting resources away from the poor are especially large for the populist Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) party. However, we find no effect of media stations based in other municipalities.
H76|Privatization Myths in Russia and the Reality of Local Land Markets|The article analyzes the ratio of state and private forms of ownership of land and studies its local markets. The data collected as a result of field research of rural communities and also provided by real estate agencies allow to track the real growth of private property on land in municipalities. Studying the condition of local land markets at the level of rural communities one can make a number of unfavorable conclusions, such as growth of shadow sector and speculation in the prices of land plots within settlements. All these tendencies call into question the existing scenario of carrying out privatization in Russia.
H76|Energy And Climate Change. Nuclear, Pros And Cons|It’s needless to say that nuclear is a hot subject. It arouses public imagination, suspicion, and fear. It has always animated scientists’ minds and souls and after they discovered how to manipulate the atom, the public conscience has become aware of its dangers and its merits. Present paper aims to present why it is important to regard with optimism and trust the science of atoms, not without loosing our critical view concerning the risks inherently connected to it. Nuclear arms are a reality, but climate change is another. Mankind is facing both. It cannot ignore one of them without assuming greater risks in the future. In this context, nuclear can be regarded with hope and audacity. Its expansion, both in countries where it already is employed, and into newcomers (where it could be implemented), can bring benefits such as: reducing energy dependence on foreign interests placed under the umbrella of oil and gas producers, or transporters; rising energy security in a world where access to cheap and reliable energy would become more problematic; greater success in fighting climate changes and global warming through energy generated in a more environmentally friendly manner. Furthermore, over the energy aspect of peaceful nuclear energy, there is another economic and technological benefit: nuclear researches could be involved simultaneously in electricity generation, heat production, agricultural and industrial rising’s potential, water desalinization and providing in arid areas, and application in medical researches and treatment. But nuclear has its weak points: it is connected to military researches and programs, while offering the needed technical ground for UN Security Council permanent members to have and maintain prestige in international politics; it looms over mankind, as a menace which hunts our conscience after Hiroshima and Nagasaki… Its minuses have to do with international context, too: if we connect the highest level in technology with strongest religious sentiment than we can face a terrifying drama. A nuclear nuke in the hands of a terrorist organization is the worst nightmare mankind could face. Countries with nuclear arms (Russian Federation and Pakistan) were courted by dangerous organizations, which searched to gain access to fissile material. But there is a hope, and the paper presents it in an indirect manner: if public conscience activates in direction of nuclear disarmament, nuclear could become the hope for a better future. Nuclear disarmament would mean a safer world, while peaceful nuclear expansion will mean cleaner energy and greater access to electricity in more areas, all of them creating a better world and a civilization proud of its name.
H76|La coordinación intra e intergubernamental para enfrentar al crimen organizado en México<BR>[The intra and intergovernmental coordination to confront organized crime in Mexico]|Organized crime´s actions are a complex problem that requires an equally complex governmental policy. This policy requires coordination within the federal government and between the federal and subnational governments. The article starts questioning how to integrate the federal and subnational governments in to a complex strategy in order to face organized crime? To answer, federal government´s strategy is analyzed, discussing its impact on the subnational governments. Its main contribution is the discussion of strategic intelligence for the states´ and the discussion of different obstacles to foster organizational change.
H76|Enabling and Integrative Infrastructure Policy: The Role of Inverse Infrastructures in Local Infrastructure Provision with Special Reference to Finnish Water Cooperatives|Infrastructures are necessary to support the functionality of urban communities. Globalization, increased polycentricity, new trends in governance and tightening public budgets have increased interest in alternative ways of providing such infrastructures. One product of this trend is the ‘inverse infrastructure,’ which refers to a modularized, semi-autonomous and user-driven infrastructure that is a result of the self-organization of local actors. In this study, we discuss the nature of such infrastructures and the challenges they pose to local infrastructure policy with special reference to the case of water cooperatives in Finland. Our conclusion is that inverse infrastructures have a potential to contribute to local infrastructure services either as cost-effective alternative or as supplement to large technical systems. Their full utilization requires, however, enabling and integrative infrastructure policy.
H76|Un modelo para el sistema de pensiones en el Perú: Diagnóstico y recomendaciones|Este documento desarrolla un modelo para el sistema de pensiones peruano con el fin de estudiar los probables efectos sobre distintos segmentos de la población de la reforma del Sistema Privado de Pensiones (SPP) peruano implementado en el año 2012. Se realizan además diversos experimentos con la finalidad de capturar los probables efectos de algunas medidas adicionales complementarias a las que esta reforma incorpora. En el escenario base proyectado hasta el año 2050, se encuentra que si bien el número de cotizantes se duplica, las tasas de cobertura laboral (en términos de cotizantes regulares) continuarían siendo bajas. Entre otros factores, ello es el reflejo del alto grado de informalidad del mercado laboral peruano. Se concluye que además de las reformas implementadas en el año 2012, se requerirían de medidas adicionales enfocadas primordialmente a los trabajadores de la microempresa y los colectivos jóvenes. Todo ello con el propósito de conseguir un sistema de pensiones más inclusivo.
H76|Responsibility with accountability: A FAIR governance framework for performance accountability of local governments|This paper focuses on the role of local governments in bringing about fair, accountable, incoorruptible and responsive (FAIR) governance. Local governments around the world have done important innovations to earn the trust of their residents and their comparative performance is of great interest yet a comprehensive framework to provide such benchmarking is not available. This paper attempts to fill this void, by developing a general framework for performance accountability of local governments and by relating real world practices to aspects of this framework. The proposed rating framework requires several types of assessments: (a) their compliance with due process and law; (b) monitoring of fiscal health for sustainability; (c) monitoring of service delivery ; and (d) citizens’ satisfaction with local services. The approach yields key indicators useful for benchmarking performance that can be used in selfevaluation and improvement of performance. t From an analysis of practices in local government performance monitoring and evaluation, the paper concludes that ad hoc ad-on self standing monitoring and evaluation systems are more costly and less useful than built-in tools and mechanisms for government transparency, self–evaluation and citizen based accountability such as local government output budgeting and output based fiscal transfers to finance local services.
H76|Juventud y campesinado en las falanges rurales: España, 1939-50|This text joins the burgeoning series of studies into agrarian fascism and the local politics of fascist and parafascist dictatorships. Taking Franco's regime as a case study, our work focuses on the role played by two of the most outstanding structures of the single party or FET-JONS in rural post-war Spain: the Youth Front (Frente de Juventudes) and the Trade Union Organisation (Organización Sindical). Their evolution and problems during the 1940s are analysed here, including the real level of social penetration, the sociological profile of their leaders, members and affiliates, as well as their capacity to implement specific policies in rural contexts. Though already well-studied in the urban sphere, greater attention should be given to the actions of FET-JONS in rural Spain, as post-war society was predominantly agricultural. Moreover, Spanish youth and peasants are two collectives that have yet to receive much attention in historiography examining Franco's regime.
H76|Local Administration Systems and Local Democracy Perception|Institutions which are subunits of a government or regional administration and authorized as defining limited number of public policies in relatively small area and implicating these policies are defined as public institutions and local administrations. The existence reasons of local administrations enforce some services which will be presented to public not by the government centre but by the public entities which are not included in centralized administration hierarchy and in centralized management organizations. There are two types of the term? decentralisation? which are governmental decentralisation and political decentralisation. If the authority transferred by centralized management is limited with legislation and to a certain degree with jurisdiction it is Political decentralisation which is special to federal states, if the authorities transferred by centralized management is limited only with enforcement it is governmental decentralisation. The first target to be reached in democracies is to make the public have rights in administration. The prior purpose in countries which has the tradition of democratic administration is to include the public in each step of administration and decision making. Public?s participation in administration process and public?s having rights in administration are easy is local administrations. In this direction, this study?s main subject will be local administration systems and the relation of systems with democratic administration.
H76|Valuing Public Investments to Support Bicycling|"We develop a framework for assessing the net benefits of investments to promote bicycling, which explicitly accounts for internal costs of bicycling. We apply our model to eight Swiss cities using data from the Swiss national travel survey and find that increasing the level of bicycling by reducing internal costs leads to inframarginal benefits that exceed the net benefits from the additional bicycling. We further find that Swiss cyclists only partially internalize health benefits, which affects the benefits from infrastructure investments but also implies that there is scope for ""soft"" measures that would inform users about health benefits of bicycling."
H76|On the definition of W in empirical models of yardstick competition|Theoretical models of strategic interaction between local governments are often implemented empirically using spatial econometric techniques. In order to empirically discriminate between different theoretical explanations for strategic interactions, it is important to ensure that the spatial weights matrix W reflects the theoretical mechanisms behind the interaction of interest. However, researchers do not usually have the information required to adequately define its elements in such a way. Here, we present a method for defining these elements that captures the interest of one jurisdiction’s inhabitants in the local politics of their neighboring jurisdictions even when this information is not directly available to the researcher. The method is suitable for use in empirical models of strategic interaction between local jurisdictions and can be used to define spatial weights matrices for spatial econometric models that will be used to test or control for yardstick competition across jurisdictions.

H76|Municipal consolidation and local government behavior: evidence from Japanese voting data on merger referenda|The empirical literature investigating the role of key features of local governments regarding decisions on consolidation tends to use a dummy dependent variable that takes 1 if both adjacent local governments decide to merge and 0 if one of them does not approve consolidation. Under this estimation method, however, it is difficult to know which governments refused to consolidate, as consolidation was not realized. The current study empirically tests the effects of economies of scale, population size, heterogeneity of preferences, and financial factors on municipal preferences for consolidation. It uses voting data from Japanese local referenda to identify preferences of specific individual municipalities, thus allowing a richer examination of local government behavior. The results obtained herein are as follows. Municipalities that could enjoy large economies of scale from consolidation prefer consolidation, while large and small municipalities are likely to merge. Moreover, municipalities receiving large unconditional grants from the central government are unlikely to merge. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014
H76|The impact of science and technology parks on firms’ product innovation: empirical evidence from Spain|Science and Technology Parks (STP) have attracted considerable attention and public funds in recent years. However, the conclusions on their effectiveness remain mixed. This work evaluates the impact of STP on firm product innovation in the Spanish context, as an example of a less developed innovation system in which regional and national governments are prioritizing STP initiatives. This work draws on a large sample of firms provided by the Spanish Survey on Technological Innovation that is conducted annually by the National Statistical Institute. We explore alternative econometric methods to obtain average treatment effects for firms located in 22 Spanish STPs. Our results show that Spanish STPs have a strong and positive impact on the probability and amount of product innovation achieved by STP located firms. These results hold when the endogeneity of STP location is taken into account. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014
H76|The Impact of City Contracting Set-Asides on Black Self-Employment and Employment|In the 1980s, many US cities initiated programs reserving a proportion of government contracts for minority-owned businesses. The staggered introduction of these set-aside programs is used to estimate their impacts on the self-employment and employment rates of African American men. Black business ownership rates increased significantly after program initiation, with the black-white gap falling 3 percentage points. The evidence that the racial gap in employment also fell is less clear as it depends on assumptions about the continuation of preexisting trends. The black gains were concentrated in industries heavily affected by set-asides, and they mostly benefited the better educated.
H76|Klimaschutz trotz knapper Kassen? Eine empirische Untersuchung zu Finanzierungsmodellen für Klimaschutzaktivitäten in Städten und Gemeinden|Kommunaler Klimaschutz gewinnt sowohl in den deutschen als auch in den europäi-schen Klimaschutzstrategien an Bedeutung, denn in den Kommunen findet sich ein großes THG-Minderungspotenzial, z.B. bei der Straßenbeleuchtung, in Schulen, Hallenbädern und Verwaltungsgebäuden. Dem gegenüber steht die angespannte Haushaltslage in vielen Kommunen, die wenig Raum für Investitionen lässt. Haben auch weniger gut situierte Kommunen die Möglichkeit, auf die Vermeidung von THG-Emissionen in ihrem Einflussbereich hinzuwirken? Diese Frage ist Gegenstand eines Gutachtens mit dem Titel Klimaschutz trotz knapper Kassen?, das im Auftrag des Bundesministeriums für Umwelt, Naturschutz und Reaktorsicherheit (BMU) erarbeitet wird und in dessen Rahmen der vorliegende Beitrag entstand. 76 Kommunen haben über einen Online-Fragebogen zur Finanzierung der von ihnen durchgeführten Klimaschutzmaßnahmen Auskunft gegeben. Ziel der Studie ist es aufzuzeigen, inwiefern Kommunen auch vor dem Hintergrund begrenzter finanzieller Mittel anhand passender Finanzierungsinstrumente Klimaschutzmaßnahmen durchführen können. Im Vorfeld der Befragung haben wir sechs Hypothesen formuliert, die dann anhand der empirisch gewonnenen Erkenntnisse überprüft werden. Die Ergebnisse legen nahe, dass die unterschiedlichen Finanzierungsinstrumente im Bereich Klimaschutz den befragten Kommunen weitestgehend bekannt sind. Der Bekanntheitsgrad umfasst hierbei sowohl Kenntnis als auch Nutzung des Instruments. Kommunen sind mit den von ihnen ausgewählten Finanzierungsinstrumenten in der Regel zufrieden. Die befragten Kommunen empfehlen für finanzschwache Kommunen insbesondere eine Finanzierung über Bürgerbeteiligungsgesellschaften und die Umsetzung nicht-investiver Maßnahmen. Contracting-Maßnahmen werden von den Kommunen als vergleichsweise kompliziert eingeschätzt, kritisch wird unter anderen der hohe Arbeitsaufwand vor Zustandekommen des Contractingvertrages betrachtet. Positive Wertschöpfungs- und Beschäftigungseffekte infolge der realisierten Projekte nimmt etwa die Hälfte bzw. ein Drittel der befragten Kommunen wahr.
H76|Deterrence and Geographical Externalities in Auto Theft|Understanding the degree of geographical crime displacement is crucial for the design of crime prevention policies. This paper documents changes in automobile theft risk that were generated by the plausibly exogenous introduction of Lojack, a highly effective stolen vehicle recovery device, into a number of new Ford car models in some Mexican states, but not others. Lojack-equipped vehicles in Lojack-coverage states experienced a 48 percent reduction in theft risk due to deterrence effects. However, 18 percent of the reduction in thefts was displaced toward unprotected Lojack models in non-Lojack states, providing new evidence of geographical crime displacement in auto theft.
H76|Incentive Schemes for Local Government: Theory and Evidence from Comprehensive Performance Assessment in England|This paper studies Comprehensive Performance Assessment, an explicit incentive scheme for local government in England. Motivated by a theoretical political agency model, we predict that CPA should increase service quality and local taxation, but have an ambiguous effect on the efficiency of service provision. We test these predictions using Welsh local governments as a control group: CPA increased the property tax, and our index of service quality, but had no significant effect on efficiency overall. There is evidence of a heterogenous effect of CPA: it impacted more on councils where electoral competition was initially weak, in line with our theory.
H76|State Gun Policy and Cross-State Externalities: Evidence from Crime Gun Tracing|This paper provides a theoretical and empirical analysis of crossstate externalities associated with gun regulations that impact gun trafficking. Using tracing data, which identify the source state for crime guns recovered in destination states, we find that firearms tend to flow from states with weak laws to states with strict laws, satisfying a key theoretical condition for the existence of externalities. We also find that gun flows are more significant between nearby states, suggesting that externalities are spatial in nature. Finally, we present evidence that criminal possession of guns is higher in states exposed to weak laws in nearby states.
H76|On the Performance of the U.S. Transportation System: Caution Ahead|Transportation is a vital sector of the U.S. economy based on consumers', firms', and government's enormous expenditures in money and time and on its effect on virtually all other sectors in the economy. I assess the performance of the transportation system and consider how it could be improved by analyzing whether the United States has the optimal mix of public and private provision. The empirical evidence indicates that our hugely important transportation system has been compromised by various government policies and the significant welfare costs motivate either vastly improving public provision or expanding the role of the private sector
H76|Evolución de las Cifras Fiscales entre 2007 y 2011. Gobiernos Centrales de las Principales Seis Ciudades Colombianas|Este artículo analiza la evolución entre 2007 y 2011, de las cifras fiscales de las seis ciudades con mayores ingresos en 2011 en Colombia: Bogotá, Medellín, Cali, Barranquilla, Cartagena y Bucaramanga. La ciudad que registró mayores progresos en términos de esfuerzo fiscal en el período analizado fue Barranquilla, seguida de Bucaramanga. Más recientemente, Cartagena también incrementó en forma destacable sus ingresos propios. Cuando se califica el desempeño fiscal con base en la magnitud del gasto por habitante que sea sostenible para las ciudades, Medellín se resalta en el primer lugar, seguida relativamente de cerca de Bogotá. Barranquilla y Cartagena vendrían después, con cierta distancia de las dos primeras; posteriormente Bucaramanga, y finalmente, y con un desempeño bastante pobre, Cali.
H76|Valuation of public investment to support bicycling (FV-09)|In this paper we develop a framework to value public investments with the purpose of increasing bicycling that explicitly accounts internal costs of bicycling, which are typically neglected in current established approaches that value bicycle spending by means of gross health benefits alone, as are inframarginal benefits to existing cyclists. By monetizing internal costs independent of health benefits, we can assess the degree of internalization of private benefits and/or the internalization of external benefits such as environmental improvements due to altruistic preferences by cyclists. Our framework further conceptualizes the complementarity between “hard” (investments in infrastructure) and “soft” measures (informational campaigns) in bicycle policy. Finally, we propose an empirical method for identifying internal costs using a latent variable approach and apply it to eight Swiss cities. Our results imply that Swiss cyclists internalize more than mortality-based benefits. However, because data for some important bicycle mode choice determinants are not available, our results cannot inform policy directly at the current stage. Instead, the contributions of our paper are the development of an economically consistent framework to value public bicycle investments and the identification of crucial data needs for the development of comprehensive assessments informing bicycle policy decisions.
H76|Local Energy Policy and Managing Low Carbon Transition: The Case of Leicester|This paper seeks to provide insights into the links between the local and national energy policy. Leicester City Council has sought to take a leadership role on implementing innovative energy policies within their city. consequently, this paper investigates the impact of national and local energy policy in Leicester. It examines the consumption of energy within city, the network of players within energy policy and two flagship aspects of the policy the district heating scheme and the use of smart metering. The paper concludes that energy policy looks very different at local and national levels.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H76|Labour’s Record on Neighbourhood Renewal in England: Policy, Spending and Outcomes 1997-2010|When he came to power in 1997, Tony Blair reacted to widening disparities between poorer and richer neighbourhoods by declaring that no one in future decades should be seriously disadvantaged by where they lived. This paper reviews the policies that Labour pursued and assesses how close it came to realising Blair's vision. It draws on speeches, policy documents, government website and evaluation reports, and on new analysis of administrative and survey data. We find that Labour's neighbourhood initial policy approach - the cross departmental National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal, with its 'floor targets' below which no neighbourhood should fall - was distinctive, although after 2007 there was a move away from this approach towards a narrower focus on economic regeneration, at large spatial scales, and on the reduction of worklessness. Evaluations report that the policies pursued represented value for money and there were trends towards positive outcomes. Physical environments and services got better during Labour's term in office - a direct result of the policies enacted. Gaps between poorer and richer areas also improved in many individual outcomes, although these cannot be so readily attributed to neighbourhood policy per se. All gaps remained large in 2010, suggesting that Blair's vision was not fully realised: which is, perhaps, not surprising in the context of sustained income inequalities.
H76|Aspects Of Decentralization In The Context Of Public Administration Reform|Public administration reform as a response to the requirements of socio-economic environment change, is a process that develops both at central and local level, aiming to an institutional framework achievement, suitable for administrative and financial decentralization, under the European Union standards. Public administration modernization assumes checking and changing all sides of statal organization this being the result of strengthening its capacity of public policies improvement towards the cohesion of territorial development accomplish.The study presents some particularities of decentralization in the context of administrative reform, the impulses for decentralization expansion, and, respectively, for development of local government, its impact on locally and nationally economic development
H76|Descentralización, Esfuerzo Fiscal y Progreso Social en Colombia en el Nivel Local, 1994-2009: ¿Por qué Importa la Política Nacional?|El presente documento explora la relación entre la competencia política y el adecuado suministro de bienes públicos en un contexto descentralizado con el fin de observar si la existencia de un mayor flujo de información, producto de la competencia política, así como la existencia de una mayor oferta de opciones políticas, hacen parte del mecanismo causal para una gobernabilidad efectiva. En particular, se estudia el efecto que tiene la competencia electoral sobre los incentivos a crear capacidad fiscal y suministrar bienes públicos como educación y acueducto, de los cuales son parcialmente responsables los gobiernos locales. La hipótesis de la investigación propone que la competencia política afecta de manera positiva la fortaleza de la descentralización del municipio, medida a través de la capacidad fiscal local. A su vez, la capacidad fiscal es el factor fundamental para explicar las diferencias en el desempeño de diversos sectores entre las diferentes administraciones locales. La capacidad fiscal trae consigo mejores resultados en la implementación de políticas públicas, así como una mejor capacidad de respuesta local frente a las necesidades –armonización–, lo cual se deriva en una mayor eficiencia en el gasto local. Utilizando datos panel a nivel municipal desde 1994 hasta 2009, se muestra que, a pesar de las diferencias entre los sectores analizados, los resultados en la implementación de las políticas públicas son mejor explicados por el propio esfuerzo fiscal de los municipios más que por otros recursos recibidos por estos, como lo son las transferencias del nivel central o las regalías.

H76|Indicadores del sector transporte en Colombia. Informe consolidado|Este documento es producto del Convenio entre Fedesarrollo y el Ministerio del Transporte. Tiene el propósito de definir una batería de indicadores del sector transporte que permita evaluar y hacer seguimiento al sector en Colombia. El ejercicio está motivado por los problemas de calidad que se han encontrado en las series de algunos de los indicadores. En particular, el trabajo de Fedesarrollo (2013) resalta los problemas en la medición de kilómetros de la red vial del país que presenta resultados variables que no son típicos. El estudio se divide en siete capítulos. Los dos primeros sientan las bases. El primero analiza la construcción del ciclo de la política pública en el país y el segundo los protocolos y procesos a través de los cuales se recoge la información y llega a convertirse en indicador. El tercer capítulo define una batería de indicadores prioritarios para medir con la periodicidad adecuada en el sector y el cuarto propone la creación del Instituto Colombiano de Transporte (ICT), el esquema de gobierno de datos mencionado. Los dos últimos capítulos presentan los primeros documentos para que el ICT funcione describiendo los temas donde se requiere de toma de decisiones. Específicamente, el sexto hace una revisión del estado de la infraestructura en el país con base en la información disponible en la actualidad. El último capítulo desarrolla cinco notas sobre indicadores clave en el sector, resalta las dificultades para su medición y propone decisiones que se deberían adoptar para mejorarlos.
H76|La integración de los sistemas de transporte urbano en Colombia: una reforma en transición|Este estudio busca contribuir al proceso de formación de la política de movilidad urbana en el país haciendo una revisión de la implementación de los SITM en Cali y las Áreas Metropolitanas de Bucaramanga, Barranquilla y Centro Occidente (Pereira) (en adelante se hablará indistintamente del área metropolitana y su ciudad principal). Para esto se describe qué son los sistemas integrados de transporte masivo y cuáles son los desafíos de su implementación. Luego, se muestra cómo se ha materializado la política de transporte urbano en Colombia y se señalan los principales retos de los SITM en las cuatro ciudades estudiadas. Por último, se hace una retroalimentación sobre la manera en la que los gobiernos (nacional y locales) deben enfrentar los retos de este proceso de transformación. Además de esta introducción, que se usa como resumen ejecutivo, el documento tiene cuatro capítulos, éstos profundizan en el diagnóstico y los desafíos de la implementación de los SITM, y en los caminos que deben tomarse para fortalecer el proceso.
H76|Does fiscal decentralization foster regional investment in productive infrastructure?|The aim of this paper is to analyze the effect of revenue decentralization on the provision of infrastructure at the sub-national level. We estimate the effects of revenue decentralization and earmarked grant financing on the level of sub-national infrastructure investment in 20 European countries over the period 1990–2009. The results are interpreted in light of the predictions of the theory on fiscal federalism. We find that it is sub-national infrastructure investment that increases after revenue decentralization and not investment in redistribution. However, the effect of revenue decentralization is lower the higher the use of earmarked grants to fund infrastructure investment.
H76|The lasting effects of crime: The relationship of discovered methamphetamine laboratories and home values|This study estimates a household's willingness to pay to avoid the stigma of crime while minimizing concerns of omitted variable bias. By assuming methamphetamine producers locate approximately at random within a narrowly defined neighborhood, this study is able to use hedonic estimation methods to estimate the impact of the discovery of a methamphetamine laboratory on the home values near that location. Specifically, the analysis designates those closest to the site as the treated, while those slightly farther away act as the comparison group. The discovery of a methamphetamine laboratory has a significant effect on the property values of those homes close to the location that peaks from 6 to 12months after each lab's discovery. The estimates found in this study range from a decrease in sale prices of 10% to 19% in the year following a laboratory's discovery compared to the prices for homes that are farther away but still in the same neighborhood.

H76|Are State Governments Roadblocks to Federal Stimulus? Evidence on the Flypaper Effect of Highway Grants in the 2009 Recovery Act|This paper examines how state governments adjusted spending in response to the large temporary increase in federal highway grants under the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). The mechanism used to apportion ARRA highway grants to states allows one to isolate exogenous changes in these grants. The results indicate that states increased highway spending over 2009 to 2011 more than dollar-for-dollar with the ARRA grants they received. Rent-seeking efforts are shown to help explain this result: states with more political contributions from the public works sector to the governor and state legislators tended to spend more out of their ARRA highway funds than other states.
H76|Political Business Cycles in Local Indonesia|We study political business cycles (PBC) in newly democratized and decentralized Indonesia at the local level. As the timing of indirect and later on direct elections of district heads differs exogenously across jurisdictions, the political business cycle effect is clearly identified. Our data allow distinguishing PBCs for indirect and direct elections. We find significant budget cycles for discretionary budget categories at the disposal of the district head (not for the overall budget) only for direct elections, not for indirect elections. These cycles are much larger if the incumbent runs for reelection. Our results underline the conditional nature of PBC.

H76|Municipal Consolidation and Local Government Behavior: Evidence from Japanese Voting Data on Merger Referenda|The empirical literature investigating the role of key features of local governments regarding decisions on consolidation tends to use a dummy that takes 1 if adjacent local governments decide to merge. Under the estimation method, it is difficult to identify which governments have no incentive to merge. The current study presents an empirical test of decision on consolidation using voting data from Japanese local referenda that distinctively identify the preferences of specific individual municipalities. I find evidence that municipalities that could enjoy large economies of scale from a merger prefer consolidation, and large and small municipalities are likely to merge.
H76|Evolution of the Public Safety and Security Mobile Networks|The emergency services which we all take for granted will in future need high speed mobile data transfer to deliver these services to the people who need them. There are, however, numerous obstacles to implementing high speed data functionalities for PSS (Public Safety and Security) organizations; the two main critical factors being the limited available spectrum to deliver these emergency services as well as the challenge of financing the necessary modifications to improve the current system. The study undertaken here seeks an answer to the question of how to meet the future needs of PSS organizations by devising a number of hypothetical scenarios for investigation. The contemporary mainstream technology, TETRA (Terrestrial Trunked Radio), is chosen as the scenario starting point when defining the roadmap of the future solutions. Using the scenario planning method, which is based upon the change forces identified, four future scenarios are defined, the timescale being the next ten year period up until 2022. According to the scenarios defined, alternative strategies for network operators are proposed. The following conclusions have been drawn: (1) emergency services need a dedicated network, the commercial BB (broadband) cellular network is, nevertheless, a feasible solution for non-critical data transmission; (2) the radio spectrum needs to be allocated for WB (wideband) in the
H76|Municipal elections and cultural expenditure|The aim of this paper is to analyze the effect of electoral timing on municipal public cultural spending. We use a panel sample of all municipalities from the Spanish Region of Murcia for 1995–2008. Our results reveal that mayors adopt an opportunistic behavior, increasing cultural spending in the election year and reducing it in the second year after the election. We also investigate whether the electoral cycle in cultural spending is influenced by mayors’ ideology, political strength, willingness to run for re-election, and electoral competitiveness. In this regard, our study shows that when mayors expect close elections, political budget cycles’ size is greater. Concerning political leadership, the magnitude of the electoral cycle is influenced by mayors’ political ideology rather than mayors’ political strength and re-election willingness. Additionally, we seek to shed some light on the determinants of public cultural spending. We find that income and upper-level governments’ transfers have a positive impact on cultural spending. Finally, unemployment, young people’s proportion and elderly people’s proportion negatively influence cultural spending. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013
H76|Two-round elections, one-round determinants? Evidence from the French municipal elections|Using a new database of French municipalities that covers 821 towns and two elections (2001 and 2008), we examine how the budget structure, degree of electoral competition and the economic context affect the share of votes for the incumbent. We take into account the institutional details of the two-round structure of the electoral process created by French electoral rules (dual ballot under plurality rules). We show that in the first round of the electoral process, spending on equipment (including infrastructures) can influence the voter, and that electoral competition has a strong impact on the incumbent’s score. In the second round, the incumbent’s vote is affected more by national considerations and local budget variables have no effect. We show that the dynamics between the first and the second rounds are intense. The results suggest that the determinants of each round’s outcome in a two-round electoral process are different.

H76|Environmental protection expenditure: Ex-post evaluation|The paper presents the methodology for monitoring and evaluating the efficiency of current environmental protection expenditures of municipalities developed within the project of Ministry of Environment of the Czech Republic. The methodology has been approved as the voluntary environmental tool for municipal officials. A proposal of methodological procedure for evaluating municipal environmental protection expenditure is based on multi-criteria weighed assessment. It gives municipalities the instrument for assessment of expenditure efficiency and includes all three pillars of sustainable development – economical, ecological and environmental. In the paper are investigate outputs which results from the evaluation of environmental protection expenditures in the city of Brno that is the second largest city in the Czech Republic and represents the territory where live approximately 380 000 citizens. The results show real state of expenditure efficiency in the city Brno and point out the possibility of improving the current situation. The methodology is assessing tool based on available data usable for other states and their municipalities for evaluation of effectiveness of public spending at the local level.
H76|Economic characteristic of non-profit sport clubs and their relations with municipalities and sport federations|There is a running discussion about the system of financing sport from public budgets and there are opinions that the sport is not sufficiently supported. We know surprisingly little about the situation of non-profit sport clubs and to find a better support system we have to gather information about the environment of sport clubs. What do we know about relations of sport clubs with public authorities and their own sport union/federation and why do we need to know? The aim of this paper is to gather information about economic situation of sport clubs; to analyze relationships between non-profit sport clubs and municipalities/sport federations with special stress on the problem of transparency; and to discuss consequences of revealed situation We gathered data from sport clubs and performed an analysis especially for three selected sport branches (athletics, basketball, karate) and we show results of questionnaire among sport club and present examples of practice of randomly selected municipalities. We discovered a significant “failure” in the relationship between sport clubs and their own sport federations. We also showed strong dependency of sport clubs on the grants system respectively we pointed on interesting connection between grants and economic results of sport clubs. Finally we revealed not marginal problem with the transparency during grants allocation.
H76|European social model – parting of the ways?|The European social model is currently the topic of many scholarly discussions. Most authors (Krebs, Mitchell, Godet, etc.) agree that, due to demographic factors and economic crises, the view of the European welfare state has to be changed. The discussions about the welfare state (Krebs, 2011) concern its existence, and moreover how it should work: its extent, its organization, and its long-term effectiveness. Changes in the perception of the welfare state in general are reflected in perceptions of particular welfare states of developed European countries. It is apparent that the national economies’ capacity to fund extensive social programs is limited, and that it is necessary to shift the boundary between national and individual responsibilities. This article investigates the Czech Republic’s position in terms of social benefits in comparison to the United Kingdom and France, as representatives of more advanced economies. The study addresses whether the social expenditures of individual EU countries are sustainable under the contemporary EU priorities for social security.
H76|The vouchers scheme as a mechanism of public support allocation in theory and practice|Sport support at the municipal level has a long tradition, especially in Europe. Youth involvement to the sport is usually one of the important aspects of grant policies. There are questions regarding how to allocate public resources more efficiently and how to increase youth participation in sport. We analyze the sport vouchers as a tool for increasing transparency and efficiency as well as the involvement of youth and their parents in sport policy at the local level. Vouchers typically transfer purchasing power to the client. Using sport vouchers as a tool for allocating public resources is still quite rare, though some attempts with sport vouchers were made in the Australia, UK and there are examples of sport vouchers in the Czech Republic. The aim of the paper is to discuss the vouchers as an alternative method of sport support at the municipality level and identify strengths and weaknesses of this method. Finally we formulate recommendation for implementation the voucher system.
H76|The Effect of Police on Crime: New Evidence from U.S. Cities, 1960-2010|We argue that the key impediment to accurate measurement of the effect of police on crime is not necessarily simultaneity bias, but bias due to mismeasurement of police. Using a new panel data set on crime in medium to large U.S. cities over 1960- 2010, we obtain measurement error corrected estimates of the police elasticity of the cost-weighted sum of crimes of roughly -0.5. The estimates confirm a controversial finding from the previous literature that police reduce violent crime more so than property crime.
